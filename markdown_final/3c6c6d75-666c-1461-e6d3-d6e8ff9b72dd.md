## Question

A 42-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a 6-month history of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding. She reports that her periods have become unpredictable and sometimes last up to 10 days, with passage of clots. She denies any pelvic pain or systemic symptoms. Her last Pap smear was normal, and she is not currently on any hormonal medications. On examination, her vital signs are stable and pelvic examination is unremarkable.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate first-line imaging study to order for this patient's abnormal uterine bleeding?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which first-line imaging study is most appropriate for a 42-year-old premenopausal woman with 6 months of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding and passage of clots. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the clinical diagnosis and whether imaging is indicated. Then, I should verify which imaging modality is recommended first-line across major guidelines. Next, I will consider alternatives like MRI or CT and why they are not initial tests. After that, I need to check whether endometrial sampling is indicated now or later. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note any caveats or exceptions I should keep in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture and the need for imaging. This is abnormal uterine bleeding in a reproductive-aged woman, and after history, exam, and basic labs, imaging is indicated when structural etiologies are suspected or symptoms persist despite initial management, which fits this case given the duration and heaviness of bleeding with clots [^111yLe7z] [^11774Peq].

> Now, I should verify the first-line imaging recommendation. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on transvaginal ultrasound as the initial imaging test for AUB in premenopausal patients: AAFP 2019, ACOG 2012, SOGC 2018, and the ACR Appropriateness Criteria 2020 all recommend TVUS as the preferred first-line modality, with transabdominal ultrasound as an adjunct when needed [^111yLe7z] [^113rVk1g] [^114jFkpT] [^1112oeUS] [^114kHb2Y].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale and technique details so I don't miss anything. TVUS is preferred because it best visualizes the endometrium and uterine cavity, detects polyps, fibroids, and adenomyosis, and can characterize adnexal structures; combining transabdominal and transvaginal views with Doppler improves completeness, and sonohysterography is reserved for further characterization if the initial ultrasound is inconclusive or a focal endometrial abnormality is suspected [^1112oeUS] [^114kHb2Y] [^111qcW9y].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. MRI is a problem-solving tool for inconclusive ultrasound or when detailed mapping is needed, and CT is generally not indicated for AUB evaluation due to limited soft-tissue resolution and radiation exposure; these are reserved for specific scenarios, not first-line imaging in a stable premenopausal patient with AUB [^115xx6ac] [^113qb7HD] [^113e2jcp].

> I need to check whether endometrial sampling is indicated now. In premenopausal women, endometrial biopsy is not first-line unless there are risk factors such as age 45 or older, persistent bleeding, failed medical therapy, or significant unopposed estrogen exposure; at 42, she does not meet the age threshold, so TVUS comes first, with biopsy considered if bleeding persists or if ultrasound reveals concerning features or if medical management fails [^116moRdg] [^111unZxf] [^117L84yM].

> But wait, what if I mistakenly thought measuring endometrial thickness on TVUS would help here? I should double-check that. In premenopausal patients, endometrial thickness varies with cycle phase and has no established diagnostic threshold for cancer, so measuring and interpreting endometrial thickness is not recommended in this setting; that reinforces TVUS as a structural assessment rather than a cancer screening tool in premenopausal AUB [^111MfQZH] [^1167vt9e].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm aligned with the weight of evidence. The most appropriate first-line imaging study is transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, ideally combined with transabdominal views and Doppler as needed, with sonohysterography reserved for further characterization if the initial study is inconclusive or a focal endometrial lesion is suspected; MRI and CT are not initial tests in this scenario [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS] [^114kHb2Y] [^111qcW9y].

> Final recommendation: Order a pelvic ultrasound with transvaginal and transabdominal approaches, including Doppler, as the first-line imaging study to evaluate for structural causes of abnormal uterine bleeding in this 42-year-old premenopausal woman; reserve MRI for problem-solving if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or if detailed mapping is required, and proceed to endometrial sampling if bleeding persists, if ultrasound reveals concerning features, or if she meets risk-based criteria such as age 45 or older or failed medical therapy [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS] [^114kHb2Y] [^116moRdg].

The most appropriate first-line imaging study for a 42-year-old woman with 6 months of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding is **transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS]. TVUS is the **preferred initial test** because it is highly sensitive for detecting structural causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) — such as polyps, fibroids, and endometrial hyperplasia — and is noninvasive, widely available, and does not involve radiation [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS]. If TVUS is inconclusive or if further detail is needed, **sonohysterography or MRI** may be considered as second-line options [^114kHb2Y] [^115xx6ac].

---

## Rationale for transvaginal ultrasound as first-line imaging

TVUS is the **recommended first-line imaging modality** for AUB in premenopausal women for the following reasons:

- **Detection of structural abnormalities**: TVUS effectively identifies common structural causes of AUB, including endometrial polyps, submucosal fibroids, adenomyosis, and endometrial hyperplasia [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS].

- **Noninvasive and safe**: TVUS is noninvasive, does not involve radiation, and is generally well-tolerated by patients [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS].

- **Cost-effective and widely available**: TVUS is cost-effective and widely available, making it accessible in most clinical settings [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS].

- **Guideline support**: Major guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), and the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommend TVUS as the initial imaging modality for AUB in premenopausal women [^111yLe7z] [^114jFkpT] [^1112oeUS].

---

## Clinical guidelines supporting TVUS as first-line imaging

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACOG (2012) | Transvaginal ultrasound is the initial screening test for abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive-aged women [^113rVk1g]. |
| SOGC (2018) | Transvaginal ultrasound is recommended as the first-line imaging modality for abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^114jFkpT]. |
| ACR (2020) | Combined transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound, including Doppler, is the most appropriate initial imaging study for abnormal uterine bleeding [^1112oeUS]. |

---

## Alternative imaging modalities

While TVUS is the first-line imaging modality, **alternative imaging studies** may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Sonohysterography**: Recommended if TVUS is inconclusive or if further characterization of intrauterine pathology is needed, such as suspected polyps or submucosal fibroids [^114kHb2Y] [^113e2jcp].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Considered as a second-line imaging modality when TVUS is inconclusive or when detailed anatomical mapping is required, such as in cases of complex uterine pathology or suspected adenomyosis [^115xx6ac] [^116tGqQU].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Generally not recommended for initial evaluation of AUB due to radiation exposure and limited utility in characterizing gynecological pathology [^113e2jcp].

---

## Clinical implications of TVUS findings

TVUS findings guide further management by identifying structural causes of AUB, prompting targeted therapy. Common findings include:

- **Endometrial polyps**: Focal echogenic lesions within the endometrial cavity, often requiring hysteroscopic polypectomy [^113caDqx].

- **Uterine fibroids**: Benign smooth muscle tumors, managed medically or surgically depending on size, location, and symptoms [^notfound].

- **Adenomyosis**: Thickening of the junctional zone, managed medically or surgically based on severity and patient preference [^111yYG6z].

- **Endometrial hyperplasia**: Thickened endometrium, requiring endometrial sampling to exclude malignancy [^117L84yM].

---

## Limitations of TVUS

Although TVUS is highly effective, it has some limitations:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy depends on operator skill and experience [^notfound].

- **Limited visualization**: May be limited in patients with obesity, uterine enlargement, or extensive fibroids [^notfound].

- **False positives/negatives**: Small polyps or fibroids may be missed, and benign conditions may mimic malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Transvaginal ultrasound is the **most appropriate first-line imaging study** for a 42-year-old woman with 6 months of irregular, heavy menstrual bleeding. It is noninvasive, widely available, and highly effective in detecting structural causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. If TVUS is inconclusive or further detail is needed, sonohysterography or MRI may be considered as second-line options [^111yLe7z] [^1112oeUS].

### Evaluation and management of abnormal uterine bleeding… [^116ZiorK]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in 9 to 14 percent of women between menarche and menopause, significantly impacting quality of life and imposing financial burden. 1 The etiologies and treatments for abnormal uterine bleeding over the reproductive years are best understood in the context of normal menstrual physiology. A normal cycle starts when pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone induces ovarian follicles to produce estrogen. Estrogen stimulates proliferation of the endometrium. A luteinizing hormone surge prompts ovulation; the resultant corpus luteum produces progesterone, inducing a secretory endometrium. In the absence of pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone levels decline, and withdrawal bleeding occurs 13 to 15 days postovulation. 2 Disruption of normal physiology, anatomic changes in the endometrium, or endometrial cancer may result in abnormal uterine bleeding.

Genital bleeding during childhood, uterine bleeding that requires emergent intervention, and postmenopausal uterine bleeding are also abnormal, but are beyond the scope of this article. Terms associated with abnormal uterine bleeding are inconsistently defined in the literature, complicating the approach to evaluation and management. 3 International experts are working to develop consensus on these definitions to improve evidence-based care. 3 Abnormal uterine bleeding that occurs from adolescence through perimenopause can be broadly divided into two categories: anovulatory and ovulatory. Anovulatory bleeding is characterized by irregular or infrequent periods, with flow ranging from light to excessively heavy.

4 Terms commonly associated with anovulatory bleeding include amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, metrorrhagia, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding. 2 The term dysfunctional uterine bleeding is sometimes used to encompass many other abnormal uterine bleeding patterns, so for clarity and consistency with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this article uses the term anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding. 4 In contrast to anovulatory patterns, ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding occurs at regular intervals, but with excessive volume or duration of more than seven days.

2 Excessive menstrual bleeding is defined as the need to change menstrual products every one to two hours, passage of clots greater than 1 inch, and/or "very heavy" periods as reported by the patient. 5, 6 It is commonly associated with low ferritin levels. 5 Table 1 summarizes the characteristics, differential diagnosis, and evaluation of anovulatory and ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding. 2, 4, 6–22. Anovulatory Bleeding At extremes of the reproductive years, irregular cycles resulting from anovulation can occur. Following menarche, the immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis may result in anovulatory cycles for two to three years. 2, 6 Up to eight years before menopause, women may again have intermittent anovulatory cycles. 2 During the rest of the reproductive years, however, recurrent irregular cycles may be caused by anovulation and are considered abnormal. 4.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal uterine bleeding [^114kHb2Y]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This publication summarizes the relevant literature for the imaging of patients with symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding, including initial imaging, follow-up imaging when the original ultrasound is inconclusive, and follow-up imaging when surveillance is appropriate. For patients with abnormal uterine bleeding, combined transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound of the pelvis with Doppler is the most appropriate initial imaging study. If the uterus is incompletely visualized with the initial ultrasou2nd, MRI of the pelvis without and with contrast is the next appropriate imaging study, unless a polyp is suspected on the original ultrasound, then sonohysterography can be performed. If the patient continues to experience abnormal uterine bleeding, assessment with ultrasound of the pelvis, sonohysterography, and MRI of the pelvis without and with contrast would be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Ultrasound evaluation of gynecologic causes of pelvic pain [^112AN6W9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Ultrasound should be considered the first-line imaging modality of choice in women presenting with acute or chronic pelvic pain of suspected gynecologic or obstetric origin because many, if not most, gynecologic/obstetric causes of pelvic pain are easily diagnosed on ultrasound examination. Since the clinical presentation of gynecologic causes of pelvic pain overlaps with gastrointestinal and genitourinary pathology, referral to CT or MRI, especially in pregnant patients, should be considered if the US examination is nondiagnostic.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® first trimester vaginal bleeding: 2025 update [^11282eJ5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is a relatively common occurrence in the first trimester of pregnancy, but can be distressing for both patients and clinicians. Differential considerations include normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, an ectopic pregnancy (EP), or much less commonly gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Although the diagnosis of EP, nonviable IUP, and GTD is important, it is also crucial to avoid harming potentially normal pregnancies through early medical or surgical treatment. Fortunately, most diagnoses can be made using a combination of ultrasound (US), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and physical examination. When a diagnosis is in question, serial examinations and close clinical evaluation is paramount. Occasionally, MRI of the pelvis without contrast may be helpful in problem-solving for challenging cases, where grayscale US is limited or when there is high concern for nontubal EP. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Imaging recommendations — structural causes of acute abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in adolescents are rare; routine ultrasonography should not be obtained solely for the workup of heavy menstrual bleeding, though it can be considered for patients who do not respond to initial management, and if imaging is needed transabdominal ultrasonography may be more appropriate than transvaginal ultrasonography in adolescent patients with the decision based on clinical judgment.

### Consider ultrasound first for imaging the female pelvis [^1159ijjp]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound technology has evolved dramatically in recent years and now includes applications such as 3-dimensional volume imaging, real-time evaluation of pelvic organs (simultaneous with the physical examination), and Doppler blood flow mapping without the need for contrast, which makes ultrasound imaging unique for imaging the female pelvis. Among the many cross-sectional imaging techniques, we should use the most informative, less invasive, and less expensive modality to avoid radiation when possible. Hence, ultrasound imaging should be the first imaging modality used in women with pelvic symptoms.

However, "the literature is unclear about when evaluation with imaging is indicated in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding". Importantly, "Ultrasound measurement of endometrial thickness in premenopausal women has no diagnostic value and should not be performed", and "The decision to histologically evaluate the endometrium should be based on symptomatology and clinical presentation". In postmenopausal women, "Any vaginal bleeding… requires assessment to exclude malignancy".

Postmenopausal bleeding — initial evaluation and risk stratification with transvaginal ultrasonography: Ultrasonography to measure endometrial echo "should be offered as an initial evaluation only to women with postmenopausal bleeding for whom no further evaluation would be needed if a thin echo is found", and "Persistent or recurrent bleeding should trigger additional evaluation". Transvaginal ultrasonography "is a reasonable alternative to endometrial sampling as a first approach" for an initial episode, and "Ultrasonography should be used only for patients whose prior probability of cancer and hyperplasia is low enough that no additional testing would be required after a normal ultrasonography". Clinical risk factors "should be considered when evaluating postmenopausal bleeding", and "Endometrial sampling should be the first-line test for women with postmenopausal bleeding at higher risk". A cohort "of 4,383 women" indicates threshold selection "should be based on available resources, comorbidities, and acceptable detection rates".

### ACR appropriateness criteria on acute pelvic pain in the reproductive age group [^114BBcrh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Premenopausal women who present with acute pelvic pain frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma, exhibiting nonspecific signs and symptoms, the most common being nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis. Diagnostic considerations encompass multiple organ systems, including obstetric, gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, and vascular etiologies. The selection of imaging modality is determined by the clinically suspected differential diagnosis. Thus, a careful evaluation of such a patient should be performed and diagnostic considerations narrowed before a modality is chosen. Transvaginal and transabdominal pelvic sonography is the modality of choice when an obstetric or gynecologic abnormality is suspected, and computed tomography is more useful when gastrointestinal or genitourinary pathology is more likely. Magnetic resonance imaging, when available in the acute setting, is favored over computed tomography for assessing pregnant patients for nongynecologic etiologies because of the lack of ionizing radiation.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Initial management of suspected primary dysmenorrhea advises that when the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated, and most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal suppression, or both. If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on abnormal vaginal bleeding [^113e2jcp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

In evaluating a woman with abnormal vaginal bleeding, imaging cannot replace definitive histologic diagnosis but often plays an important role in screening, characterization of structural abnormalities, and directing appropriate patient care. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is generally the initial imaging modality of choice, with endometrial thickness a well-established predictor of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women. Endometrial thickness measurements of ≤ 5 mm and ≤ 4 mm have been advocated as appropriate upper threshold values to reasonably exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding; however, the best upper threshold endometrial thickness in the asymptomatic postmenopausal patient remains a subject of debate. Endometrial thickness in a premenopausal patient is a less reliable indicator of endometrial pathology since this may vary widely depending on the phase of menstrual cycle, and an upper threshold value for normal has not been well-established. Transabdominal ultrasound is generally an adjunct to TVUS and is most helpful when TVUS is not feasible or there is poor visualization of the endometrium. Hysterosonography may also allow for better delineation of both the endometrium and focal abnormalities in the endometrial cavity, leading to hysteroscopically directed biopsy or resection. Color and pulsed Doppler may provide additional characterization of a focal endometrial abnormality by demonstrating vascularity. MRI may also serve as an important problem-solving tool if the endometrium cannot be visualized on TVUS and hysterosonography is not possible, as well as for pretreatment planning of patients with suspected endometrial carcinoma. CT is generally not warranted for the evaluation of patients with abnormal bleeding, and an abnormal endometrium incidentally detected on CT should be further evaluated with TVUS.

Endometrial cancer post-treatment surveillance — these recommendations recognize that the value of intensive surveillance has not been demonstrated in this disease; therefore, ancillary testing is not recommended; patients with clinical stage I and stage II endometrial cancer have a recurrence rate of approximately 15%, and 50% to 70% of these patients are symptomatic; for most patients, disease recurs within 3 years of initial treatment; because most recurrences are symptomatic, all patients should receive verbal and written information on symptoms and should seek prompt evaluation if bleeding, decreased appetite, weight loss, pain, cough, shortness of breath, or swelling occurs; history and physical exam is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 to 3 years, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter for up to the fifth year, then annually; for non–fertility-sparing treatment, imaging should be guided by patient symptoms, risk assessment, and clinical concern for recurrent or metastatic disease, with possible indications including abnormal physical exam finding, bulky uterine tumor, vaginal or extrauterine involvement, delay in presentation or treatment, and abdominal or pulmonary symptoms.

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

Secondary amenorrhea — approach to evaluation emphasizes first excluding pregnancy and then using a stepwise workup: The possibility of pregnancy must be at the forefront of differential diagnoses for secondary amenorrhea, and once pregnancy has been ruled out, a stepwise approach to evaluation is recommended, as outlined in Figure 2; in contrast to primary amenorrhea, the diagnostic yield of physical examination alone is less; a thorough history and reproductive hormone profile constitute the backbone of diagnostic evaluation, and pelvic ultrasound, if accessible and available, can help streamline evaluation early in the process; in many cases, only a few of the tests listed in Figure 2 are necessary, and the temporal pattern of menses since the onset of menarche is informative.

When approaching the patient with acute pelvic pain, it is imperative to keep in mind the subtle differences each diagnosis can present with. Narrowing down pelvic pain to a specific location in the body while maintaining a high index of suspicion for acute pelvic pain emergencies will aid in a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Bear in mind that acute pelvic pain is a clinical challenge, and although an exact diagnosis maybe elusive, emergency treatment should always be provided first and foremost despite an exact diagnosis.

### Ultrasound for pelvic pain II: nongynecologic causes [^1154CQPe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Acute pelvic pain in women is a common presenting complaint that can result from various conditions. Because these conditions can be of gynecologic or nongynecologic origin, they may pose a challenge to the diagnostic acumen of physicians, including radiologists. A thorough workup should include clinical history, physical examination, laboratory data, and appropriate imaging studies, all of which should be available to the radiologist for evaluation. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality in women with acute pelvic pain because of its high sensitivity, low cost, wide availability, and lack of ionizing radiation, particularly when a gynecologic disorder is suspected as the underlying cause. However, other modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be very helpful, especially when a nongynecologic condition is suspected.

### Use of pelvic computed tomography and sonography in women of reproductive age in the emergency department [^115AMpKA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to review use of pelvic computed tomography (CT) and sonography in the emergency department for women of reproductive age and to identify cases in which sonography might have been adequate.

Methods

Computed tomographic and sonographic examinations of the pelvis performed on women up to 55 years of age in our emergency department during a 6-month period were reviewed. Repeated CT and CT with indications for which sonography would not be the first-line imaging modality (eg, diverticulitis and trauma) were excluded. For the sonographic-only assessment, repeated sonography and sonography with indications for which CT would not be the first-line imaging modality (eg, vaginal bleeding) were excluded. Patient referral indications, imaging diagnoses, and discharge diagnoses were compared for the groups with CT only, CT first, sonography first, and sonography only.

Results

Of 509 women who underwent CT, 407 (80%) underwent CT only; 54 (11%) underwent CT first; and 48 (9%) underwent pelvic sonography first. The percentages with negative CT findings were 42%,17%, and 50%, respectively. Overall, 63 (CT only), 38 (CT first), and 12 (sonography first) patients had CT diagnoses of pelvic conditions only (113 of 509 women [22%]). Of the patients with CT and discharge diagnoses of pelvic conditions, 36 of 44 (82%) had CT only or CT first; 58 of 110 (53%) of cases with sonography only showed acute pelvic conditions.

Conclusions

Twenty-two percent of pelvic CT examinations performed in women of reproductive age in our emergency department showed only pelvic conditions, suggesting that sonography would have been a reasonable primary imaging test for these patients.

### From menarche to menopause, heavy menstrual bleeding is the underrated compass in reproductive health [^1123Q7Fa]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Menstruation is defined as monthly uterine bleeding, regarded as a sign of reproductive health. When characterized by excessive bleeding (heavy menstrual bleeding [HMB]), it may act as a useful clinical marker for diagnosis of reproductive diseases. Endometrial and myometrial mechanisms underlying abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), which includes HMB, have hormonal, cellular, and molecular aspects. Structural and nonstructural causes of AUB, presenting with HMB as the major symptom, result in iron depletion and consequent anemia. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be considered as a single entity to identify the possible underlying causes, which may be different to some extent to those of AUB, as a whole. Furthermore, the difficulties in defining HMB through objective methods do not allow the current epidemiological scenario on the prevalence of the symptom among reproductive-age women to be outlined. Moreover, the introduction of new diagnostic methods, including imaging technologies, entails a revision of the available figures on HMB in different age groups from menarche to menopause. In addition, a proper diagnostic algorithm for HMB should be implemented to adapt recommendations for clinical investigation when HMB is present.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^111Td6UX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected secondary dysmenorrhea — Most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal suppression, or both; however, patients who present with symptoms suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea or who fail empiric treatment require further evaluation. Additionally, if a patient has pain for 3–6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of chronic pelvic pain should be performed with a history and focused physical examination to assess potential gastroenterologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial etiologies of pain. A pelvic examination to evaluate potential etiologies of secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered, and with education and support many adolescents who are not sexually active are able to tolerate a pelvic examination. Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea, and ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to identify potential etiologies, including obstructive reproductive tract anomalies, uterine myomas, and adnexal masses with endometriomas.

### Unexpected findings during evaluation of acute pelvic pain with transvaginal sonography [^11199mtT]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Transvaginal sonography is the first-line imaging modality used to evaluate acute female pelvic pain in the emergency setting because of its accessibility, lack of ionizing radiation, and excellent ability to identify reproductive tract disorders. Although the intent of transvaginal sonography is to evaluate the reproductive organs, imaging of adjacent pelvic structures is an important part of every transvaginal sonographic examination. Gastrointestinal, urologic, and vascular disorders incidentally scanned on transvaginal sonography may explain the pain for which the examination is being performed. In such cases, transvaginal sonography may play an important role in the diagnostic process if the clinician is aware of the transvaginal sonographic appearance of these entities.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^116KSPBp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies — ACOG Committee Opinion Number 779 — outlines presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies may present after puberty with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, recurrent vaginal discharge, or infertility, and the evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging, with the genital examination critical to differentiate key causes. Pelvic ultrasonography is the initial imaging method recommended for a patient with cyclic pain and amenorrhea or a patient with persistent dysmenorrhea, but diagnosis of a uterine or vaginal anomaly by imaging before puberty can be challenging and misleading. If the diagnosis is not certain or there is a concern for specified distal obstructive anomalies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended, and consultation with a radiologist experienced with imaging of uterovaginal anomalies may be helpful to determine the most accurate diagnosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^114UG9Ed]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaFirst trimester vaginal bleeding [^113dWHe4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is not uncommon in the first trimester of pregnancy. The majority of such patients will have a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), a nonviable IUP, or an ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging modality in evaluation of these patients. US, along with clinical observations and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels, can usually distinguish these causes. Although it is important to diagnose ectopic pregnancies and nonviable IUPs, one should also guard against injury to normal pregnancies due to inappropriate treatment with methotrexate or surgical intervention. Less common causes of first trimester vaginal bleeding include gestational trophoblastic disease and arteriovenous malformations. Pulsed methods of Doppler US should generally be avoided in the first trimester when there is a normal, or a potentially normal, IUP. Once a normal IUP has been excluded, Doppler US may be useful when other diagnoses such as retained products of conception or arteriovenous malformations are suspected. MRI may occasionally be helpful as a problem-solving tool. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Management of pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal abnormal uterine bleeding: when to perform endometrial sampling? [^113KNAgg]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is defined as abnormal volume, duration, or frequency of menstrual period and is a common symptom in women of all ages (premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal). The acronym PALM-COEIN, introduced by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), facilitates the evaluation and differential diagnosis of AUB, mostly in premenopausal women with AUB. Endometrial evaluation (including ultrasound or hysteroscopic imaging and tissue sampling) for subtle pathology is proposed in patients who are at high risk for endometrial cancer and in patients at low risk who present with AUB and who present poor correspondence in medical treatment. Many new diagnostic modalities are available in clinicians in order to help the assessment of women presenting with abnormalities in their menstrual pattern. The present study reviews the optimal management of women presenting with AUB, taking into consideration the actual need for invasive management in these women, who of them require it, and who can be diagnosed without histological verification. The importance of endometrial tissue sampling in women who present with AUB as well as the best timing for a clinician to conduct a biopsy are two axons analyzed below, according to the latest worldwide guidelines and major publications about this subject.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in premenopausal women [^11774Peq]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common symptom in women. The acronym PALM-COEIN facilitates classification, with PALM referring to structural etiologies (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia), and COEIN referring to nonstructural etiologies (coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, not otherwise classified). Evaluation involves a detailed history and pelvic examination, as well as laboratory testing that includes a pregnancy test and complete blood count. Endometrial sampling should be performed in patients 45 years and older, and in younger patients with a significant history of unopposed estrogen exposure. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality and is indicated if a structural etiology is suspected or if symptoms persist despite appropriate initial treatment. Medical and surgical treatment options are available. Emergency interventions for severe bleeding that causes hemodynamic instability include uterine tamponade, intravenous estrogen, dilation and curettage, and uterine artery embolization. To avoid surgical risks and preserve fertility, medical management is the preferred initial approach for hemodynamically stable patients. Patients with severe bleeding can be treated initially with oral estrogen, high-dose estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, or intravenous tranexamic acid. The most effective long-term medical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Other long-term medical treatment options include estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, oral progestins, oral tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and depot medroxyprogesterone. Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment. A lower-risk surgical option is endometrial ablation, which performs as well as the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. Select patients with chronic uterine bleeding can be treated with myomectomy, polypectomy, or uterine artery embolization.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaOvarian cancer Screening [^113xh4ug]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

There has been much interest in the identification of a successful ovarian cancer screening test, in particular, one that can detect ovarian cancer at an early stage and improve survival. We reviewed the currently available data from randomized and observational trials that examine the role of imaging for ovarian cancer screening in average-risk and high-risk women. We found insufficient evidence to recommend ovarian cancer screening, when considering the imaging modality (pelvic ultrasound) and population (average-risk postmenopausal women) for which there is the greatest available published evidence; randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in this setting. Screening high-risk women using pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate in some clinical situations; however, related data are limited because large, randomized trials have not been performed in this setting. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Practice bulletin no. 149: endometrial cancer [^111kJAfn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal uterine bleeding — initial evaluation and ultrasound thresholds: Initial assessment may use either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography, and this initial evaluation does not require performance of both tests. In approximately 2,900 postmenopausal women from 13 published studies, an endometrial thickness of 5 mm or less on ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 54% for detecting endometrial cancer, compared with 98% and 35% when the cutoff was reduced to 3 mm. When transvaginal ultrasonography is used initially and an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 mm is found, endometrial sampling is not required; thickness greater than 4 mm should trigger alternative evaluation such as sonohysterography, office hysteroscopy, or endometrial biopsy, and evaluation is also warranted if thickness cannot be adequately visualized.

Detecting Endometrial Cancer in Premenopausal Patients

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends endometrial sampling in patients with AUB who are older than 45 years as a first-line test. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends sampling in patients younger than age 45 years with risk factors, including history of unopposed estrogen exposure (such as seen in obesity or PCOS), failed medical management, and persistent AUB. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics states, "for those at increased risk, endometrial biopsy is probably warranted". The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends hysteroscopy for patients with heavy and abnormal bleeding, with consideration of biopsy at the time of hysteroscopy for patients at high risk for endometrial pathology. The SGO recommends endometrial sampling if the patient has risk factors or the workup of the bleeding is negative.

Evaluation of Incidental Findings in Asymptomatic Patients

Among asymptomatic postmenopausal women, an increased endometrial thickness of 4 mm or more on transvaginal ultrasonography has poor accuracy for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. In a decision analysis, an endometrial thickness of more than 11 mm in asymptomatic postmenopausal women conferred similar risk for endometrial cancer (6.7%) as a patient with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of more than 5 mm (7.3%). In a meta-analysis, the prevalence of malignancy in endometrial polyps was 2.73% overall (1.12% for premenopausal women and 4.73% for postmenopausal women). Asymptomatic women had a lower risk of malignancy (1.89%) compared with symptomatic women (5.14%, P < .001). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that management of endometrial polyps can be expectant or surgical depending on patient symptoms and risk factors for malignancy. Abnormal uterine bleeding is an indication for polypectomy. We found no guidelines regarding evaluation or treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women with incidental endometrial polyps.

### Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114oa2TY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Primary amenorrhea — evaluation for Müllerian tract anomalies: In cases of primary amenorrhea, we suggest evaluating Müllerian tract anomalies (congenital or acquired) and note that diagnostic options include physical examination, progestin challenge test, abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on the context and patient preferences (2⊕⊕○○). Defining reproductive tract anatomies is described as the first step in excluding anatomic causes of amenorrhea and is especially important in primary amenorrhea; outflow tract anomalies often present as primary amenorrhea and require both a physical examination and imaging with pelvic ultrasound or MRI to exclude and/or define anatomic anomalies. In some women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), clinicians may consider a hysterosalpingogram, sonohysterogram, or saline infusion sonogram or hysteroscopy to establish acquired gynecologic tract abnormalities, and the text notes that Asherman syndrome may present as secondary amenorrhea, that a history of postpartum dilation and curettage or pelvic infection may raise suspicion of endometrial injury, and that irregular and erratic bleeding may be due to intrauterine polyps or intramural fibroids rather than functional hypothalamic hypogonadism.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) comprehensive history and gynecologic evaluation — A complete past medical, surgical, obstetric, social, and family history should be documented, as the history may reveal risk factors for POP such as obesity, advancing age, vaginal parity, hysterectomy status, conditions that chronically increase intra-abdominal pressure, and family history of pelvic floor disorders. Gynecologic history is particularly important, especially if removal of the uterus and/or adnexa is being considered. If cervical screening is not current, cervical cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus testing should be performed according to current guidelines. History of adnexal and uterine masses should be elicited, and, if indicated, additional imaging should be obtained. A history of abnormal or postmenopausal uterine bleeding should prompt an appropriate gynecologic evaluation before surgical management of POP can be considered. Previous treatments for prolapse should be noted, including when they occurred, and if a graft was used, and operative reports of previous surgery for prolapse and/or incontinence are useful to help direct management and should be actively sought out, reviewed, and documented.

How to use the algorithm

Identify the symptoms by systematic history taking.
Examine the patient appropriately.
Use the algorithm to plan investigations for troublesome/severe symptoms.
Most patients have more than one symptom and so investigations need to be requested for each symptom.
Usually all investigations are ordered at the same time and the patient reviewed with all the results.
When investigations should be ordered sequentially, the algorithm indicates this by stating first line, second line, etc.
Treatment options are generally offered sequentially but clinical judgement should be used.

Rotation Prep Published July 10, 2019 Common menstrual and bleeding abnormalities include the following: menorrhagia: excessively heavy flow metrorrhagia: uterine bleeding at irregular intervals oligomenorrhea: infrequent menstrual periods amenorrhea: absence of a menstrual period The PALM-COEIN classification system: Etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding can be summarized with the acronym PALM-COEIN, divided into structural causes and nonstructural causes. Remember that, along with pregnancy, infections like chlamydia can also cause bleeding. The PALM-COEIN Classification System for Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Clinical classification of uterine bleeding: This alternative classification categorizes uterine bleeding clinically as ovulatory and anovulatory bleeding: Ovulatory bleeding: Differential diagnosis includes: normal menses with longer cycles.

coagulopathy structural causes thyroid disease endometriosis AAFP Algorithm for Evaluation and Treatment of Ovulatory Bleeding Anovulatory bleeding: Differential diagnosis is the same for oligo/amenorrhea, including pregnancy, thyroid disease, premature ovarian failure, perimenopause, and use of hormonal contraception. AFP Algorithm for Evaluation and Treatment of Anovulatory Bleeding Up to 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding have some variant of von Willebrand's syndrome, and up to 20% have underlying coagulation disorder. Initial workup includes a thorough history, including heavy bleeding since menarche, postpartum hemorrhage, surgery-related bleeding, bleeding with dental work, easy bruising, and epistaxis. All women older than 45, or women younger than 45 with history of obesity or unopposed estrogen exposure with abnormal uterine bleeding, should be referred for endometrial tissue sampling.

Treatment depends on the etiology of the bleeding. For acute bleeding, only one treatment is approved by the FDA. For chronic treatment for menorrhagia, medical options include combined hormonal contraceptive, oral or injectable progestins, a subdermal implant or levonorgestrel IUD, and/or tranexamic acid. See the ACOG guidelines for additional information on treatment options. Any woman with vaginal bleeding after menopause requires evaluation to exclude malignancy. All women should be referred to an OB/GYN or clinician capable of performing endometrial biopsy. ACOG recommendations for postmenopausal bleeding are as follows: Perform initial assessment with endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography. Endometrial sampling is not recommended for endometrial thickness ≤ 4 mm. Further evaluation is required for endometrial thickness ≥ 4 mm.

Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the cessation of regular menses for 3 months or of irregular menses for 6 months. Pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea and should be excluded in all cases; additional workup may include serum levels of luteinizing hormone, FSH, prolactin, and TSH. AAFP Algorithm for Diagnosis of Secondary Amenorrhea Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. Endometrial implants appear almost anywhere, although they are primarily found in the peritoneum, on the ovaries, and occasionally even on and above the diaphragm. Common clinical presentation includes pelvic pain, dyspareunia, bladder and bowel symptoms, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. The diagnosis and staging of endometriosis can technically only be made surgically. Transvaginal ultrasound and MRI can both detect ovarian endometriomas but are less sensitive at finding peritoneal or ovarian implants.

Endometrial cancer — Level B diagnostic thresholds using transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) in postmenopausal bleeding specify when endometrial sampling is not required and when alternative evaluation is triggered. Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), when TVUS is used initially and endometrial thickness is less than or equal to 4 mm, endometrial sampling is not required. If endometrial thickness is greater than 4 mm in a patient with postmenopausal bleeding, alternative evaluation (such as sonohysterography, office hysteroscopy, or endometrial biopsy) should be triggered, as should an inability to adequately visualize thickness.

DIAGNOSIS AND CARE COORDINATION

Features that help stratify risk of malignancy and guide management include patient characteristics, physical examination findings, imaging results, and serum tumor marker levels. Patient history should include a thorough personal medical and gynecologic history, family history, and review of symptoms. A thorough physical examination should include palpation of cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, and groin lymph nodes; a pulmonary examination; palpation and auscultation of the abdomen; and a pelvic examination with visual inspection of the perineum, cervix, and vagina, as well as a bimanual examination that includes a rectovaginal examination if indicated. Masses that are irregular, firm, fixed, nodular, bilateral, or associated with ascites are more concerning for malignancy.

Transvaginal ultrasonography is typically the most appropriate initial imaging modality for the assessment of adnexal masses. Features that are concerning for malignancy include papillary or solid components, irregularity, presence of ascites, and high color Doppler flow. Magnetic resonance imaging may further distinguish benign from malignant masses, especially if they are indeterminate on ultrasonography, and may help establish the origin if it is not clearly adnexal. Computed tomography is useful to assess for the extent of metastatic disease, to evaluate for a potential other primary site, and to plan for surgery. Baseline blood tests should include a complete blood count, chemistry profile with liver function tests, and tumor marker assessment.

Accurately predicting malignancy in asymptomatic and symptomatic masses is difficult. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that "because the primary assessment and debulking by a gynecologic oncologist is associated with improved survival, all patients with lesions suspected to be ovarian malignancies (based on clinical evidence) should be referred to an experienced gynecologic oncologist for evaluation". The ACOG recommends either consultation with or referral to a gynecologic oncologist for those with an adnexal mass who meet one or more of the following criteria:
Any patient with ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy, ascites, a nodular or fixed pelvic mass, or evidence of abdominal or distant metastasis
Postmenopausal patient with elevated CA 125 level
Premenopausal patient with a very elevated CA 125 level
Any patient with an elevated score on a formal risk assessment test such as the multivariate index assay, Risk of Malignancy Index, or the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm or one of the ultrasound-based scoring systems from the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis Group

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^115B7EjJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common presenting symptom in the family practice setting. In women of childbearing age, a methodical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation may enable the physician to rule out causes such as pregnancy and pregnancy-related disorders, medications, iatrogenic causes, systemic conditions, and obvious genital tract pathology. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (anovulatory or ovulatory) is diagnosed by exclusion of these causes. In women of childbearing age who are at high risk for endometrial cancer, the initial evaluation includes endometrial biopsy; saline-infusion sonohysterography or diagnostic hysteroscopy is performed if initial studies are inconclusive or the bleeding continues. Women of childbearing age who are at low risk for endometrial cancer may be assessed initially by transvaginal ultrasonography. Postmenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding should be offered dilatation and curettage; if they are poor candidates for general anesthesia or decline dilatation and curettage, they may be offered transvaginal ultrasonography or saline-infusion sonohysterography with directed endometrial biopsy. Medical management of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding may include oral contraceptive pills or cyclic progestins. Menorrhagia is managed most effectively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or the levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive device. Surgical management may include hysterectomy or less invasive, uterus-sparing procedures.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® second and third trimester vaginal bleeding [^116xsbf6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginal bleeding can occur throughout pregnancy with varied etiologies. Although history and physical examination can identify many etiologies, imaging, in particular ultrasound (US), is the backbone of current medical practice. US pregnant uterus transabdominal, US pregnant uterus transvaginal, and US duplex Doppler velocimetry are usually appropriate for the evaluation of women with painless vaginal bleeding, those with painful vaginal bleeding, and also for those with second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. US cervix transperineal may be appropriate for those with painless or painful vaginal bleeding but is usually not appropriate for second or third trimester vaginal bleeding with suspicion of or known placenta previa, low-lying placenta, or vasa previa. Because the outcome of pregnancies is unequivocally related to the specific etiology of the vaginal bleeding, knowledge of imaging results directly informs patient management to optimize the outcome for mother and fetus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.
