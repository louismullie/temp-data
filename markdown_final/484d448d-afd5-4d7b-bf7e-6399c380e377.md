## Question

Bilirubin encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bilirubin encephalopathy, including definitions, pathophysiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical staging, diagnosis, management, prevention, controversies, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and the spectrum of disease. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially the role of free bilirubin and brain regions involved. Next, I will review epidemiology and burden, followed by risk factors and modifiers. After that, I need to stage the clinical presentation and correlate with imaging. Then, I will examine diagnostic strategies, including TSB/TcB, bilirubin-to-albumin ratio, and MRI. Next, I should review management thresholds for phototherapy and exchange transfusion, including special populations. Finally, I will consider prevention, controversies, and emerging research, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate entities. Bilirubin encephalopathy refers to brain injury from unconjugated bilirubin, with acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) as the early, potentially reversible phase and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) as the permanent sequelae; kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD) encompasses the full range of neurotoxic outcomes, and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) should be used as a severity score for ABE rather than a diagnostic label for subtle deficits, which I need to be careful not to overcall [^115Meiy3] [^111B5Tyb].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I emphasize the central role of free, unbound unconjugated bilirubin (Bf). Bf crosses the immature blood–brain barrier and accumulates in vulnerable regions such as the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem auditory pathways, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, calcium dysregulation, inflammation, and apoptosis; albumin binding buffers toxicity, so hypoalbuminemia increases risk, and developmental stage modifies susceptibility, with prematurity and illness lowering neurotoxic thresholds substantially [^111B5Tyb] [^116vv9j9] [^112ouftd].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and burden, and I need to double-check the global estimates. Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia affects at least 481,000 infants annually, with about 114,000 deaths and more than 63,000 survivors with moderate to severe disability; over 75% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and in high-income settings kernicterus remains rare but persistent, with Black infants in the U.S. disproportionately represented despite lower average hyperbilirubinemia rates, underscoring a critical health disparity [^116dB6dP] [^114FLtHg] [^1145spyC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about risk factors without categorizing them. Hemolytic disease (Rh, ABO, G6PD deficiency), prematurity, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, and clinical instability increase neurotoxicity risk; socioeconomic and systems factors such as home birth, delayed care-seeking, and ineffective phototherapy amplify risk in LMICs; and emerging data suggest genetic modifiers like SLCO1B1 variants may influence bilirubin handling, which I should keep in mind when risk-stratifying infants [^116f2hGF] [^1124ZRpm] [^114pQ2sN].

> Let me think about the clinical staging, and I should confirm the progression. Early ABE presents with lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia, and a high-pitched cry; intermediate stages show hypertonia, retrocollis, opisthotonus, and temperature instability; advanced ABE includes seizures, coma, and respiratory failure. Wait, I initially thought apnea was a hallmark of early ABE, but I should correct that: central apnea is more characteristic of intermediate to advanced stages and is uncommon in healthy late preterm/term infants unless there is significant neurologic compromise, so its presence should heighten concern for progression [^111KBbEr] [^113JDXGV].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach and ensure I integrate laboratory and clinical data. Universal predischarge screening with TSB or TcB and structured follow-up reduce risk, but I should remember that screening predicts hyperbilirubinemia, not kernicterus per se, and evidence linking screening to reduced encephalopathy is indirect; when severe, the bilirubin-to-albumin ratio (B/A) refines risk, with exchange thresholds of B/A ≥ 8.0 for ≥ 38 weeks without neurotoxicity risk factors, ≥ 7.2 with risk factors or 35–37 weeks, and ≥ 6.8 for 35–37 weeks with risk factors; MRI shows T1 hyperintensity in the globus pallidus and subthalamic nuclei acutely and T2 hyperintensity chronically, though early T1 changes can reflect myelination, so diffusion-weighted imaging and tractography improve specificity [^111y5X1n] [^114Cp8Za] [^116NjGWV] [^115iWjk6].

> Now, I should review management thresholds and make sure I align with the 2022 AAP update. Intensive phototherapy is indicated when TSB reaches gestational age– and hour-specific thresholds, which were modestly raised from 2004 but still maintain a safety margin; exchange transfusion is urgent at or above exchange thresholds or with signs of intermediate/advanced ABE, and if preparing for exchange but TSB falls below threshold and there are no ABE signs, exchange can be deferred with close monitoring; adjuncts include IVIG for isoimmune hemolysis, though benefit is uncertain and NEC risk must be weighed, and supportive care with hydration and monitoring every 2 hours during escalation [^112v4n53] [^112fj1a3] [^115tsH2g] [^114cxCKw].

> But wait, what about special populations where thresholds differ. In preterm infants, neurotoxicity can occur at lower TSB levels, so I should maintain a lower threshold for intervention and consider prophylactic phototherapy in very low birth weight infants, acknowledging that while it lowers peak bilirubin and may reduce exchange transfusions, long-term neurodevelopmental benefits are not firmly established; in cholestatic infants, decisions should be based on total bilirubin unless the direct fraction exceeds 50% of TSB, in which case expert input is advised; in resource-limited settings, validated protocols and pragmatic triage tools can reduce both under- and overtreatment while maintaining safety [^115E6J35] [^111wAmpe] [^115xcXFD].

> Next, I should review prevention strategies and verify which are evidence-based. Systems-level measures such as universal predischarge bilirubin screening, structured follow-up based on risk, lactation support, and standardized escalation protocols reduce hazardous hyperbilirubinemia; parent education, particularly in LMICs, reduces delayed care and ABE; and addressing disparities through culturally tailored outreach and clinician training is essential to close the gap for Black infants in the United States [^111y5X1n] [^1147aNr9] [^1145spyC].

> I will now examine controversies and uncertainties, and I need to be transparent about evidence gaps. Universal screening increases phototherapy use without definitive proof of reduced kernicterus incidence, though it improves detection of severe hyperbilirubinemia; subtle neurodevelopmental effects of moderate bilirubin exposure remain debated, with some associations reported but causality unproven; and while free bilirubin better reflects neurotoxic risk than TSB, routine Bf measurement is not yet validated for clinical decision-making, limiting precision at the bedside [^116NjGWV] [^1135XNts] [^116b2ToM].

> Let me consider emerging research and future directions, and I should confirm which avenues are most promising. Novel agents such as metalloporphyrins and experimental nanodrugs that degrade bilirubin show preclinical promise but require rigorous safety and outcome data; artificial intelligence applied to multimodal MRI and clinical data may enable earlier, more objective detection of ABE; and expanded genetic screening for conditions like G6PD deficiency and transporter variants could refine risk stratification and timing of interventions [^1174fqTA] [^116AoJt3] [^116vSnDa] [^112M8MqQ].

> In summary, I should double-check that the key messages are clear. Bilirubin encephalopathy is a preventable brain injury driven by free unconjugated bilirubin crossing an immature blood–brain barrier; risk is modified by hemolysis, prematurity, hypoalbuminemia, and systems factors; early recognition with structured screening, timely intensive phototherapy, and urgent exchange transfusion for ABE are the cornerstones of management; and while kernicterus is rare in high-resource settings, it remains a major source of neonatal mortality and disability globally, demanding sustained public health and clinical system improvements [^113gsmyE] [^116dB6dP].

---

Bilirubin encephalopathy is **preventable brain injury** from unconjugated bilirubin crossing the immature blood–brain barrier, causing acute and chronic neurologic sequelae [^111B5Tyb]. It presents with lethargy, poor feeding, hypotonia, high-pitched cry, and seizures; **early recognition and treatment are critical** to prevent permanent damage [^111KBbEr]. Risk factors include prematurity, hemolysis, G6PD deficiency, sepsis, and low albumin [^116f2hGF]; management is guided by hour-specific TSB thresholds, with **intensive phototherapy** and **exchange transfusion** when indicated [^112v4n53] [^112fj1a3]. Universal predischarge screening and structured follow-up reduce risk, but kernicterus persists globally, especially in LMICs due to delays in care [^111y5X1n] [^114FLtHg].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Unconjugated bilirubin**: Lipid-soluble and capable of crossing the immature blood–brain barrier, accumulating in brain tissues [^116rCd8m].

- **Neuronal injury**: Bilirubin disrupts mitochondrial function, induces oxidative stress, and causes apoptosis, particularly in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and brainstem auditory nuclei [^116vv9j9].

- **Blood–brain barrier**: Immaturity in neonates increases susceptibility to bilirubin neurotoxicity [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Bilirubin encephalopathy presents in **two phases**:

| **Phase** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) | - Lethargy <br/> - Poor feeding <br/> - Hypotonia <br/> - High-pitched cry <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Hypertonia <br/> - Retrocollis <br/> - Opisthotonos <br/> - Fever [^112z3b1H] |
| Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) | - Choreoathetoid cerebral palsy <br/> - Sensorineural hearing loss <br/> - Gaze palsy <br/> - Dental enamel dysplasia <br/> - Intellectual impairment [^117Nj44U] |

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy:

- **Prematurity**: Lower gestational age increases risk [^116f2hGF].

- **Hemolytic disease**: Isoimmune hemolysis, G6PD deficiency, or other hemolytic conditions [^116f2hGF].

- **Sepsis**: Significant clinical instability [^116f2hGF].

- **Low albumin**: Albumin < 3.0 g/dL [^116f2hGF].

- **Delayed care**: Late presentation or inadequate treatment [^113LyEuH].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and imaging:

- **Clinical assessment**: Modified Bilirubin-Induced Neurologic Dysfunction (BIND) scoring system [^113Xycsy].

- **Laboratory tests**: Total serum bilirubin (TSB), direct bilirubin, complete blood count, albumin, and bilirubin-to-albumin ratio [^1132BEAK].

- **Imaging**: Brain MRI shows characteristic bilateral hyperintensity in the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus [^115iWjk6].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **reducing bilirubin levels** and preventing further neurotoxicity:

- **Phototherapy**: First-line treatment; intensive phototherapy is recommended at specific TSB thresholds based on gestational age, age in hours, and risk factors [^112v4n53].

- **Exchange transfusion**: Indicated for severe hyperbilirubinemia or signs of intermediate/advanced ABE [^112fj1a3].

- **Supportive care**: Hydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and monitoring for complications [^1132BEAK].

---

## Prevention

Prevention centers on **early detection and intervention**:

- **Universal screening**: Predischarge bilirubin measurement and structured follow-up [^111y5X1n].

- **Risk assessment**: Systematic evaluation of risk factors before discharge [^113h3u4e].

- **Parent education**: Teaching parents to recognize jaundice and seek timely care [^1147aNr9].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity of hyperbilirubinemia and the timeliness of intervention. Early recognition and treatment significantly improve outcomes, whereas delays can result in **permanent neurologic damage** or death [^116dB6dP].

---

## Current research and controversies

Current research and controversies include uncertainty over the **exact TSB thresholds** for neurotoxicity, particularly in preterm infants [^111hs81m], and debate about the effectiveness of universal screening versus targeted screening based on risk factors [^112Y57ru]. Emerging therapies under investigation include **metalloporphyrins** and novel agents to reduce bilirubin production [^1174fqTA].

---

Bilirubin encephalopathy is a **preventable neurologic injury** caused by unconjugated bilirubin. Early recognition, risk assessment, and timely intervention are essential to prevent **permanent damage**.

Despite efforts to eliminate permanent and irreversible brain damage due to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, these conditions continue to accompany us into the third millennium. This phenomenon occurs not only in developing countries with emerging medical systems, but in Westernized countries as well. Comprehensive guidelines to detect newborns with jaundice and treat those in whom hyperbilirubinemia has already developed have been formulated in several countries, but have not been successful in completely eliminating the problem. In this appraisal of the situation we review selected aspects of bilirubin encephalopathy and/or kernicterus. We highlight recent reports of severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus, discuss some of the factors responsible for the continuing appearance of these conditions, and briefly review what can be done to decrease bilirubin-related morbidity and mortality to the minimum.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a global perspective [^114FLtHg]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia, presenting as jaundice, is a ubiquitous and frequently benign condition in newborn babies but is a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life. In some infants jaundice can become severe, progressing to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus with a substantial risk of neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia and its sequelae continue to occur in industrialised countries with functioning medical systems and a disproportionately high burden also persists in low-income and middle-income countries due primarily to delays in delivering effective treatments that are routinely available in high-income countries. In this Review we summarise up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology of neonatal jaundice including its global burden based on estimates of its prevalence, and both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes. We also discuss the management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia including the prevention of kernicterus, and highlight future directions for research.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

### Review of bilirubin neurotoxicity I: molecular biology and neuropathology of disease [^111B5Tyb]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of successful prevention strategies to prevent excessive hyperbilirubinemia, the neurological sequelae of bilirubin neurotoxicity (BNTx) still occur throughout the world. Kernicterus, encephalopathy due to BNTx, is now understood to be a spectrum of severity and phenotypes known as kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD). A better understanding of the selective neuropathology and molecular biology of BNTx and using consistent clinical definitions of KSDs as outcome measure can lead to more accurately predicting the risk and causes of BNTx and KSDs. In Part I of our two-part review, we will summarize current and recent advances in the understanding of the selective neuropathology and molecular biology of the disease. Herein we emphasize the role of unbound, free unconjugated bilirubin as well as genetic contributions to the susceptibility BNTx and the development of KSDs. In Part II, we focus on current and possible novel methods to prevent BNTx and ABE and treat ABE and KSDs.

### Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113h3u4e]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. The focus of this guideline is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. These guidelines provide a framework for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants of 35 or more weeks of gestation. In every infant, we recommend that clinicians 1) promote and support successful breastfeeding; 2) perform a systematic assessment before discharge for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia; 3) provide early and focused follow-up based on the risk assessment; and 4) when indicated, treat newborns with phototherapy or exchange transfusion to prevent the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia and, possibly, bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).

### Models of bilirubin neurological damage: lessons learned and new challenges [^114CxhUQ]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Jaundice (icterus) is the visible manifestation of the accumulation of bilirubin in the tissue and is indicative of potential toxicity to the brain. Since its very first description more than 2000 years ago, many efforts have been undertaken to understand the molecular determinants of bilirubin toxicity to neuronal cells to reduce the risk of neurological sequelae through the use of available chemicals and in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo, and clinical models. Although several studies have been performed, important questions remain unanswered, such as the reasons for regional sensitivity and the interplay with brain development. The number of new molecular effects identified has increased further, which has added even more complexity to the understanding of the condition. As new research challenges emerged, so does the need to establish solid models of prematurity.

Methods

This review critically summarizes the key mechanisms of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and the use of the available models and technologies for translational research.

Impact

We critically review the conceptual dogmas and models used for studying bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. We point out the pitfalls and translational gaps, and suggest new clinical research challenges. We hope to inform researchers on the pro and cons of the models used, and to help direct their experimental focus in a most translational research.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113gsmyE]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — updates prior guidance and frames key risks and system needs. More than 80% of newborn infants will have some degree of jaundice, and careful monitoring of all newborn infants and the application of appropriate treatments are essential, because high bilirubin concentrations can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. Kernicterus is a permanent disabling neurologic condition characterized by some or all of the following: choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, upward gaze paresis, enamel dysplasia of deciduous teeth, sensorineural hearing loss or auditory neuropathy or dyssynchrony spectrum disorder, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Central to this guideline is having systems in place including policies in hospitals and other types of birthing locations to provide the care necessary to minimize the risk of kernicterus. This article updates and replaces the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management and prevention of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and states that this clinical practice guideline addresses issues of prevention, risk assessment, monitoring, and treatment.

### Review of bilirubin neurotoxicity II: preventing and treating acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus spectrum disorders [^111xZ4QQ]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Previously in Part I of this two-part review, we discussed the current and recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology and neuropathology of bilirubin neurotoxicity (BNTx). Here in Part II, we summarize current treatment options available to treat the severely jaundiced infants to prevent significant brain damage and improve clinical outcomes. In addition, we review potential novel therapies that are in various stages of research and development. We will emphasize treatments for both prevention and treatment of both acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSDs), highlighting the treatment of the most disabling neurological sequelae of children with mild-to-severe KSDs whose "rare disease" status often means they are overlooked by the clinical research community at large. As with other secondary dystonias, treatment of the dystonic motor symptoms in kernicterus is the greatest clinical challenge.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn [^111KBbEr]. Pediatrics in Review (2011). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: 1. List the risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia. 2. Distinguish between physiologic jaundice and pathologic jaundice of the newborn. 3. Recognize the clinical manifestations of acute bilirubin encephalopathy and the permanent clinical sequelae of kernicterus.4. Describe the evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia from birth through 3 months of age. 5. Manage neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, including referral to the neonatal intensive care unit for exchange transfusion.

### The enigma of low bilirubin kernicterus in premature infants: why does it still occur, and is it preventable? [^112riAQR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Low bilirubin kernicterus in preterm neonates, though rare, remains an unpredictable and refractory form of brain injury. Hypoalbuminemia, co-morbid CNS insult(s), infection, and inflammation are contributing causes that, in many cases, appear to interact in potentiating bilirubin neurotoxicity. Despite compulsive attention to serum bilirubin levels, and clinical and laboratory indices of neurotoxicity risk, low bilirubin kernicterus continues to be seen in contemporary NICUs. While efforts to refine and improve current treatment guidelines are certainly needed, such revision(s) will also have to take into account the risks and benefits of any intervention, including phototherapy.

### Kernicterus in the 21st century: frequently asked questions [^113GB5Zp]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute kernicterus remains a clinical emergency and its delayed management represents an easily preventable neonatal brain injury. Yet, practitioners encounter recurrent questions regarding the risk and timing of bilirubin-related neurotoxicity. These include the following: does bilirubin damage the brain of healthy infants? Is there a re-emergence of kernicterus in the United States? Was kernicterus previously prevented in the United States? What was the public health impact of 1994 American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines? What is the current incidence of kernicterus and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia? What is the estimated risk of kernicterus in infants with excessive hyperbilirubinemia? Is there a specific bilirubin threshold total serum bilirubin (TSB) value for neurotoxicity? Are there sequelae of severe or prolonged moderate hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of recognized acute bilirubin encephalopathy? Can we define a bilirubin level that is safe in newborns? We address these questions in the context of available data and evidence, and estimate the current risk of chronic kernicterus is about one in seven in infants with TSB > 30 mg per 100 mL (513 µmol L⁻¹).

### Acute bilirubin encephalopathy: some lessons learned [^113LyEuH]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) is still an insufficiently addressed cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This article highlights that delayed or incorrect medical advice, inaccurate bilirubin measurements as well as ineffective phototherapy are some of the relevant causes predisposing jaundiced newborns to develop extreme hyperbilirubinemia [EHB, total serum/plasma bilirubin (TB) ≥ 25 mg/dL (428 µmol/L)] and subsequent ABE. Obstacles preventing state of the art management of such infants are also discussed. Prevention of ABE cannot occur without a system-based approach tailored to suit the needs and available resources of each community. Clear set protocols, rigorous training, monitoring, and accurate documentation together with simple innovative affordable technologies that can be locally produced, are essential to observe the change desired.

### Developmental influence of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and neurobehavioral disorders [^1135XNts]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin-induced brain injury in the neonatal period has detrimental effects on neurodevelopment that persist into childhood and adulthood, contributing to childhood developmental disorders. Unconjugated bilirubin is a potent antioxidant that may be useful for protecting against oxidative injuries, but it becomes a potent neurotoxin once it crosses the blood brain barrier. Because bilirubin toxicity involves a myriad of pathological mechanisms, can damage most types of brain cells, and affects brain circuits or loops that influence cognition, learning, behavior, sensory, and language, the clinical effects of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity are likely to be manifold. One possible effect that several experts have identified is bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (subtle kernicterus). However, the underlying biological mechanisms or pathways by which subtle kernicterus could lead to developmental disorders has not been elucidated previously. Our aim in this review is to describe a spectrum of developmental disorders that may reflect subtle kernicterus and outline plausible biological mechanisms for this possible association. We review existing evidence that support or refute the association between unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and developmental disorders, and limitations associated with these studies.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^111qYedE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level thus can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infant's age in hours. Because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability, infants at greatest risk are those who have increased bilirubin production rates, because of hemolysis, for example. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies as well as noninvasive technologies to treat and to identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates, respectively, are tantamount to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^115xcXFD]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia is a ubiquitous transitional morbidity in the vast majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, inappropriate or ineffective treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (≥ 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of hyperbilirubinaemia through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on newborn jaundice from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G6PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. The need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels.

### Research on prevention of bilirubin-induced brain injury and kernicterus: national institute of child health and human development conference executive summary. 2003 [^116AN1Ma]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

In July 2003, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a conference, "Research on Prevention of Bilirubin-Induced Brain Injury and Kernicterus: Bench-to-Bedside". This article will provide a summary of presentations and discussions from this conference. The summary will focus on the identified knowledge gaps in 5 areas related to bilirubin-induced brain injury and kernicterus: 1) neurobiology and neuroimaging; 2) epidemiology and issues of clinical management; 3) methodologies for assessing clinical jaundice and direct and noninvasive measurement of serum bilirubin and hemolysis; 4) therapies for management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia; and 5) public health surveillance and systems-based approaches to prevention.

### NICHD conference on kernicterus: research on prevention of bilirubin-induced brain injury and kernicterus: bench-to-bedside – diagnostic methods and prevention and treatment strategies [^114pA1dg]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

In July 2003, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) organized a consensus conference, where a group of experts were invited to review and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and identify areas in which where future research should be directed. This paper summarizes the presentations addressing the current methodologies for direct and noninvasive assessments of serum total bilirubin concentrations as well as prevention and treatment strategies for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

### Molecular events in brain bilirubin toxicity revisited [^116vv9j9]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms involved in bilirubin neurotoxicity are still far from being fully elucidated. Several different events concur to damage mainly the neurons among which inflammation and alteration of the redox state play a major role. An imbalance of cellular calcium homeostasis has been recently described to be associated with toxic concentrations of bilirubin, and this disequilibrium may in turn elicit an inflammatory reaction. The different and age-dependent sensitivity to bilirubin damage must also be considered in describing the dramatic clinical picture of bilirubin-induced neurological damage (BIND) formerly known as kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD). This review aims to critically address what is known and what is not in the molecular events of bilirubin neurotoxicity to provide hints for a better diagnosis and more successful treatments. Part of these concepts have been presented at the 38th Annual Audrey K. Brown Kernicterus Symposium of Pediatric American Society, Washington DC, May 1, 2023.

### Systematic review of screening for bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates [^116NjGWV]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is associated with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).

Objective

To systematically review the effectiveness of specific screening modalities to prevent neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy.

Methods

We identified studies through Medline searches, perusing reference lists and by consulting with US Preventive Services Task Force lead experts. We included English-language publications evaluating the effects of screening for bilirubin encephalopathy using early total serum bilirubin (TSB), transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements, or risk scores. Severe hyperbilirubinemia was used as a surrogate for possible chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, because no studies directly evaluated the latter as an outcome. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of early TSB, TcB measurements, or risk scores in detecting hyperbilirubinemia.

Results

Ten publications (11 studies) were eligible. Seven (2 prospective) studies evaluated the ability of risk factors (n = 3), early TSB (n = 3), TcB (n = 2), or combinations of risk factors and early TSB (n = 1) to predict hyperbilirubinemia (typically TSB > 95th hour-specific percentile 24 hours to 30 days postpartum). Screening had good ability to detect hyperbilirubinemia: reported area-under-the-curve values ranged between 0.69 and 0.84, and reported sensitivities and specificities suggested similar diagnostic ability. Indirect evidence from 3 descriptive uncontrolled studies suggests favorable associations between initiation of screening and decrease in hyperbilirubinemia rates, and rates of treatment or readmissions for hyperbilirubinemia compared with the baseline of no screening. No study assessed harms of screening.

Conclusions

Effects of screening on the rates of bilirubin encephalopathy are unknown. Although screening can predict hyperbilirubinemia, there is no robust evidence to suggest that screening is associated with favorable clinical outcomes.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: evaluation and treatment [^115RLKsn]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Neonatal jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia is common, and most cases are benign. The irreversible outcome of brain damage from kernicterus is rare (1 out of 100,000 infants) in high-income countries such as the United States, and there is increasing evidence that kernicterus occurs at much higher bilirubin levels than previously thought. However, newborns who are premature or have hemolytic diseases are at higher risk of kernicterus. It is important to evaluate all newborns for risk factors for bilirubin-related neurotoxicity, and it is reasonable to obtain screening bilirubin levels in newborns with risk factors. All newborns should be examined regularly, and bilirubin levels should be measured in those who appear jaundiced. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) revised its clinical practice guideline in 2022 and reconfirmed its recommendation for universal neonatal hyperbilirubinemia screening in newborns 35 weeks' gestational age or greater. Although universal screening is commonly performed, it increases unnecessary phototherapy use without sufficient evidence that it decreases the incidence of kernicterus. The AAP also released new nomograms for initiating phototherapy based on gestational age at birth and the presence of neurotoxicity risk factors, with higher thresholds than in previous guidelines. Phototherapy decreases the need for an exchange transfusion but has the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including diarrhea and increased risk of seizures. Mothers of infants who develop jaundice are also more likely to stop breastfeeding, even though discontinuation is not necessary. Phototherapy should be used only for newborns who exceed thresholds recommended by the current AAP hour-specific phototherapy nomograms.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^115Meiy3]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics hyperbilirubinemia guideline — appendix A kernicterus nomenclature defines kernicterus, kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD), and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND), and provides terminology guidance. Kernicterus refers to a permanent disabling neurologic condition characterized by choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, upward gaze paresis, enamel dysplasia of deciduous teeth, sensorineural hearing loss or auditory neuropathy or dyssynchrony spectrum disorder, and characteristic findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging. KSD has been proposed to provide a broader conceptualization of kernicterus and encompasses all the neurologic sequelae of bilirubin neurotoxicity including classic, motorpredominant, and auditory-predominant subtypes; it also suggests a possible association between subtle adverse neurodevelopmental findings and bilirubin concentrations well below those linked to classical kernicterus, but the literature linking subtle abnormalities with bilirubin is conflicting and there is no evidence that treating infants at these lower bilirubin concentrations prevents these outcomes. BIND has been variously used to designate subtle neurodevelopmental findings and all neurologic conditions associated with exposure to hazardous hyperbilirubinemia, as well as a scoring system that quantitatively describes the progression and severity of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE); Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction should be used as originally intended as a score to quantify the severity of ABE and risk of an infant with ABE subsequently developing kernicterus or KSD, and its use for entities for which a causal effect of bilirubin has not been demonstrated should be avoided.

### Hyperbilirubinemia: subcortical mechanisms of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction [^1155jJAg]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Although development of the full syndrome of kernicterus is relatively rare, neonatal jaundice continues to occur frequently. Controversy remains concerning whether or not infants with moderate elevations in bilirubin are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in later childhood. Sites of brain pathology associated with bilirubin neurotoxicity are identified and well established. Based on these regions of brain involvement, we apply neuroscientific principles of brain-behavior relationships to predict types of cognitive features that may accompany hyperbilirubinemia. We address a range of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that can arise as a function of elevated neonatal bilirubin levels affecting these brain regions, even in the absence of full kernicterus syndrome. Moreover, we explain the neuropathologic mechanisms that would drive these abnormalities. We thus attempt to establish a blueprint for future investigations of these conditions, to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Evaluation and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112Y57ru]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Although neonatal jaundice is common, acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus (i.e., chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) are rare. Universal screening for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is controversial. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends universal screening with bilirubin levels or targeted screening based on risk factors. However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians found insufficient evidence that screening improves outcomes. Universal screening may also increase rates of phototherapy, sometimes inappropriately. Younger gestational age and exclusive breastfeeding are the strongest risk factors for the development of hyperbilirubinemia. Infants who appear jaundiced should be evaluated by a risk score or by measurement of total serum or transcutaneous bilirubin. Phototherapy is an effective treatment for hyperbilirubinemia, but the number needed to treat varies widely depending on sex, gestational age, and time since delivery. If indicated, phototherapy should be initiated based on gestational age and risk factors. Exchange transfusion leads to complications in about 5% of treated infants and has a mortality rate of three or four per 1,000 infants. Infants who breastfeed exclusively-particularly those who consume inadequate calories-are at increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia. However, interrupting breastfeeding for the treatment of jaundice increases the risk of early discontinuation of breastfeeding. Encouragement from health care professionals is important to promote breastfeeding in these situations.

### Why is kernicterus still a major cause of death and disability in low-income and middle-income countries? [^114bgsCC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is predominantly a benign condition that affects 60%-80% of newborns worldwide but progresses to potentially harmful severe hyperbilirubinaemia in some. Despite the proven therapeutic benefits of phototherapy for preventing extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus, several low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) continue to report high rates of avoidable exchange transfusions, as well as bilirubin-induced mortality and neurodevelopmental disorders. Considering the critical role of appropriate timing in treatment effectiveness, this review set out to examine the contributory factors to the burden of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus based on the 'three delays model' described by Thaddeus and Maine in the 91 most economically disadvantaged LMICs with Gross National Income per capita ≤ US$6000 and median human development index of 0.525 (IQR: 0.436–0.632). Strategies for addressing these delays are proposed including the need for clinical and public health leadership to curtail the risk and burden of kernicterus in LMICs.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: what should we do next? [^113T214o]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breast-feeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### Kernicterus on the spectrum [^116rCd8m]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Kernicterus is the potential toxic sequela of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia resulting from the passage of excess free, unconjugated bilirubin across the blood-brain barrier, irreversibly and selectively damaging vulnerable target brain cells including the basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and the auditory system. Kernicterus continues to plague the modern world. Not only does it continue to be uncontrolled in developing countries with underdeveloped medical systems, and health organizations rendered ineffective by the ravages of war, but it also remains prevalent in industrialized countries. In this review, we attempt to clarify the different and overlapping nomenclature used in the past to describe this entity and aim to offer a uniform approach to defining kernicterus spectrum disorder. We also discuss the different spectrum subtypes including motor-predominant kernicterus, auditory neural sensory dysfunction, subtle kernicterus, and kernicterus plus. In addition to reviewing several genetic factors that increase the risk of developing kernicterus, we also present some exciting potential therapeutic approaches.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: new insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^1149keDS]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin (Rotor syndrome). Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent (Gilbert syndrome) or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy (Crigler-Najjar syndrome). Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). We review the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia protects against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome and the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Combating the hidden health disparity of kernicterus in black infants: a review [^1145spyC]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Kernicterus is a devastating, permanently disabling neurologic condition resulting from bilirubin neurotoxicity. Black neonates account for more than 25% of kernicterus cases in the US, despite making up only approximately 14% of all births. This is a largely overlooked health disparity.

Observations

The black kernicterus health disparity exists despite a lower overall incidence of clinically significant hyperbilirubinemia among black neonates, a paradox recently explained by a previously unrecognized risk for hazardous hyperbilirubinemia. Aligned with national and global health initiatives to reduce or eliminate health disparities, this review highlights the multiple biologic and nonbiologic factors contributing to kernicterus risk in black infants and approaches to reduce this health disparity. This includes both parent-level and clinician-level kernicterus prevention strategies, with an emphasis on improving parental health literacy on neonatal jaundice and acute bilirubin encephalopathy and clinician awareness of the key factors that contribute to hazardous hyperbilirubinemia risk in this vulnerable group. Parent-level prevention strategies include efforts to improve their health literacy on neonatal jaundice and acute bilirubin encephalopathy and empower care seeking for jaundice. Clinician-level prevention strategies include efforts to eliminate community and institutional barriers that impede access to care, heighten clinician awareness of the factors that contribute to kernicterus risk in this vulnerable patient group, and strengthen newborn hyperbilirubinemia management and bilirubin surveillance.

Conclusions and Relevance

There are multiple opportunities for intervention to reduce black kernicterus risk. Although kernicterus is a rare disorder, the incidence among black infants is not a trivial matter nor are efforts to prevent kernicterus. While the multiple interacting biologic and nonbiologic contributors to increased kernicterus risk among black infants pose a considerable challenge to clinicians, there are opportunities for intervention to reduce this risk and health disparity. Continued study is imperative to understand the current scope of kernicterus and its occurrence in black neonates.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^113oVjLS]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a leading cause of hospital admission/re-hospitalisation in the first week of life globally. Timely and appropriate treatment with phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion are effective in controlling excessive bilirubin levels in the affected infants. Otherwise, severe hyperbilirubinaemia may progress to acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) or kernicterus with a significant risk of mortality in newborns. Survivors may also acquire long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae such as cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, intellectual difficulties or gross developmental delays. It is estimated that, worldwide, severe hyperbilirubinaemia affects at least 481,000 term or near-term newborn babies annually, of whom 114,000 die and more than 63,000 survive with moderate or severe disability. At least, 75% of the affected infants reside in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), delay in seeking care for infants with hyperbilirubinaemia as well as delay in providing appropriate treatment when affected infants present in health facilities is commonly reported. Where phototherapy devices are available, if at all, lack of relevant guidelines or inadequate knowledge of essential requirements for effective treatment results in frequent and potentially avoidable exchange transfusions. We, therefore, set out to identify key considerations for the effective management of late-preterm and term infants (≥ 35 weeks of gestation) with significant hyperbilirubinaemia presenting at health facilities in LMICs.

### Patterns of acute bilirubin encephalopathy in Nigeria: a multicenter pre-intervention study [^1124ZRpm]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) is an important cause of neonatal morbidity in Nigeria, accounting for 5–14% of neonatal deaths. Most newborns with severe ABE have irreversible damage before receiving treatment emphasizing the need for timely pre-admission monitoring and referral. There is limited evidence that educational interventions targeting mothers and health care providers will reduce delayed care.

Objective

To provide baseline data on the incidence of ABE and associated pre-admission risk factors in five centers of Nigeria in order to evaluate the effect of subsequent educational interventions on outcome.

Study Design

The incidence of ABE among newborns treated for hyperbilirubinemia was documented prospectively. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate risk factors for acute bilirubin encephalopathy and reasons for regional differences in its occurrence.

Results

Of 1040 infants, 159 treated for hyperbilirubinemia (15.3%) had mild to severe bilirubin encephalopathy (including 35 deaths), but the incidence ranged from 7 to 22% between centers. Logistic regression identified four common predictors: total serum bilirubin (odds ratio 1.007 per mg/dl rise), out-of-hospital births (OR 2.6), non-alloimmune hemolytic anemia (OR 2.8), and delayed care seeking (OR 4.3).

Conclusion

The high occurrence of bilirubin encephalopathy in Nigeria is due in large part to a delay in seeking care. A planned intervention strategy will target conditions leading to severe hyperbilirubinemia and delay.

Hyperbilirubinemia — bilirubin to albumin ratio thresholds for considering exchange transfusion state that an exchange transfusion may be considered if the bilirubin to albumin ratio is ≥ 8.0 when gestational age is ≥ 38 weeks' gestation and there are no hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors; ≥ 7.2 when gestational age is ≥ 38 weeks' gestation and there is at least 1 hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factor; ≥ 7.2 when gestational age is 35 through 37 weeks' gestation with no hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factor; or ≥ 6.8 when gestational age is 35 through 37 weeks' gestation and at least 1 hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factor.

### Revisiting the criteria for exchange transfusion for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in resource-limited settings [^1174UBZ1]. Neonatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Exchange transfusion (ET) for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) is frequently undertaken in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), in sharp contrast to the prevailing practice in high-income countries. However, the criteria for initiating this procedure in settings with limited resources for treating infants with SNH have not been systematically explored.

Objective

To identify key considerations for initiating ET in resource-poor countries to curtail its unnecessary use for the prevention of kernicterus.

Methods

A review of the existing guidelines and literature on the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia worldwide was conducted to identify criteria and underlying factors for initiating ET.

Results

There is a dearth of evidence from randomized clinical trials to support clear criteria for indicated ET worldwide. Because risk assessment for kernicterus based solely on the levels of total serum bilirubin (TSB) has often proved inadequate, a combination of plasma/serum bilirubin estimation and clinical evaluation for acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) has been recommended for predicting the risk of kernicterus. However, there is a lack of consistency regarding the TSB levels for which ET should be initiated in relation to the clinical signs/symptoms of ABE and hemolytic disorders.

Conclusions

A decision-making framework that combines TSB thresholds and evidence of neurotoxicity is needed for evaluating the risk of kernicterus and prioritising infants for ET in LMICs to curtail unnecessary interventions.

### Diagnosing acute bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates using MRI-based deep learning model [^116vSnDa]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most prevalent neonatal diseases, primarily manifesting as neonatal jaundice. It is caused by dysregulation in bilirubin metabolism. Some evidence indicates that approximately 60% of full-term infants and 80% of preterm infants exhibit jaundice during the first week of life. Most cases of jaundice are "physiological", with the majority of affected infants recovering through short-term phototherapy. Only about 0.01% of newborns may develop acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE), also known as kernicterus, due to the accumulation of bilirubin, potentially leading to neonatal death or permanent neurodevelopmental delay.

Currently, the severity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is assessed based on bilirubin levels, with excessively high levels potentially resulting in ABE. However, evidence suggests that individual factors significantly influence the level of bilirubin in the brain; thus, bilirubin levels alone cannot serve as the sole criterion for assessing ABE. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in conjunction with observations of neonatal neurological manifestations, is the primary and widely used method for the evaluating and clinically diagnosing ABE. MRI sequences typically include T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging. These images provide diverse biological parameters for neuropathological changes associated with ABE, with multiple studies indicating the presence of characteristic imaging markers in standard magnetic resonance images (MRIs) for identifying ABE. The pathological basis of these imaging markers may be related to bilirubin neurotoxicity, which induces astrocyte responses and leads to the accumulation of bilirubin in neurons, ultimately damaging neuronal cell membranes. However, early clinical symptoms of ABE are either absent or mild and non-specific, greatly increasing the probability of missed diagnosis based on subjective interpretation of imaging markers alone. This delay can result in missing the optimal treatment window, thereby affecting the long-term prognosis and survival of the affected infants. Distinguishing whether or not infants with hyperbilirubinemia have concurrent ABE remains a challenging issue.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of bilirubin encephalopathy: current limitations and future promise [^115iWjk6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Infants with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy often demonstrate abnormal bilateral, symmetric, high-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus, consistent with the neuropathology of kernicterus. Early magnetic resonance imaging of at-risk infants, while frequently showing increased T1-signal in these regions, may give false-positive findings due to the presence of myelin in these structures. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion tensor imaging with tractography may shed new insights into the pathogenesis of bilirubin-induced brain injury and the neural basis of long-term disability in infants and children with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy.

### Maternal instruction about jaundice and the incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy in Nigeria [^1147aNr9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether teaching mothers about neonatal jaundice will decrease the incidence of acute bilirubin encephalopathy among infants admitted for jaundice.

Study Design

This was a multicenter, before-after and cross-sectional study. Baseline incidences of encephalopathy were obtained at 4 collaborating medical centers between January 2014 and May 2015 (Phase 1). Structured jaundice instruction was then offered (May to November 2015; Phase 2) in antenatal clinics and postpartum. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models compared 3 groups: 843 Phase 1 controls, 338 Phase 2 infants whose mothers received both antenatal and postnatal instruction (group A), and 215 Phase 2 infants whose mothers received no instruction (group B) either because the program was not offered to them or by choice.

Results

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy occurred in 147 of 843 (17%) Phase 1 and 85 of 659 (13%) Phase 2 admissions, which included 63 of 215 (29%) group B and 5 of 338 (1.5%) group A infants. OR for having acute bilirubin encephalopathy, comparing group A and group B infants adjusted for confounding risk factors, was 0.12 (95% CI 0.03–0.60). Delayed care-seeking (defined as an admission total bilirubin ≥ 18 mg/dL at age ≥ 48 hours) was the strongest single predictor of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (OR 11.4; 6.6–19.5). Instruction decreased delay from 49% to 17%. Other major risk factors were home births (OR 2.67; 1.69–4.22) and hemolytic disease (hematocrit ≤ 35% plus bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL) (OR 3.03; 1.77–5.18). The greater rate of acute bilirubin encephalopathy with home vs hospital birth disappeared if mothers received jaundice instruction.

Conclusions

Providing information about jaundice to mothers was associated with a reduction in the incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy per hospital admission.

### Emergency release uncross-matched packed red blood cells for immediate double volume exchange transfusion in neonates with intermediate to advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy: timely but insufficient? [^1131DSgH]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Given the urgency of double volume exchange transfusion (ExT) in an infant with intermediate to advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE), it has been suggested that emergency release uncross-matched packed red blood cells (ER-PRBC) be used. The efficacy of an ExT in removing bilirubin from the brain, however, is a direct function of the mass of albumin exchanged. The very low albumin content of ER-PRBC may fail to be neuroprotective. Predicted changes in total serum bilirubin (TSB), serum albumin, the bilirubin/albumin (B/A) ratio, plasma volume (PV), and bilirubin equilibration from the extravascular space during ER-PRBC ExT are described. ExT using ER-PRBC is efficacious in lowering the TSB. However, this result is falsely reassuring as significant concurrent serum albumin loss, resultant hypoalbuminemia, contraction of PV, limited bilirubin clearance from the extravascular space, and sustained B/A ratio elevations above recommended ExT treatment thresholds suggest that bilirubin neurotoxicity will continue.

### Management of neonatal jaundice in low-and lower-middle-income countries [^116dB6dP]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

More than 85% of newborns develop some degree of jaundice during the first days of life. Often a benign condition, the yellowish discolouration of the skin, sclerae, and mucous membranes in newborn infants is caused by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, which may result from increased production of bilirubin, limited ability to conjugate bilirubin, and/or slow hepatic-enteric clearance of bilirubin. A small proportion of newborns develops extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, that is, a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 25 mg/dL (428 µmol/L) or more. When it is not timely recognised or treated, extreme unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia may lead to acute bilirubin encephalopathy. This in turn carries a risk of developing a spectrum of long-term neurological sequelae known as kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSD), encompassing 'classical kernicterus' but also milder forms of permanent brain damage caused by bilirubin neurotoxicity. Worldwide, it is estimated that extreme hyperbilirubinaemia affects at least 481 000 late-preterm and term newborn infants annually, resulting in 114 000 deaths and more than 63 000 survivors with moderate or severe long-term disability. More than 75% of affected infants live in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Moreover, in South Asia severe hyperbilirubinaemia is the seventh leading cause of neonatal mortality.

### Bilirubin toxicity in the developing nervous system [^1172ZygZ]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Bilirubin toxicity remains a significant problem despite recent advances in the care of jaundiced (hyperbilirubinemic) neonates. A recent surge in reported cases of classical kernicterus, due in part to earlier hospital discharge and relaxation of treatment criteria for hyperbilirubinemia, and new reports of hyperbilirubinemia-induced auditory dysfunction using evoked potential based infant testing and hearing screening, underscore the need to better understand how hyperbilirubinemia causes brain damage in some infants, especially because the damage is preventable. Recent progress in understanding bilirubin binding and neurotoxicity resulting from unbound or "free" unconjugated bilirubin, how bilirubin affects the central nervous system in vivo and in vitro, and the use of new clinical tools in neonates, for example magnetic resonance imaging revealing bilateral lesions in globus pallidus and subthalamus, and abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials with normal inner ear function, may lead to improved detection and prevention of neurologic dysfunction and damage from bilirubin. Finally, the concern is raised that partial or isolated neurologic sequelae, for example auditory neuropathy and other central auditory processing disorders, may result from excessive amount and duration of exposure to free, unconjugated bilirubin at different stages of neurodevelopment.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^111y5X1n]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

### Rates of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in children and adherence to national guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment in Sweden [^112iBPHs]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Bilirubin Encephalopathy and Kernicterus

Among infants with serum bilirubin levels of 30 mg/dL (510 μmol/L) or higher, 28 of 67 (42%) had 1 or more symptoms of acute bilirubin encephalopathy documented in their medical records. Thirteen infants — all with signs of acute encephalopathy and with serum bilirubin levels between 30 and 45 mg/dL (517–765 μmol/L) — developed kernicterus (incidence rate, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.6–2.0 per 100 000). The maximum bilirubin level among those who developed kernicterus was higher than that in infants who did not develop kernicterus (mean [SD], 36.0 [4.6] mg/dL or 608 [79] μmol/L vs 32.0 [3.2] mg/dL or 551 [54] μmol/L; p = 0.01).

Adherence to Best Practices

By auditing the medical records of 67 infants with hazardous bilirubin levels using our predefined performance indicators, we found that large proportions of infants had been discharged early from the hospital without a predischarge bilirubin level determination (eg, for 15 of 19 infants [79%] leaving the hospital < 24 hours after birth) and that untimely or no exchange transfusion was common (eg, > 12-hour delay or no exchange for 19 of 28 infants [68%]) (Table 3).

### Metalloporphyrins for treatment of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates [^1174fqTA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Metalloporphyrins are heme analogues that inhibit heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of heme to bilirubin. By preventing the formation of bilirubin, they have the potential to reduce the level of unconjugated bilirubin in neonates and thereby reduce the risk of neonatal encephalopathy and long term neurodevelopmental impairment from bilirubin toxicity to the nervous system.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of metalloporphyrins in reducing bilirubin levels, reducing the need for phototherapy or exchange transfusion and reducing the incidence of bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia when compared to placebo, phototherapy or exchange transfusion. 2. To determine the nature and frequency of side effects of metalloporphyrins when used to treat unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (1966 - January 2003) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR) from the Cochrane Library (2003, issue 1). We hand-searched the articles cited in each publication obtained. We hand searched the abstracts of the Society for Pediatric Research (USA) (published in Pediatric Research) for the years 1985–2002.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled studies, in which preterm or term neonates (age 28 days of life or less) with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to any cause were randomly allocated to receive a metalloporphyrin in the treatment arm(s), and to receive a placebo or a conventional treatment (phototherapy or exchange transfusion) or no treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in the comparison arm(s). Any preparation of metalloporphyrin could be used, in any form, by any route, at any dose.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data independently. Data were entered into Revman by one author and checked by a second author. Prespecified subgroup analyses were planned in term versus preterm infants, hemolytic versus non-hemolytic causes of jaundice and according to the type of metalloporphyrin used.

Main Results

Three small studies, enrolling a total of 170 infants, were eligible for inclusion in this review. None blinded intervention or outcome assessment. In all three studies some patients were excluded after randomization. Metalloporphyrin-treated infants appeared to have short-term benefits compared to controls, including a lower maximum plasma bilirubin level in one study, a lower frequency of severe hyperbilirubinemia in one study, a decreased need for phototherapy, fewer plasma bilirubin measurements and a shorter duration of hospitalization. None of the enrolled infants required an exchange transfusion in the two studies that described this outcome. None of the studies reported on neonatal kernicterus, death, long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes or iron deficiency anemia. Though a small number of metalloporphyrin-treated as well as control infants developed a photosensitivity rash, the trials were too small to rule out an increase in the risk of photosensitivity or other adverse effects from metalloporphyrin treatment. No subgroup analyses were possible due to the small number of included trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. There is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. Routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.

### Management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: pediatricians' practices and educational needs [^115Q1baL]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Management of hyperbilirubinemia remains a challenge for neonatal medicine because of the risk for serious neurological complications related to the toxicity of bilirubin. The neonatal hyperbilirubinemia practice guidelines published in 2004 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) expresses the pediatric community's concern regarding bilirubin-induced neurological pathology.

The prevention of bilirubin encephalopathy is based on the detection of infants at risk for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia and the early treatment of this condition. Newman and Maisels have questioned the compliance with the existing guidelines in the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia cases associated with an adverse outcome. Therefore, understanding the pediatricians' practices and beliefs towards the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is of particular importance. A survey conducted more than ten years ago showed wide variation in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management practices among the pediatricians and neonatologists. Approximately 66% of the pediatricians reported an awareness of the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia clinical practice guidelines published in 1994. Atkinson et al showed that only 54% of the pediatricians initiated treatment in accord with the recommended parameters. However, none of the previous studies investigated the pediatricians' preferences regarding management of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants before and after hospital discharge. Moreover, no study has clearly assessed the pediatricians' beliefs regarding the risk factors for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

In the present survey study we evaluated the New Jersey pediatricians' practices and beliefs regarding management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and their compliance with the 1994 AAP recommendations.

### Prophylactic phototherapy for preventing jaundice in preterm or low birth weight infants [^115E6J35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Low birth weight and premature infants are at major risk for exaggerated hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice that can lead to bilirubin encephalopathy. Phototherapy is the most common treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and could be most effective in preventing the sequelae of hyperbilirubinaemia if initiated prophylactically.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy for preterm (< 37 weeks gestational age) or low birth weight infants (birth weight < 2500 g).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3) on 31 March 2011, MEDLINE (1950 to 31 March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 31 March 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to 31 March 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled studies evaluating the effects of prophylactic phototherapy for preterm or low birth weight infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently obtained data from published articles. We performed fixed-effect meta-analysis for the outcomes: rate of exchange transfusion, cerebral palsy or other neurodevelopmental impairment, peak serum bilirubin level and all-cause mortality.

Main Results

Nine studies of 3449 participants were included. The rate of exchange transfusion was reduced in one study with liberal transfusion criteria (risk ratio (RR) 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.31) but not in the other two more recent studies with stringent criteria (typical RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.28). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of cerebral palsy (typical RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.85; two studies, 756 participants). However, one large study that reported on neurodevelopmental impairment (a composite outcome including cerebral palsy) found a slightly lower rate of neurodevelopmental impairment with prophylactic phototherapy (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.99; 1804 participants). The prophylactic phototherapy group had lower peak bilirubin levels (mean difference (MD) -2.73; 95% CI -2.89 to -2.57; six studies, 2319 participants) and had fewer neonates with peak unconjugated serum bilirubin levels > 10 mg/dl (typical RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.33; three studies, 1090 participants) or peak unconjugated serum bilirubin levels > 15 mg/dl (typical RR 0.13; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23; four studies, 1116 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of all-cause mortality between the two groups (typical RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.26; four studies, 3044 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic phototherapy helps to maintain a lower serum bilirubin concentration and may have an effect on the rate of exchange transfusion and the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. However, further well-designed studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy on long-term outcomes including neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Management of jaundice and prevention of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in infants ≥ 35 weeks gestation [^116PRXSA]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus is still occurring but should be largely preventable if health care personnel follow the recommendations listed in this guideline. These recommendations emphasize the importance of universal, systematic assessment of the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, lactation support, close follow-up, and prompt intervention when necessary. A systems-based approach to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be implemented at all birthing facilities and coordinated with continuing ambulatory care. Translational research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions.

### An emergency medicine approach to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^114FnTZA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Jaundice (also known as hyperbilirubinemia) is a yellowish-greenish pigmentation of the sclera and skin caused by an increase in bilirubin production or a defect in bilirubin elimination. Management of hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common reasons for readmission of a newborn. Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result in acute bilirubin encephalopathy and eventually develop into chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Kernicterus, the feared complication of hyperbilirubinemia, was considered almost extinct but has recently re-emerged despite virtual elimination of Rh disease. This review provides a systematic approach to the presentation, evaluation, and management of the jaundiced newborn.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^11187kdq]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia KAS 23 — exchange transfusion and monitoring: An urgent exchange transfusion should be performed for infants if the total serum bilirubin (TSB) is at or above the exchange transfusion threshold, and if before starting the exchange transfusion a TSB concentration is below the exchange transfusion threshold without signs of intermediate or advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy, the exchange transfusion may be deferred while continuing intensive phototherapy and following the TSB every 2 hours until the TSB is below the escalation of care threshold (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation). Treatment at these levels may prevent kernicterus, and risks of exchange transfusion include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars.

### Management of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the cholestatic neonate: a review and an approach [^111wAmpe]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A review of the literature demonstrates that severe total hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL [340 µmol/L]) in some cholestatic term (≥ 37 weeks) and late-preterm (≥ 34 0/7 6/7 weeks) gestation neonates poses a risk for bilirubin-induced brain damage. When the direct bilirubin fraction is < 50% of the total serum bilirubin this risk is associated with the total serum bilirubin alone and treatment decisions should be based on the total serum bilirubin. On the other hand, there are limited data on the risk of bilirubin-induced brain damage in the neonate with severe total hyperbilirubinemia and a direct bilirubin fraction that is equal to or exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin. When this rare combination occurs, efforts to keep the indirect bilirubin fraction from reaching severe levels might, nevertheless, be prudent.

### Quality improvement initiative using transcutaneous bilirubin nomogram to decrease serum bilirubin sampling in low-risk babies [^115mFdvk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Jaundice is a common newborn problem. Early recognition and treatment play a key role in preventing bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction.
Transcutaneous bilirubin (TcBR) measurement provides a reliable screening tool for detection of neonatal jaundice; however, its widespread use in low- and lower middle-income countries is still limited.
Significant differences in TcBR nomogram exist across populations based on ethnicity, race and bilirubin kinetics.

What this study hopes to add?

A TcBR measurement protocol that significantly reduces serum sampling in healthy, full-term and low-risk babies.
A TcBR nomogram which is easy to use and reliable.
This TcBR nomogram and screening protocol can be used at a larger scale in similar settings for improvement in quality and reduction in cost of care for babies with neonatal jaundice in low- and lower middle-income countries.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^1132BEAK]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia — escalation-of-care algorithm (Figure 4): Start (TSB exceeds escalation of care level) leads to the decision "At appropriate location for exchange transfusion?"; if yes, perform STAT labs (total and direct serum bilirubin, CBC, albumin, serum chemistries, type and cross match), notify the blood bank, measure TSB at least every 2 hours, provide intensive phototherapy and PO+/IV hydration, and see IVIG therapy and B/A measurement options. If not at an appropriate location, consult a neonatologist for urgent transfer to NICU (directly if possible) and provide intensive phototherapy and PO+/IV hydration during transfer, if possible. Next, if "Acute bilirubin encephalopathy OR Latest TSB at or above the exchange transfusion threshold?" is yes, proceed to "Urgent exchange transfusion"; if no, assess "TSB below the escalation-of-care level?" and if yes, "Return to regular phototherapy guidelines", otherwise "Continue intensive phototherapy and PO+/IV hydration and measuring TSB at least every 2 hours". The figure notes the escalation-of-care threshold is 2 mg/dL below the exchange transfusion threshold.

### A decision-making tool for exchange transfusions in infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia in resource-limited settings [^1133ZfEW]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Late presentation and ineffective phototherapy account for excessive rates of avoidable exchange transfusions (ETs) in many low- and middle-income countries. Several system-based constraints sometimes limit the ability to provide timely ETs for all infants at risk of kernicterus, thus necessitating a treatment triage to optimize available resources. This article proposes a practical priority-setting model for term and near-term infants requiring ET after the first 48h of life. The proposed model combines plasma/serum bilirubin estimation, clinical signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy and neurotoxicity risk factors for predicting the risk of kernicterus based on available evidence in the literature.

### Diagnosing acute bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates using MRI-based deep learning model [^115BrKoV]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Artificial intelligence has been extensively used for the prediction and prognosis of diseases. In particular, deep learning (DL) and machine learning algorithms for classifying medical images have gained widespread recognition among clinical physicians. Herein, we propose a DL model that fuses radiological and clinical characteristics to establish a classifier for distinguishing between ABE and hyperbilirubinemia without concurrent acute bilirubin encephalopathy (non-ABE). This model may facilitate early screening and prediction of neonates with ABE, thereby mitigating further bilirubin-induced neonatal nervous system damage. Additionally, the model will offer clinicians an objective, non-invasive, reproducible, and more accurate diagnostic method.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113djqS1]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 22 — urgent exchange transfusion for acute bilirubin encephalopathy: An urgent exchange transfusion should be performed for infants with signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (examples include hypertonia, arching, retrocollis, opisthotonos, high-pitched cry, or recurrent apnea), with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation. Case reports and case series suggest that an immediate exchange transfusion may prevent kernicterus in some infants already showing signs and that reducing the time the brain is exposed to high TSB concentration may also reduce the severity of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy if it develops; risks include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars. The benefit of avoiding kernicterus or reducing its severity among newborns with signs of intermediate or advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy probably exceed the risks and costs of exchange transfusion, though some parents have a strong preference to avoid blood products.

### Prevention of neurodevelopmental sequelae of jaundice in the newborn [^112crp5Q]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Although its cause, jaundice in the newborn, is extremely common, the disabling neurological disorder kernicterus is very rare. Kernicterus may be prevented by selecting those infants who are at risk of extreme jaundice or who may be particularly vulnerable to bilirubin neurotoxicity. Because the tools for achieving that goal are inadequate, a secondary strategy is needed. This involves a plan for emergency treatment of severely jaundiced infants, in particular those who present with neurological symptoms. In this paper I review the strategies for preventing extreme jaundice, and for reversing neurotoxicity in those infants for whom the principal strategies fail. Briefly, the tools for prevention include measurement of bilirubin while the infant is staying in the maternity unit, plotting the value on an hour-specific chart, assessing other risk factors for jaundice, and educating the parents. Emergency treatment should include immediate, high-irradiance phototherapy, consideration of intravenous immune globulin, and preparation for an exchange transfusion.

### Controversies in our understanding of extreme hyperbilirubinemia in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient neonates [^112M8MqQ]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite declarations that kernicterus should be a "never-event", the condition continues to occur, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficiency being a leading cause. In this paper, we address some controversies regarding the pathophysiology and the potential for extreme hyperbilirubinemia associated with G6PD-deficiency. We present evidence to demonstrate that G6PD-deficiency-associated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is no longer limited to countries and geographic regions to which the condition was indigenous, but is also encountered in North America and other Western countries with a low inherent G6PD-deficiency frequency. Pathophysiologically, while a diminished bilirubin conjugative component is undoubtedly present, we present evidence that there is a component of increased hemolysis as well, contributing to the extreme, exponential hyperbilirubinemia associated with G6PD-deficiency. Extreme hyperbilirubinemia in G6PD heterozygotes, while less frequent than in male hemizygotes or female deficient homozygotes, has been reported, suggesting previous underestimation of the risks of heterozygosity. Universal neonatal screening for G6PD-deficiency, while not expected to prevent acute, episodic hyperbilirubinemia, should increase awareness, thereby facilitating earlier referral for treatment, prior to the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy. Finally, we speculate as to what the future looks like for babies with G6PD-deficiency, potential therapeutic stratagems, and the effect of G6PD-deficiency on medical conditions beyond the realm of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. IMPACT STATEMENTS: G6PD-deficiency is encountered in North America and Western countries previously thought to have a low frequency of the condition. Extreme, sudden neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is due, in the main, to increased hemolysis, an independent risk factor for neurotoxicity. Extreme hyperbilirubinemia may follow apparently resolved neonatal hyperbilirubinemia which had been treated by phototherapy. Female G6PD heterozygotes, previously thought to be unaffected clinically by G6PD-deficiency, while at low risk, may, nevertheless, develop extreme hyperbilirubinemia. Universal neonatal G6PD screening should be aimed towards increasing caretaker awareness and facilitating referral for treatment prior to the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy.

### Apnea in acute bilirubin encephalopathy [^113JDXGV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Central apnea, defined as cessation of breathing for ≥ 20s, is frequent in premature infants born at < 34 weeks׳ gestation but uncommon among healthy late preterm (34(0/7)-36(6/7) weeks׳ gestation) and term (≥ 37 weeks׳ gestation) infants, where it is usually a clinical manifestation of a neurological or metabolic problem. There is growing evidence that marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is associated with central apnea in neonates. This article explores the reported association between acute bilirubin encephalopathy and symptomatic apneic events in newborns and the possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. The prevalence of symptomatic apneic events in reports of acute bilirubin encephalopathy suggests this clinical finding should be considered a sign of bilirubin neurotoxicity.

### Effectiveness of transcutaneous bilirubin measurement in managing neonatal jaundice in postnatal ward of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan [^113nLfJW]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Neonatal jaundice is a common cause of concern both for caregivers and parents.
If left unrecognised, it can lead to serious complications like bilirubin encephalopathy.
Transcutaneous bilirubin meter has proven to be a good tool for screening of neonatal jaundice.

What this study hopes to add?

We are presenting a quality improvement protocol to reduce the number of blood bilirubin samples for neonatal jaundice.
We have introduced a TcBR nomogram for the first time in Pakistani population.
If successful, this can be used at a larger scale for improvement in quality and reduction in cost of care for babies with neonatal jaundice.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^116woNm2]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — monitoring and safety in acute HCV infection notes that monitoring with hepatic panels (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], bilirubin, and INR in the setting of an increasing bilirubin level) is recommended at 2-week to 4-week intervals until resolution of acute hepatitis, and acetaminophen and alcohol consumption should be avoided during acute HCV infection. Patients with acute HCV infection rarely require hospitalization unless nausea and vomiting are severe; although acute liver failure is very rare (< 1%), patients with an INR > 1.5 and those with signs of acute liver failure (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) should be immediately referred to a liver transplant center, and use of HCV antiviral regimens in acute liver failure should be managed by a clinician experienced in HCV treatment, ideally in consultation with a liver transplant specialist.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112v4n53]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia — intensive phototherapy thresholds (KAS 10) specify that intensive phototherapy is recommended at the total serum bilirubin thresholds in Fig 2 or Fig 3 based on gestational age, hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors, and age in hours, with an Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation. The phototherapy treatment thresholds take both gestational age and the presence of other neurotoxicity risk factors into account, using Figure 2 when there are no known hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors in addition to gestational age and Figure 3 if there are any hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age. Infants born at ≥ 38 weeks' gestation are grouped together in Fig 3 because although infants born at ≥ 39 weeks' gestation are at lower risk of subsequent hyperbilirubinemia than infants born at 38 weeks' gestation, there is no evidence that they are at lower risk of neurotoxicity.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114cxCKw]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Severe hyperbilirubinemia is associated with kernicterus. Informed guidance on hyperbilirubinemia management, including preventive treatment thresholds, is essential to safely minimize neurodevelopmental risk.

Objective

To update the evidence base necessary to develop the 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation.

Data Source

PubMed.

Study Selection

English language randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Excluded: case reports or series, nonsystematic reviews, and investigations focused on < 35-weeks' gestation infants.

Data Extraction

Topics addressed in the previous clinical practice guideline (2004) and follow-up commentary (2009) were updated with new evidence published through March 2022. Evidence reviews were conducted for previously unaddressed topics (phototherapy-associated adverse effects and effectiveness of intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] to prevent exchange transfusion).

Results

New evidence indicates that neurotoxicity does not occur until bilirubin concentrations are well above the 2004 exchange transfusion thresholds. Systematic review of phototherapy-associated adverse effects found limited and/or inconsistent evidence of late adverse effects, including cancer and epilepsy. IVIG has unclear benefit for preventing exchange transfusion in infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease, with a possible risk of harm due to necrotizing enterocolitis.

Limitations

The search was limited to 1 database and English language studies.

Conclusions

Accumulated evidence justified narrowly raising phototherapy treatment thresholds in the updated clinical practice guideline. Limited evidence for effectiveness with some evidence of risk of harm support the revised recommendations to limit IVIG use.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116f2hGF]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia exchange transfusion thresholds by gestational age for infants with any recognized hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age are presented for two time windows: from birth to 72 hours (ie, 3 days) and from 3 to 14 days, and these thresholds are based on expert opinion rather than strong evidence; the stippled lines for the first 24 hours indicate uncertainty because of the wide range of clinical circumstances and responses to intensive phototherapy. Use total serum bilirubin concentrations; do not subtract direct bilirubin from the total serum bilirubin, and in rare cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia in which the direct-acting or conjugated bilirubin exceeds 50% of the TSB, consult an expert; hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include gestational age < 38 weeks; albumin < 3.0 g/dL; isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or other hemolytic conditions; sepsis; or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### Detecting acute bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates based on multimodal MRI images and non-image clinical data [^112z3b1H]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Jaundice is one of the most common conditions requiring medical attention in newborn babies, which occurs in approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm babies during the first weeks of life. It's mainly caused by the accumulation of neurotoxic unconjugated bilirubin from the breakdown of red blood cells that cannot be cleared effectively by the immature liver of the infant. Neonatal jaundice is usually noted clinically when the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level is more than 5 mg/dl [85.5 µmol/L], also known as hyperbilirubinemia (HB). Although most jaundice is benign, 8–9% of newborns might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia (SHB), which is defined as peak TSB level of more than 20 mg/dL [342.1µmol/L], SHB neonates, when unmonitored or untreated, can progress to acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) with varying degrees of brain damage, causing patients' neurological dysfunction and neurobehavioral disorders, such as decreased feeding, lethargy, abnormal tone (hypotonia and/or hypertonia), high-pitched cry, retrocollis and opisthotonus, setting-sun sign, fever, seizures, and possibly death. Nevertheless, the bilirubin-induced brain damage during the ABE period can be reversed if the patients receive effective treatments in time to reduce the bilirubin levels in the brain, such as phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Otherwise, due to the persistent invasion of bilirubin neurotoxicity to the specific brain regions, chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE, also known as kernicterus) would occur, which leads to irreversible brain damage and permanent sequelae of bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) or even death. Therefore, identifying neonates with a high risk of ABE early to apply the effective treatment in time is crucial to minimize the incidence of permanent BIND and CBE. However, precisely detecting ABE neonates is still a challenge in the current clinical practice.

Data Searches for G6PD Deficiency and Preterm Birth, With Effects on Neonatal Mortality, EHB, and Kernicterus

Systematic reviews of the main electronic literature databases (Ovid Medline, Ovid Medline In-Process and Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Cinahl, Global Health, Scopus, and Popline) were undertaken using a combination of medical subject heading and free text words. Search terms used were exchange blood transfusion, kernicterus/bilirubin encephalopathy, death (from jaundice), phototherapy, G6PD deficiency, ABO incompatibility, Rh incompatibility, admission/readmission (for jaundice), sequelae, impairment, and outcomes. Reference lists of all the relevant studies were scanned to further identify studies of interest. We excluded case reports, nonhuman studies, those that did not have the relevant population or age group, those that did not focus on the relevant condition (jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, and encephalopathy), and those that did not provide relevant primary data (e.g. for prevalence/risk). In addition, we conducted a retrospective review of the historic Rh disease literature, commencing from identification as a clinical disease to the period Rh disease was considered "conquered". Pivotal studies, cited in Appendix I, allowed for estimation of mortality and disease among survivors. We also identified population-based studies before the use of phototherapy, which reported on the outcome of systematic use of phototherapy. Due to rapid improvement in the access to and quality of specialized/intensive newborn care in countries with low-mortality settings, for mortality, encephalopathy, and long-term impairment risk, we decided to focus on recent literature only and extracted data from studies with birth cohorts having median year of 2005 or later. Where sufficient data were available, standard meta-analysis techniques were used to obtain pooled estimates of the relevant parameter's risk, which included EHB-related neonatal mortality and bilirubin encephalopathy (acute and/or chronic). Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using I² and χ² tests, and where evidence of heterogeneity was present (I² > 70% or P < 0.05), a random-effects model was used.

### Bilirubin-albumin binding and neonatal jaundice [^112ouftd]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Bilirubin-albumin binding weakens the correlation between the plasma total bilirubin concentration (TBC) and bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus), which has led to considerable interest over the years in measuring binding as part of the evaluation of jaundiced newborns. Despite development of several bilirubin-albumin binding tests, technical, ethical, and logistical factors have prevented the prospective studies needed to validate their routine clinical use. Consequently, it has been necessary to adopt aggressive exchange transfusion criteria based on the TBC that require the unnecessary treatment of large numbers of babies to prevent the rare case of kernicterus. Recently, early hospital discharge and arbitrary relaxation of exchange transfusion criteria have resulted in a resurgence of kernicterus. This resurgence and studies showing that nonalbumin bound or "free" bilirubin (Bf) correlates better than the TBC with bilirubin toxicity have rekindled interest in bilirubin binding tests. Technological advances in the measurement of Bf provide a convenient and economical means for integrating Bf measurements into routine clinical practice by determining the bilirubin-albumin binding parameters of various newborn populations.

### The association between serum bilirubin and kernicterus spectrum disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gTNZW]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Total serum bilirubin (TSB) is used in managing neonates with jaundice, but clear evidence on its association with major outcomes is lacking.

Objectives

We evaluated the association between TSB and kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD).

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL till July 2021. Two authors independently selected relevant cohort studies, extracted data (CHARMS checklist), assessed risk of bias (RoB) (QUIPS tool), and rated certainty-of-evidence (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). We pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (random-effect) via generic inverse variance methods.

Results

From 2,826 records retrieved, we included 37 studies (n = 648,979). Fifteen studies had low, 16 moderate, and 6 high RoB, with majority having concerns on confounder adjustment and statistical analysis. Twenty-two studies contributed meta-analysis data, and 15 were summarized narratively. TSB appears associated with KSD in infants with certain risk factors (aOR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.07–1.13; 5 studies [n = 4,484]). However, TSB (aOR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23; 1 study [n = 34,533]) or hyperbilirubinemia (aOR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.51–1.95; 2 studies [n = 56,578]) have no clear association with kernicterus or neurological diagnosis in overall neonatal population (moderate-certainty-evidence). One study shows that infants with hyperbilirubinemia appear likelier to develop attention-deficit disorder (aOR 1.90, 95% CI: 1.10–3.28) and autistic spectrum disorder (aOR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.03–2.49, n = 56,019) (low-certainty-evidence). Certain clinical factors appear associated with KSD, although very few studies contributed to the analyses.

Conclusions

Despite the importance of this question, there is insufficient high-quality evidence on the independent prognostic value of TSB for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in most neonatal populations. Future studies should incorporate all known risk factors alongside TSB in a multivariable analysis to improve certainty-of-evidence.

### Galactosaemia: an unusual cause of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy [^114g2Ai2]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Galactosaemia is a disorder of galactose metabolism in which raised levels of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate damage various organs. Although galactosaemia is a common metabolic liver disease in childhood, it is a rare cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia requiring intervention. We report an unusual case of neonatal galactosaemia that at presentation had features of acute bilirubin encephalopathy requiring exchange transfusion and at discharge had features of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. This case report emphasises the need for timely suspicion and diagnosis of this disease for prevention of chronic morbidity.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, commonly known as jaundice, is a prevalent condition affecting both premature and full-term infants, often leading to hospitalization within the first week of life. It is estimated that approximately 60% of term infants and about 80% of preterm infants experience jaundice, with the highest risk observed in infants born before 35 weeks gestation. Severe neonatal jaundice (SNJ) presents a critical global health challenge, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). The prevalence of jaundice among hospitalized neonates in these regions ranges form 0.73–3.34%, with approximately 14.26% of jaundiced neonates classified as having SNJ. This highlights a substantial healthcare burden. Clinical complications associated with neonatal jaundice include bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, kernicterus, and acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE). The necessity for exchange blood transfusions (EBT) can also arise in severe cases. Rates of EBT range between 0.74% and 3.81%, while ABE occurs with a frequency of 0.16–2.75%.

The diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia primarily relies on a physical examination and the assessment of serum bilirubin levels, with jaundice becoming clinically evident when bilirubin levels exceed 85 µmol/dl (5 mg/dl). Key indicators of pathological jaundice include early onset, elevated bilirubin levels, and significant clinical symptoms. The pathophysiology of hyperbilirubinemia stems from an imbalance between bilirubin production and elimination. While low bilirubin levels are generally considered harmless and may even confer antioxidant benefits, elevated levels pose serious risks, potentially leading to bilirubin encephalopathy and central nervous system complications. Treatment strategies for jaundice are determined by its severity and underlying cause. Common interventions include phototherapy, exchange transfusion in critical cases, and enhanced feeding techniques. Prolonged unconjugated bilirubin levels that remain untreated can lead to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and, in severe cases, may result in death from kernicterus. Jaundice generally resolves within a week in the absence of complications such as inadequate oral intake, hypoxia, fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, infection, sepsis, or hepatic disorders.

### Predicting bilirubin trends in preterm infants using patient specific exponential decay model [^111hs81m]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is one of the most common problems faced by preterm infants in the first month of life. Decreased life span of red blood cells, immaturity of liver enzymes, increased enterohepatic circulation, and associated illnesses such as sepsis and hemolysis play important role in contributing towards increased bilirubin levels in preterm infants. Other factors including delayed initiation of enteral feeding, unable to tolerate feeds and bruising at the time of delivery may impose additional risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia in these infants. Unlike in term infants, hyperbilirubinemia is more protracted and largely unpredictable in preterm infants. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy may manifest as kernicterus leading to choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, hearing loss or sensorimotor integration disorders. Even though exact serum bilirubin levels causing acute bilirubin encephalopathy are not known, the preterm infants despite rigorous monitoring are at higher risk for kernicterus at lower bilirubin concentrations than term infants.

Bilirubin research in preterm infants is primarily targeted towards early detection, determination of the treatment thresholds to prevent encephalopathy and assessment of neurological consequences. Current guidelines typically focus on initial management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants to prevent kernicterus. Risk for prolonged and life-threatening jaundice remains in the preterm infants beyond first week of life which can lead to undesirable consequences. Gestational age and hour of life specific nomograms for preterm infants have been created to help develop early management decisions. A recent study has demonstrated use of an electronic clinical decision-making tool to alert physicians of critical values of bilirubin levels in preterm infants. While critical hyperbilirubinemia is diagnosed in early phase there is scarcity in the literature on natural course of bilirubin levels at various gestational ages beyond first week of life. Also, the factors indirectly affecting bilirubin concentrations including inflammatory makers such as c reactive protein (CRP) or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have rarely been taken into consideration for predicting bilirubin levels especially in preterm infants.

KAS 10 — intensive phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia: Intensive phototherapy is recommended at the total serum bilirubin thresholds in Fig 2 (Supplemental Table 1 and Supplemental Fig 1) or Fig 3 (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 2) on the basis of gestational age, hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors, and age of the infant in hours; this is an Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X recommendation. Intensive phototherapy can reduce TSB levels and decrease the need for escalation of care, including the need for exchange transfusion, to prevent kernicterus, and the phototherapy treatment thresholds are higher than those in the 2004 guideline but still leave a wide margin of safety. Potential harms include that two observational studies found a small increased risk of epilepsy in males treated with phototherapy; if causal, for approximately each 100 to 250 males treated with phototherapy, 1 will be diagnosed with epilepsy by 10 years of age. Families may vary in approach; for infants with TSB levels at or < 2 mg/dL above thresholds, families may prefer only blanket phototherapy (in the hospital or at home) or withholding phototherapy with very close follow-up of TSB concentrations. The evidence is strong that phototherapy reduces TSB concentrations and the need for exchange transfusion, but evidence is weak regarding the specific treatment threshold at which benefits exceed harms; even at these thresholds the number needed to treat to prevent 1 exchange transfusion may be in the hundreds or thousands, and the more the TSB exceeds the phototherapy threshold, the lower the number needed to treat.

Step 3: Estimation of Impairment due to Kernicterus

Global estimate of survivors with NDI following kernicterus. The estimated risk of long-term impairment among survivors, globally, is shown in Figure 5. We based the risk on a recently published systematic review and data provided by Sgro and Ebbesen, which are more specific than those previously provided by Ip et al. We assumed a constant biologic risk and applied this risk of impairment to all the survivors of kernicterus regardless of the level of care and mortality setting because the effect of bilirubin encephalopathy is not reversible (a global prevalence of 56/100,000 live births) and hence estimated the number of impaired survivors with long-term impairment according to specific global regions (Table 5 and Figure 6).

### A new animal model of hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia-induced bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus) [^115AuZk8]. Pediatric Research (2008). Low credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can cause bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Spontaneously jaundiced (jj) Gunn rats treated with sulfonamide (sulfa) to displace bilirubin from serum albumin, develop bilirubin encephalopathy and abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) comparable with human newborns. We hypothesized phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced hemolysis would significantly elevate total plasma bilirubin (TB) in jj Gunn rat pups and produce BAEP abnormalities similar to those observed after sulfa. PHZ 0, 25, 50, or 75 mg/kg was administered intraperitonealy to 15-d-old jjs. An initial TB was recorded in each animal, and a second recorded 1–4 d postinjection to generate a dose-response curve. After PHZ 75 mg/kg, TB peaked at about 30 mg/dL at 48–72 h. A second group of jjs injected with PHZ (0, 25, 50, or 75 mg/kg) and nonjaundiced controls given PHZ 75 mg/kg had HCT and TB at baseline, and HCT, TB, and BAEPs recorded at 48 h. BAEP wave II and III amplitudes decreased, and I-II and I-III interwave intervals increased indicating abnormal central (brainstem) auditory function. PHZ-induced hemolysis in jaundiced Gunn rat pups produces sufficiently elevated TB levels to produce bilirubin encephalopathy. This new model may be a more clinically relevant experimental model of kernicterus- and bilirubin-induced neurologic disorders.

### Chemoprevention of bilirubin encephalopathy with a nanoceutical agent [^116AoJt3]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Targeted rapid degradation of bilirubin has the potential to thwart incipient bilirubin encephalopathy. We investigated a novel spinel-structured citrate-functionalized trimanganese tetroxide nanoparticle (C-Mn 3 O 4 NP, the nanodrug) to degrade both systemic and neural bilirubin loads.

Method

Severe neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) was induced in neonatal C57BL/6j mice model with phenylhydrazine (PHz) intoxication. Efficiency of the nanodrug on both in vivo bilirubin degradation and amelioration of bilirubin encephalopathy and associated neurobehavioral sequelae were evaluated.

Results

Single oral dose (0.25 mg kg⁻¹ bodyweight) of the nanodrug reduced both total serum bilirubin (TSB) and unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) in SNH rodents. Significant (p < 0.0001) UCB and TSB-degradation rates were reported within 4–8 h at 1.84 ± 0.26 and 2.19 ± 0.31 mg dL⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively. Neural bilirubin load was decreased by 5.6 nmol g⁻¹ (p = 0.0002) along with improved measures of neurobehavior, neuromotor movements, learning, and memory. Histopathological studies confirm that the nanodrug prevented neural cell reduction in Purkinje and substantia nigra regions, eosinophilic neurons, spongiosis, and cell shrinkage in SNH brain parenchyma. Brain oxidative status was maintained in nanodrug-treated SNH cohort. Pharmacokinetic data corroborated the bilirubin degradation rate with plasma nanodrug concentrations.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates the in vivo capacity of this novel nanodrug to reduce systemic and neural bilirubin load and reverse bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. Further compilation of a drug-safety-dossier is warranted to translate this novel therapeutic chemopreventive approach to clinical settings.

Impact

None of the current pharmacotherapeutics treat severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (SNH) to prevent risks of neurotoxicity. In this preclinical study, a newly investigated nano-formulation, citrate-functionalized Mn 3 O 4 nanoparticles (C-Mn 3 O 4 NPs), exhibits bilirubin reduction properties in rodents. Chemopreventive properties of this nano-formulation demonstrate an efficacious, efficient agent that appears to be safe in these early studies. Translation of C-Mn 3 O 4 NPs to prospective preclinical and clinical trials in appropriate in vivo models should be explored as a potential novel pharmacotherapy for SNH.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and rhesus disease of the newborn: incidence and impairment estimates for 2010 at regional and global levels [^117SK7v6]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

In Walker's large series of pregnancies affected with Rh disease, 33% of newborns required no treatment. We have assumed that 14% of Rh disease pregnancies will result in stillbirths and 24% in neonatal deaths and that the remaining 29%, who require treatment, will have severe hyperbilirubinemia. Hsia et al. reported that 50% of untreated infants whose peak TB reached > 513 µmol/L (30 mg/dL) developed kernicterus, consistent with observations made by Mollison and Walker. We assumed that 50% of babies with Rh disease and hyperbilirubinemia would reach a level greater than 30 mg/dl (513 µmol/l) in keeping with the clear indication for exchange transfusion for babies with Rh disease (as described by Walker) to prevent kernicterus. Overall, we estimated 7.2% of all Rh disease–affected infants who survived had developed subsequent kernicterus (Table 1).

Non-Rh disease EHB mortality and kernicterus adjusted for access to neonatal care. Process: We estimated the number of babies with EHB and/or Rh disease who develop acute kernicterus or die in the neonatal period. The risk for acute (ABE) and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (CBE; kernicterus) was calculated together to avoid overreporting of cases because many articles had given figures for both without specifying how many babies had both ABE and CBE. If individual data were listed for ABE and CBE (kernicterus), we chose the higher value for our analysis (Table 2 and Web appendix I-v).

Outcome in countries with "good" access to neonatal care (NMR < 5): In these countries, almost all babies requiring care would have access to specialized facilities. The risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in this group was estimated from six relevant articles from four countries, and it included a large cohort study with 7-y follow-up from the United States. The pooled risk of encephalopathy was 23.0% (95% CI: 9.9, 36.1). On the other hand, the pooled mortality data using two data sets specifically from the United States from among the three pooled data sets showed a bilirubin encephalopathy rate of 2.4% (95% CI: 1.0, 5.8).

### A modified bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND-M) algorithm is useful in evaluating severity of jaundice in a resource-limited setting [^113Xycsy]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Severe neonatal jaundice with associated acute bilirubin encephalopathy occurs frequently in low- and middle-income countries, where advanced diagnostic technology is in short supply. In an effort to facilitate the physical diagnosis of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, we pilot-tested a modified bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction scoring algorithm in a group of pediatric trainees (residents) and their mentors (consultants) in a resource-constrained setting.

Methods

Jaundiced Nigerian infants were examined by consultant and resident pediatricians. The modified bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction score assigned by residents was compared with the clinical diagnosis of acute bilirubin encephalopathy by expert consultants. Demographic information was obtained. Known risk factors were also evaluated among infants with and without acute bilirubin encephalopathy in addition to exploratory analyses. Data were analyzed by Statistical Analysis System; statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Results

Three hundred and thirty three paired modified bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction scores (333) were analyzed and showed excellent agreement (weighted Kappa coefficient 0.7969) between residents and consultants. A modified bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction score greater than or equal to 3 was highly predictive of a clinical diagnosis of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, with sensitivity of 90.7%, specificity of 97.7%, positive predictive value of 88.9%, and negative predictive value of 98.2%. Exposure to mentholated products was strongly associated with increased risk of acute bilirubin encephalopathy among those with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (odds ratio = 73.94; 95% confidence interval = 5.425-infinity) as well as among those whose G6PD phenotype was unknown (odds ratio = 25.88; 95% confidence interval = 2.845–235.4).

Conclusions

The modified bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction score for neonatal jaundice can be assigned reliably by both residents and experienced pediatricians in resource-limited settings as reflected in the algorithm's sensitivity and specificity. It may be useful for predicting the development and severity of acute bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates.

### Toward understanding kernicterus: a challenge to improve the management of jaundiced newborns [^116b2ToM]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We sought to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of total serum bilirubin concentration (TSB) and free (unbound) bilirubin concentration (Bf) as predictors of risk for bilirubin toxicity and kernicterus and to examine consistency between these findings and proposed mechanisms of bilirubin transport and brain uptake.

Methods

A review of literature was undertaken to define basic principles of bilirubin transport and brain uptake leading to neurotoxicity. We then reviewed experimental and clinical evidence that relate TSB or Bf to risk for bilirubin toxicity and kernicterus.

Results

There are insufficient published data to precisely define sensitivity and specificity of either TSB or Bf in determining risk for acute bilirubin neurotoxicity or chronic sequelae (kernicterus). However, available laboratory and clinical evidence indicate that Bf is better than TSB in discriminating risk for bilirubin toxicity in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia. These findings are consistent with basic pharmacokinetic principles involved in bilirubin transport and tissue uptake.

Conclusions

Experimental and clinical data strongly suggest that measurement of Bf in newborns with hyperbilirubinemia will improve risk assessment for neurotoxicity, which emphasizes the need for additional clinical evaluation relating Bf and TSB to acute bilirubin toxicity and long-term outcome. We speculate that establishing risk thresholds for neurotoxicity by using newer methods for measuring Bf in minimally diluted serum samples will improve the sensitivity and specificity of serum indicators for treating hyperbilirubinemia, thus reducing unnecessary aggressive intervention and associated cost and morbidity.

It urges investigation of dosing for the most premature infants "born at earlier gestational ages (ie, 22–23 weeks of gestation)". Priorities include "Reconsideration of a more unifying definition of EFAD" and work to define when "the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy is increased by ILE displacement of bilirubin". It also highlights uncertainty during metabolic stress (eg, sepsis, NEC) where "the infusion of nutrients only adds metabolic stress" and asks whether "pausing PN or reducing doses of specific parenteral macronutrients or micronutrients is metabolically advantageous".

### Burden of severe neonatal jaundice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113CdhcK]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Context

To assess the global burden of late and/or poor management of severe neonatal jaundice (SNJ), a common problem worldwide, which may result in death or irreversible brain damage with disabilities in survivors. Population-based data establishing the global burden of SNJ has not been previously reported.

Objective

Determine the burden of SNJ in all WHO regions, as defined by clinical jaundice associated with clinical outcomes including acute bilirubin encephalopathy/kernicterus and/or exchange transfusion (ET) and/or jaundice-related death.

Data sources

PubMed, Scopus and other health databases were searched, without language restrictions, from 1990 to 2017 for studies reporting the incidence of SNJ.

Study selection/data extraction

Stratification was performed for WHO regions and results were pooled using random effects model and meta-regression.

Results

Of 416 articles including at least one marker of SNJ, only 21 reported estimates from population-based studies, with 76% (16/21) of them conducted in high-income countries. The African region has the highest incidence of SNJ per 10 000 live births at 667.8 (95% CI 603.4 to 738.5), followed by Southeast Asian, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, Americas and European regions at 251.3 (132.0 to 473.2), 165.7 (114.6 to 238.9), 9.4 (0.1 to 755.9), 4.4 (1.8 to 10.5) and 3.7 (1.7 to 8.0), respectively. The incidence of ET per 10 000 live births was significantly higher for Africa and Southeast Asian regions at 186.5 (153.2 to 226.8) and 107.1 (102.0 to 112.5) and lower in Eastern Mediterranean (17.8 (5.7 to 54.9)), Americas (0.38 (0.21 to 0.67)), European (0.35 (0.20 to 0.60)) and Western Pacific regions (0.19 (0.12 to 0.31). Only 2 studies provided estimates of clear jaundice-related deaths in infants with significant jaundice [UK (2.8%) and India (30.8%).

Conclusions

Limited but compelling evidence demonstrates that SNJ is associated with a significant health burden especially in low-income and middle-income countries.

### What are the current… [^117Nj44U]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice affects up to 84% of term newborns 1 and is the most common cause of hospital readmission in the neonatal period. 2 Severe hyperbilirubinemia occurs in less than 2% of term infants and can lead to kernicterus and permanent neurodevelopmental delay. 2 Therefore, it is important to systematically evaluate all infants for hyperbilirubinemia. 2 Data on progression of acute bilirubin encephalopathy to kernicterus are limited, but one study found that 95% of infants with acute bilirubin encephalopathy had full resolution of symptoms, and 5% had evidence of kernicterus by the time of discharge. 3 Kernicterus develops in one in 100, 000 infants and manifests as athetoid cerebral palsy, auditory dysfunction, dental dysplasia, paralysis of upward gaze, and variable intellectual disability.

4 In addition to hyperbilirubinemia, earlier gestational age, hemolysis, sepsis, and low birth weight are associated with the development of bilirubin encephalopathy. One study found that less than 5% of healthy term infants with a TSB level greater than 30 mg per dL developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus.
3. Are There Long-Term Neurodevelopmental Sequelae from Hyperbilirubinemia. A prospective case-control study of 146 term and near-term infants with TSB levels greater than 25 mg per dL found no differences in cognitive scores, abnormal results on neurologic examinations, or neurologic diagnoses at two years of age. 35 At two years' follow-up, there were no significant differences in rates of cerebral palsy, deafness, developmental delay, or visual abnormalities. The cohort with TSB levels greater than 19 mg per dL had an increased risk of attention deficit disorder.

Four high-quality studies with follow-up of 6. 5 to 17 years showed no relationship between hyperbilirubinemia and lower IQ scores. 5.

### Systematic review of screening for newborn bilirubin… [^111D6hmg]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Background: Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is associated with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy, or kernicterus, which is a rare disorder characterized by spasticity, hearing and vision abnormalities, and sometimes mental retardation. Reportedly occurring at a rate of 0. 9 instances per 100, 000 live births, kernicterus has a mortality rate of at least 10 percent and a morbidity rate of at least 70 percent. Severe hyperbilirubinemia has been used as a surrogate marker because no studies have directly measured kernicterus as an outcome. Screening, by risk factor and bilirubin measurement, and treatment of elevated bilirubin levels have become widespread to try to prevent kernicterus. In 2007, the Center on Primary Care, Prevention and Clinical Partnerships at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, on behalf of the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, asked the Tufts Evidence-Based Practice Center to update its 2003 evidence report on hyperbilirubinemia.

The USPSTF uses those findings in its screening recommendations for bilirubin encephalopathy in neonates. Trikalinos and colleagues summarized the key findings from the systematic review that examined the effects of screening for hyperbilirubinemia on the incidence of acute and chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. The Study: The study addressed four key questions: Does screening using risk-factor assessment and bilirubin testing reduce the incidence of acute or chronic bilirubin encephalopathy.; Does risk-factor assessment correctly identify infants who may benefit from bilirubin testing.; Does bilirubin testing correctly identify infants who may benefit from phototherapy.; and What are the adverse effects of screening. Screening by risk factors, bilirubin testing, or a combination is effective in predicting high bilirubin levels. In addition, noncontrolled studies suggest that early detection reduces the rate of readmission for hyperbilirubinemia.

However, the literature assumes that high bilirubin levels are a valid marker for bilirubin encephalopathy, and that treating high bilirubin levels can prevent bilirubin encephalopathy. The small number of eligible studies, none of good methodologic quality, limited the ability to determine definitive answers to the study questions. Conclusion: The authors conclude that high-quality evidence is lacking to determine the actual value of screening for hyperbilirubinemia to prevent chronic bilirubin encephalopathy.
