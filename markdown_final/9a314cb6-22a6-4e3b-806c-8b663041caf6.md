## Question

Why would a colonoscopy be normal 2–3 weeks after colitis seen on CT? At the time of the CT patient was having lots of bloody diarrhea, elevated calprotectin, and negative stool cultures. Does this rule out Crohn's disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a colonoscopy can be normal 2–3 weeks after CT showed colitis, and whether a normal colonoscopy in this context rules out Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal dynamics of mucosal healing and the limits of CT versus endoscopy. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance and limitations of fecal calprotectin. Next, I will review guideline-based principles for confirming or excluding Crohn's disease. After that, I need to consider patchy disease, small-bowel involvement, and histology. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and answer the question directly with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the apparent paradox: CT demonstrated colitis with bloody diarrhea and elevated calprotectin, yet colonoscopy 2–3 weeks later is normal, and stool cultures were negative, prompting concern for Crohn's disease and whether it has been excluded. Wait, let me verify the key elements: CT is sensitive for bowel wall thickening and extraluminal complications but is not the gold standard for mucosal assessment, whereas colonoscopy with biopsies provides direct visualization and histology, and a normal-appearing colon does not guarantee absence of microscopic or segmental disease, especially in Crohn's disease which can be patchy and transmural [^1165t1Pj] [^114GyrQ9].

> I will now examine the time course of mucosal healing. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — rapid improvement can occur over 2–3 weeks, particularly with transient colitides or early treatment effects, but I should confirm whether complete histologic normalization would be expected that quickly. Let me consider that in acute self-limited colitis versus new-onset IBD, histologic features of chronicity can already be present within days to a week, yet endoscopic appearance may lag or normalize faster than histology, and conversely, a normal-appearing mucosa can still harbor microscopic inflammation or architectural distortion, especially in Crohn's disease where disease is patchy and may spare segments visible on colonoscopy [^116zGLtt] [^1165t1Pj].

> Next, I should review fecal calprotectin performance and limitations. I need to ensure I am using appropriate cutoffs: ACG suggests fecal calprotectin thresholds around 50–100 μg/g to distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory colonic disease, but AGA emphasizes that neither normal nor elevated calprotectin alone is sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity in symptomatic Crohn's disease, and that biomarkers can be discordant with endoscopy due to assay variability, patchiness, and non-IBD causes of elevation, so a normal colonoscopy does not negate a recent elevated calprotectin [^113xzPbN] [^114Ldtnm] [^113Kg9s7].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline-based diagnostic principles for Crohn's disease. The AGA biomarker guidance indicates that in patients with moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or CRP supports active inflammation and can obviate routine endoscopic confirmation, whereas in patients with mild symptoms and normal biomarkers, endoscopic assessment is still suggested because biomarkers alone are insufficiently accurate. Importantly, in symptomatic remission with recent confirmation of endoscopic remission, fecal calprotectin less than about 150 μg/g and normal CRP can reasonably rule out active inflammation, but in patients without recent endoscopic remission confirmation, normal biomarkers cannot reliably exclude active disease, so a normal colonoscopy does not by itself rule out Crohn's disease in this context [^114Ldtnm] [^114kT7eK] [^1136Dph5].

> Let me consider disease distribution and the possibility of missed segments. Crohn's disease can involve the terminal ileum and small bowel with colonic sparing, and CT evidence of colitis could reflect a segmental process that is not sampled or is already healed at the time of colonoscopy; I should double-check whether the ileum was intubated and biopsied, and whether biopsies were obtained even from normal-appearing mucosa, because histology can reveal focal or microscopic disease and architectural changes not visible endoscopically, and guidelines emphasize systematic biopsies to maximize diagnostic yield and differentiate IBD mimics [^112fWCYp] [^1165t1Pj] [^114GyrQ9].

> But wait, what if the initial CT colitis was not IBD at all? I need to check alternative explanations: ischemic colitis, infection including C. difficile, NSAID-associated colitis, or immune-mediated colitis can produce transient CT abnormalities with subsequent rapid mucosal recovery, and stool cultures can be falsely negative; moreover, fecal calprotectin can be transiently elevated in infections and other non-IBD conditions, so a normal colonoscopy weeks later does not exclude a non-IBD colitis that has since resolved, though the negative cultures reduce but do not eliminate infectious etiologies given imperfect sensitivity [^115Bca9e] [^111HCtpu] [^113DdxXE].

> I should confirm the role of cross-sectional imaging for small-bowel evaluation. If suspicion for Crohn's disease remains, MR enterography or CT enterography can identify ileal or jejunal disease not visualized by colonoscopy, and guidelines recommend small-bowel imaging when clinical features suggest proximal involvement or when the diagnosis remains uncertain after ileocolonoscopy with biopsies. This is particularly relevant if symptoms persist or biomarkers remain elevated despite a macroscopically normal colon [^112fWCYp].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, I should review the colonoscopy report to ensure ileal intubation with biopsies and systematic colonic biopsies from right and left colon, including normal-appearing segments, because histology is decisive when macroscopy is normal. Second, I should repeat fecal calprotectin and CRP now to assess current inflammatory activity and guide next steps. Third, if symptoms persist or biomarkers remain elevated, I should obtain MR enterography or CT enterography to evaluate for small-bowel Crohn's disease. Fourth, if the diagnosis remains uncertain, I should consider capsule endoscopy where appropriate, recognizing retention risk and the need to exclude strictures first. Finally, I should avoid prematurely excluding Crohn's disease based solely on a normal colonoscopy in this time frame, and instead integrate symptoms, biomarkers, endoscopic histology, and cross-sectional imaging before concluding [^112fWCYp] [^114Ldtnm].

> Direct answer to the question: No, a normal colonoscopy 2–3 weeks after CT-demonstrated colitis with bloody diarrhea and elevated calprotectin does not rule out Crohn's disease. Rapid mucosal healing can occur, Crohn's disease can be patchy or confined to the small bowel, and a normal endoscopic appearance does not exclude microscopic or transmural inflammation. Definitive exclusion requires adequate segmental and ileal biopsies, reassessment of current biomarkers, and, if suspicion persists, small-bowel imaging, aligned with guideline-based principles that biomarkers and endoscopy are complementary and that discordance between symptoms, biomarkers, and endoscopy is well recognized in IBD [^112fWCYp] [^114Ldtnm] [^113JGoUr].

A normal colonoscopy 2–3 weeks after CT-proven colitis with bloody diarrhea and elevated calprotectin does not exclude Crohn's disease because CD can be **patchy, transmural, and segmental**, with inflammation limited to the small bowel or areas not visualized by colonoscopy [^1165t1Pj]. CT detects transmural and extramural inflammation that may be missed by endoscopy, and early or medically induced **mucosal healing** can yield a normal colonoscopic appearance despite ongoing disease. To avoid misdiagnosis, **small-bowel imaging** (MR enterography or capsule endoscopy) and histology are essential when CD is suspected [^112fWCYp].

---

## Pathophysiological explanations for normal colonoscopy despite recent colitis

### Patchy and segmental nature of Crohn's disease

- **Patchy inflammation**: CD characteristically shows skip lesions, so endoscopy can miss active segments.
- **Small bowel involvement**: Inflammation may be confined to the terminal ileum or jejunum, beyond colonoscopic reach [^112fWCYp].
- **Transmural disease**: CT detects full-thickness and extramural changes that endoscopy cannot visualize.

---

### Rapid mucosal healing

- **Early healing**: With therapy, mucosa can normalize within weeks, yielding a normal colonoscopy despite recent inflammation.
- **Histologic lag**: Endoscopic remission may precede histologic healing, masking ongoing disease.
- **Medication effects**: Anti-inflammatory drugs can suppress mucosal signs, creating a false-normal endoscopy.

---

### Limitations of colonoscopy in detecting Crohn's disease

| **Limitation** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Patchy inflammation | Skip lesions can be missed if not sampled |
| Small bowel involvement | Colonoscopy cannot visualize jejunum/proximal ileum |
| Transmural disease | Endoscopy cannot detect full-thickness or extramural inflammation |
| Rapid healing | Mucosal normalization can occur within weeks |
| Technical factors | Poor prep, incomplete exam, or operator variability limit sensitivity |

## Role of fecal calprotectin in Crohn's disease

Fecal calprotectin reflects **neutrophilic inflammation** and correlates with disease activity, but it is **nonspecific** — infections, NSAIDs, and other inflammatory conditions can elevate it. In CD, calprotectin is useful for screening and monitoring, yet **normal values do not exclude active disease**, particularly in the small bowel or with patchy inflammation.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Small-bowel imaging**: MR enterography or capsule endoscopy is recommended when CD is suspected and colonoscopy is normal [^112fWCYp].
- **Histology**: Biopsies can reveal microscopic inflammation or granulomas even with a normal mucosa.
- **Multimodal assessment**: Combine clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and radiologic data to improve diagnostic accuracy [^116hPXJj].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Persistent symptoms with a normal colonoscopy warrant **further evaluation** with small-bowel imaging and histology. A **treat-to-target** approach uses objective evidence (biomarkers, imaging) to guide therapy beyond symptoms alone [^113JGoUr]. Ongoing monitoring with biomarkers and imaging helps detect relapse or progression early.

---

## Conclusion

A normal colonoscopy 2–3 weeks after CT-proven colitis with bloody diarrhea and elevated calprotectin **does not exclude Crohn's disease**. CD's patchy, transmural nature and rapid mucosal healing can yield false-negative endoscopy. Small-bowel imaging and histology are critical to avoid misdiagnosis and ensure appropriate management.

### Can faecal calprotectin predict relapse in inflammatory bowel disease: a mini review [^113SZ3kv]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Faecal calprotectin is a protein complex of the S-100 family of calcium-binding proteins present in inflammatory cells that can be measured in stool samples, which act as a biomarker for bowel inflammation. Elevated faecal calprotectin has been shown to reflect the presence of ongoing mucosal inflammation, which improves with mucosal healing. The aim of this review was to evaluate the available evidence on the ability of faecal calprotectin to predict a relapse in inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple retrospective studies have shown that patients who relapse have significantly higher levels of calprotectin in their stool compared with non-relapsers, especially in ulcerative colitis. Elevated faecal calprotectin postoperatively in Crohn's disease was also shown to be indicative of a relapse. However, the association of a raised faecal calprotectin and relapse is not universal and may be explained by the different patterns of mucosal inflammatory activity that exist. In conclusion, we put forward our hypothesis that changes such as a rise in faecal calprotectin levels may be more predictive of a relapse than absolute values.

### Practical guidance on the use of faecal calprotectin [^111RRtnL]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Differentiation between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and functional gut disorders, and the determination of mucosal disease activity in established cases of IBD remain the cornerstones of disease diagnosis and management. Non-invasive, accurate biomarkers of gut inflammation are needed due to the variability of symptoms, the inaccuracies of currently available blood markers and the cost and invasive nature of endoscopy. Numerous biomarkers have been used and/or considered with some in current use. This article reviews the current evidence base around the indications for using biomarkers and their limitations, with a particular focus on faecal calprotectin.

Diarrhea and colitis

Diagnostic workup for grade 1 diarrhea or colitis symptoms should include CBC, CMP, and fecal lactoferrin.
Additional workup should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2, and these additional tests should include fecal calprotectin, and stool infectious analysis (stool ova and parasite, C. difficile and cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if available or if high index of suspicion is present, among other infectious studies (eg, COVID-19)). Serum TSH and celiac serologies (antitransglutaminase antibodies with total IgA level) may also be considered, if clinical suspicion of ICI-induced celiac disease is present.
Abdominal CT scan should be obtained in patients with signs and symptoms of colitis complications, such as bowel perforation or toxic megacolon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy with biopsy should be performed for patients with diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 3 or with persistent (≥ 5 days) diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade 2 (LE: 4).
ICIs may be temporarily withheld (instead of discontinued) in patients experiencing grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis symptoms. These patients may be re-challenged with ICIs if their symptoms are stable (grade ≤ 1 or baseline) with < 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) (LE: 4).
Close monitoring for recurrence of diarrhea or colitis symptoms is recommended after re-challenging patients with ICI therapy.
Corticosteroids should be started in patients experiencing diarrhea or colitis symptoms of grade ≥ 2. The initial dose of prednisone should be 1 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) for grade 2 diarrhea or colitis and 1–2 mg/kg/day for grades 3 and 4. Grade 4 diarrhea or colitis should initially be treated with IV corticosteroids. Corticosteroids should be tapered within 4 weeks after improvement of diarrhea or colitis symptoms to grade ≤ 1 (LE: 1).
Prior to administration of infliximab or vedolizumab, patients should be tested for HBV, HIV, and TB. Administration of infliximab or vedolizumab should not be delayed if test results are pending.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms do not respond to corticosteroid therapy within 3–5 days, if diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur after tapering corticosteroids, or if there is severe ulcerative presentation on colonoscopy, 3 doses of infliximab (5 mg/kg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1) to reduce the risk of colitis recurrence.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms persist after the second dose of infliximab treatment, the third dose should be held and 3 doses of vedolizumab (300 mg) should be administered at 0, 2, and 6 weeks (LE: 1).
If no clinical improvement is observed following immunosuppressive therapy in patients with grade ≥ 3 diarrhea or colitis, a repeat endoscopy with infectious workup (C. difficile and CMV) should be performed. Repeat endoscopy should be performed prior to resuming ICI therapy.
If diarrhea or colitis symptoms recur following corticosteroid taper, they should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as the first episode.

### Appropriate use of GI endoscopy [^115tauw3]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2012). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is generally indicated for evaluation of an abnormality on barium enema or other imaging study that is likely to be clinically significant, evaluation of unexplained GI bleeding (hematochezia; melena after an upper GI source has been excluded; presence of fecal occult blood), unexplained iron deficiency anemia, and screening and surveillance for colonic neoplasia including screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients, examination to evaluate the entire colon for synchronous cancer or neoplastic polyps in a patient with treatable cancer or neoplastic polyp, colonoscopy to remove synchronous neoplastic lesions at or around the time of curative resection of cancer followed by colonoscopy at 1 year and, if normal, then 3 years, and, if normal, then 5 years thereafter to detect metachronous cancer, surveillance of patients with neoplastic polyps, and surveillance of patients with a significant family history of colorectal neoplasia; additional indications include dysplasia and cancer surveillance in select patients with long-standing ulcerative or Crohn's colitis, evaluation of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease of the colon if more precise diagnosis or determination of the extent of activity of disease will influence management, and clinically significant diarrhea of unexplained origin.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to laboratory follow-up, AGA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using fecal calprotectin < 150 mcg/g and/or CRP < 5 mg/L (or below cutoff for normal range for the laboratory) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity in patients with CD in symptomatic remission with recent confirmation of endoscopic remission (without any change in clinical status, on stable therapy).

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^115BQ3Mq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — society recommendations for surveillance describe eligible ulcerative colitis (UC) patients as left-sided or extensive colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) involving at least 1/3 of colon; screening is for all patients at 8–10 y after symptom onset to reassess disease extent, with surveillance every 1–2 y, after 2 negative examinations recommended every 1–3 y until colitis has been present for 20 years, and after 20 years every 1–2 y. Random biopsy technique specifies that in extensive disease a minimum of 33 biopsies should be performed (4-quadrant biopsies every 10 cm throughout the colon), and in less extensive microscopic disease 4-quadrant biopsies should be taken from the proximal extent of disease and every 10 cm distally; particularly in UC, consider taking 4-quadrant biopsies every 5 cm in the lower sigmoid colon and rectum, and endorses the incorporation of chromoendoscopy into surveillance colonoscopy for appropriately trained endoscopists.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy — indications and biopsy strategy in diarrhea notes that flexible sigmoidoscopy may be a suitable initial investigation for the evaluation of acute diarrhea in patients with suspected diffuse colitis or for chronic diarrhea in patients who are pregnant, have significant comorbidities, or when symptoms characteristic of left-sided colonic disease predominate; in many situations, flexible sigmoidoscopy may be sufficient as the initial endoscopic test in chronic diarrhea. Biopsies should be performed for histologic evaluation even when the mucosa appears normal to exclude microscopic colitis and other etiologies, and colonoscopy should be considered if sigmoidoscopy findings are inconclusive, symptoms persist, there is large-volume blood loss, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or colorectal cancer is suspected.

### Time-to-reach target calprotectin level in newly diagnosed patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115v1Ztm]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

With the use of a prospective registry, we have shown that reaching calprotectin levels < 250 μg/g within 12 weeks of the initiation of induction therapy, facilitates recognition of new-onset CD patients with a favorable disease course, but this does not apply to new-onset UC patients. CD patients who fail to reach target calprotectin levels within 12 weeks after conventional induction therapy may be entitled to step-up to anti-TNF agents.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^113Dhrdg]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA guideline — biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring in ulcerative colitis (UC): In patients with UC in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests the use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over a symptom-based monitoring strategy. For patients in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, and/or normal C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. In patients with UC with moderate to severe symptoms, the panel suggests using fecal calprotectin > 150 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin, or elevated CRP to inform treatment decisions and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease. However, in patients in symptomatic remission but with elevated biomarkers, and in patients with moderate to severe symptoms with normal biomarkers, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease to inform treatment decisions. In patients with UC with mild symptoms, the panel suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity to inform treatment decisions.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117PcGs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) — key concepts include that UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of the ileum and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist. Categories of disease extent in UC consist of proctitis, left-sided colitis, or extensive colitis. If the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless there are other symptoms or findings to suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of CD rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity should be based on patient-reported outcomes, the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers of inflammation including fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS). Disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and periods of suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin monitoring in asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and practical guide [^116dsxvg]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), "monitoring" involves repeated testing aimed at early recognition of disease exacerbation. We aimed to determine the usefulness of repeated fecal calprotectin (FC) measurements to predict IBD relapses by a systematic literature review.

Methods

An electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to April 2016. Inclusion criteria were prospective studies that followed patients with IBD in remission at baseline and had at least 2 consecutive FC measurements with a test interval of 2 weeks to 6 months. Methodological assessment was based on the second Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist.

Results

A total of 1719 articles were identified; 193 were retrieved for full text review. Six studies met eligibility for inclusion. The time interval between FC tests varied between 1 and 3 months. Asymptomatic patients with IBD who had repeated FC measurements above the study's cutoff level had a 53% to 83% probability of developing disease relapse within the next 2 to 3 months. Patients with repeated normal FC values had a 67% to 94% probability to remain in remission in the next 2 to 3 months. The ideal FC cutoff for monitoring could not be identified because of the limited number studies meeting inclusion criteria and heterogeneity between selected studies.

Conclusions

Two consecutively elevated FC values are highly associated with disease relapse, indicating a consideration to proactively optimize IBD therapy plans. More prospective data are necessary to assess whether FC monitoring improves health outcomes.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^116Fs95i]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, more specifically with respect to management of gastrointestinal toxicity, evaluation, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining early stool testing for inflammatory markers (lactoferrin and calprotectin) in patients with grade ≥ 2 colitis/diarrhea (> 4 bowel movements daily above baseline) according to the CTCAE version 5 and selected patients with less-severe diarrhea, to help stratify high-risk patients for endoscopic evaluation.

### Ulcerative colitis [^115LJQc9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colon, and its incidence is rising worldwide. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, epithelial barrier defects, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental factors. Patients with ulcerative colitis have mucosal inflammation starting in the rectum that can extend continuously to proximal segments of the colon. Ulcerative colitis usually presents with bloody diarrhoea and is diagnosed by colonoscopy and histological findings. The aim of management is to induce and then maintain remission, defined as resolution of symptoms and endoscopic healing. Treatments for ulcerative colitis include 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs, steroids, and immunosuppressants. Some patients can require colectomy for medically refractory disease or to treat colonic neoplasia. The therapeutic armamentarium for ulcerative colitis is expanding, and the number of drugs with new targets will rapidly increase in coming years.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115RndQZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) endoscopic evaluation, biopsies, and imaging — procedural guidance states: In individuals with severe disease, a complete colonoscopy may be associated with a greater risk of perforation and in this case a sigmoidoscopy with biopsies is sufficient. Therefore, biopsies should be obtained from the proximal endoscopically normal-appearing colon even if the endoscopically inflamed segment seems to be restricted to the distal colon, and even if the distal rectum seems endoscopically normal, separate biopsies from the rectum should be obtained because patchy histologic inflammation may be seen in 5%–30% of children with UC despite the absence of endoscopically visible inflammation. Routine upper endoscopic evaluation is not required in adults with a new diagnosis of UC and should be restricted to those who have symptoms of upper gastrointestinal disease; in the pediatric UC population, up to 8% of children with UC may have their diagnosis modified to CD based on these upper findings. Imaging the small bowel with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging is also not routinely required in all patients with normal appearance of the terminal ileum on colonoscopy; however, in those with abdominal symptoms not explained by endoscopically active disease, those with suspicion of CD and those in whom the proximal extent of involvement cannot be evaluated because of severity of inflammation, small bowel imaging may be useful, and when considering surgery in those with UC, a small bowel evaluation may be reasonable to inform surgical management, with the utility of intestinal ultrasound in this specific scenario not yet defined.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^115rP3Xo]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) remission — fecal calprotectin (FC) and relapse risk: One-third of patients (38%) had elevated FC defined as > 200–300 µg/g; at a median follow-up of 1 year, elevated FC was associated with being 4.8 times more likely to relapse than normal FC, with 95% CI 2.81–8.17 and I2 = 82%; with a baseline median annual relapse risk of 11% on normal FC, the 12 months relapse risk with elevated biomarkers and symptomatic remission was 52.7% (95% CI, 30.9%–89.9%).

### Are we exposing patients with a mildly elevated faecal calprotectin to unnecessary investigations? [^114m3N7R]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Faecal calprotectin (FC) is a non-invasive marker used to differentiate irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, false positives are common. We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of investigation in patients presenting with new lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and a mildly elevated FC (100–200µg/g).

Design

Retrospective study of electronic patient records.

Patients

Patients aged 16–50years with new lower GI symptoms and an FC 100–200µg/g were identified from our biochemistry laboratory database between September 2009 and 2011. Patients were excluded if they had a previous FC > 200µg/g, were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), had IBD, positive stool cultures or 'alarm' symptoms.

Setting

Secondary care gastroenterology clinics.

Results

161 patients (103 female patients) were identified. Mean age was 37.3years with a mean FC of 147µg/g. 398 endoscopic, radiological and histological investigations were undertaken in 141 patients (an average of 2.8 investigations per patient). 131 colonoscopies were performed with abnormalities in only 24 (18.3%). In patients with a macroscopically normal upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy, the diagnostic yield of any further investigation was only 7.3%. The negative predictive value (NPV) of an FC 100–200µg/g was 86.7% for any pathology and 97.5% for significant luminal pathology (IBD, advanced adenoma or colorectal carcinoma). After a mean follow-up of 172.4weeks, IBD was the final diagnosis in only 4 (2.5%) of patients.

Conclusions

In adult patients under 50years old presenting with new lower GI symptoms, the NPV of an FC between 100 and 200µg/g in excluding significant organic GI disease is high.

### P019 Not all fecal calprotectin is specific for inflammatory bowel disease [^116ydCcS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Case

Introduction:Fecal calprotectin is a known inflammatory marker used to evaluate patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In fact, ACG Clinical Guideline for management of Crohn's disease recommend fecal calprotectin (FC) as a helpful test to distinguish IBD versus functional disorder such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Studies have also shown association of fecal calprotectin with colon cancer. Recent study proposed fecal calprotectin could be a reliable marker for ruling out organic disease with high negative predictive value.

Case Description

We present a patient case of a Caucasian, thirty-five years of age male with PMHx of GERD on Prilosec who presented due to acute abdominal pain, nausea, emesis and watery, nonbloody diarrhea of four days duration. Initially, patient had unknown family history of colon cancer which later was revealed that patient's father had a colon cancer diagnosis in his fifties. On admission, patient had stable vitals with routine labs showing leukocytosis, iron deficiency anemia, normal CRP, and elevated fecal calprotectin of 986mcg/gm. Abdominal imaging with CT abdomen with contrast showed diffuse dilation of ileum and thickening of the distal ileum up to the level of the ileocecal junction, suggestive of enteritis from infectious or inflammatory etiology such as Crohn's. Patient was managed conservatively, stool studies were negative otherwise and discharged with outpatient endoscopy due to high suspicion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Within one week, patient had a subsequent readmission for now partial small bowel obstruction at the level of ileum. Due to high suspicion of Crohn's, patient was empirically started on IV steroids. Decision for inpatient colonoscopy was made with colonoscopy showing completely obstructing, circumferential, large mass found in the cecum extending into ascending colon. Final pathology revealed invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated. Patient subsequently underwent right hemicolectomy with lymph node resection and adjuvant chemotherapy treatment for stage 3 colon.

Discussion

We present here a case where a common cancer was found in an otherwise healthy, young male with acute abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. While initial symptoms, imaging and laboratory findings pointed towards a biased high suspicion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, patient's ultimate diagnosis was stage 3 adenocarcinoma of colon requiring surgical resection and chemotherapy. Fecal calprotectin is a known marker for colon inflammation and associated with both IBD and colon cancer. It is important to keep in mind that while fecal calprotectin may have elevated negative predictive value and be used to rule out organic disease, elevation of fecal calprotectin is not always specific for IBD. We want to emphasize the importance of considering colon cancer on the differential despite a patient's age and diagnostic bias. Lastly, we also want to highlight the importance of tissue diagnosis prior to long term therapy use.

The diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease has traditionally relied on clinical assessment, serum markers of inflammation, and endoscopic examination. Fecal biomarkers such as calprotectin, lactoferrin, and S100A12 are predominantly derived from neutrophils, are easily detectable in the feces, and are emerging as valuable markers of intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on the role of fecal biomarkers in the diagnosis and monitoring of Crohn's disease, in particular how these biomarkers change with disease activity and remission, how they can be used to monitor the response to medical therapy, their value in predicting clinical relapse, and their role in monitoring the postoperative state.

### Faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of inflammatory bowel disease in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms: meta-analysis [^1142bLzg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Colonoscopy is the standard medical procedure to identify inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Noninvasive measurement of faecal calprotectin concentration may replace colonoscopy in this indication. The study aimed to assess efficacy of faecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker of IBD in patients with symptoms suggestive of such diagnosis. Meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies was performed. Cochrane, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases were searched until December 2018. Inclusion criteria comprised experimental and observational studies, adults with gastrointestinal symptoms, calprotectin as index and colonoscopy as reference test, presence of data on/enabling the calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters. For each study, sensitivity and specificity of faecal calprotectin were analysed as bivariate data. Nineteen studies were identified. The total number of patients was 5032. Calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.882 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.827–0.921] and 0.799 (95% CI, 0.693–0.875), respectively. Following faecal calprotectin incorporation in the diagnostic work-up of 100 people with suspected IBD, 18 non-IBD patients will have a colonoscopy performed and one patient with the disease will not be referred for this examination. Faecal calprotectin concentration measurement is a useful screening test to rule out IBD, at the same time reducing the need for colonoscopy by 66.7%.

Observational cohorts detected a small number of colorectal cancers (15 cases/1000 patients) and advanced adenomas (33 cases/1000 patients), and absence of a mass lesion on CT scan does not exclude the possibility of an underlying colonic neoplasm. Several factors to perform colonoscopy include timing and completeness of a prior colonoscopy, comorbidities, persistent symptoms of abdominal pain or diarrhea, and patient preferences; although an increased risk of recurrent diverticulitis or colonic perforation is a concern, this was not reported as an adverse event in the available literature. The optimal timing is uncertain, and intervals of 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of acute diverticulitis are commonly followed.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

Epidemiological diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) — Among more than 40 published epidemiological series in children and adults, the definition of UC is more consistent than for Crohn disease (CD); the epidemiological diagnosis of UC relies on bloody diarrhea with negative stool cultures and endoscopic evidence of diffuse continuous mucosal inflammation involving the rectum and extending proximally, and the presence of backwash ileitis does not exclude a diagnosis of UC.

5.5.2 Collection of faecal calprotectin samples

There remain practical issues around the use of faecal calprotectin. These include variability between different assays, variability in levels in different stool samples from one patient during 1 day, lack of stability for samples kept at room temperature for more than a few days, and variation in calprotectin levels related to the interval between stools being passed. It is therefore recommended that the first stool passed in the morning is routinely used for sampling, and that this is stored for no more than 3 days at room temperature before analysis.

Chronic diarrhea — diagnostic evaluation including endoscopy: While not considered in these guidelines, the work-up of chronic diarrhea is briefly considered and should include the differential diagnoses such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and Whipple's disease; gastrointestinal endoscopy and relevant serological assays may contribute to the diagnosis and management if sustained or progressive weight loss is a prominent feature, and upper endoscopy may be considered, with mucosal biopsies recommended even when the endoscopic appearance is normal; the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy in patients ranges from 7 to 32%, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and microscopic colitis being the most common diagnoses, and colonoscopy yields a noninfectious diagnosis more often than upper endoscopy; in the situation of chronic diarrhea and abdominal symptoms occurring after a bout of infectious diarrhea, a diagnosis of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome must be considered.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^1165t1Pj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Chronic diarrhea — colonoscopy diagnostic yield and biopsy approach is detailed: Histology is essential in evaluation because many etiologies are not macroscopically evident, the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy ranges from 7% to 32%, and in referral centers microscopic colitis accounts for approximately 10% of patients seen for chronic diarrhea; in a retrospective series of 809 patients, more than 99% of 122 abnormal pathologic findings were identifiable on distal colonic biopsies and the majority (80 of 122) showed microscopic colitis; because distribution can be patchy and left-sided sampling may miss disease, it is recommended that multiple biopsy samples should be taken from both the right and left sides of the colon, and clinicians should note that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause terminal ileal mucosal changes that mimic IBD.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113UTa6z]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds — In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), FC levels < 60 μg/g were predictive of deep remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) with 86% sensitivity and 87% specificity, and FC < 40.5 μg/g predicted histological remission with 41% sensitivity and 100% specificity; thresholds of 200–250 μg/g may predict endoscopic remission in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD). FC values < 50 μg/g may be reassuring for a non-IBD etiology of persistent symptoms, whereas 50–250 μg/g can be challenging to interpret; for mild symptoms, serial FC monitoring at 3- to 6-month intervals may be appropriate, and if a flare is suspected, endoscopy with biopsies or dedicated small-bowel imaging in CD should be considered. CRP has poor sensitivity and up to 15% of patients may fail to mount a CRP response.

### Questions and answers on the role of faecal calprotectin as a biological marker in inflammatory bowel disease [^112niWiZ]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Faecal calprotectin has been proposed as a non-invasive surrogate marker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. Close correlation between faecal calprotectin concentration and faecal leukocyte excretion quantified with (111)indium has been described. This faecal marker can be detected using simple and cheap techniques. Faecal calprotectin has a good diagnostic precision for separating organic and functional intestinal diseases. However, the specificity for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease is lower than desirable, as several diseases other than inflammatory bowel disease — specially colorectal neoplasia and gastrointestinal infection — can also increase faecal calprotectin. High concentration of calprotectin in faeces is a strong argument to carry out a colonoscopy in order to rule out the presence of inflammatory bowel disease or other organic pathologies. Parallelism between faecal calprotectin levels and inflammatory bowel disease activity has been confirmed, although this faecal marker appears to better reflect the disease activity in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. Faecal calprotectin's capacity to predict inflammatory bowel diseases relapse is promising. It has been suggested that, in inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving treatment, a normalization or decrease in faecal calprotectin concentrations is an accurate indicator of endoscopic healing. Greater faecal calprotectin concentration has been shown in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting that there is a high prevalence of subclinical intestinal inflammation in them.

Acute self-limited colitis (ASLC) vs inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults — biopsy timing and parameters: A blinded retrospective adult study examining rectal biopsies in 52 ASLC, 51 new-onset (< 3 months) ulcerative colitis (UC), and 30 chronic IBD found that chronic changes were reliably present in most IBD patients as early as 7 days after symptom onset, while branched glands were present in only 3 of 37 ASLC and basal lymphoid aggregates were absent. Another series of 209 consecutive biopsies (38 UC, 12 Crohn disease [CD], 105 other colitides) reported that a combination of increased lamina propria plasma cells, crypt distortion, and crypt atrophy had 94% sensitivity and 96% specificity in distinguishing IBD from other colitides. These data suggest that in acute colitis with negative cultures, colonoscopy with biopsy within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset can successfully differentiate ASLC and IBD in adults.

### Usefulness of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker of microscopic colitis in a cohort of patients with chronic watery diarrhoea of functional characteristics [^116sJGDS]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Information on the use of fecal markers in microscopic colitis screening is limited.

Aim

To evaluate the risk variables associated with a diagnosis of microscopic colitis including fecal calprotectin.

Methods

Patients submitted for a colonoscopy due to chronic watery diarrhea fulfilling criteria of functional disease were evaluated. Colonic mucosa was normal but mild erythema and edema was allowed. Fecal calprotectin was analyzed. A logistic regression was used to evaluate variables associated with both raised fecal calprotectin and a diagnosis of microscopic colitis.

Results

94 patients were included, 30 were diagnosed with microscopic colitis and 64 made up the control group. Median calprotectin levels were 175 (IQR, 59–325) for the microscopic colitis and 28 (IQR, 16–111) for the control group (p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off for fecal calprotectin was > 100 μg/g (AUC, 0.73), with 67% sensitivity and 75% specificity. The number of drugs used ≥ 3 (OR, 3.9; CI, 1.4–10.4) and microscopic colitis diagnosis (OR, 6; CI, 2.2–16.3) were associated with raised calprotectin levels. Age > 60 years (OR, 3.8; CI, 1.4–10.1) and calprotectin levels (OR, 5.3; CI, 2–14.1) were associated with a risk of microscopic colitis.

Conclusions

Elevated fecal calprotectin concentrations are often seen in microscopic colitis, and may be helpful in the diagnosis of women over 60 with chronic watery diarrhea.

5.5.1.1 Faecal calprotectin in the assessment of disease activity in known IBD

Statement 112. We suggest that, in IBD patients where it is unclear if symptoms are due to ongoing inflammation or other non-inflammatory causes (such as bile acid malabsorption, functional bowel disorder or short bowel), faecal calprotectin measurement may be used to provide evidence of mucosal inflammation (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Faecal calprotectin is a useful surrogate marker of inflammatory activity in IBD. It correlates well with endoscopic inflammation in UCand in Crohn's disease. If it is unclear whether new symptoms represent a relapse or other causes, particularly in Crohn's disease, then calprotectin is useful to confirm active inflammation and can be a non-invasive alternative to flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. If relapsing disease is clinically obvious, then measurement is not necessary.

A recent meta-analysis including data for 2822 IBD patients and 298 controls found that a calprotectin cut-off of 50 µg/g had the best sensitivity (90.6%) to detect endoscopically active disease, with specificity performing best (78.2%) at levels > 100 µg/g. A separate meta-analysis has shown that a threshold of 250 µg/g provides better specificity of 82% than thresholds of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g (specificity of 66% and 60%, respectively) in differentiating active IBD from remission. However, a faecal calprotectin of 250 µg/g had a relatively lower sensitivity of 80% compared with a sensitivity of 84% and 92% at cut-offs of 100 µg/g and 50 µg/g, respectively.

### Post-transplant inflammatory bowel disease associated with donor-derived TIM-3 deficiency [^1169Pzd3]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Five years after aSCT, the patient presented with watery diarrhea. After stool multiplex-PCR ruled out bacterial, viral, or parasite pathogens, colonoscopy revealed a moderate left-sided colitis, histologically associated with non-specific inflammation but neither evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection nor GvHD (Lerner grade 0). Broad-spectrum antibiotics and short-term budesonide were associated with transient improvement. However, within a few weeks, the patient developed bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis, markedly elevated C-reactive protein, and a newly developed iron deficiency anemia. Stool calprotectin was > 800 ug/g stool, pathogen multiplex stool-PCR screening, including Clostridioides difficile, was negative, and the computer tomography (CT)-imaging demonstrated a severe pancolitis. A repeat colonoscopy confirmed an erosive pancolitis and a moderate terminal ileitis (Supplemental Fig. 1). Histologically, multiple crypt abscesses, distortion of the crypt architecture on colonic biopsies, and an erosive inflammation with cryptitis in the ileum were consistent with diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) (Supplemental Fig. 1). No evidence of GvHD or CMV infection was found. Gastro-duodenoscopy performed at this time showed the absence of duodenal inflammation and no evidence of Whipple's disease. High-dose prednisolone therapy with a tapering scheme, along with an infliximab induction therapy (5 mg/kg body weight), was initiated. The patient achieved remission which was maintained clinically, biochemically, and endoscopically up to the present with infliximab every 6–8 weeks in the absence of steroids. In this stable remission, the distribution of lymphocyte and T cell subpopulations in peripheral blood was analyzed, demonstrating normal T cell numbers with a preserved CD4 + /CD8 + T cell ratio > 1. CD25 hi CD127 lo regulatory CD4 T cell frequencies were also normal, naïve CD4 T cells were slightly low, and follicular T helper cells were relatively elevated compared to age- and sex-matched reference values (Table 1).

5.4.7 Summary of recommendations for operative optimisation

In elective surgery IBD patients should have their physical condition assessed and optimised prior to surgery. This should include assessment of comorbidities; imaging or endoscopy to document disease extent; drainage of abscesses and treatment of sepsis; assessment and correction of nutritional deficiencies; and stopping corticosteroids and biologics where possible. All IBD patients undergoing surgery should follow an enhanced recovery (ERAS) protocol. A checklist is shown in box 10.

5.5 Faecal calprotectin

5.5.1 Faecal calprotectin in the differential diagnosis of IBD versus IBS

Statement 111. We recommend that, for patients aged 16–40 presenting in primary care with chronic diarrhoea and symptoms that may be consistent with either IBD or IBS, faecal calprotectin is a useful screening tool with a high negative predictive value. If significantly elevated, patients should have an infective cause excluded and be referred for further investigation (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.9%).

Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive and specific marker of intestinal inflammation and is a useful non-invasive method to investigate patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in low-risk groups for malignancy, when infection and coeliac disease have been excluded as the cause and symptoms are suspected to be either due to IBD or IBS (figure 6). A normal level has a very high negative predictive value for IBD. By contrast, the positive predictive value of levels above the assay reference level (normal defined as < 50 µg/g stool) is low, and it is recommended that a higher threshold is used to trigger colonoscopy, which improves the positive predictive value with little reduction in the negative predictive value. Due to the variety of calprotectin assays in commercial use, the exact cut-off prompting colonoscopy should be determined locally, but it is generally between 100 and 250 µg/g stool and should be monitored to ensure appropriate specificity and sensitivity. Used in this way, faecal calprotectin can be used as a cost-effective measureto prevent unnecessary colonoscopy in those where IBD is extremely unlikely.

### How Do we treat inflammatory bowel diseases to aim for endoscopic remission? [^113JGoUr]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous conditions which may manifest with 1 or more of a constellation of abnormal symptoms, elevated biomarkers, and/or objective evidence of inflammation on endoscopic or cross-sectional evaluation. Whilst resolution of symptoms and restoration of quality of life is the primary goal for patients following a disease flare, there may be discordance between resolution of symptoms, biomarkers, and endoscopy. Increased emphasis is placed on the achievement of endoscopic remission, given it is associated with improved outcomes and reduction in hospitalization and surgeries. As the therapeutic armamentarium for inflammatory bowel disease does not achieve remission in all patients, there is greater emphasis on repetitive interval-based assessment of disease activity with sequential algorithmic treatment adjustments until endoscopic remission is achieved, in a so-called treat-to-target approach. We review the role of symptoms, biomarkers, imaging and endoscopy within treat-to-target algorithms and provide a practical guidance to their use in clinical practice.

### Diagnostic value of faecal calprotectin in unselected outpatients referred for colonoscopy: a multicenter prospective study [^115TVc62]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of faecal calprotectin in consecutive outpatients referred for colonoscopy.

Methods

Outpatients undergoing colonoscopy at five participating institutions were eligible. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Faecal samples were tested at a single laboratory by means of a commercially available kit.

Results

We consecutively enrolled 870 patients. Mean levels of calprotectin were significantly higher in patients with neoplastic and inflammatory disorders when compared with subjects with a normal colonoscopy or trivial endoscopic findings. Elevated calprotectin levels (> 50mg/dl) were detected in 85% of patients with colorectal cancer, and 81% of those with inflammatory conditions but also in 37% of patients with normal or trivial endoscopic findings. In patients referred for chronic diarrhoea, sensitivity and negative predictive value were 100% in detecting either any organic colonic disease. In patients referred for symptoms of "suspected functional origin" sensitivity and negative predictive value for colorectal cancer were also 100%.

Conclusions

In unselected outpatients referred for colonoscopy, a single measurement of faecal calprotectin is not sufficiently accurate to identify those with significant colorectal disease. However, a normal result can help rule out organic disease among patients with diarrhoea and those with abdominal pain and/or constipation.

### Faecal calprotectin for screening of patients with suspected inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic meta-analysis [^113Uqrt5]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other reviews

A total of 22 narrative reviews have been published in recent years on the use of testing for faecal calprotectin levels in the diagnosis of intestinal inflammation or flare-up of inflammatory bowel disease (fig 1), but all were based on non-systematic methods. One systematic approach summarised the findings of all available studies to 2006. The reviewers found higher sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease than we did. The meta-analysis of that review, however, had several methodological limitations. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled separately contrary to general recommendations and the reviewers included studies that featured a control group with healthy people, which leads to overestimation of diagnostic accuracy.

Cut-off of 50 μg/g faeces (assay-dependent) is recommended to distinguish functional bowel disorder from organic/inflammatory bowel disease (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
In patients with typical symptoms of functional bowel disease, normal physical examination and normal screening blood and faecal tests (calprotectin), a positive diagnosis of IBS can be made (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation strong).
For those with lower gastrointestinal symptoms suspicious of colon cancer (without rectal bleeding), we suggest faecal immunological testing as a rule out test to guide need for referral or urgency of investigations either in primary or secondary care; (Grade of evidence level 2, Strength of recommendation weak)
In patients with chronic diarrhoea, we recommend colonoscopy (with ileoscopy) and biopsy as the preferred investigation of the lower bowel (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
In younger patients (under 40 years) with a normal faecal calprotectin and in whom functional bowel disease is suspected, we recommend a flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy (Grade of evidence level 3, Strength of recommendation strong).
We recommend either MR enterography or video capsule endoscopy (VCE) (depending on local availability) rather than CT as first-line investigation for diagnosing inflammation within the small bowel (Grade of evidence level 1, Strength of recommendation strong).
We do not recommend VCE for the diagnosis of coeliac disease due to insufficient evidence (Grade of evidence level 5, Strength of recommendation strong).
Ultrasonography of the small bowel, while attractive due to its non-invasive nature and absence of radiation exposure, has a limited diagnostic role hence cannot be recommended routinely (unless other modalities are unavailable) (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).
Enteroscopy (± device assisted) has limited diagnostic value for chronic diarrhoea and we recommend its role mainly for targeting predefined lesions (Grade of evidence level 4, Strength of recommendation strong).

This article discusses the important role endoscopy plays in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease and how the procedure adds crucial information to the constellation of history, physical examination, radiographic findings, and laboratory values. Differentiation between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has important ramifications for medical therapy, surgical options, and prognosis. This distinction can be accurately made in at least 85% of patients.

Crohn's disease — symptom assessment and confirmation of disease activity: Evaluation of clinical disease activity should include assessment of stool frequency and consistency, the presence of abdominal pain, systemic signs of inflammation, and extraintestinal manifestations of CD, and when diagnostic uncertainty is present because of unclear symptoms, it is recommended to confirm disease activity through imaging and/or endoscopic assessments; in individuals without any observable mucosal inflammation or ulceration, consideration should be given to the potential differential diagnostic possibilities.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^114Ldtnm]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) reviews the performance of fecal calprotectin, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and the Endoscopic Healing Index across asymptomatic patients, those with varying symptom severity, and those in surgically induced remission, and the guideline panel made 11 conditional recommendations. In CD in symptomatic remission, the panel suggests use of a biomarker- and symptom-based monitoring strategy over symptoms alone, and in this setting a fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g and normal CRP rules out active inflammation, avoiding endoscopic evaluation for assessment of disease activity; however, elevated biomarkers in this setting merit confirmation with endoscopy before treatment adjustment. In CD with mild symptoms, neither normal nor elevated biomarkers alone are sufficiently accurate to determine endoscopic activity, whereas in moderate to severe symptoms, elevated fecal calprotectin or serum CRP suggests endoscopic activity, precluding routine endoscopic assessment for disease activity. In surgically induced remission in low-risk patients on pharmacologic prophylaxis, a normal fecal calprotectin reliably rules out endoscopic recurrence, while in other postoperative settings biomarkers are insufficient for establishing diagnosis of recurrence.

### Diagnosis of colitis: making the initial diagnosis [^115Bca9e]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The evaluation of patients with colitis of recent onset is a relatively common clinical challenge. The main considerations are infectious colitides, idiopathic IBD, ie, ulcerative and Crohn's colitis, and colonic ischemia. An initial risk assessment on the basis of such factors as concurrent symptoms in contacts, travel history, medications, and human immunodeficiency virus risk factors should be followed by a thorough clinical history, physical examination, stool studies, blood tests, and, in selected cases, endoscopic examination and serologic tests. Biopsies can be decisive in distinguishing among the different types of acute colitis and might help identify specific etiologies. The diagnostic yield of biopsies is maximized by appropriate sampling of the colonic mucosa and by sharing the clinical and endoscopic findings with the pathologist, eg, via a copy of the endoscopy report.

### What is the faecal calprotectin test? [^111A1HPZ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is a protein released by white blood cells involved in inflammation of the bowel.1 It can be detected in faeces using laboratory or point of care tests. Although an elevated calprotectin level indicates inflammation in the bowel, it cannot identify the cause.1 Faecal calprotectin testing is mainly used in distinguishing between 'functional' disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and 'organic' disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, a group of conditions including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that require referral to specialist services. Here we explain the role of faecal calprotectin testing in adults in primary care.

### Can fecal calprotectin accurately identify histological activity of ulcerative colitis? A meta-analysis [^1158kHiZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

FC has a good diagnostic accuracy for histological response and remission in patients with UC. A cut-off value of 100–200 µg/g is more appropriate to identify patients in histological response and spare patients from unnecessary endoscopy and biopsy. The exact cut-off value should be further decided according to the prevalence of histological activity and different FC assays. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.

Early colonoscopy with biopsy — Mantzaris et al evaluated acute self-limited colitis (ASLC) versus IBD by performing colonoscopy in 114 adults with acute colitis of ≤ 5 days' duration, with all patients also undergoing serial flexible sigmoidoscopies at 1, 3, 6, and 18 to 24 months after initial illness and a total colonoscopy at 12 months. Ultimately, 68 patients were diagnosed with ASLC, of whom 35 patients (52%) had positive cultures, while 46 patients had IBD (42 UC, 4 Crohn ileocolitis). Compared with ASLC, UC showed a significantly higher prevalence of diffuse erythema (100% vs 25%), granularity (100% vs 8%), and friability (100% vs 12%).

Figure 6
Use of faecal calprotectin in primary care.

Faecal calprotectin is generally raised in patients with bloody diarrhoea and patients with this presenting feature will need flexible sigmoidoscopy regardless of the calprotectin result. In acute diarrhoea due to infection, calprotectin is also likely to be raised and will not discriminate between IBD and gastroenteritis, thus stool culture and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are the appropriate diagnostic investigations. While there is limited evidence to support routine repeat testing, an evaluation of the York Faecal Calprotectin Care Pathway found that, in 243 patients with a faecal calprotectin ≥ 100 µg/g after a median of 18 (IQR 14–29) days, repeat testing identified a reduction in 53% of patients, either to < 100 µg/g or, if initially > 250 µg/g, into the 100–250 µg/g range.

Faecal calprotectin is not sensitive enough in the exclusion of advanced colorectal adenoma or colorectal carcinoma, and so in patients with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, weight loss, or iron-deficiency anaemia, cancer pathway referral should be strongly consideredand calprotectin is not appropriate. In primary care, symptoms of change in bowel habit with rectal bleeding and abnormal haematology in patients under 50 years are strongly predictive of IBD or colorectal cancer, but generally do not discriminate between the two. IBD is significantly more common in younger age groups, so referral will generally be to medical gastroenterologists. However, if there are reasons to suspect malignancy, patients should be referred via a suspected cancer pathway, although both need rapid colonoscopy (figure 6).

AGA Recommendation 4 — In patients with UC with mild symptoms, with normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP), the AGA suggests endoscopic assessment of disease activity rather than empiric treatment adjustment (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). For mild symptoms such as slight increase in stool frequency and/or infrequent rectal bleeding, proceeding directly with endoscopic assessment rather than testing biomarkers may be reasonable, and for those who prefer to avoid endoscopy or empiric escalation, repeat biomarker measurement (in 3–6 months) may be a reasonable alternative.

GI toxicities — colitis management for grade 2 diarrhea includes holding ICI, corticosteroids with taper, consideration of biologics, endoscopic evaluation, and criteria for resuming therapy. G2 (increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline) management states: Hold ICI at least until recovery to G1, consider consult with gastroenterology for ≥ G2, and administer corticosteroids starting with initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent until symptoms improve to G1, then taper over 4–6 weeks. Consider adding anti-TNF (infliximab) or anti-integrin (vedolizumab) for corticosteroid-refractory disease (ie, no decrease by one grade in 72 hours) or dependent or with high-risk endoscopic features. When symptoms improve to ≤ G1, taper corticosteroids over 4–6 weeks; endoscopic evaluation with EGD or colonoscopy is highly recommended for cases grade ≥ 2. Resuming ICI therapy after symptoms improve to ≤ G1 may be considered when steroid taper is completed and/or if endoscopic and histologic remissions are achieved; fecal calprotectin ≤ 116 μg/g may be considered as a surrogate. Resuming PD-1/PD-L1 agent is associated with lower risk of flare-up; however, CTLA-4 inhibitor can still be considered in selected cases.

### Role of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^1132s7HV]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is an abundant neutrophil protein found in both plasma and stool that is markedly elevated in infectious and inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We conducted a systematic review of the published literature regarding fecal calprotectin to evaluate its potential as a noninvasive marker of neutrophilic intestinal inflammation. Reference ranges for fecal calprotectin have been established in healthy adults and children, and elevated concentrations of fecal calprotectin have been demonstrated in numerous studies of patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin correlates well with histological inflammation as detected by colonoscopy with biopsies and has been shown successfully to predict relapses and detect pouchitis in patients with IBD. Fecal calprotectin has been shown to consistently differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome because it has excellent negative predictive value in ruling out IBD in undiagnosed, symptomatic patients. Fecal calprotectin also may be useful in determining whether clinical symptoms in patients with known IBD are caused by disease flares or noninflammatory complications/underlying irritable bowel syndrome and in providing objective evidence of response to treatment. Although more studies are needed to define fully the role of fecal calprotectin, convincing studies and growing clinical experience point to an expanded role in the diagnosis and management of IBD.

### Chronic granulomatous disorder-associated colitis can Be accurately evaluated with MRI scans and fecal calprotectin level [^112RbfH1]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

In summary, we have demonstrated that CGD-associated colitis can be assessed non-invasively. Fecal calprotectin can be used to confidently exclude active colitis if normal, and the level will give an indication of disease activity. Serum interleukin-12 concentration may also correlate with disease activity and points towards a targeted treatment. Although it may still be important to perform colonoscopy to confirm a diagnosis, and intermittently thereafter, MRI imaging can be used for some monitoring of disease activity. It will be of particular benefit for those unable to tolerate or with contraindications to colonoscopy. While its use in children may be affected by the need for sedation and requirement to ingest a relatively unpalatable drink, these issues equally apply to colonoscopy. In adults, this modality is better tolerated and generally preferred by patients, is quicker, is safer, is more likely to visualize the entire large bowel to terminal ileum, and can identify additional pathologies outside the gastrointestinal tract. We recommend that it is incorporated into routine clinical practice.

For practical implementation, the panel preferred a single fecal calprotectin cutoff (> 150 μg/g) across scenarios, and in typical flare symptoms reported that an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) had very good performance, at least comparable with fecal tests. The document also notes that stool testing to rule out C difficile and other enteric pathogens may still be required for all symptomatic patients.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline — biomarkers for Crohn's disease (CD) monitoring — emphasizes specificity and infection exclusion: CRP may be elevated in systemic inflammatory processes and does not always represent luminal CD activity; fecal calprotectin is more specific for gut inflammation but may be elevated with concomitant gastrointestinal infections, and in patients with CD who have elevated biomarkers and disease-related symptoms, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile and other enteric pathogens is important. For other indications, endoscopic evaluation is warranted for determining the extent and severity of inflammation, dysplasia detection and surveillance, evaluation and endoscopic treatment of stricturing disease, and ruling out cytomegalovirus colitis; biomarkers are not helpful in these situations.

### Sampling endoscopically normal large bowel mucosa from patients presenting with elevated faecal calprotectin levels is not clinically justified [^115XJHv5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims and Methods

Faecal calprotectin (FCP) measurement is used especially to investigate for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To assess the utility of sampling endoscopically normal large bowel among patients first presenting with elevated FCP, this study identified 115 such patients out of 652 patients with elevated FCP from approximately 6000 primary care tests processed over 15 months.

Results

23 cohort patients showed histologically abnormal large bowel biopsies. Only four cases demonstrated acute inflammation and two such patients only showed scattered cryptitis and did not develop IBD. A third patient demonstrated similar histology but, following repeat colonoscopy, her elevated FCP was attributed to small intestinal inflammation. Only the fourth patient's large bowel biopsies showed features suggesting Crohn's disease, but this represented an IBD detection rate out of 115 sets of large bowel biopsies of 0.9%.

Conclusions

Sampling of endoscopically normal large bowel among patients first presenting with elevated FCP is not clinically justified.

Anatomic abnormalities or structural complications should be considered for obstructive symptoms, and alternative pathophysiologic mechanisms such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and chronic pancreatitis should be considered and evaluated based on predominant symptom patterns.

Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea — initial differentiation of infectious colitis versus inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) relies on stool cultures and duration of diarrhea, and patients with no identified pathogen and/or an illness duration of > 2 weeks are likely to have IBD. Pathogens typically tested for include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile, with additional analysis for Amoeba and Mycobacterium tuberculosis when indicated. The sensitivity of stool cultures in acute diarrhea only ranges from 40% to 80%, infectious agents such as Campylobacter or Clostridium difficile may trigger an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC), and a small number of documented cases of infectious colitis last longer than 30 days.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112MSTY4]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Recommendation 2 — In patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in symptomatic remission, the AGA suggests using fecal calprotectin < 150 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, or normal C-reactive protein (CRP) to rule out active inflammation and avoid routine endoscopic assessment of disease activity (Conditional recommendation, very low to low certainty of evidence). For those who recently achieved symptomatic remission after treatment adjustment in the preceding 1–3 months, fecal calprotectin < 50 μg/g may be preferred over < 150 μg/g to detect endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1), and normal CRP may be less informative; however, if CRP was elevated at the initial flare, normalization may suggest endoscopic improvement (MES 0 or 1).
