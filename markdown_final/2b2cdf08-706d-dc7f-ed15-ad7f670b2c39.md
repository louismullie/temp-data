## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best represents the most common way viruses kill host cells. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that viruses can kill cells in multiple ways and that the "most common" mechanism may vary by context. Then, I should verify which mechanisms are repeatedly emphasized in authoritative reviews and experimental studies. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that evidence and eliminate implausible or less common options. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and state the best-supported answer with caveats about exceptions and latency.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: viruses kill cells via diverse mechanisms, including lysis, apoptosis, and other programmed or nonprogrammed pathways, and the dominant mechanism depends on the virus and host context, so I need to be cautious about claiming a single universal "most common" cause without anchoring to high-quality sources [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify which mechanism is most consistently emphasized across reviews and studies. Multiple authoritative sources converge on programmed cell death, particularly apoptosis, as a principal and evolutionarily conserved host response that viruses both trigger and evade, with caspase activation as a hallmark execution pathway, which supports option I as a leading candidate [^8d965ffa].

> I will now examine apoptosis more closely to ensure I'm not overstating it. Apoptosis is described as a genetically controlled, energy-requiring process with intrinsic mitochondrial and extrinsic receptor pathways that both culminate in caspase activation and orderly cell disassembly; importantly, viruses have evolved extensive strategies to modulate apoptosis, underscoring its centrality in host–virus interactions and its frequent deployment as a cell-killing mechanism during infection [^8d965ffa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the alternatives and see if any are more prevalent. Lytic destruction and membrane dissolution can occur, especially with lytic phages or certain enveloped viruses, but these are typically framed as specific strategies rather than the most common mechanism across diverse viral families, whereas apoptosis is repeatedly described as a widespread host defense and viral target, which weakens options E and H as universal "most common" answers.

> Let me consider energy depletion and transcriptional blockade. While viral replication can impose metabolic stress and some viruses interfere with host transcription, these are generally not cited as the predominant killing mechanism across viral classes, so options C and J appear too narrow or context-specific to be "most common" [^notfound].

> I should double-check DNA-level mechanisms. Fragmentation of cellular DNA and changes to the genetic code can accompany viral infection and cell death, but again, these are not presented as the primary, most frequent mechanism of cell killing across viruses compared with apoptosis, which remains the recurrent theme in reviews and mechanistic studies.

> But wait, what if the question is implicitly about lytic viruses that "explode" cells? Even in lytic contexts, many animal viruses still engage or manipulate apoptotic pathways, and the literature emphasizes apoptosis as a dominant host response that viruses must navigate, reinforcing that apoptosis is the most consistently represented mechanism across virology overviews, even if lysis occurs in specific systems.

> I need to ensure I acknowledge exceptions. Some viruses establish latency with minimal cell death, and others actively inhibit apoptosis to prolong host cell survival for replication, which means that while apoptosis is the most commonly described and evolutionarily central mechanism, it is not universal and can be delayed or blocked depending on the virus and timing.

> Putting this together, the weight of evidence supports apoptosis via caspase activation as the most commonly described and broadly applicable mechanism by which viruses kill host cells, with the caveat that lysis and other pathways occur in specific viral contexts; therefore, the best answer is I. Induces apoptosis via caspases [^948564eb] [^8d965ffa].

The most common way viruses kill cells is by **inducing apoptosis** (programmed cell death) via caspase activation [^c70231d7], which is a rapid, controlled process that limits viral spread and inflammation [^8d965ffa]. While viruses can also cause lysis, necrosis, or metabolic collapse, **apoptosis is the predominant mechanism** across many viral families because it efficiently eliminates infected cells while minimizing tissue damage [^948564eb].

---

## Mechanisms of viral-induced cell death

Viruses use several mechanisms to kill host cells, including:

- **Apoptosis**: Programmed cell death triggered by intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, culminating in caspase activation and orderly cell dismantling [^8d965ffa].
- **Necrosis**: Uncontrolled cell death with rapid membrane rupture and inflammation.
- **Lysis**: Direct destruction of the cell membrane, releasing virions.
- **Metabolic collapse**: Depletion of cellular resources or disruption of essential processes.

Among these, **apoptosis is the most common and evolutionarily conserved** mechanism [^c70231d7].

---

## Apoptosis: the predominant mechanism

Apoptosis is a **highly regulated process** that removes infected cells without damaging surrounding tissue [^8d965ffa]. It proceeds through two main pathways:

- **Intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway**: Triggered by intracellular stress, such as viral infection, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-9 and downstream effector caspases [^1f459519].
- **Extrinsic pathway**: Initiated by death receptor signaling (e.g. TNF, Fas ligand), activating caspase-8 and downstream effector caspases [^8d965ffa].

Both pathways converge on **caspase-3, -6, and -7**, which execute cell death by cleaving structural proteins, activating DNases, and inducing membrane changes that mark cells for phagocytosis [^8d965ffa].

---

## Viral strategies to induce apoptosis

Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to **induce apoptosis**, including:

- **Direct activation of caspases**: Some viruses encode proteins that directly activate caspases or mimic death receptor ligands [^notfound].
- **Disruption of cellular homeostasis**: Viral replication can cause ER stress, DNA damage, or mitochondrial dysfunction, triggering intrinsic apoptosis [^notfound].
- **Immune-mediated apoptosis**: Viral antigens presented on infected cells can trigger cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells to induce apoptosis [^notfound].

---

## Examples of viruses inducing apoptosis

Many viruses **commonly induce apoptosis**, including:

| **Virus family** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of apoptosis induction** |
|-|-|-|
| Retroviridae | HIV | - Intrinsic pathway <br/> - Mitochondrial dysfunction <br/> - Caspase activation [^notfound] |
| Herpesviridae | - HSV <br/> - CMV | - Direct caspase activation <br/> - Immune-mediated killing [^notfound] |
| Adenoviridae | Adenovirus | - Intrinsic pathway <br/> - p53 activation <br/> - Caspase activation [^notfound] |
| Flaviviridae | - Hepatitis C <br/> - Dengue | - ER stress <br/> - Intrinsic pathway <br/> - Caspase activation [^notfound] |
| Coronaviridae | SARS-CoV-2 | - Intrinsic pathway <br/> - Mitochondrial dysfunction <br/> - Caspase activation [^notfound] |

## Advantages of apoptosis for viral spread

Apoptosis offers several advantages for viral spread and persistence:

- **Efficient dissemination**: Apoptotic cells are rapidly cleared by phagocytes, facilitating viral spread to new hosts [^notfound].
- **Immune evasion**: Apoptosis minimizes inflammation, reducing immune detection and clearance [^8d965ffa].
- **Tissue integrity**: Apoptosis preserves tissue architecture, allowing continued viral replication and spread [^8d965ffa].

---

## Alternative mechanisms of cell death

While apoptosis predominates, viruses can also kill cells via:

- **Necrosis**: Rapid membrane rupture and inflammation (e.g. influenza virus) [^notfound].
- **Lysis**: Direct membrane destruction (e.g. bacteriophages, some enveloped viruses) [^33f3d44b].
- **Metabolic collapse**: Depletion of cellular resources or disruption of essential processes (e.g. HIV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction) [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most common way viruses kill cells is by **inducing apoptosis** via caspase activation [^c70231d7]. This programmed cell death is rapid, controlled, and minimizes tissue damage, thereby facilitating viral spread and persistence [^948564eb]. While viruses can also cause necrosis, lysis, or metabolic collapse, apoptosis remains the predominant mechanism across many viral families [^c70231d7].

### SCF (cyclin F)-dependent degradation of CDC6 suppresses DNA re-replication [^68e3f3fd]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Maintenance of genome stability requires that DNA is replicated precisely once per cell cycle. This is believed to be achieved by limiting replication origin licensing and thereby restricting the firing of each replication origin to once per cell cycle. CDC6 is essential for eukaryotic replication origin licensing, however, it is poorly understood how CDC6 activity is constrained in higher eukaryotes. Here we report that the SCF(Cyclin F) ubiquitin ligase complex prevents DNA re-replication by targeting CDC6 for proteasomal degradation late in the cell cycle. We show that CDC6 and Cyclin F interact through defined sequence motifs that promote CDC6 ubiquitylation and degradation. Absence of Cyclin F or expression of a stable mutant of CDC6 promotes re-replication and genome instability in cells lacking the CDT1 inhibitor Geminin. Together, our work reveals a novel SCF(Cyclin F)-mediated mechanism required for precise once per cell cycle replication.

### SCF (cyclin F)-dependent degradation of CDC6 suppresses DNA re-replication [^7a439933]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To ensure replication happens once and only once during the cell cycle, the two steps of replication initiation, origin licensing and firing, are temporarily separated. If inappropriate re-licensing of replication origins occurs from S phase to mitosis, origins may fire more than once within a single cell cycle, which can result in re-replication of DNA. Several overlapping mechanisms prevent re-licensing, however, the regulation of the key licensing protein CDC6 was so far poorly understood in this process. The results presented here reveal that the E3-ligase SCF Cyclin F restrains CDC6 activity to suppress re-replication. Cyclin F accumulates in late stages of the cell cycle, and our data uncover a pronounced interaction with CDC6 at this stage mediated via a specific Cyclin-binding motif. This promotes SCF Cyclin F -dependent degradation of CDC6 thereby safeguarding chromosomal DNA by securing that no sections of DNA are over-replicated. In the absence of Cyclin F, cells critically rely on Geminin and control of CDT1 to suppress re-replication causing genome instability and checkpoint activation. Consistently, the absence of Cyclin F can induce cellular senescence, a tumorigenesis barrier imposed by DNA damage checkpoints. The overlapping mechanisms acting to prevent re-replication ensure that lack of one regulatory pathway is not sufficient to induce re-replication. In agreement with this notion, we found only little induction of re-replication in response to Cyclin F depletion. Co-depletion of Cyclin F together with Geminin, however, induces substantial re-replication, suggesting that the degradation of CDC6 by Cyclin F cooperates with mechanisms that suppress CDT1 activity. It was previously reported that Geminin ablation in itself promotes re-replication. Here, we observe only little re-replication in Geminin-depleted cells, which is likely due to the difference in our experimental setup of the co-depletion experiment, where Cyclin F is depleted 24 h before Geminin. In any case, absence of Cyclin F strongly promotes re-replication in Geminin knockdown cells.

### F-actin architecture determines constraints on myosin thick filament motion [^74c24d7c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Active stresses are generated and transmitted throughout diverse F-actin architectures within the cell cytoskeleton, and drive essential behaviors of the cell, from cell division to migration. However, while the impact of F-actin architecture on the transmission of stress is well studied, the role of architecture on the ab initio generation of stresses remains less understood. Here, we assemble F-actin networks in vitro, whose architectures are varied from branched to bundled through F-actin nucleation via Arp2/3 and the formin mDia1. Within these architectures, we track the motions of embedded myosin thick filaments and connect them to the extent of F-actin network deformation. While mDia1-nucleated networks facilitate the accumulation of stress and drive contractility through enhanced actomyosin sliding, branched networks prevent stress accumulation through the inhibited processivity of thick filaments. The reduction in processivity is due to a decrease in translational and rotational motions constrained by the local density and geometry of F-actin.

### SCF (cyclin F)-dependent degradation of CDC6 suppresses DNA re-replication [^16e1e35e]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Cyclin F suppresses genome instability

Licensing of DNA replication origins by the assembly of pre-RCs is tightly regulated and requires the combined action of CDC6 and CDT1 (refs). Reduction of CDT1 activity by proteasomal degradation or by the CDT1 inhibitor Geminin have been described as mechanisms preventing re-replication by re-licensing of replicated DNA during late cell cycle stages. We analysed whether Cyclin F-mediated degradation of CDC6 is preventing re-replication and analysed the DNA content in cells treated with siRNA targeting Cyclin F. Here, we observed limited re-replication and accumulation of cells with DNA content greater than 4 N in Cyclin F-depleted cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4a, c). These results are consistent with data obtained in several systems, in which the overexpression of CDC6 is not sufficient to induce re-replication. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the notion that CDC6 and CDT1 cooperate in licensing and that several overlapping mechanisms exist to prevent re-replication. We therefore hypothesized that the degradation of CDC6 by Cyclin F cooperates with mechanisms that suppress CDT1 activity. Indeed, depletion of both Cyclin F and the CDT1 inhibitor Geminin caused substantial re-replication as manifested by a proportion of cells with DNA content greater than 4 N (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 4a, c). We further analysed DNA re-replication at intermediate times after siRNA-induced depletion of Cyclin F and/or Geminin (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c) and consistently found substantially more cells with DNA content > 4 N in cells co-depleted for Cyclin F and Geminin as compared with Geminin depletion alone (Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting that Cyclin F is important for suppressing re-replication when CDT1 activity is high. Re-replication leads to genomic instability as evidenced by the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and these DNA lesions activate ataxia-telangiectasia mutated checkpoint pathways. We therefore measured DNA DSB formation and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated-dependent DNA damage checkpoint activation in siRNA-treated cells. Depletion of Cyclin F or Geminin alone did not lead to marked DNA DSBs and DNA damage checkpoint activation (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4d). However, combined depletion of both Cyclin F and Geminin lead to marked formation of DSBs and the activation of DNA damage checkpoints (Fig. 4b, c and Supplementary Fig. 4d). These data further highlight that Geminin and Cyclin F cooperate in maintaining genome integrity, through joint suppression of the major licensing factors CDC6 and CDT1. Notably, siRNA depletion of Geminin in cells expressing the dl93–100 mutant, but not WT CDC6, caused a marked activation of DNA damage checkpoint signalling and re-replication (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 5a). In comparison to previous reports, we observed rather limited re-replication in Geminin-depleted cells. We hypothesized that the underlying reason for the observed difference may be a consequence of our experimental setup of the co-depletion experiment, where cells are first depleted with Cyclin F and control siRNA, respectively, and 24 h later with Geminin and control siRNA, respectively. To test whether this is indeed the case, we depleted Geminin in U2OS cells stably expressing V5-tagged LacZ, WT CDC6 or the stable dl93–100 mutant CDC6, respectively. Under these conditions, we found that Geminin depletion in cells expressing LacZ and WT CDC6 leads to re-replication similar to previous studies when Geminin was depleted in U2OS cells(Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, Geminin depletion in cells expressing the stable dl93–100 mutant CDC6 caused a dramatic increase in re-replication as compared with Geminin depletion in cells expressing LacZ and WT CDC6, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Together, these data suggest that Cyclin F prevents re-replication and genome instability by targeting CDC6 for degradation. We further analysed the biological significance of the checkpoint response in the absence of Cyclin F as observed in Fig. 4b–d. Cellular senescence is a tumorigenesis barrier imposed by DNA damage checkpointsand we therefore speculated that the absence of Cyclin F in cells with aberrant CDT1 activity would lead to cellular senescence. Indeed, we observed induction of cellular senescence in TIG-3 human fibroblasts depleted for Cyclin F and Geminin as evidenced by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4e).

### F-actin-rich contractile endothelial pores prevent vascular leakage during leukocyte diapedesis through local rhoA signalling [^c0211538]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have discovered that local RhoA-mediated F-actin rings in the endothelial lining prevent vascular leakage during leukocyte diapedesis. Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of barrier maintenance during leukocyte diapedesis may have implications for the development of new therapies to restore normal homeostatic junctional remodelling to counteract vascular dysfunction during chronic inflammation.

### Francisella tularensis induces cytopathogenicity and apoptosis in murine macrophages via a mechanism that requires intracellular bacterial multiplication [^436cb6a9]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

The murine macrophage-like cell line J774. A1 ingests and allows intracellular growth of Francisella tularensis. We demonstrate that, after 24 h of infection, a pronounced cytopathogenicity resulted and the J774 cells were undergoing apoptosis. Despite this host cell apoptosis, no decrease in bacterial numbers was observed. When internalization of bacteria was prevented or intracellularly located F. tularensis bacteria were eradicated within 12 h, the progression of host cell cytopathogenicity and apoptosis was prevented.

### High-throughput synaptic connectivity mapping using in vivo two-photon holographic optogenetics and compressive sensing [^2c121760]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Source Data

Recording from opsin-negative neurons prevented the generation of photocurrent from direct opsin activation (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Holding the membrane potential at −70 mV (the reversal potential of inhibitory conductance) focused our acquisition on connections between putative excitatory neurons and also prevented spikes in the patched cell, thereby avoiding confounding individual postsynaptic inputs.

We extracted the coordinates of the opsin-positive neurons (N) surrounding the patched cell to define a set of potential presynaptic cells. Accordingly, we designed a stimulation procedure consisting of a number of measurements (M), each corresponding to a stimulation with a distinct holographic light pattern illuminating F targets: for sequential connectivity mapping, M = N and F = 1; for parallel mapping, M ≤ N and F > 1 (typically with F = 5–10; Supplementary Table 6 and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

### CD69 prevents PLZFinnate precursors from prematurely exiting the thymus and aborting NKT2 cell differentiation [^e9ebd3c7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Loss of S1P 1 expression rescues NKT2 cell differentiation

Since CD69 prevents the cell-surface expression of S1P 1, which signals thymic egress, we next examined whether S1P 1 deficiency in Cd69 –/– mice prevented early thymic egress of CD24 + PLZF hi innate precursors and restored NKT2 cell differentiation in the Cd69 –/– thymus. To do so, we crossed Cd69 –/– mice with S1pr1 f/f Cd4 -Cre transgenic (Tg) mice (hereafter known as " Cd69 –/– S1pr1 –/– " mice). In contrast to its significant effect of S1P 1 deficiency on retaining CD4SP and CD8SP cells in the Cd69 –/– thymus (Supplementary Fig. 6a), S1P 1 deficiency only slightly increased the total frequency of CD69-deficient iNKT cells in the thymus (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Notably, the increased frequency of iNKT cells was mainly due to NKT2 cells, since the NKT2 cell frequency in the thymus was most significantly increased (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the NKT2 cell frequency was significantly increased in the thymus of Cd69 Tg mice, in which the S1P 1 surface expression was completely prevented(Supplementary Fig. 6b). These data suggest that S1P 1 deficiency preferentially impacts NKT2 cells.

The role of restriction nucleases during phage infections

Phages may use two alternative strategies to infect bacterial cells. Lysogenic phages integrate their genome into the bacterial chromosome and replicate without lysing the host. In contrast, lytic phages destroy the host cell to release hundreds of new phages that can infect nearby bacteria. Lytic infections, the focus of this work, are usually described by means of qualitative models that represent the key discrete events of the infection (Fig. 1). Although these models are useful to describe the interactions between phages and their hosts, they are insufficient to fully understand the progression of phage infections inside bacterial cells. The fate of the host cell depends on the balance between the effectiveness of its immune mechanisms and the ability of the phage to subvert those mechanisms. However, from the conceptual model shown in Fig. 1 it is impossible to deduce in what circumstances lytic phages prevail over the host's immune defenses or how infected cells decide when they must resort to suicide.

Fig. 1
Standard representation of the role of nucleases in lytic infections.

A In the absence of infection, the bacterial cell is free from viral DNA and may display basal levels of restriction nucleases capable of cleaving non-self DNA. B In case of infection, the host detects the presence of phage DNA and triggers an innate immune response that includes the upregulation of restriction nucleases. C The balance between the replication of the viral DNA and its destruction by bacterial nucleases determines the eventual outcome of the infection. D If the phage evades the host's immune response, the bacterial cell dies and releases the newly formed phages to the extracellular space. E Alternatively, the infected cell may undergo suicide to prevent the spread of the infection. F If the host cell survives, it must deactivate its anti-phage defenses and return to the pre-infection state, which involves the downregulation of the nucleases produced during the infection and also the clearance of the remnants of viral DNA from the cytoplasm.

### LIMK (LIM kinase) inhibition prevents vasoconstriction-and hypertension-induced arterial stiffening and remodeling [^a8941363]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Increased arterial stiffness and vascular remodeling precede and are consequences of hypertension. They also contribute to the development and progression of life-threatening cardiovascular diseases. Yet, there are currently no agents specifically aimed at preventing or treating arterial stiffening and remodeling. Previous research indicates that vascular smooth muscle actin polymerization participates in the initial stages of arterial stiffening and remodeling and that LIMK (LIM kinase) promotes F-actin formation and stabilization via cofilin phosphorylation and consequent inactivation. Herein, we hypothesize that LIMK inhibition is able to prevent vasoconstriction- and hypertension-associated arterial stiffening and inward remodeling. We found that small visceral arteries isolated from hypertensive subjects are stiffer and have greater cofilin phosphorylation than those from nonhypertensives. We also show that LIMK inhibition prevents arterial stiffening and inward remodeling in isolated human small visceral arteries exposed to prolonged vasoconstriction. Using cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, we determined that LIMK inhibition prevents vasoconstrictor agonists from increasing cofilin phosphorylation, F-actin volume, and cell cortex stiffness. We further show that localized LIMK inhibition prevents arteriolar inward remodeling in hypertensive mice. This indicates that hypertension is associated with increased vascular smooth muscle cofilin phosphorylation, cytoskeletal stress fiber formation, and heightened arterial stiffness. Our data further suggest that pharmacological inhibition of LIMK prevents vasoconstriction-induced arterial stiffening, in part, via reductions in vascular smooth muscle F-actin content and cellular stiffness. Accordingly, LIMK inhibition should represent a promising therapeutic means to stop the progression of arterial stiffening and remodeling in hypertension.

### Junction-based lamellipodia drive endothelial cell rearrangements in vivo via a VE-cadherin-F-actin based oscillatory cell-cell interaction [^c2bd06cb]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling are driven by extensive endothelial cell movements. Here, we present in vivo evidence that endothelial cell movements are associated with oscillating lamellipodia-like structures, which emerge from cell junctions in the direction of cell movements. High-resolution time-lapse imaging of these junction-based lamellipodia (JBL) shows dynamic and distinct deployment of junctional proteins, such as F-actin, VE-cadherin and ZO1, during JBL oscillations. Upon initiation, F-actin and VE-cadherin are broadly distributed within JBL, whereas ZO1 remains at cell junctions. Subsequently, a new junction is formed at the front of the JBL, which then merges with the proximal junction. Rac1 inhibition interferes with JBL oscillations and disrupts cell elongation-similar to a truncation in ve-cadherin preventing VE-cad/F-actin interaction. Taken together, our observations suggest an oscillating ratchet-like mechanism, which is used by endothelial cells to move over each other and thus provides the physical means for cell rearrangements.

### Complementation of the fadA mutation in Fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates that the surface-exposed adhesin promotes cellular invasion and placental colonization [^aee3b08c]. Infection and Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

Fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative oral anaerobe implicated in periodontal disease and adverse pregnancy outcome. The organism colonizes the mouse placenta, causing localized infection and inflammation. The mechanism of placental colonization has not been elucidated. Previous studies identified a novel adhesin from F. nucleatum, FadA, as being involved in the attachment and invasion of host cells. The fadA deletion mutant F. nucleatum 12230 US1 was defective in host cell attachment and invasion in vitro, but it also exhibited pleiotropic effects with altered cell morphology and growth rate. In this study, a fadA-complementing clone, F. nucleatum 12230 USF81, was constructed. The expression of FadA on USF81 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescent labeling. USF81 restored host cell attachment and invasion activities. The ability of F. nucleatum 12230, US1, and USF81 to colonize the mouse placenta was examined. US1 was severely defective in placental colonization compared to the wild type and USF81. Thus, FadA plays an important role in F. nucleatum colonization in vivo. These results also represent the first complementation studies for F. nucleatum. FadA may be a therapeutic target for preventing F. nucleatum colonization of the host.

### Microscale geometrical modulation of PIEZO1 mediated mechanosensing through cytoskeletal redistribution [^03536823]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Besides the geometrical modulation on the tension, our study exposes the critical role that F-actin plays as a physical constriction to the lipid bilayer membrane during cellular aspiration. Our findings suggest that the redistribution of F-actin in response to mechanical force is not merely passive but is intricately dependent on the force magnitude (Fig. 5b–e). Notably, we observed a concurrent movement of F-actin and PIEZO1 from the cell body to the aspirated cell tongue, with higher co-localization in suspended cells compared to adhered cells (Fig. 7). This redistribution of F-actin, and the subsequent enhanced PIEZO1 activity, may act as a self-preservation mechanism for cells under increased mechanical stress. Our observations imply that the local constriction from F-actin accumulation aids the cell in maintaining membrane integrity under high tension conditions (c.f. Fig. S6a, b), and this F-actin binding to the lipid bilayer may halt membrane tension propagation from the force application site. This could prevent the dissipation of membrane tension in the aspirated tongue and thus allow an exaggerated Ca 2+ influx in the tongue.

In adhered cells, well-developed focal adhesions might immobilize a proportion of F-actin filaments, prohibiting them from being drawn into the micropipette and thereby suppressing Ca 2+ influx at the tongue. Such dynamic interplay between F-actin and PIEZO1 activity is likely more pronounced in suspended cells. Our observation of PIEZO1 dynamics during aspiration illustrates that PIEZO1 moves into the micropipette independent from F-actin dynamics. Together with the patch-clamp results, it is indicated that one key response of F-actin to mechanical stretch is the amplification of the activity of mechanosensitive ion channels after accumulation at the neck (Fig. 6i). Previous research has suggested that F-actin polymerization in adhered cells functions as a protective mechanism for PIEZO1 gating. Extending upon this, our findings underscore the importance of the state of the cell and the site of polymerization. F-actin accumulation at the aspirated neck was found to enhance PIEZO1 gating surprisingly (Fig. 8), suggesting two critical roles: 1) providing mechanical support to prevent membrane rupture, and 2) serving as a physical constriction to the lipid bilayer, which is integral in modulating Ca 2+ influx at the aspirated cell tongue.

### F (ab)' 2-mediated neutralization of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins: a novel effector function of immunoglobulins [^18ce5922]. Nature Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prevents immune damage by scavenging complement fragments C3b and C4b. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous immunoglobulin molecules also bind anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, thereby neutralizing their pro-inflammatory effects. Single-cell calcium measurements in HMC-1 human mast cells showed that a rise in intracellular calcium caused by C3a and C5a was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by IVIG, F(ab)2-IVIG and irrelevant human monoclonal antibody. C3a- and C5a-induced thromboxane (TXB2) generation and histamine release from HMC-1 cells and whole-blood basophils were also suppressed by exogenous immunoglobulins. In a mouse model of asthma, immunoglobulin treatment reduced cellular migration to the lung. Lethal C5a-mediated circulatory collapse in pigs was prevented by pretreatment with F(ab)2-IVIG. Molecular modeling, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and western blot analyses suggested a physical association between anaphylatoxins and the constant region of F(ab)2. This binding could interfere with the role of C3a and C5a in inflammation.

### American Society of Transplantation and cellular therapy series: # 8-management and prevention of non-aspergillus molds in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients [^9a5c1de5]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Fusariosis — management and prognosis include the following points: outcomes were similar for voriconazole and L-AMB but mortality was higher with deoxycholate amphotericin B; posaconazole is not recommended as first-line treatment, though it is considered a limited rescue therapy (success rates < 20%) in persistent neutropenia; combination triazoles with L-AMB or terbinafine are recommended by guidelines but evidence for superior benefit is limited; surgical debridement of localized infection is usually recommended to prevent dissemination and improve outcome, whereas debridement of multiple cutaneous lesions is not recommended, and if an intravascular catheter is the clear source of fungemia, it should be removed; delayed diagnosis and/or receipt of glucocorticoids have been associated with poor prognosis, with reports of better prognosis for localized skin lesions and worse for pulmonary or disseminated IF; mortality rate remains high at 60% to 70%, and mortality might be higher with F. solani and Fusarium proliferatum compared to other species.

### A p27Kip1 mutant that does not inhibit CDK activity promotes centrosome amplification and micronucleation [^b1861fde]. Oncogene (2012). Low credibility.

Mitotic catastrophe occurs when cells enter mitosis with damaged DNA or excess centrosomes. Cells overexpressing the centrosome protein CP110 or depleted of cyclin F, which targets CP110 for destruction, have more than two centrosomes and undergo mitotic catastrophe. Our studies show centrosome reduplication and mitotic catastrophe in osteosarcoma cells inducibly expressing a p27Kip1 mutant (termed p27K) that binds cyclins but not cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). p27K inhibited cell proliferation but not CDK activity or cell cycle progression. It did not induce apoptosis; however, cells expressing p27K had more than two centrosomes and, indicative of mitotic catastrophe, irregularly shaped nuclei or multiple micronuclei. p27K interacted with cyclin F in vivo (as did endogenous p27Kip1) and displaced cyclin F from CP110. Depletion of CP110 rescued p27K-expressing cells from centrosome reduplication and mitotic catastrophe. Collectively, our data show that p27Kip1 can perturb mitosis and suggest that it does so by sequestering cyclin F, which prevents its interaction with and the subsequent degradation of CP110, ultimately resulting in centrosome reduplication, mitotic catastrophe and abrogation of cell proliferation.

To pinpoint the time at which Prmt5 was required during activation, we stimulated splenic B cells from Prmt5 F/F CD19-cre mice ex vivo with LPS and IL-4. Cell enumeration and cell division tracking dye showed reduced proliferation of Prmt5-deficient B cells (Fig. 3a). These Prmt5-null B cells had normal cell cycle profile (Fig. 3b) but significantly increased cell death, which was inversely correlated to Prmt5 levels (Fig. 3c, d). To test whether B cell survival depended on the catalytic activity of Prmt5, we treated wt B cells with the PRMT5-specific inhibitor EPZ015666 (EPZ), which reduced sDMA in cell extracts (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Inhibition of Prmt5 24 h prior to activation increased cell death and reduced cell numbers after activation in an EPZ dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 2B). In contrast, adding EPZ simultaneously with LPS and IL-4 reduced proliferation but did not increase apoptosis compared to control (Supplementary Fig. 2C). This difference suggested that the anti-apoptotic function of Prmt5 was mediated by factors that were pre-methylated in resting B cells. To confirm this, we produced Prmt5 F/F Cγ1-cre mice, which express the Cre-recombinase only after B cell activation. We reasoned that the presence of the sDMA at the time of activation in Prmt5 F/F Cγ1-cre B cells might prevent the apoptosis seen in the sDMA-depleted Prmt5 F/F CD19-cre B cells. Indeed, stimulated Prmt5 F/F Cγ1-cre B cells showed efficient Prmt5 depletion without any increase in apoptosis compared to control cells (Fig. 3e). We conclude that Prmt5 functions to protect B cells from apoptosis at the time of activation.

### Identification of an anti-inflammatory protein from faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium deficient in Crohn's disease [^52bf8ec9]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD)-associated dysbiosis is characterised by a loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whose culture supernatant exerts an anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo. However, the chemical nature of the anti-inflammatory compounds has not yet been determined.

Methods

Peptidomic analysis using mass spectrometry was applied to F. prausnitzii supernatant. Anti-inflammatory effects of identified peptides were tested in vitro directly on intestinal epithelial cell lines and on cell lines transfected with a plasmid construction coding for the candidate protein encompassing these peptides. In vivo, the cDNA of the candidate protein was delivered to the gut by recombinant lactic acid bacteria to prevent dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS)-colitis in mice.

Results

The seven peptides, identified in the F. prausnitzii culture supernatants, derived from a single microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM), a protein of 15kDa, and comprising 53% of non-polar residues. This last feature prevented the direct characterisation of the putative anti-inflammatory activity of MAM-derived peptides. Transfection of MAM cDNA in epithelial cells led to a significant decrease in the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway with a dose-dependent effect. Finally, the use of a food-grade bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, delivering a plasmid encoding MAM was able to alleviate DNBS-induced colitis in mice.

Conclusions

A 15kDa protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit the NF-κB pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.

### The adaptor protein crk controls activation and inhibition of natural killer cells [^14ddf56d]. Immunity (2012). Low credibility.

Natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptors recruit tyrosine phosphatases to prevent activation, induce phosphorylation and dissociation of the small adaptor Crk from cytoskeleton scaffold complexes, and maintain NK cells in a state of responsiveness to subsequent activation events. How Crk contributes to inhibition is unknown. We imaged primary NK cells over lipid bilayers carrying IgG1 Fc to stimulate CD16 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E to inhibit through receptor CD94-NKG2A. HLA-E alone induced Crk phosphorylation in NKG2A(+) NK cells. At activating synapses with Fc alone, Crk was required for the movement of Fc microclusters and their ability to trigger activation signals. At inhibitory synapses, HLA-E promoted central accumulation of both Fc and phosphorylated Crk and blocked the Fc-induced buildup of F-actin. We propose a unified model for inhibitory receptor function: Crk phosphorylation prevents essential Crk-dependent activation signals and blocks F-actin network formation, thereby reducing constraints on subsequent engagement of activation receptors.

### Cyclin F suppresses B-myb activity to promote cell cycle checkpoint control [^dd79ef2a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Cells respond to DNA damage by activating cell cycle checkpoints to delay proliferation and facilitate DNA repair. Here, to uncover new checkpoint regulators, we perform RNA interference screening targeting genes involved in ubiquitylation processes. We show that the F-box protein cyclin F plays an important role in checkpoint control following ionizing radiation. Cyclin F-depleted cells initiate checkpoint signalling after ionizing radiation, but fail to maintain G2 phase arrest and progress into mitosis prematurely. Importantly, cyclin F suppresses the B-Myb-driven transcriptional programme that promotes accumulation of crucial mitosis-promoting proteins. Cyclin F interacts with B-Myb via the cyclin box domain. This interaction is important to suppress cyclin A-mediated phosphorylation of B-Myb, a key step in B-Myb activation. In summary, we uncover a regulatory mechanism linking the F-box protein cyclin F with suppression of the B-Myb/cyclin A pathway to ensure a DNA damage-induced checkpoint response in G2.

### A fate worse than death: apoptosis as an oncogenic process [^fb2de23e]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2016). Medium credibility.

Apoptotic cell death is widely considered a positive process that both prevents and treats cancer. Although undoubtedly having a beneficial role, paradoxically, apoptosis can also cause unwanted effects that may even promote cancer. In this Opinion article we highlight some of the ways by which apoptosis can exert oncogenic functions. We argue that fully understanding this dark side will be required to optimally engage apoptosis, thereby maximizing tumour cell kill while minimizing unwanted pro-tumorigenic effects.

### Setd2 supports GATA3ST2thymic-derived treg cells and suppresses intestinal inflammation [^f2f9de82]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Next, we purified splenic Treg cells from Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f and control mice and transferred them to Rag2 –/– hosts (Fig. 2d). We confirmed that the purity of Treg cells from both genotypes were comparable and higher than 99% (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Interestingly, Setd2-deficient Treg cells showed decreased reconstitution in the intestine but not in the spleen (Fig. 2e). Some Treg cells lost Foxp3 expression in immunodeficient hosts and the percentage of Treg cells converted to Foxp3 – cells (exTreg) was higher in the absence of Setd2 (Fig. 2f). The data suggest that Setd2 prevents fate conversion of Treg cells during homeostatic expansion. Nevertheless, the numbers of T cells with Treg and exTreg cells added up together were still fewer in the intestine of Rag2 –/– hosts transferred with Setd2-deficient Treg cells (Fig. 2g). This indicates that Setd2-deficient donor cells, with Treg and exTreg cells, added up, have defective maintenance in Rag2 –/– mice. This led us to think that there might be other mechanisms in addition to preventing fate conversion that mediates Setd2-supported Treg maintenance. T cells were expected to undergo homeostatic expansion in immunodeficient mice. Thus, defective Treg maintenance in the absence of Setd2 might occur during proliferation and activation. To test this idea, we treated Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice with IL-2-α-IL-2 complex (IL-2c), which favors the expansion of Treg over Tconv cells. Strikingly, we found that both splenic and intestinal Setd2-deficient Treg cells expanded less in response to IL-2 than control Treg cells, as demonstrated by the percentages and absolute numbers of Treg cells (Fig. 2h–k). This result was unlikely due to reduced proliferation since the percentage of Ki67 + cells was not decreased in Treg cells from Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). Rather, the proliferative rate of Treg cells was higher in splenic and intestinal Treg cells of PBS treated Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice, possibly as a consequence of the proinflammatory environment (Supplementary Fig. 2e, f). In addition, cleaved Caspase 3 + cells (apoptotic cells) among Treg cells were increased in both the spleen and intestine of Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice with or without IL-2c treatment (Fig. 2l, m). Furthermore, blockade of cell apoptosis and necrosis by treatment with z-VAD-FMK and necrostatin-1 partially rescued the curtailed expansion of Setd2-deficient Treg cells in response to IL-2c treatment (Fig. 2n, o). The data collectively suggest that Setd2 is essential for Treg homeostatic expansion by preventing cell death.

### Nuclear deformability increases PARPi sensitivity in BRCA1-deficient cells by increasing microtubule-dependent DNA break mobility [^1fd9b987]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Lamin-A/C but not Lamin-B1 prevents invaginations and one-ended DSB mobility and mis-repair

To determine whether nuclear invaginations or intrinsic nuclear deformability could influence DSB repair in BRCA1-deficient cells, we investigated the effect of alterations in the viscoelastic properties of the nucleus on the mobility and repair of DSBs. To this end, we decided to compromise the nuclear lamin network. In fact, while the sporadic NE invaginations in untreated cells are enriched for both Lamin-A/C and Lamin-B1 (Fig. 2a), Lamin-A is known to be the main contributor to NE stiffness while Lamin-B1 is mostly involved in the preservation of NE integrity. To compare the effect of Lamin-A and Lamin-B1 deficiency on DSBs mobility and mis-repair in PARPi-treated BRCA1-deficient cells, we derived immortalized Brca1 F/F Lmna −/− MEFs litter mates to Brca1 F/F Lmna +/+ MEFs or we used two specific shRNAs to target LmnB1 gene expression (Fig. 2b, c). Consistent with previous analysis. Lmna deletion did not affect cell survival and Lamin A/C-deficient nuclei showed aberrant Lamin-B1 organization and higher levels of invagination, but no blebs/herniations, compared to the control cells (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). In contrast, Lamin-B1 depletion caused a significant increase in blebs/herniations, but not in invaginations (Fig. 2d, f), confirming that, while both Lamin-A and Lamin-B1 control NE structure, their functions are different, and invaginations are specifically prevented by Lamin-A. Furthermore, Lmna deletion, but not Lamin-B1 depletion, caused higher mobility of the DSBs induced by PARPi in BRCA1-deficient cells (Fig. 2g–i, and Supplementary Fig. 2d–h), similar to previous data obtained after DSBs induction with etoposide, indicating that the Lamin-A network, but not Lamin-B1, prevents DSBs mobility by increasing NE rigidity. This increase in DSB hyper mobility in the absence of Lamin-A was strongly, although not completely, reduced by taxol treatment (Fig. 2g, h and Supplementary Fig. 2d–f), indicating that dynamic microtubules are the main, but perhaps not the only, cytoskeleton force responsible for DSBs mobility in the absence of Lamin-A/C.

Cobinamide prevents smooth muscle cell apoptosis in the aortas of Fbn1 C1041G/+ mice

A decrease in the number of aortic VSMCs with an increase in VSMC apoptosis are also characteristic of MFS. We found about a 50% reduction in the number of aortic VSMCs and twice as many apoptotic VSMCs in the ascending aortas of Fbn1 C1041G/+ mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E). Males and females showed a similar reduction in smooth muscle cell number, but only in females did the increase in apoptotic cells reach significance (Figures 2C and 2F). Cobinamide maintained a normal number of VSMCs and prevented the increase in apoptosis in the mutant mice (Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2E), and reduced apoptosis in both sexes (Figures 2C and 2F).

### Strategies and efforts in circumventing the emergence of antiviral resistance against conventional antivirals [^59dc0237]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Types of antivirals and their mechanisms of action.

The various steps of the viral life cycle targeted by DAAs (purple) and HTAs (orange) are shown. A Viral binding inhibitors bind to viral glycoproteins, preventing them from binding host receptors, while host binding inhibitors act as host receptor antagonists, preventing their binding with viral glycoproteins required for viral entry. B Viral fusion inhibitors bind and disrupt the conformations of viral proteins responsible for mediating fusion between host and viral membranes. C Viral uncoating inhibitors bind to and interfere with viral proteins such as capsid or ion channels preventing capsid disassembly or endosomal acidification required for release of viral genome. D Viral nucleoside inhibitors bind to reverse transcriptases or polymerases and either cause chain termination or incorporation of a mutagen that drives a virus towards error catastrophe. E Host nucleotide depletion deprives viruses of purines and pyrimidines needed for genome replication. F Viral integrase strand transfer inhibitors bind to viral integrase active sites and displace viral DNA, preventing proviral incorporation into host genomes. G Host nuclear export disruption prevents the export of viral genomes and ribonucleoproteins out of the nucleus to their assembly site. H Host immune stimulants place host cells in an antiviral state by activating the expression of genes with antiviral activity against various steps of the viral life cycle. I Post-translational modifications are crucial for several viral proteins to function. HTAs that prevent such modifications could render these proteins non-functional, inhibiting the viral replication cycle at several different stages. J Viral assembly inhibitors interact with viral proteins, preventing their oligomerisation required for viral particle assembly. K An inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the function of a viral protein with multiple roles in the viral life cycle could simultaneously disrupt multiple stages at once. L Viral protease inhibitors bind to viral proteases and prevent the cleaving of viral polyproteins into functional proteins. M Viral egress inhibitors bind viral proteins required to separate the membranes of the host and new virions, thus preventing the budding of progeny viral particles from the host.

### Setd2 supports GATA3ST2thymic-derived treg cells and suppresses intestinal inflammation [^152effd0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The intestine harbors food antigens and trillions of microbiota that induces highly activated Tconv cells, which need to be controlled by Treg cells to prevent autoimmunity even under a steady state. We initially observed a reduction in the percentage of Treg cells in the GALTs but not in SLOs or other analyzed tissues. Interestingly, while Setd2 supports ST2 + tTreg cells in both the intestine and other analyzed peripheral tissues, the decrease of GATA3 + tTreg cells was observed in the large intestine but not in the fat, lung, or liver of Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice. This may suggest that IL-33-supported ST2 + GATA3 + tTreg cells homeostasis dependent on Setd2 is more prominent in the intestine than in other organs under a steady state.

The Treg cells that are responsible for inhibiting specific CD4 + conventional T responses seem to share expression of the same transcription factors, likely due to spatial proximity and/or competition for survival factors. We showed that Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice had decreased GATA3 + tTreg cells. Moreover, we found that Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice had enhanced IL-17 production by Treg cells and increased intestinal Th2 responses, as was similarly observed in Foxp3 Cre-YFP Gata3 f/f mice in previous studies –. Therefore, GATA3 deficiency in Treg cells of Foxp3 Cre-YFP Setd2 f/f mice possibly contributes to their reduced ability to inhibit Th2 responses. We showed that Setd2-deficient Treg cells had increased fate conversion in CD45RB high T cell-induced colitis and during homeostatic expansion in Rag2 –/– mice. Previous studies indicate that GATA3 and ST2 are important for the maintenance of Treg stability during inflammation. Therefore, it is likely that Setd2 prevents the fate conversion of Treg cells under inflammatory conditions by sustaining GATA3 and ST2. We also found that Setd2-deficient Treg cells had increased apoptosis, and blocking cell death partially rescued defective expansion of Setd2-deficient Treg cells in response to IL-2. So far, not much evidence supports the theory that GATA3 or ST2 could promote Treg survival. We speculate that Setd2 may support the survival of Treg cells through GATA3/ST2-independent mechanisms.

### Chemical disinfectants | Infection control… [^08b5e13d]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Mode of Action The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of water. Ethyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%–80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses and many hydrophilic viruses. Mode of Action The exact mechanism by which free chlorine destroys microorganisms has not been elucidated.

Inactivation by chlorine can result from a number of factors: oxidation of sulfhydryl enzymes and amino acids; ring chlorination of amino acids; loss of intracellular contents; decreased uptake of nutrients; inhibition of protein synthesis; decreased oxygen uptake; oxidation of respiratory components; decreased adenosine triphosphate production; breaks in DNA; and depressed DNA synthesis 329, 347. The actual microbicidal mechanism of chlorine might involve a combination of these factors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites
347. Mode of Action Formaldehyde inactivates microorganisms by alkylating the amino and sulfhydral groups of proteins and ring nitrogen atoms of purine bases 376. Mode of Action The biocidal activity of glutaraldehyde results from its alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganisms, which alters RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. The mechanism of action of glutaraldehydes are reviewed extensively elsewhere 592, 593.

Microbicidal Activity The in vitro inactivation of microorganisms by glutaraldehydes has been extensively investigated and reviewed. Mode of Action Hydrogen peroxide works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other essential cell components. Catalase, produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes that possess cytochrome systems, can protect cells from metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide by degrading hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection 653, 654. Microbicidal Activity Hydrogen peroxide is active against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, viruses, and spores.

### Rapamycin inhibits F-actin reorganization and phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins [^7feb6bc4]. Oncogene (2008). Low credibility.

An early event of cell migration is characterized as the rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, we have demonstrated that rapamycin inhibits tumor cell motility. To understand the underlying mechanism, this study was set to determine whether rapamycin inhibition of cell motility is related to its prevention of F-actin reorganization. We found that rapamycin prevented type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I)-stimulated F-actin reorganization in human rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30), Ewing sarcoma (Rh1), glioblastoma (U-373) and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cells, and concurrently inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin and p130(Cas) in the cells. The effect of rapamycin was blocked by expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR (mTORrr), but not a kinase-dead mTORrr. Downregulation of raptor mimicked the effect of rapamycin. Cells infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing constitutively active and rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) conferred to resistance to rapamycin. Further, IGF-I failed to stimulate F-actin reorganization and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins in the S6K1-downregulated cells. Expression of constitutively hypophosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1-5A) inhibited IGF-I-stimulated F-actin reorganization, but did not alter the cellular protein or phosphorylation levels of the focal adhesion proteins. The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits IGF-I-induced F-actin reorganization and phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins by disruption of mTOR-raptor complex. Both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways, mediated by the mTOR-raptor complex, are involved in the regulation of IGF-I-stimulated F-actin reorganization, but only the former controls IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins.

### A mitotic chromatin phase transition prevents perforation by microtubules [^c4fbd51c]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

We next investigated whether chromatin fragments generated in interphase nuclei undergo a solubility phase transition after progression to mitosis. To monitor cell cycle stages, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor for a key mitotic kinase, aurora B. As chromosome fragmentation blocks mitotic entry owing to DNA damage signalling, we applied chemical inhibitors to induce an interphase-to-mitosis transition. We first synchronized cells to G2 using the cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibitor RO3306 and then induced a mitosis-like state by removing RO3306 for CDK1 activation and simultaneously inhibiting counteracting protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) using okadaic acid. Mitotic entry was demonstrated by the aurora B FRET biosensor signal (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b and Supplementary Video 6). Injection of AluI into G2 cell nuclei resulted in homogeneously distributed chromatin, consistent with a soluble state; furthermore, after induction of mitosis, chromatin fragments formed spherical condensates that were as dense as intact chromosomes (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d and Supplementary Video 7), whereas control cells in which RO3306 was not replaced by Okadaic acid maintained homogeneously dissolved chromatin fragments (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f). These observations support a model in which a global reduction in solubility drives chromatin compaction at the interphase-to-mitosis transition.

### VWF protects FVIII from endocytosis by dendritic cells and subsequent presentation to immune effectors [^9671540f]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a chaperone molecule for procoagulant factor VIII (FVIII). Its role in the reduction of the immunogenicity of therapeutic FVIII in patients with hemophilia A has been evoked but lacks clear cellular and molecular rationale. Here, we demonstrate that VWF protects FVIII from being endocytosed by human dendritic cells (DCs) and subsequently presented to FVIII-specific T cells. The immunoprotective effect of VWF requires a physical interaction with FVIII because the endocytosis of FVIII was significantly restored on hindering the formation of the VWF-FVIII complex. Interestingly, VWF had no direct inhibitory effect either on the ability of DCs to present antigenic peptides or on the activation potency of CD4+ T cells. We thus propose that VWF may reduce the immunogenicity of FVIII by preventing, upstream from the activation of immune effectors, the entry of FVIII in professional antigen-presenting cells.

### Hfe acts in hepatocytes to prevent hemochromatosis [^94d4b430]. Cell Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a prevalent, potentially fatal disorder of iron metabolism hallmarked by intestinal hyperabsorption of iron, hyperferremia, and hepatic iron overload. In both humans and mice, type I HH is associated with mutations in the broadly expressed HFE/Hfe gene. To identify where Hfe acts to prevent HH, we generated mice with tissue-specific Hfe ablations. This work demonstrates that local Hfe expression in hepatocytes serves to maintain physiological iron homeostasis, answering a long-standing question in medicine and explaining earlier clinical observations.

### Epigenetics, health, and disease | Genomics and your health… [^3a1b65c9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Gene expression refers to the process of making proteins using the instructions from genes. A person's DNA includes many genes. Each gene includes instructions for making proteins. Additionally, there are other sections of DNA that are not part of any gene but are important for making sure the genes work properly. These DNA sections provide directions about where in the body the protein is made, when it is made, and how much is made. While changes to the genes can change the protein that is made, epigenetic changes affect gene expression to turn genes "on" and "off. " This can mean that genes make proteins in cells and tissues where or when they normally would not, or that genes don't make proteins where and when they normally would. It can also mean that genes make more or less of a protein than they normally would. There are several ways an environmental factor can cause an epigenetic change to occur. One of the most common ways is by causing changes to DNA methylation.

DNA methylation works by adding a chemical to DNA. This chemical can also be removed from the DNA through a process called demethylation. Typically, methylation turns genes off and demethylation turns genes on. Thus, environmental factors can impact the amount of protein a cell makes. Less protein might be made if an environmental factor causes an increase in DNA methylation, and more protein might be made if a factor causes an increase in demethylation. Keep Reading: Genetics Basics. EXAMPLE: Nerve cell and muscle cell. Your nerve cells and muscle cells have the same DNA, but they work differently. A nerve cell transports information to other cells in your body. A muscle cell has a structure that aids in your body's ability to move. Epigenetics allows the muscle cell to turn on genes to make proteins important for its job and turn off genes important for a nerve cell's job.

Epigenetics and exposures Your epigenetics can change in response to your behaviors and environment. Infections Germs can change your epigenetics to weaken your immune system. This helps the germ survive. EXAMPLE: Tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis. Infections with these germs can cause epigenetic changes in some of your immune cells that result in turning off the IL-12B gene. Turning off the IL-12B gene weakens your immune system and improves the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

### To kill or be killed: how viruses interact with the cell death machinery [^c70231d7]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A virus (from the Latin virus meaning toxin or poison) is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the cells of another organism. Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. The range of structural and biochemical (i.e., cytopathic) effects that viruses have on the host cell is extensive. Most viral infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis, alterations to the cell's surface membrane and various modes of programmed cell death. Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infection and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. Some viruses can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy, whereas others are established causes of cancer. Human organisms use a genetically controlled cell death programme that prevents the spreading of viral infection and kills the virus. Between 19 and 21 November 2009, with sponsorship from the Journal of Internal Medicine, the Swedish Research Foundation and the Swedish Cancer Society hosted a conference in Stockholm entitled: 'To kill or to be killed. Viral evasion strategies and interference with cell death machinery'. Four comprehensive reviews from this conference are presented in this issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine. These reviews include descriptions of: the modulation of host innate and adaptive immune defenses by cytomegalovirus; the impact of gamma-chain family cytokines on T cell homoeostasis in HIV-1 infection and the therapeutic implications; approaches to killing tumours by depriving them of the mechanisms for detoxification; and viral strategies for the evasion of immunogenic cell death.

### Viral strategies for the evasion of immunogenic cell death [^bf47cc96]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Viral strategies for the evasion of immunogenic cell death (Symposium). J Intern Med 2010; 267: 526–542. Driven by co-evolutionary forces, viruses have refined a wide arsenal of strategies to interfere with the host defences. On one hand, viruses can block/retard programmed cell death in infected cells, thereby suppressing one of the most ancient mechanisms against viral dissemination. On the other hand, multiple viral factors can efficiently trigger the death of infected cells and uninfected cells from the immune system, which favours viral spreading and prevents/limits an active antiviral response, respectively. Moreover, several viruses are able to inhibit the molecular machinery that drives the translocation of calreticulin to the surface of dying cells. Thereby, viruses block the exposure of an engulfment signal that is required for the efficient uptake of dying cells by dendritic cells and for the induction of the immune response. In this review, we discuss a variety of mechanisms by which viruses interfere with the cell death machinery and, in particular, by which they subvert immunogenic cell death.

### HIF-2 α is indispensable for regulatory T cell function [^70479f37]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We also investigated if HIF-2α deficiency affects CD4 + T cell differentiation. Naïve CD4 + CD25 − CD44 low CD62L high T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 under Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-polarizing conditions, and then we determined the expression of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 in each lineage. There was no difference in Th1, Th2 or Th17 differentiation between Hif2a f/f and Cd4 Cre Hif2a f/f naïve CD4 + T cells (Fig. 3f). Therefore, HIF-2α is required to prevent Treg cells from being converted into IL-17-secreting cells, but it does not directly regulate Th1, Th2 or Th17 differentiation.

### Mitochondrial apoptosis: killing cancer using the enemy within… [^ed75bd08]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Every minute of life, millions of cells in our bodies undergo a regulated form of cell death called apoptosis. This altruistic cellular process plays varied and essential roles in keeping us healthy, not least in protecting us from cancer. Many oncogenic stresses, including uncontrolled proliferation or DNA damage, trigger apoptosis; consequently, by culling cells at risk of transformation, apoptosis effectively prevents cancer. Apoptosis also suppresses tumourigenesis in various other ways. For example, matrix detachment of cells — a pre-requisite for metastatic disease — induces a form of apoptosis called anoikis. In short, for cancer to initiate and progress, apoptosis must be inhibited at multiple stages. Cell death also plays key roles in the treatment of cancer. The best way to treat cancer is to kill it; indeed many anti-cancer therapies do this by inducing cell death through various mechanisms. Therefore, inhibition of cell death can act as a double-whammy that both promotes tumourigenesis and inhibits treatment responses. Nevertheless, although inhibition of cell death promotes cancer, tumour cells themselves often remain sensitive to apoptosis. Indeed, cancer cells are often more sensitive to cell death than normal tissue. As we will discuss in more detail later, this paradox can be explained because of the inherent stresses that tumour cells face, effectively pushing them closer to the edge. Importantly, this can provide a therapeutic window to selectively trigger tumour death. In this mini-review, we will discuss the role of cell death in cancer development and treatment, specifically focusing upon the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Besides being the most commonly deregulated type of cell death in cancer, our understanding of mitochondrial apoptosis is now such that novel therapies have been developed to specifically engage mitochondrial apoptosis. Although we will restrict our discussion to mitochondrial apoptosis, it is important to note that other forms of programmed cell death, notably necroptosis also exist. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis does not require mitochondria to execute, but it is currently unclear whether targeting necroptosis is possible or indeed beneficial in cancer. Here, in a progressive manner, we will outline the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, describe how tumour cells block it and then discuss exciting new targeted therapies that exploit mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer treatment.

Intracellular uptake of poly(CEP) micelles in RPE cells prevent scar membrane formation.

a Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) plot showed a significant increase in cellular uptake of fluorescein-conjugated poly(CEP) (F-poly(CEP)) at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) (0.1, 0.5, and 1 wt%) when compared to media only at 4 h post-exposure. Data represents mean ± s.d. of four replicates. b Effect of different endocytosis inhibitors on cellular uptake (%) of 1 wt% F-poly(CEP). The greatest decrease in internalised F-poly(CEP) was observed after exposure to chlorpromazine, a clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor. Minimal internalisation was observed when cells were kept on ice (4 °C). Data represents mean ± s.d. of three replicates for 4 °C and media only, and seven replicates for the remaining groups. c Intracellular uptake of 1 wt% F-poly(CEP) and its co-localisation with lysosome (marked using LysoTracker) was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic agent that prevents endosome to lysosome fusion. Addition of CQ increased punctate staining of LysoTracker (green arrows). 1 wt% F-poly(CEP) with LysoTracker showed the presence of internalised micelles co-localising with lysosomes (white arrows). However, the addition of CQ disrupted this co-localisation. Nuclei was stained in blue with Hoechst stain. Inset shows enlarged image from dotted box. Scale bar, main panel: 20 µm, inset: 10 µm.

### Cell-specific functions of ADAM17 regulate the progression of thoracic aortic aneurysm [^d720e0e2]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17) is a membrane-bound enzyme that regulates bioavailability of multiple transmembrane proteins by proteolytic processing. ADAM17 has been linked to several pathologies, but its role in thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) has not been determined.

Objective

The objective of this study was to explore the cell-specific functions of vascular ADAM17 in the pathogenesis and progression of TAA.

Methods and Results

In aneurysmal thoracic aorta from patients, ADAM17 was increased in tunica media and intima. To determine the function of ADAM17 in the major cells types within these regions, we generated mice lacking ADAM17 in smooth muscle cells (SMC; Adam17 f/f /Sm22 Cre/+) or endothelial cells (Adam17 f/f /Tie2 Cre/+). ADAM17 deficiency in either cell type was sufficient to suppress TAA dilation markedly and adverse remodeling in males and females (in vivo) although through different mechanisms. ADAM17 deficiency in SMCs prevented the contractile-to-synthetic phenotypic switching in these cells after TAA induction, preventing perivascular fibrosis, inflammation, and adverse aortic remodeling. Loss of ADAM17 in endothelial cells protected the integrity of the intimal barrier by preserving the adherens junction (vascular endothelial-cadherin) and tight junctions (junctional adhesion molecule-A and claudin). In vitro studies on primary mouse thoracic SMCs and human primary aortic SMCs and endothelial cells (± ADAM17 small interfering RNA) confirmed the cell-specific functions of ADAM17 and demonstrated the cross-species validity of these findings. To determine the impact of ADAM17 inhibition in treating TAA, we used an ADAM17-selective inhibitor (PF-548) before or 3 days after TAA induction. In both cases, ADAM17 inhibition prevented progression of aneurysmal growth.

Conclusions

We have identified distinct cell-specific functions of ADAM17 in TAA progression, promoting pathological remodeling of SMC and impairing integrity of the intimal endothelial cell barrier. The dual impact of ADAM17 deficiency (or inhibition) in protecting 2 major cell types in the aortic wall highlights the unique position of this proteinase as a critical treatment target for TAA.

### Erythropoietin fails to interfere with the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of antitumor drugs [^3e8d6c1c]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Erythropoietin (EPO) therapy is widely used for the prevention and treatment of anemia resulting from cancer chemotherapy. Native EPO regulates erythropoiesis, at least in part, by protecting erythroid progenitor cells from apoptotic cell death. The recent discovery of the EPO receptor (EPOR) on cancer cells raises the concern that EPO therapy might stimulate tumor growth and/or protect cancer cells from drug-induced apoptosis. Therefore, the capacity of EPO to interfere with the effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs on proliferation, apoptosis, and the induction of senescence was investigated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells, which express the EPOR as well as in F-MEL erythroleukemia cells.

Experimental Design

Breast cancer cells and F-MEL leukemic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of EPO and then exposed to antitumor drugs. Cell proliferation was assessed by a standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye reduction assay 72 hours after drug exposure. Cytotoxicity was monitored by clonogenic survival. Apoptosis was evaluated either by the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling assay or fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and senescence was monitored by beta-galactosidase staining. EPO signaling was assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation/activation of specific signaling proteins.

Results

EPO failed to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 or MDA-MB231 breast tumor cells or F-MEL leukemic cells. EPO treatment also failed to interfere with the antiproliferative and/or cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin, Taxol, and tamoxifen in breast tumor cells (or of cytarabine and daunorubicin in F-MEL cells). EPO failed to prevent apoptosis induced by Taxol or senescence induced by Adriamycin in MCF-7 cells. EPO stimulated the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase in MCF-7 cells but did not activate Akt or signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5). EPO failed to activate any of these signaling pathways in MDA-MB231 cells. Cytarabine and daunorubicin interfered with EPO signaling in F-MEL cells.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that EPO is unlikely to directly counteract the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. This may be a consequence of either ineffective signaling through the EPOR or drug-mediated suppression of EPO signaling.

### Keratinocyte growth factor preserves normal thymopoiesis and thymic microenvironment during experimental graft-versus-host disease [^ffae5fb3]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Thymus-dependent reconstitution of the peripheral T-cell compartment is critical for the successful outcome of bone marrow transplantation. However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects thymic stromal function and thus prevents normal T-cell maturation and selection. To determine whether cytoprotection of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) averts GVHD-related injury to the thymus, a nonirradiated murine parent→ F(1) transplantation model was investigated. Administration of KGF between days -3 and +3 of GVHD induction preserved normal thymic size, cellularity, and thymocyte phenotype when measured 2 weeks after transplantation and compared with saline-treated parent→ F(1) mice that received allogeneic transplants. Moreover, the characteristic GVHD-induced impairment in cell cycle progression of pro- and pre-T cells was prevented by KGF. However, the normal phenotypic and functional status of the thymus did not correlate with the higher number of GVHD-inducing mature donor T cells in thymi of KGF-treated mice. Importantly, extensive analysis of the different TEC populations within the thymic cortex and medulla revealed an almost normal stromal architecture and composition in GVHD mice treated with KGF. These observations are likely to reflect an indirect effect of KGF on thymopoiesis as KGF-receptor expression was demonstrated to be restricted to TECs. Thus, pharmacologic doses of KGF appear to exert a potent effect on TEC function, which in turn allows for normal T lymphopoiesis to occur during acute GVHD.

### Risk factors: infectious agents-NCI… [^1527e7b4]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr Virus EBV, a type of herpes virus, causes mononucleosis as well as certain types of lymphoma and cancers of the nose and throat. EBV is most commonly transmitted by contact with saliva, such as through kissing or by sharing toothbrushes or drinking glasses. It can also be spread by sexual contact, blood transfusions, and organ transplantation. EBV infection is lifelong. More than 90% of people worldwide will be infected with EBV during their lifetime, and most do not develop any symptoms. There is no vaccine to prevent EBV infection and no specific treatment for EBV infection. New research shows that EBV may lead to cancer by causing breaks in human DNA. Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus Chronic infections with HBV or HCV can cause liver cancer. Both viruses can be transmitted via blood and from mother to baby at birth. In addition, HBV can be transmitted via sexual contact.

Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. HIV does not cause cancer itself, but infection with HIV weakens the immune system and makes the body less able to fight off other infections that cause cancer. People infected with HIV have increased risks of a number of cancers, especially Kaposi sarcoma, lymphomas, and cancers of the cervix, anus, lung, liver, and throat. KSHV is most commonly spread through saliva. It can also be spread through organ or bone marrow transplantation, and there is some evidence that it can be spread by blood transfusion, although this risk is minimized by practices followed in the United States such as blood storage and removal of white cells. Merkel Cell Polyomavirus MCPyV can cause Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare type of skin cancer.

Most adults are infected with MCPyV, with transmission most likely occurring through casual direct or indirect contact in early childhood. The risk of Merkel cell carcinoma is greatly increased in elderly people and in younger adults with who are infected with HIV or are immunosuppressed for other reasons. Infection does not generally cause symptoms, and there are no treatments for MCPyV.

### TGF-β-mediated silencing of genomic organizer SATB1 promotes tfh cell differentiation and formation of intra-tumoral tertiary lymphoid structures [^08b25a6d]. Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T follicular helper (Tfh) cells promotes Tfh:B cell interactions and appropriate positioning within tissues. Here, we examined the impact of regulation of PD-1 expression by the genomic organizer SATB1 on Tfh cell differentiation. Vaccination of CD4 Cre Satb1 f/f mice enriched for antigen-specific Tfh cells, and TGF-β-mediated repression of SATB1 enhanced Tfh differentiation of human T cells. Mechanistically, high Icos expression in Satb1 -/- CD4 + T cells promoted Tfh cell differentiation by preventing T follicular regulatory cell skewing and resulted in increased isotype-switched B cell responses in vivo. Ovarian tumors in CD4 Cre Satb1 f/f mice accumulated tumor antigen-specific, LIGHT + CXCL13 + IL-21 + Tfh cells and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). TLS formation decreased tumor growth in a CD4 + T cell and CXCL13-dependent manner. The transfer of Tfh cells, but not naive CD4 + T cells, induced TLS at tumor beds and decreased tumor growth. Thus, TGF-β-mediated silencing of Satb1 licenses Tfh cell differentiation, providing insight into the genesis of TLS within tumors.

### Preventing excessive noise exposure in infants, children, and adolescents [^47b9462d]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Noise effects — hearing loss mechanisms and speech perception impacts are outlined, noting that damage to hair cells is permanent and usually cannot be restored with medical treatment, that noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) can occur after high-intensity traumatic noises or after less-loud noises experienced over time, and that the longer the exposure, the greater the risk for hearing loss. Continuous exposure to hazardous noise levels tends to cause maximum damage to high-frequency areas of the cochlea and is usually most severe around 4000 Hz. NIHL impacts understanding of speech, with consonants disproportionately affected in higher frequencies, and because softly spoken, high-frequency consonants such as "f", "s", and "h" convey more of the intelligibility of words in speech compared with vowels, an individual with NIHL can have difficulty understanding in background noise and when following higher-pitched voices.

### Fas / CD95 prevents autoimmunity independently of lipid raft localization and efficient apoptosis induction [^f3f76304]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

These results suggest that non-apoptotic signalling through Fas promotes a cell fate (differentiation into effector memory T cells), where cells become sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis, constituting an elegant feedback system to maintain T-cell homoeostasis during chronic immune stimuli and prevent autoimmunity. Although we found that Fas-induced differentiation into T EM was detrimental to anti-tumour immunity, therapeutic enhancement of T-cell differentiation through non-apoptotic Fas signalling may benefit chronic autoimmune diseases that rely on a self-renewing supply of long-lived central memory T cells. By separating the apoptotic from non-apoptotic functions of Fas, the FasC194V lpr/lpr mouse model should aid elucidation of the pathways mediating non-apoptotic signalling, which will inform the design of therapeutic strategies that harness this less-understood function of Fas in the immune system.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 1: intracellular overdrive for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^f1b57255]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has claimed approximately 5 million lives and 257 million cases reported globally. This virus and disease have significantly affected people worldwide, whether directly and/or indirectly, with a virulent pathogen that continues to evolve as we race to learn how to prevent, control, or cure COVID-19. The focus of this review is on the SARS-CoV-2 virus' mechanism of infection and its proclivity at adapting and restructuring the intracellular environment to support viral replication. We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients.

### Stimulatory MAIT cell antigens reach the circulation and are efficiently metabolised and presented by human liver cells [^f50aa922]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Inhibition of liver APC-mediated MAIT cell activation by MR1 blocking ligands

We explored whether blocking of MR1 occupancy with non-activating MR1 ligands prevents MAIT cell activation by liver cells, potentially offering an approach to counteract the postulated role of MAIT cells in liver fibrogenesis. We found that MAIT cell activation by Ag-exposed primary liver cells can be prevented in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treating liver cells with 6-formylpterin (6-FP) or acetyl-6-FP, known to enter the MR1 5-OP-RU binding pocket but not activate MAIT cells (figure 5A, B). The acetylsalicylic acid derivative 5-formyl-salicylic acid (5-F-SA) was found previously to stabilise MR1 on the cell surface, without stimulating Jurkat T cells overexpressing the MAIT TCR. We found that 5-F-SA decreased MAIT cell activation by liver APCs (figure 5B).

Figure 5
Non-activating MR1 ligands prevent MAIT cell activation by liver-derived APCs. MAIT cell clone SMC3 was co-cultured with indicated liver cells pretreated with different non-activating MR1 ligands for 1 hour before addition of 5-OP-RU. IFN-γ secretion was assessed by ELISA. (A) Hepatocytes either treated with 0.1–1 nM 5-OP-RU alone (CTRL) or pretreated with 50 µM 6-FP (left panel) or 5 µM acetyl-6-FP (right panel) before adding 5-OP-RU. (B) HSCs and BECs either treated with 5-OP-RU alone (CTRL), or pretreated with indicated concentrations of 6-FP, acetyl-6-FP, or 5-formyl-salicylic acid (5-F-SA) before 5-OP-RU addition.

### American Society of Transplantation and cellular therapy series: # 8-management and prevention of non-aspergillus molds in hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients [^6bb70de2]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Non-Aspergillus invasive mold infections (NAIMIs) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients remain uncommon but are associated with high mortality rates, and the true incidence is difficult to ascertain. In the United States, the overall post-HCT 12-month cumulative incidence is estimated at 0.29%, with the rank order of frequency being mucormycosis (MCM), fusariosis, scedosporiosis/lomentosporiosis, and then rare NAIMIs. Non-Aspergillus molds are ubiquitously found in soil, dust, and decaying vegetation with aerosolization from wind, rain, fires, construction, or other disruption of fungal conidia, with inhalational acquisition usual and direct inoculation from penetrating trauma also described. NAIMIs frequently involve the lungs, sinuses, central nervous system, skin, and soft tissue; fungemia with dissemination is common in heavily immunocompromised HCT recipients, and nosocomial outbreaks also occur. MCM refers to NAIMI caused by molds of the class Mucoycetes and order Mucorales, their incidence may be increasing, and common genera include Rhizopus spp, Mucor spp, Rhizomucor, and Cunninghamella. Fusarium spp. NAIMI are most commonly due to the F. solani species complex, followed by F. oxysporum, and are the third most common cause of invasive mold infection after Aspergillus spp. and Mucorales, accounting for < 5% of IFD in HCT in the US. Invasive fusariosis has been increasing in the US and can be more frequent in tropical regions, for example, 20% to 30% of IMI in Brazil. Recognized risk factors for IF after allogeneic HCT include acute myeloid leukemia, hyperglycemia, and antithymocyte globulin therapy, while non-myeloablative conditioning, grade III-IV GVHD, and previous IMI have been associated with IF late posttransplant. Scedosporium/Lomentospora spp. were reclassified with Scedosporium prolificans now Lomentospora prolificans, and these molds are broadly resistant to multiple antifungal agents.

### Dual functions of rap1 are crucial for T-cell homeostasis and prevention of spontaneous colitis [^c2ab03c6]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Rap1 deficiency facilitated rolling of T EM cells

To compare the homing ability of Rap1-deficient T EM cells, CD4 + T N cells from Rap1 f/f and Rap1 −/− mice were cultured under T H 17-polarizing conditions. Rap1 deficiency exerted no significant effects on differentiation into T H 17 and T H 1 cells or expression of α 4 β 7, LFA-1, PSGL-1 and CXCR3 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Rap1 in f/f T EM cells was activated after CXCL10 stimulation (Fig. 4b). We investigated whether Rap1 deficiency influenced the adhesion cascades of T EM cells on the endothelium expressing P-selectin and ICAM-1 under shear flow. Rap1 −/− T EM cells exhibited significantly more frequent and slow rolling in the absence or presence of CXCL10, relative to Rap1 f/f T EM cells (Fig. 4c). These data demonstrated that PSGL-1/P-selectin-dependent rolling was elevated in Rap1 −/− T EM cells.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^8e2f430d]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Automaticity mechanisms in ventricular arrhythmia are described as follows: normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential. An initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane. In the acute phase of a myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia, increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium, and these injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

### What is cancer?-NCI… [^3f09bd23]. NCI (2007). Low credibility.

Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways. For instance, cancer cells:

- grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals.
- ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die.
- invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body.
- tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors. These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.
- hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells.
- trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow. For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.
- accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.
- rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells. In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly. Cancer is a genetic disease — that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide. Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:

- of errors that occur as cells divide.
- of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun.
- they were inherited from our parents. The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body's ability to do so goes down as we age.

This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life. Each person's cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes. Tumor suppressor genes are also involved in controlling cell growth and division. Cells with certain alterations in tumor suppressor genes may divide in an uncontrolled manner. DNA repair genes are involved in fixing damaged DNA. Cells with mutations in these genes tend to develop additional mutations in other genes and changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Together, these mutations may cause the cells to become cancerous.

### Killing in self-defense: proapoptotic drugs to eliminate intracellular pathogens [^4c2c67b6]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Intracellular infections rely on host cell survival for replication and have evolved several mechanisms to prevent infected cells from dying. Drugs that promote apoptosis, a noninflammatory form of cell death, can dysregulate these survival mechanisms to kill infected cells via a mechanism that resists the evolution of drug resistance. Two such drug classes, known as SMAC mimetics and BH3 mimetics, have shown preclinical efficacy at mediating clearance of liver-stage malaria and chronic infections such as hepatitis-B virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Emerging toxicity and efficacy data have reinforced the broad applicability of these drugs and form the foundations for preclinical and clinical studies into their various usage cases.

### Critical tumor suppressor function mediated by epithelial mig-6 in endometrial cancer [^5235739f]. Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is preceded by endometrial hyperplasia, unopposed estrogen exposure, and genetic alterations, but the precise causes of endometrial cancer remain uncertain. Mig-6, mainly known as a negative regulator of the EGF receptor, is an important mediator of progesterone signaling in the uterus, where it mediates tumor suppression by modulating endometrial stromal-epithelial communications. In this study, we investigated the function of Mig-6 in the uterine epithelium using a tissue-specific gene knockout strategy, in which floxed Mig-6 (Mig-6(f/f)) mice were crossed to Wnt7a-Cre mice (Wnt7a(cre+)Mig-6(f/f)). Wnt7a(cre+)Mig-6(f/f) mice developed endometrial hyperplasia and estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer, exhibiting increased proliferation in epithelial cells as well as apoptosis in subepithelial stromal cells. We documented increased expression of NOTCH1 and BIRC3 in epithelial cells of Wnt7a(cre+)Mig-6(f/f) mice and decreased expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) in stromal cells. Progesterone therapy controls endometrial growth and prevents endometrial cancer, but the effectiveness of progesterone as a treatment for women with endometrial cancer is less clear. We noted that the hyperplasic phenotype of Wnt7a(cre+)Mig-6(f/f) mice was prevented by progesterone treatment, whereas this treatment had no effect in PR(cre/+)Mig-6(f/f) mice where Mig-6 was deleted in both the epithelial and stromal compartments of the uterus. In contrast, activation of progesterone signaling in the stroma regulated proliferation and apoptosis in the epithelium via suppression of ERα signaling. In summary, our results establish that epithelial Mig-6 functions as a critical tumor suppressor that mediates the ability of progesterone to prevent the development of endometrial cancer.

### Caspase-independent cell death [^f0ac4682]. Nature Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Caspase activation has been frequently viewed as synonymous with apoptotic cell death; however, caspases can also contribute to processes that do not culminate in cell demise. Moreover, inhibition of caspases can have cytoprotective effects. In a number of different models, caspase inhibition does not maintain cellular viability and instead shifts the morphology of death from apoptosis to nonapoptotic pathways. Here, we explore the contribution of caspases to cell death, either as upstream signals or as downstream effectors contributing to apoptotic morphology, as well as alternative strategies for cell death inhibition. Such alternative strategies may either target catabolic hydrolases or be aimed at preventing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and its upstream triggers.

### TNF controls a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the cell death decision to restrict viral spread [^3224ab95]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The data presented here demonstrate that information provided to cells through macrophage secreted cytokines can alter their classification strategy by dynamically shifting their error tolerance in favor of faster decisions. Importantly, these changes to individual cells' decision processes are required to prevent viral spread in the population.

We only observed a TNF-induced change in cellular decision strategy during viral infection and not in response to other stresses such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide or DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 3H, I). One interpretation of this context specificity stems from the fact that viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and death of the host cell halts viral replication. The context specific manner by which TNF acts indicates how the regulation of cellular decision strategies has evolved to provide specific physiological benefits. In our in vitro system, TNF had a significant antiviral effect; however, in vivo, it acts together with other cytokines to restrict viral spread. The relative importance of TNF versus other other cytokines likely varies between different types and stages of viral infection and merits further investigation using in vivo experimental models.

### Prevention of immune cell apoptosis as potential therapeutic strategy for severe infections [^8cf8d61f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Mechanism and Regulation of Apoptosis

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is the method by which tissue remodeling takes place during normal growth and development and the physiologic mechanism by which labile cell populations such as gastrointestinal epithelial cells, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophils are regulated. Apoptosis is of particular importance for the immune system as the means by which self-recognizing lymphocytes are deleted and expanded lymphocyte populations are reduced at the conclusion of an acute immune response. This closely regulated, energy-requiring process can be initiated through 2 different mechanisms, each based on the successive activation of preexisting but dormant cysteine-aspartate proteases, or caspases (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Apoptotic pathways of cell death. The extrinsic pathway is mediated by a variety of death receptor ligands, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Fas ligand (FaSL), that trigger apoptosis by binding to cell surface receptors. In the intrinsic pathway, several adverse factors act upon mitochondria to cause loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in leakage into the cytosol of cytochrome C (Cyto C), which together with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 forms the apoptosome that activates caspase-9. Communication between the pathways exists through cleavage of Bcl-2 interacting domain (Bid) by active caspase-8 to form truncated Bid (tBid). Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) can prevent caspase activation under certain conditions.

### An intestinal T17 cell-derived subset can initiate cancer [^a436cf13]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

In summary, our work shows a mechanism that protects against intestinal cancer initiation. This mechanism is based on an interplay between IECs and differentiated T H 17 cells, which blocks the continuum of differentiation of pretumorigenic T H 17 cells to a tumorigenic state, protecting IECs against malignant transformation.

### Inhibition of nuclear pore complex formation selectively induces cancer cell death [^c5e62bf6]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Medium credibility.

Nuclear pore complexes (NPC) are the central mediators of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Increasing evidence shows that many cancer cells have increased numbers of NPCs and become addicted to the nuclear transport machinery. How reducing NPC numbers affects the physiology of normal and cancer cells and whether it could be exploited for cancer therapies has not been investigated. We report that inhibition of NPC formation, a process mostly restricted to proliferating cells, causes selective cancer cell death, prevents tumor growth, and induces tumor regression. Although cancer cells die in response to NPC assembly inhibition, normal cells undergo a reversible cell-cycle arrest that allows them to survive. Mechanistically, reducing NPC numbers results in multiple alterations contributing to cancer cell death, including abnormalities in nuclear transport, catastrophic alterations in gene expression, and the selective accumulation of DNA damage. Our findings uncover the NPC formation process as a novel targetable pathway in cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Reducing NPC numbers in cancer cells induces death, prevents tumor growth, and results in tumor regression. Conversely, normal cells undergo a reversible cell-cycle arrest in response to inhibition of NPC assembly. These findings expose the potential of targeting NPC formation in cancer.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias — automaticity explains that normal automaticity results from phase 4 spontaneous depolarization of the transmembrane action potential arising from a normal resting potential, reaching threshold and initiating an action potential, and that an initiating current (I f) is responsible for spontaneous phase 4 depolarization in the sinus node. In contrast, abnormal automaticity arises from a partially depolarized membrane potential that is usually close to the activation potential for calcium channels in the cell membrane, and in the acute phase of an myocardial infarction (MI) or during transient ischemia increased extracellular potassium causes partial depolarization of the resting membrane potential creating injury currents between the infarcted/ischemic tissue and healthy myocardium. These injury currents may initiate spontaneous activity.

Mechanism of Action

Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion, or integration, of unintegrated linear HIV-1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV-1 provirus. The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases α, β, and γ.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 ± 20 nM resulted in 95% inhibition (EC95) of viral spread (relative to an untreated virus-infected culture) in human T-lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell-line adapted HIV-1 variant H9IIIB. In addition, 5 clinical isolates of HIV-1 subtype B had EC95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In a single-cycle infection assay, raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV-1 isolates representing 5 non-B subtypes (A, C, D, F, and G) and 5 circulating recombinant forms (AE, AG, BF, BG, and cpx) with EC50values ranging from 5 to 12 nM. Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV-2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells (EC95 value = 6 nM). Additive to synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed when human T-lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV-1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirdine, efavirenz, or nevirapine); nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, or zidovudine); protease inhibitors (amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir); or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide.

### TNF controls a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the cell death decision to restrict viral spread [^991deba9]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Rapid detection of viral infection is needed to minimize spread and associated damage. At the same time, evolutionary pressures constantly enhance the arsenal of strategies that viruses use to evade and manipulate host detection. The adversarial co-evolution between host detection and viral avoidance creates a challenging and time-dependent classification problem for host cells that likely operate close to the detection limits imposed by the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. Rapid decision making at the noise limit is likely to result in false-positive classification i.e. a decision that a virus is there when it is not, followed by unnecessary cell death and bystander tissue damage. How cells navigate the tradeoff between decision speed and accuracy to achieve an optimal classification strategy has not been explored.

The initial detection of viral invasion in a tissue is accomplished by macrophages and other innate immune sentinels. These specialized cells secrete cytokines and other inflammatory mediators to alert nearby cells of invading pathogens. Alerted cells then execute diverse strategies to prevent viral spread including restriction of viral entry, direct inhibition of viral gene expression, prevention of viral genome replication, prevention of viral egress, and death of infected cells. These defense mechanisms are activated in an inducible manner as they have the potential to interfere with normal host cell physiology –. We asked how cells balance the competing goals of antiviral activity and maintenance of normal physiology in response to macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines. We focused on Tumor Necrosis Factor ɑ (TNF), because it is an important antiviral cytokine, yet can also cause significant damage to healthy host tissues due to its role regulating cell death pathways. This relationship is exemplified by the observation that TNF-blocking drugs have shown remarkable success for treatment of autoimmune disorders, yet also increase susceptibility to certain pathogens. Further, excessive production of TNF has been implicated as an important driver of cell death and tissue destruction during infection with hyper-virulent virus strains such as the H5N1 and 1918 pandemic influenza subtypes –.

Here, we combine experiments in cell culture with mathematical modeling and live, whole-organ light-sheet microscopy to examine the regulation of the cellular decision to undergo cell death during viral infection. We show that TNF regulates a tradeoff between the cell death decision speed and accuracy, such that infected cells die faster at the expense of increased death of uninfected bystander cells. Importantly, the regulation of this speed-accuracy tradeoff in single cells is critical to limit viral spread throughout a whole population. Our work demonstrates that the immune system regulates the execution of individual cellular decisions to tune a tissues' tolerance for self-damage based on pathogen threat.

### Staurosporine and cytochalasin D induce chondrogenesis by regulation of actin dynamics in different way [^5fe3d6a7]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this present study, we employed two different drugs which modulate actin filaments and compared their effects on chondrogenesis, F-/G-actin ratio, and phosphorylation of cofilin and MLC.

The role of staurosporine in the recovery from the dedifferentiated state and prevention of dedifferentiation-like process as well as cytoskeletal changes has been studied in several cells. Staurosporine disrupts actin filaments and redifferentiates chondrocytes defifferentiated by retinoic acid or serial passages and stimulates expression of collagen type II in fibrochondrocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that staurosporine induces the differentiation of single mesenchymal cells extending its influence to undifferentiated cells. Cytochalasin D also showed similar chondrogenesis-inducing effect as previously reported.

However, the effects of these drugs on the actin cytoskeleton were somewhat different. While staurosporine dissolves actin filament with slight decrease in the relative amount of G-actin, F-actin, and F-/G-actin ratio compared to the control, cytochalasin D considerably reduced G-actin content and F-/G-actin ratio.

Actin dynamics is regulated by actin binding proteins such as MLC and cofilin. Cytochalasins interact with the actin filament network by capping the barbed ends, and thereby altering the dynamic properties of microfilaments. It has been proposed that the effects of cytochalasin D on cells result from both a direct interaction of the drug with the actin filament components of cytoskeletal networks and a secondary cellular response. The latter engages network fragments in an energy-dependent event that leads to the formation of filament foci. In the present study, we show that cytochalasin D decreases the phosphorylation of cofilin. Cytochalasin B itself has a weak severing effect. However, it has been reported that cytochalasin D reduces phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin which would activate cofilin and thereby depolymerize F-actin. Thus, our results suggest that cytochalasin D promotes F-actin depolymerization by reduction of cofilin phosphorylation in concert with the prevention of F-actin polymerization by its immediate effect on the organization of cytoskeletal networks. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of the cytochalasin D-induced dephosphorylation of cofilin.

### Mechanisms of inhibition of the host interferon alpha / β-mediated antiviral responses by viruses [^c99dd413]. Microbes and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Complex multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to prevent and control infection by pathogens. Among these mechanisms, the type I interferon or interferon alpha/beta system represents one of the first lines of defense against viral infections. Typically, viral infection induces the synthesis and secretion of interferon alpha/beta by the infected cell, which in turn activates signaling pathways leading to an antiviral state. As a counter measure, many viruses have developed intriguing mechanisms to evade the interferon alpha/beta system of the host. In this review, we will summarize recent research developments in this interesting field of virus-host cell interactions.

### Amantadine [^d6b62c5b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Pharmacodynamics

 Mechanism of Action: Antiviral

The mechanism by which amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. In certain cases, amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine.

Antiviral Activity

Amantadine inhibits the replication of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes, i.e. H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. It has very little or no activity against influenza B virus isolates. A quantitative relationship between the in vitro susceptibility of influenza A virus to amantadine and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in man. Sensitivity test results, expressed as the concentration of amantadine required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus (ED50) in tissue culture vary greatly (from 0.1 μg/mL to 25 μg/mL) depending upon the assay protocol used, size of virus inoculum, isolates of influenza A virus strains tested, and the cell type used. Host cells in tissue culture readily tolerated amantadine up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL.

### A clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy alloimmunized to red blood cell antigens [^8ab3dd9f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy alloimmunized to red blood cell antigens — importance and prevention: Red blood cell alloimmunization is typically associated with the transplacental transfer of incompatible fetal red blood cells into maternal circulation, and subsequent pregnancies can be affected by fetal anemia, hydrops fetalis, and perinatal death; most cases of Rhesus D (RhD) alloimmunization due to pregnancy can be prevented by the proper administration of Rhesus immune globulin; however, an emerging practice of using low-titer, O RhD-positive whole blood (LTOWB) in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage has the potential to increase the exposure of the female population to a new source of incompatible red blood cells.

### Targeting cell death signalling in cancer: minimising' collateral damage' [^5ab721dd]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Targeting apoptosis for the treatment of cancer has become an increasingly attractive strategy, with agents in development to trigger extrinsic apoptosis via TRAIL signalling, or to prevent the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-2 proteins or inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. Although the evasion of apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, many cancers have intact apoptotic signalling pathways, which if unblocked could efficiently kill cancerous cells. However, it is becoming increasing clear that without a detailed understanding of both apoptotic and non-apoptotic signalling, and the key proteins that regulate these pathways, there can be dose-limiting toxicity and adverse effects associated with their modulation. Here we review the main apoptotic pathways directly targeted for anti-cancer therapy and the unforeseen consequences of their modulation. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of an in-depth mechanistic understanding of both the apoptotic and non-apoptotic functions of those proteins under investigation as anti-cancer drug targets and outline some novel approaches to sensitise cancer cells to apoptosis, thereby improving the efficacy of existing therapies when used in combination with novel targeted agents.

### Chimeric TIM-4 receptor-modified T cells targeting phosphatidylserine mediates both cytotoxic anti-tumor responses and phagocytic uptake of tumor-associated antigen for T cell cross-presentation [^42945b06]. Molecular Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to cytotoxicity, we also evaluated the phagocytic activity of CER-1236 T cells against whole-cell targets to further assess their functionality. To accomplish this, CER-1236 T cells were co-cultured with JeKo-1 TMEM30A KO cells in the presence or absence of inhibitors of key steps of target engulfment: cytochalasin D, an actin polymerase inhibitor that prevents target uptake into phagosomes, and bafilomycin A, a lysosomal ATPase inhibitor that prevents fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes, thus preventing acidification. Since both agents inhibit phagocytosis and prevent the fluorescent signal increases of pHrodo Red particles that would otherwise be internalized into acidic lysosomal compartments, they would be expected to impair phagocytosis.

CER-1236 T cells demonstrated higher phagocytic activity against JeKo-1 TMEM30A KO cells than untransduced cells (Figures 2 F and 2G). Phagocytic activity was reduced after treatment with either cytochalasin D or bafilomycin A in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2 F and 2G). A low dose of cytochalasin D (0.05 μM) reduced engulfment by 41%, while a dose of 0.5 μM cytochalasin D reduced CER-1236 engulfment by 79% (Figure 2 F). Similarly, bafilomycin A inhibited engulfment activity by CER-1236 T cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a 62% inhibition of phagocytosis at 10 nM bafilomycin A (Figure 2 G). Of note, neither untransduced cells nor a TIM-4 binding site mutant CER-1250 showed engulfment of TMEM30A KO target cells.

### Prevention of immune cell apoptosis as potential therapeutic strategy for severe infections [^8d965ffa]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

As its name implies, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway begins within the cell, when toxic alterations bring about a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, leading to the opening of mitochondrial membrane pores and the release of cytochrome C and other substances into the cytoplasm. The extrinsic pathway, by contrast, is triggered by extracellular events through the binding to cell surface receptors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily death ligands, including TNF-α and Fas ligand. Although the intrinsic pathway involves early activation of caspase-9, and the extrinsic pathway is mediated through caspase-8, both lead to activation of the executioner caspase-3 and a variety of proteases and endonucleases. Once begun, apoptosis may be described as an orderly disassembly of the cell from within. Chromosomal DNA is cleaved into oligonucleosomal segments, the nucleus is divided into discrete subunits, and the cell itself is partitioned into multiple membrane-bound fragments whose outer surfaces are marked by large numbers of phosphatidylserine molecules, leading to their rapid uptake by phagocytes. Because all multicellular organisms use programmed cell death to maintain or modify their tissues, this process does not evoke an inflammatory response, and its end products actually serve as antiinflammatory stimuli. Apoptosis thus differs markedly from necrosis, the chaotic breakdown resulting from trauma and other types of damage, in its morphologic and immunologic features (Table 1). Necrosis is characterized by the early loss of outer membrane function, rapid cytoplasmic swelling and disintegration, and release of cell contents into surrounding tissues, which evoke an intense inflammatory response.

Table 1
Distinguishing features of apoptosis and necrosis

A large number of cell-surface and cytoplasmic proteins participate in the detection and processing of signals that tip the balance toward or away from programmed cell death. These include members of the Bcl-2 protein family, which have both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic activity (Bcl-2 is antiapoptotic), and other inhibitors (Figure 1). Despite these elaborate control mechanisms, innate or acquired defects in the control of apoptosis may lead to a variety of disease states. For example, excessive inhibition of apoptosis is an underlying mechanism of cancer, while an inappropriate increase is seen in some neurodegenerative diseases and other conditions.

### Nephrin is expressed on the surface of insulin vesicles and facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin release [^2e1607f2]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Nephrin augmentation of insulin secretion is partially dependent on actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

Actin depolymerizing agents have been shown to affect insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells, while more complex may be the role of actin-stabilizing/nucleating drugs such as jasplakinolide, which has been clearly shown to increase glucose responsiveness in MIN6 cells when used at high concentrations. Nephrin increases insulin secretion (Fig. 3), and nephrin modulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Therefore, we tested if nephrin trafficking from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm can be prevented by actin stabilization with low-dose jasplakinolide and if the positive nephrin effect on insulin secretion could be abolished. Both glucose and cytochalasin D induced a redistribution of nephrin from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 A and C), and jasplakinolide completely prevented this effect (Fig. 7 B), similar to what we observed with 200 nmol/l phalloidin treatment (data not shown). The augmentation of GSIR in nephrin-transfected cells was also prevented by jasplakinolide (Fig. 7 D), suggesting that a nephrin-mediated increase in insulin secretion is partially dependent on the polymerization status of actin. The actin remodeling function of cytochalasin D, jasplakinolide, and phalloidin was studied by Western blotting for G- and F-actin subcellular fractions. While untreated MIN6 cells are characterized by a content of F-actin of ∼40% of total actin, cytochalasin D treatment resulted in a decrease F-actin content to 10%, and jasplakinolide and phalloidin both increased F-actin content to 60 and 65%, respectively (Fig. 7 E).

### How do viruses control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis? [^948564eb]. Virus Research (2015). Low credibility.

There is no doubt that viruses require cells to successfully reproduce and effectively infect the next host. The question is what is the fate of the infected cells? All eukaryotic cells can "sense" viral infections and exhibit defence strategies to oppose viral replication and spread. This often leads to the elimination of the infected cells by programmed cell death or apoptosis. This "sacrifice" of infected cells represents the most primordial response of multicellular organisms to viruses. Subverting host cell apoptosis, at least for some time, is therefore a crucial strategy of viruses to ensure their replication, the production of essential viral proteins, virus assembly and the spreading to new hosts. For that reason many viruses harbor apoptosis inhibitory genes, which once inside infected cells are expressed to circumvent apoptosis induction during the virus reproduction phase. On the other hand, viruses can take advantage of stimulating apoptosis to (i) facilitate shedding and hence dissemination, (ii) to prevent infected cells from presenting viral antigens to the immune system or (iii) to kill non-infected bystander and immune cells which would limit viral propagation. Hence the decision whether an infected host cell undergoes apoptosis or not depends on virus type and pathogenicity, its capacity to oppose antiviral responses of the infected cells and/or to evade any attack from immune cells. Viral genomes have therefore been adapted throughout evolution to satisfy the need of a particular virus to induce or inhibit apoptosis during its life cycle. Here we review the different strategies used by viruses to interfere with the two major apoptosis as well as with the innate immune signaling pathways in mammalian cells. We will focus on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and discuss new ideas about how particular viruses could activately engage mitochondria to induce apoptosis of their host.

### White paper on microbial anti-cancer therapy and prevention [^2480ca17]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Delivery of viral particles

Because viral particles are inert outside of host cells, classic delivery of naked virus depends on passive accumulation. High viral titers can be safely administered when using a highly tumor-selective virus and tumors with leaky vasculature. To be effective, the inoculum needs to remain in the circulation for sufficient time to allow passage through the tumor vascular bed. This becomes a particular issue for viral species that have not evolved to spread in the blood, and so have little or no protection against complement or removal by the reticuloendothelial system. Even species that are well adapted to evade these innate immune responses are likely to be severely restricted in their ability to be delivered systemically when faced with an anti-viral adaptive immune response, especially circulating neutralizing antibodies. This might be due to previous vaccinations (e.g. vaccinia, measles), prior exposure to a virus (e.g. adenovirus) or simply as a result of repeated treatment with the same viral therapy.

The easiest way to avoid such delivery hurdles is to directly inject the virus into the tumor. Intratumoral administration would circumvent antiviral immune responses, enable more direct contact with cancer cells and reduce systemic toxicity. However, this method of administration creates another set of issues, including the need for a surgeon to perform such procedures; an inability to target multiple metastases; reaching areas of the tumor beyond the needle tract; and ensuring the virus is not delivered to necrotic regions or simply escapes the tumor.

Several strategies have been developed to try to enhance the systemic delivery of oncolytic viral therapies. One approach has been to chemically modify the viral particle itself, such as chemical attachment to large inert molecules (notably polyethylene glycol, PEG) or wrapping of the viral particle in a synthetic lipid envelope or polymer coat. Other strategies include complement inhibition and cytokine conditioning to mobilize a cellular population upon which the virus can hitchhike. These approaches have successfully demonstrated the ability to de-target viruses from non-tumor cells (notably hepatocytes) and to increase circulation time. However, they often suffer from an inability to reliably release infectious virus in the tumor. Because the modifications often inhibit the natural routes of viral cell entry, they need to be selectively removed within the tumor or alternative cell entry routes developed. Similar approaches involving enzymatically removing immune activating surface molecules (such as through deglycosylation) or genetic engineering of the virus itself (such as swapping of coat proteins between related viral strains that have evolved to spread differently in a host) have demonstrated greater successes.

### Mechanical power is maximized during contractile ring-like formation in a biomimetic dividing cell model [^6999c80a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Understanding the mechanics and energetics of cell division is often hindered by cellular complexity, such as variable protein composition and overlapping signaling pathways. Here, we developed an in vitro model of dividing cells by encapsulating purified actin and myosin within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs, liposomes) –. This system enables precise control over both molecular inputs (e.g. protein composition) and mechanical inputs (i.e. actomyosin contractility), which is infeasible in living cells. By controlling myosin activity with light patterns, we investigate its impact on dynamics, symmetry, and mechanical energy usage of cell division-like shape changes. We correlate shape changes with liposome aspect ratio, furrow depth, and F-actin alignment under varying actin-membrane attachment strength, turnover, and F-actin architecture. Our aim is to determine how contractility regulates shape change and F-actin organization to optimize mechanical outputs during division. We identify that mechanical power is maximized during shape elongation, coinciding with contractile ring formation, while furrowing expends less mechanical power and leads to greater energy dissipation.

### TNF controls a speed-accuracy tradeoff in the cell death decision to restrict viral spread [^03adac89]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fractions of healthy, infected, dead following infection, and dead without infection are calculated as a fraction of the initially seeded cells. Cells that were initially seeded but disappeared are assumed to be dead since dead cells often detach from the plate or otherwise disintegrate.

To quantify single-cell infection rate as a function of nearest neighbor viral load (Supplementary Fig. 4D) we co-cultured uninfected target cells with a small fraction of infected cells. We imaged the cells every 20 min, which allows us to detect infection rates as long as they are slower than 3 per hour. At every timepoint, we measured the infection state of individual cells, and the total nearest neighbor viral load (defined as the total viral fluorescent signal from cells within a 70 μm radius of the target cell center) of any uninfected target cell. We then determined the fraction of target cells that were infected during the 20 min interval. Overall, we tracked 335,999 possible infection events, 4% of which resulted in productive infection. We then conditioned our data on the nearest neighbor viral load using 25 equally sized bins, each with ~13,200 potential infection events, and repeated the calculation of fractions of successful infections over the 20 min interval. To assess the robustness of our measurement we calculated the standard error of the mean by repeated sampling (100 iterations) of n = 500 cells out of every group and measuring the s.d. of the resulting sample fractions. We then fit the corresponding curve to a Hill function (Supplementary Fig 4D) to extract the viral infectivity, the maximal rate of viral infection given a saturating viral load in the infecting cells, and the EC50 of viral infection, the half maximal viral load of the neighboring infecting cells.

Preferred technique — selection depends on logistics and source water, and combined processes may be needed: the optimal technique depends on number of persons, space and weight, source water quality, taste preferences, and fuel; because halogens are not effective for killing Cryptosporidium and common microfilters are not reliable for viruses, optimal protection may require a 2-step process of 1) filtration or C.F., then 2) halogenation, while heat (boiling) is effective as a 1-step process. In disasters, household or point-of-use disinfection is advised; chlorine is the simplest method, cloudy water should be clarified before using hypochlorite, and for marine voyages only reverse osmosis membrane filters are adequate. For storage and daily use, iodine works only for short periods, prolonged storage should use chlorination in tightly sealed containers, and narrow‑mouthed or spigot containers help prevent contamination.

### Prevention of immune cell apoptosis as potential therapeutic strategy for severe infections [^e57c9dae]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Despite success in controlling many infectious diseases, efforts to defend against the wide range of microbes that threaten human health continue to be challenged by the unexpected emergence of novel pathogens and possible use of a variety of virulent agents as biologic weapons. A defensive strategy based solely on developing new vaccines and antimicrobial and antiviral drugs, each specific for only 1 or a few agents, is unlikely to be successful in dealing with potential microbial threats and will be exceedingly expensive. An alternative approach attempts to identify mechanisms shared by most or all severe infections that could be targets for pharmacologic intervention. Such generic therapies could supplement agent-specific treatment by increasing resistance to infection, potentially improving outcomes for patients in a variety of disease states.

One physiologic process that characterizes several severe infections is a massive loss of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, gastrointestial epithelial cells, and other cell types through apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This process is an apparent acceleration or dysregulation of the same process by which these cell populations are regulated during normal health. By impairing the development of adaptive immune responses needed for recovery, the apoptotic destruction of lymphocytes and dendritic cells could have a particularly adverse effect on disease outcome. Fortunately, because programmed cell death is an orderly biochemical process triggered by specific stimuli and executed by a limited range of enzymes, it could be inhibited through pharmacologic countermeasures, offering a novel approach to therapy.

We begin this article by summarizing evidence that a massive apoptotic loss of lymphocytes takes place in humans during the course of septic shock and describing similar findings in animal models of sepsis. Data are then presented that indicate that a marked die-off of lymphocytes also occurs in Ebola hemorrhagic fever, anthrax, and plague, which suggests that unregulated apoptosis of these cells is a component of many, and perhaps all, severe infectious processes and may contribute to high case fatality rates by impairing adaptive immune function. After describing encouraging results obtained in proof-of-concept tests of multiple antiapoptotic interventions in lethal murine models of sepsis, we note some potential limitations of such therapy that could slow its introduction into the therapeutic regimen. Whatever the potential role of such strategies, improved understanding of the causes, time course, and extent of programmed cell death will aid management of patients with severe infections.

### Death and anti-death: tumour resistance to apoptosis [^45e69901]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2002). Medium credibility.

Every cell in a multicellular organism has the potential to die by apoptosis, but tumour cells often have faulty apoptotic pathways. These defects not only increase tumour mass, but also render the tumour resistant to therapy. So, what are the molecular mechanisms of tumour resistance to apoptosis and how can we use this knowledge to resensitize tumour cells to cancer therapy?

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^f2c73459]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

Partners PrEP trial — A phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of daily oral F/TDF or TDF for prevention of HIV acquisition enrolled 4,758 couples in Uganda and Kenya, and the trial was stopped after an interim analysis in mid-2011 showed statistically significant efficacy in the medication groups compared with placebo. In 48% of couples, the infected partner was male, and HIV-positive partners had a median CD4 count of 495 cells/μL and were not being prescribed antiretroviral therapy because they were not eligible by local treatment guidelines; participants had monthly follow-up visits, and the study drug was discontinued among women who became pregnant during the trial. Adherence was very high: 98% by pills dispensed, 92% by pill count, and 82% by plasma drug-level testing among randomly selected participants in the TDF and F/TDF study groups. Among participants of both sexes combined, efficacy estimates compared with placebo were 67% (95% CI, 44–81) for TDF and 75% (95% CI, 55–87) for F/TDF; among women the estimated efficacy was 71% for TDF and 66% for F/TDF, and among men it was 63% for TDF and 84% for F/TDF, with efficacy estimates by drug regimen not statistically different among or between sexes. In a Partners PrEP substudy, detectable plasma TFV among those assigned to F/TDF was associated with a 90% reduction in HIV acquisition; TDF- or FTC- resistant virus was detected in 3 of 14 persons determined to have been infected when enrolled (2 of 5 in the TDF group; 1 of 3 in the F/TDF group), and no TDF or FTC resistant virus was detected among those infected after enrollment. Among women, the pregnancy rate was high (10.3 per 100 py), and rates did not differ significantly between the study groups.

### Mitochondrial apoptosis: killing cancer using the enemy within… [^1f459519]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Apoptotic cell death inhibits oncogenesis at multiple stages, ranging from transformation to metastasis. Consequently, in order for cancer to develop and progress, apoptosis must be inhibited. Cell death also plays major roles in cancer treatment, serving as the main effector function of many anti-cancer therapies. In this review, we discuss the role of apoptosis in the development and treatment of cancer. Specifically, we focus upon the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis — the most commonly deregulated form of cell death in cancer. In this process, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation or MOMP represents the defining event that irrevocably commits a cell to die. We provide an overview of how this pathway is regulated by BCL-2 family proteins and describe ways in which cancer cells can block it. Finally, we discuss exciting new approaches aimed at specifically inducing mitochondrial apoptosis in cancer cells, outlining their potential pitfalls, while highlighting their considerable therapeutic promise.

### American society for transplantation and cellular therapy series # 11: updated cytomegalovirus guidelines in hematopoietic cell transplant and cellular therapy recipients [^8255540c]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). High credibility.

American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Series #11 — updated cytomegalovirus (CMV) guidelines target hematopoietic cell transplant and cellular therapy recipients and describe scope, format, and grading. The Practice Guidelines Committee partnered with the Transplant Infectious Diseases Special Interest Group to update previous guidance for the prevention and management of CMV infection and disease following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Each standalone topic is published as frequently asked questions (FAQs), and adult and pediatric infectious diseases and HCT content experts developed the FAQs and the answers; recommendations were graded according to their strength (A–E) and the level of the supporting evidence (I–III). Prior updates published in 2021 focused on prevention and management, including refractory and resistant infections, and several advances in CMV prevention and management since 2021 warranted an update.

### Nonviral protein cages as tools to decipher and combat viral threats [^804dcbb8]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Simplified viral life cycle.

The majority of viruses — whether enveloped or nonenveloped — depend on the host cell's endocytic pathways for entry (left). Some viruses bypass complex entry mechanisms by directly fusing their envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing their capsids to reach the cytosol (middle). Endocytosed viruses undergo a multistep process that moves them from the cell surface to specific intracellular sites where their genetic material is released. Initially, viruses attach to cellular receptors, which may be proteins, lipids, or carbohydrates, typically in a specific and multivalent fashion. These interactions trigger cellular signaling pathways, leading to virus uptake through various endocytic mechanisms, primarily macropinocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Following vesicular trafficking, host cell cues — such as pH changes or proteolytic cleavage — induce conformational changes in the virus, facilitating penetration into the cytosol. Enveloped viruses achieve this through membrane fusion, while nonenveloped viruses disrupt the vacuolar membrane through pore formation or lysis. The precise site of penetration varies depending on the virus and host cell type, occurring at the plasma membrane, early or late endosomes, macropinosomes, or the endoplasmic reticulum. After cytosolic entry, RNA viruses typically replicate in the cytoplasm, whereas most DNA viruses continue their journey to the nucleus. The entry process concludes with controlled uncoating of the viral genome, marking the start of replication (right). Newly synthesized viral components are then assembled into progeny virions, which are subsequently released from the host cell via budding or lysis.

### Preventing excessive noise exposure in infants, children, and adolescents [^24254847]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Noise exposure pathophysiology and persistence — Intense noise exposure can breach the endolymph and perilymph barrier and disrupt hair cell stereocilia and support cells, can initiate an extracellular ion-channel response causing overproduction of free radicals in cochlear cells, and free radical levels can remain measurable in the cochlea for 7 to 10 days after noise exposure; sustained high free radical levels trigger an inflammatory response and can lead to apoptosis or necroptosis of hair cells; hair cells and spiral ganglia that are permanently damaged cannot regenerate, and research on oral antioxidant vitamins shows antioxidants affect cochlear free radical levels and reduce damage to hearing.

### MOR1 is essential for organizing cortical microtubules in plants [^8fa4757a]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Microtubules orchestrate cell division and morphogenesis, but how they disassemble and reappear at different subcellular locations is unknown. Microtubule organizing centres are thought to have an important role, but in higher plants microtubules assemble in ordered configurations even though microtubule organizing centres are inconspicuous or absent. Plant cells generate highly organized microtubule arrays that coordinate mitosis, cytokinesis and expansion. Inhibiting microtubule assembly prevents chromosome separation, blocks cell division and impairs growth polarity. Microtubules are essential for the formation of cell walls, through an array of plasma-membrane-associated cortical microtubules whose control mechanisms are unknown. Using a genetic strategy to identify microtubule organizing factors in Arabidopsis thaliana, we isolated temperature-sensitive mutant alleles of the MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION 1 (MOR1) gene. Here we show that MOR1 is the plant version of an ancient family of microtubule-associated proteins. Point mutations that substitute single amino-acid residues in an amino-terminal HEAT repeat impart reversible temperature-dependent cortical microtubule disruption, showing that MOR1 is essential for cortical microtubule organization.

### Cdc48 / p97 promotes reformation of the nucleus by extracting the kinase Aurora B from chromatin [^8320b47c]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

During division of metazoan cells, the nucleus disassembles to allow chromosome segregation, and then reforms in each daughter cell. Reformation of the nucleus involves chromatin decondensation and assembly of the double-membrane nuclear envelope around the chromatin; however, regulation of the process is still poorly understood. In vitro, nucleus formation requires p97 (ref. 3), a hexameric ATPase implicated in membrane fusion and ubiquitin-dependent processes. However, the role and relevance of p97 in nucleus formation have remained controversial. Here we show that p97 stimulates nucleus reformation by inactivating the chromatin-associated kinase Aurora B. During mitosis, Aurora B inhibits nucleus reformation by preventing chromosome decondensation and formation of the nuclear envelope membrane. During exit from mitosis, p97 binds to Aurora B after its ubiquitylation and extracts it from chromatin. This leads to inactivation of Aurora B on chromatin, thus allowing chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope formation. These data reveal an essential pathway that regulates reformation of the nucleus after mitosis and defines ubiquitin-dependent protein extraction as a common mechanism of Cdc48/p97 activity also during nucleus formation.

### A non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle underlies cellular identity [^d1177ba3]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central hub of cellular metabolism, oxidizing nutrients to generate reducing equivalents for energy production and critical metabolites for biosynthetic reactions. Despite the importance of the products of the TCA cycle for cell viability and proliferation, mammalian cells display diversity in TCA-cycle activity 1,2. How this diversity is achieved, and whether it is critical for establishing cell fate, remains poorly understood. Here we identify a non-canonical TCA cycle that is required for changes in cell state. Genetic co-essentiality mapping revealed a cluster of genes that is sufficient to compose a biochemical alternative to the canonical TCA cycle, wherein mitochondrially derived citrate exported to the cytoplasm is metabolized by ATP citrate lyase, ultimately regenerating mitochondrial oxaloacetate to complete this non-canonical TCA cycle. Manipulating the expression of ATP citrate lyase or the canonical TCA-cycle enzyme aconitase 2 in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells revealed that changes in the configuration of the TCA cycle accompany cell fate transitions. During exit from pluripotency, embryonic stem cells switch from canonical to non-canonical TCA-cycle metabolism. Accordingly, blocking the non-canonical TCA cycle prevents cells from exiting pluripotency. These results establish a context-dependent alternative to the traditional TCA cycle and reveal that appropriate TCA-cycle engagement is required for changes in cell state.
