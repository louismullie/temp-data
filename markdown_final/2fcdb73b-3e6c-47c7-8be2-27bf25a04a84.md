## Question

UTI treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about UTI treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the UTI syndrome and define uncomplicated versus complicated disease. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to culture and how to interpret results. Next, I will consider antimicrobial stewardship principles and local resistance patterns. After that, I will select empiric therapy by syndrome and special populations, and then refine to culture-directed definitive therapy. I should also review non-antibiotic strategies, monitoring and follow-up, and finally address emerging issues and controversies, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment hinges on it; uncomplicated UTI is a clinical syndrome of lower tract symptoms without fever, flank pain, costovertebral tenderness, or systemic instability, whereas complicated UTI includes pyelonephritis, infections in patients with structural or functional genitourinary abnormalities, immunocompromise, diabetes, or catheterization, and the presence of systemic features or bacteremia shifts management toward longer courses and broader initial coverage [^113XstJL] [^1132xnmk] [^113ivLkw] [^114JeXVq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach for uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant women; in those with classic symptoms, empiric therapy without culture is acceptable, but I should reserve culture for atypical presentations, treatment failure, recurrent infections, or suspected resistant organisms, and I need to remember that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in pregnancy and select procedural contexts, so I must not conflate colonization with infection [^1132XuuX] [^1166Vvbp] [^115K3ua3].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of urinalysis; dipsticks can support diagnosis but have imperfect negative predictive value, so in patients with high pretest probability, a negative dipstick does not exclude UTI, and I should avoid overtesting in low-probability scenarios to prevent overtreatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, especially in older adults where pyuria is common without infection [^1135JKJ5] [^113kGXtE].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is front and center; that means using the narrowest effective agent, the shortest effective duration, and de-escalating promptly to culture results, while avoiding agents with high collateral damage such as fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist, and I should double-check local antibiograms to guide empiric choices and minimize resistance selection pressure [^112bPvv4] [^113LH3ve] [^113w9t1z].

> Next, I will now examine empiric therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant women; first-line options remain nitrofurantoin for 5 days, fosfomycin as a single dose, trimethoprim for 3 days, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 3 days when local resistance is below 20 percent, and I should avoid beta-lactams as initial therapy due to lower efficacy and higher recurrence, reserving them as alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable [^1132XuuX] [^1132xnmk] [^112e6Ry3].

> But wait, what if symptoms are mild; I should consider delayed prescribing or even symptomatic management with NSAIDs because randomized data show similar symptom control across strategies with substantially reduced antibiotic use when delayed or targeted approaches are used, though patients should be counseled that symptoms may persist longer without immediate antibiotics and safety netting is essential [^114eitib] [^114n2X2r].

> Let me think about pyelonephritis; I should confirm that nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are inappropriate because they do not achieve adequate renal parenchymal levels, and empiric therapy should include an oral fluoroquinolone only if local resistance is under 10 percent, otherwise an aminoglycoside or an extended-spectrum beta-lactam such as ceftriaxone is reasonable, with total duration typically 7 to 14 days and a shorter 7-day course acceptable in clinically improving bacteremic patients [^1132XuuX] [^116fXk2s].

> I should double-check complicated UTI without pyelonephritis; management mirrors that of pyelonephritis with initial broader coverage guided by local antibiograms and patient-specific risk factors for resistance, followed by de-escalation to culture-directed therapy, and I need to ensure source control for catheters, obstruction, or stones because antibiotics alone will fail without addressing the nidus [^116uTTsD] [^112bPvv4] [^1117cEAA].

> For catheter-associated UTI, hold on, I should verify that the catheter must be removed or replaced before starting antibiotics, that symptomatic CA-UTI is treated per complicated UTI principles, and that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated except in special circumstances, with cultures obtained from the new catheter if replaced to improve diagnostic yield [^112BeWJp] [^114XQfpU] [^115Xk6Uu].

> In pregnancy, I need to ensure I treat asymptomatic bacteriuria because it reduces pyelonephritis and may reduce preterm birth and low birth weight, and for symptomatic UTI I should preferentially use beta-lactams such as amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or nitrofurantoin, avoiding TMP-SMX in the first trimester and near term, and I should obtain cultures to guide therapy whenever feasible [^1144U2MN] [^1132xnmk].

> For men with lower UTI symptoms, let me reconsider whether this can ever be truly uncomplicated; most guidelines treat male patients as having complicated infection by default, so I should obtain a urine culture and treat for about 7 days with agents that penetrate the prostate when indicated, and I must keep prostatitis on the differential if symptoms persist or systemic features emerge [^114JeXVq] [^1132xnmk].

> In older adults, I should confirm that distinguishing UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria is critical because overtreatment is common; I need to correlate symptoms carefully, avoid anchoring on nonspecific changes, and apply diagnostic algorithms or toolkits in long-term care to reduce inappropriate antibiotics and their harms [^112HusbM] [^113kGXtE].

> For recurrent UTI in women, I should verify that prevention strategies prioritize non-antibiotic options such as vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal patients, cranberry products with modest benefit, and behavioral modifications, reserving antibiotic prophylaxis for those with frequent, bothersome episodes after shared decision-making, and I should consider patient-initiated therapy in reliable patients while ensuring cultures are obtained to document episodes and guide future care [^113fX5G2] [^112kKQCz] [^114JpJPa].

> Next, I should review how to transition from empiric to definitive therapy; once culture and susceptibilities return, I must de-escalate to the narrowest active agent, correct any initial mismatches, and adjust duration to the shortest effective course, documenting the rationale for any extension beyond guideline ranges when clinically justified [^112bPvv4] [^116uTTsD].

> I will now examine non-antibiotic and adjunctive strategies; methenamine hippurate can be considered for prophylaxis in select patients, NSAIDs may suffice for some with mild symptoms, and I should counsel on hydration and behavioral measures while acknowledging that evidence for many supplements is limited and heterogeneous [^1132xnmk] [^113w9t1z].

> Let me verify monitoring and follow-up; uncomplicated cystitis should improve within 48 to 72 hours, and if symptoms persist beyond 7 days or worsen, I should repeat urinalysis and culture, reassess for obstruction or abscess, and consider imaging such as renal ultrasound or CT when red flags are present, especially in pyelonephritis or treatment failure [^113EKioz] [^115fxkfK].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging issues; antimicrobial resistance continues to rise and threatens empiric choices, prompting stewardship and exploration of novel agents and strategies, while diagnostic uncertainty persists with calls for better definitions and harmonized criteria for complicated UTI to improve trial comparability and clinical decision-making [^113w9t1z] [^111ndMsp] [^1122dnZP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said fluoroquinolones are first-line for cystitis; that would be outdated and discordant with stewardship principles, so I should correct that and reserve fluoroquinolones for pyelonephritis or complicated UTI when local resistance and patient factors justify their use, given their collateral damage and resistance selection risk [^1132XuuX] [^112e6Ry3].

> Finally, I need to ensure my plan aligns with contemporary evidence; recent large-scale analyses reinforce that guideline-concordant first-line agents for uncomplicated UTI remain effective and safer than fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams, supporting continued stewardship emphasis on nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and TMP-SMX when appropriate, with individualized adjustments for allergies, prior resistance, and patient preferences [^114FurQs] [^112e6Ry3] [^1135gEPy].

---

UTI treatment should be tailored to infection type, patient factors, and local resistance patterns [^1137rWfo]. For uncomplicated cystitis, use **nitrofurantoin 5 days** [^1132XuuX], **fosfomycin single dose**, or **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 3 days** if resistance is ≤ 20% [^1132xnmk]; avoid fluoroquinolones when possible due to resistance and adverse effects [^112e6Ry3]. For complicated UTI or pyelonephritis, use **fluoroquinolones or beta-lactams for 7–14 days** [^1132XuuX], and tailor to culture results [^112bPvv4]. In pregnancy, use **beta-lactams or nitrofurantoin** [^1132xnmk]; avoid fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim in the first trimester. For catheter-associated UTI, replace the catheter [^112BeWJp] and treat for 7–14 days [^115Xk6Uu]. Always obtain cultures for recurrent or complicated cases [^111WdJTa], and apply antimicrobial stewardship to minimize resistance [^113w9t1z].

## Classification of UTIs

UTIs are classified as **uncomplicated or complicated** based on clinical presentation and patient factors [^11285M1j]:

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated UTI | Infection in immunocompetent patients without structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities | - Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women [^1132XuuX] |
| Complicated UTI | Infection in patients with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromise, or systemic illness | - Pyelonephritis <br/> - Catheter-associated UTI [^1143DosV] <br/> - UTI in diabetic patients [^notfound] |

---

## General principles of UTI treatment

- **Empiric therapy**: Initiate based on clinical presentation, patient factors, and local resistance patterns [^1132XuuX].
- **Culture and susceptibility testing**: Obtain in complicated cases, recurrent infections, or treatment failure [^114JpJPa].
- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Use the narrowest effective agent and shortest effective duration to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^112bPvv4].

---

## Treatment of uncomplicated cystitis

First-line antibiotics include **nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days** [^1132XuuX], **fosfomycin tromethamine 3 g orally as a single dose** [^1132xnmk], or **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800 mg orally twice daily for 3 days** if local resistance is ≤ 20% [^1132XuuX]. Alternative options include beta-lactams (amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefpodoxime) for 3–7 days if first-line agents are unsuitable [^1132XuuX]. Avoid **fluoroquinolones** due to resistance and adverse effects; reserve for complicated cases [^112e6Ry3].

---

## Treatment of complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis

- **Empiric therapy**: Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) or beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam) for 7–14 days [^notfound].
- **Catheter-associated UTI**: Replace or remove the catheter before initiating antibiotics; treat for 7–14 days [^112BeWJp].
- **Tailored therapy**: Adjust based on culture and susceptibility results [^112bPvv4].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnant patients

- **Safe antibiotics**: Beta-lactams (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin) and nitrofurantoin are preferred [^1135JKJ5].
- **Avoid**: Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim in the first trimester.
- **Asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Treat to prevent pyelonephritis and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1144U2MN].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **empiric therapy** is with amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, or TMP-SMX for 7–10 days, and **complicated cases** may require broader-spectrum agents and longer durations (10–14 days) [^1116o5L4].

---

### Elderly patients

In elderly patients, **differentiation** is critical to distinguish UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria to avoid overtreatment [^113kGXtE], and **empiric therapy** should be guided by local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors [^114JpJPa].

---

## Non-antibiotic and adjunctive therapies

- **Cranberry products**: May reduce recurrent UTIs, particularly in premenopausal women [^113fX5G2].
- **Probiotics**: Limited evidence; may be considered in recurrent UTIs [^notfound].
- **Symptomatic relief**: Analgesics and antipyretics for symptom control [^1132xnmk].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention strategies include **behavioral modifications** such as increased fluid intake, frequent voiding, and post-coital voiding [^notfound]. Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective for recurrent UTIs but carries risks of resistance and adverse effects [^1132xnmk]; consider non-antibiotic options first [^11534DAr]. Vaccines remain under investigation and are not currently available [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **bacteriophage therapy**, which is under investigation for recurrent and resistant UTIs [^113Sj4KX], and **novel diagnostics**, with rapid molecular testing under development to improve diagnosis and stewardship [^116zynFj]. Personalized medicine aims to tailor therapy to individual patient and pathogen factors [^11534CLZ].

---

UTI treatment should be individualized based on infection type, patient factors, and local resistance patterns. Empiric therapy is followed by culture-guided adjustments, with antimicrobial stewardship to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^114JpJPa].

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^113TeMWT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### Scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of urinary tract infection in the past 10 Years [^117BehL6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a very common disease that is accompanied by various complications in the affected person. UTI triggers diverse inflammatory reactions locally in the infected urinary bladder and kidney, causing tissue destruction and organ failure. Moreover, systemic responses in the entire body carry the risk of urosepsis with far-reaching consequences. Understanding the cell-, organ-, and systemic mechanisms in UTI are crucial for prevention, early intervention, and current therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes the scientific advances over the last 10 years concerning pathogenesis, prevention, rapid diagnosis, and new treatment approaches. We also highlight the impact of the immune system and potential new therapies to reduce progressive and recurrent UTI.

### Consensus position statement on advancing the classification of patients and tests of cure in studies of antibiotic treatment of complicated urinary tract infections [^111ndMsp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections denote an important research field for new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens. There is, however, increasing concern that this disease entity is too vaguely defined, leading to heterogeneous study populations and risk of bias. We analysed researchers' adherence to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and assessed risk of bias using a three-step procedure: literature review of full-text articles on complicated urinary tract infection; assessment of the importance of risk factors for treatment failure, including statistical evaluation of how patients with risk factors might skew treatment effects; and a Delphi consensus process in a multidisciplinary group. Our evaluation showed poor adherence to FDA guidance on complicated urinary tract infection and significant heterogeneity in the reporting of study, patient, and pathogen characteristics, leading to a high risk of bias when interpreting and comparing study findings. We therefore question the concept of complicated urinary tract infection as a meaningful entity with its own study guidance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections [^113ivLkw]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

A complicated urinary tract infection is that which occurs in a patient with an anatomically abnormal urinary tract or significant medical or surgical comorbidities. Whereas this definition may not cover each and every situation, it does serve to encompass the great majority of these patients and guide their care. The definition is necessarily broad, to assure that these potentially complex patients are appropriately managed. Thus, complicated urinary tract infection describes a group of patients that usually need a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy, with all its attendant morbidities, costs, and outcome differences.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^113AFvAL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections are common infections seen by obstetrician/gynecologists and primary care providers. Recurrent urinary tract infections are difficult to treat and decrease quality of life. This article addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections, including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. Most notably, increased interest in the urinary microbiome is leading to improved understanding of virulent and commensal bacteria in the genitourinary tract. Understanding the causative factors of recurrent urinary tract infections will lead to improved detection, treatment, and prevention.

Key Points

Question

Are treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) recommended in national guidelines published in 2011 still optimal?

Findings

Using a large regional claims dataset for 57 585 episodes of UTI occurring in 49 037 female patients, this cohort study found that guideline-concordant first-line treatments retained their efficacy vs fluoroquinolones and outperformed β-lactam antibiotics with respect to efficacy and adverse events.

Meaning

Even though the national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated UTI were published nearly 14 years ago, these findings suggest that outpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs should continue to encourage clinicians to follow them.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116wywDX]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### Antibiotics for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy [^1144U2MN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a bacterial infection of the urine without any of the typical symptoms that are associated with a urinary infection, and occurs in 2% to 15% of pregnancies. If left untreated, up to 30% of mothers will develop acute pyelonephritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been associated with low birthweight and preterm birth. This is an update of a review last published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria on the development of pyelonephritis and the risk of low birthweight and preterm birth.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 4 November 2018, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment in pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria found on antenatal screening. Trials using a cluster-RCT design and quasi-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, as were trials published in abstract or letter form, but cross-over studies were not.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 15 studies, involving over 2000 women. Antibiotic treatment compared with placebo or no treatment may reduce the incidence of pyelonephritis (average risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.41; 12 studies, 2017 women; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotic treatment may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.88; 3 studies, 327 women; low-certainty evidence), and low birthweight babies (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93; 6 studies, 1437 babies; low-certainty evidence). There may be a reduction in persistent bacteriuria at the time of delivery (average RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.53; 4 studies; 596 women), but the results were inconclusive for serious adverse neonatal outcomes (average RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.79, 3 studies; 549 babies). There were very limited data on which to estimate the effect of antibiotics on other infant outcomes, and maternal adverse effects were rarely described. Overall, we judged only one trial at low risk of bias across all domains; the other 14 studies were assessed as high or unclear risk of bias. Many studies lacked an adequate description of methods, and we could only judge the risk of bias as unclear, but in most studies, we assessed at least one domain at high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of the evidence for the three primary outcomes with GRADE software, and found low-certainty evidence for pyelonephritis, preterm birth, and birthweight less than 2500 g.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment may be effective in reducing the risk of pyelonephritis in pregnancy, but our confidence in the effect estimate is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. There may be a reduction in preterm birth and low birthweight with antibiotic treatment, consistent with theories about the role of infection in adverse pregnancy outcomes, but again, the confidence in the effect is limited given the low certainty of the evidence. Research implications identified in this review include the need for an up-to-date cost-effectiveness evaluation of diagnostic algorithms, and more evidence to learn whether there is a low-risk group of women who are unlikely to benefit from treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

### CAUTIon-not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for ~400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics and treatment options but also differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments - which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs - often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically, by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^114JpJPa]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) treatment principles — treatment options "can be stratified by whether complicating features, such as known abnormal genitourinary anatomy, immunosuppression, and chronic catheterization, are present", and "Antibiotic therapy is typically used to treat active infections and prevent future infections; the treatment regimen, route, and duration will vary based on the clinical situation and should be individualized for each patient"; strategies "can be divided into treatment of an acute episode (provider prescribed or self-treatment) or prophylaxis (to prevent further episodes)"; "Whenever possible, rUTI patients should have a culture sent before treatment", although "Empiric therapy can be initiated before urine culture results if clinically indicated (such as history of UTI-related sepsis or pyelonephritis)", and "Antibiotic choice should be tailored to the individual patient and pathogens, community and patient resistance patterns, costs, drug availability, patient allergies, and patient tolerance/ability to comply"; clinicians "should be familiar with the antibiotic-resistant patterns in their communities which is generally available via antibiograms through any clinical laboratory", and "Empiric regimens should be altered if necessary based on the urine culture results".

### The diagnosis and treatment of adult urinary tract infections in the emergency department [^115d1h84]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine has been called the art of "making complicated clinical decisions with limited information". This description is particularly relevant in the case of diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although common, UTIs are often challenging to diagnose given the presence of non-specific signs and symptoms and over-reliance on laboratory findings. This review provides an interdisciplinary interpretation of the primary literature and practice guidelines, with a focus on diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^114hHBBu]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Keep it simple: a proposal for a new definition of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections from the EAU urological infections guidelines panel [^113Ym5hA]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Association of Urology Urological Infections Guidelines Panel is proposing a new classification scheme for categorizing urinary tract infections (UTIs) into uncomplicated and complicated types. This classification would provide clarity and facilitate effective clinical management of UTIs, and acknowledges the importance of addressing clinical and sex-specific nuances in the care of individual patients.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115fyFbG]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115Xk6Uu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of persons with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The evidence-based guidelines encompass diagnostic criteria, strategies to reduce the risk of CA-UTIs, strategies that have not been found to reduce the incidence of urinary infections, and management strategies for patients with catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria or symptomatic urinary tract infection. These guidelines are intended for use by physicians in all medical specialties who perform direct patient care, with an emphasis on the care of patients in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

### Urinary tract infections: current and emerging management strategies [^113efeWL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cystitis is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections and is responsible for substantial morbidity and high medical costs in the United States and across the globe. Though generally considered to be self-limiting and easily treated with antibiotics, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often incompletely resolved by antibiotic therapy and frequently recur. This is in part due to the ability of uropathogenic bacteria to invade, replicate, and persist within host epithelial cells. The biological complexity of these infections combined with a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens highlight the need for alternative therapies. In this review we examine current management strategies for UTIs, as well as emerging treatments, including novel compounds that block bacterial interactions with the urothelium and vaccines focused on preventing both acute and recurrent infections.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^1126ST1b]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^1116o5L4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician because of the variety of clinical syndromes included and consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence for practical guidance. The cumulative incidence of all childhood UTI by the age of 7 years is 1%–2% in boys and 7% in girls. Of those presenting to emergency, 5%–24% are deemed cUTI, so it is a common childhood infection. However, defining what makes a UTI complicated is difficult because it has been characterized by a variety of UTI syndromes, which include hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, and unusual pathogens. For this review and guideline, cUTIs are those that require other management considerations than straightforward lower or upper tract UTIs for which evidence and guidelines exist. Accurate diagnosis and management of cUTI limit morbidity and mortality from sepsis and long-term renal damage. However, most trials of UTI in children have excluded those with cUTI, and consequently, many guidelines also exclude them. The absence of a standardized definition for cUTI has resulted in inconsistencies in treatment approaches, which may lead to increased morbidity among affected children. Existing major UTI guidelines for children either do not address complicated UTIs at all or are limited to only some complications or some age groups. –

This review aims to address the four most important controversies when managing children with cUTI and provide recommendations for definition, investigations, treatment and follow-up. The resulting guidelines offer evidence-graded recommendations specifically for the management of pediatric cUTI, addressing gaps that exist in current guidelines.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^1122dnZP]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^1135gEPy]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Which treatment strategy for women with symptoms of urinary tract infection? [^111osZb9]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with severe and persistent symptoms, microbiological examination of urine can help the GP to identify the micro-organisms causing the infection. In Nordic countries, many GPs have direct access to point of care testing such as urine phase contrast microscopy, culture, and direct susceptibility testing to identify patients who need antibiotic treatment. In the study by Gágyor and colleagues, only a third of patients with uncomplicated UTI needed antibiotics during the four weeks of follow-up, so a strategy of delayed prescription for patients with light to moderate symptoms might also be a feasible strategy. We need trials of delayed prescriptions for UTI. Delayed prescribing has been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections by 50–70%.(this is same sentence repeated in adifferent way!)

### Uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1142cqa9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^1132xnmk]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^113AAffU]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Our data continue to support evidence that UTIs are often diagnosed and treated in a manner inconsistent with guidelines meant to direct best clinical practices. Laboratory tests are frequently used in the absence of urinary symptoms demonstrating inappropriate testing. Over‐testing is contributing to the overtreatment of patients without UTI symptoms and often without microbiological evidence of infection. Given the potential harms of overtreatment such as antibiotic resistance, recurrent infections, and high healthcare costs, our study demonstrates the need for advances in adherence to and understanding of UTI diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines as well as improved diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship.

### Urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults [^113kGXtE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

### Urinary tract infections in patients with diabetes treated with dapagliflozin [^112aURs3]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Urinary tract infection is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Possible causative factors include glucosuria, which is a result of treatment with sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Dapagliflozin is an investigative SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated glycemic benefits in patients with diabetes. Data from dapagliflozin multi-trial safety data were analyzed to clarify the association between glucosuria and urinary tract infection.

Methods

Safety data from 12 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were pooled to evaluate the relationship between glucosuria and urinary tract infection in patients with inadequately controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 6.5%-12%). Patients were treated with dapagliflozin (2.5, 5, or 10mg) or placebo once daily, either as monotherapy or add-on to metformin, insulin, sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione for 12–24weeks. The incidence of clinical diagnoses and events suggestive of urinary tract infection were quantified.

Results

This analysis included 3152 patients who received once-daily dapagliflozin (2.5mg [n = 814], 5mg [n = 1145], or 10mg [n = 1193]) as monotherapy or add-on treatment, and 1393 placebo-treated patients. For dapagliflozin 2.5mg, 5mg, 10mg, and placebo, diagnosed infections were reported in 3.6%, 5.7%, 4.3%, and 3.7%, respectively. Urinary glucose levels, but not the incidence of urinary tract infection, increased progressively with dapagliflozin dosage. Most identified infections were those considered typical for patients with diabetes. Discontinuations due to urinary tract infection were rare: 8 (0.3%) dapagliflozin-treated patients and 1 (0.1%) placebo-treated patient. Most diagnosed infections were mild to moderate and responded to standard antimicrobial treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment of type 2 diabetes with once-daily dapagliflozin 5 or 10mg is accompanied by a slightly increased risk of urinary tract infection. Infections were generally mild to moderate and clinically manageable. This analysis did not demonstrate a definitive dose relationship between glucosuria and urinary tract infection.

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^113fX5G2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^115qQwRP]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common conditions seen in female patients in general practice. These infections affect 50% of women at least once in their lives, and more than 20% of infections are resistant to trimethoprim and cephalosporins and 50% to amoxicillin.

Urinary dipsticks are the most commonly used near patient test in primary care in the United Kingdom. The aim of using dipsticks is to target treatment to the 60% of women who have urinary tract infections, while minimising antibiotic use for women without infection. A previous validation study has shown that dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. If clinicians are to use dipsticks, however, they need to have strategies to deal with the poor negative predictive values. We know of no trial that has assessed dipstick or clinical management algorithms in comparison with the realistic alternatives. Previous studies have documented that delayed antibiotic prescribing in respiratory infections results in good symptom control, reduced belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics, and fewer repeat consultations. We hypothesised that, compared with an immediate antibiotic prescription, other management strategies would result in worse symptom control, particularly in women asked to delay antibiotics empirically or while waiting for the result of midstream urine analysis.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of management using dipstick or clinical algorithms compared with the alternative management strategies (empirical antibiotic treatment, delayed prescribing, and targeted prescribing based on midstream urine results).

### Phage therapy for urinary tract infections: progress and challenges ahead [^113Sj4KX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of bacterial infection, affecting at least 150 million people annually worldwide based on epidemiological estimates over 2 decades ago, with recent estimates as high as 400 million. Half of women will have at least one UTI during their lifetime and of these ~ 30% will develop recurrent UTI (defined as symptomatic culture-proven UTI at least twice in 6 months or three times in a year). Recurrent UTI is associated with the development of intracellular bacterial reservoirs, which may serve as the nidus for subsequent infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent UTI is associated with repetitive and extended antibiotic use and poses significant therapeutic and public health issues owing to alarming increases in antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has been unable to keep up with the concerning rise in antibiotic resistance, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic options. Current vaccine trials for UTI have had limited impact. Here, we review the putative role of bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a therapeutic for UTI, highlight patient and microbiological factors that might impact successful treatment, and suggest reporting standards for future work to help to advance the field.

### Cost effectiveness of management strategies for urinary tract infections: results from randomised controlled trial [^1176LkpS]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections are common in female patients in general practice, and urine is the most frequently received specimen in microbiology laboratories. These common bacterial infections affect half of all women at least once in their lives. Clinical management strategies vary, with empirical antibiotics commonly used. Many practitioners, however, also use urinary dipstick results and request analysis of midstream urine samples. In over 62% of women presenting with suspected urinary tract infection, the diagnosis is laboratory confirmed. The use of dipsticks and clinical scoring algorithms can potentially help to improve the precision of diagnosis by improving the positive predictive values. It is unclear what effects different management strategies will have on the costs and cost effectiveness. We carried out an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to investigate the costs and cost effectiveness of the different management strategies for urinary tract infection.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute pyelonephritis [^115fxkfK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis refers to infection involving the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is diagnosed clinically and responds quickly to appropriate antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, the patient is immunocompromised, or for other reasons, microabscesses that form during the acute phase of pyelonephritis may coalesce, forming a renal abscess. Patients with underlying diabetes are more vulnerable to complications, including emphysematous pyelonephritis in addition to abscess formation. Additionally, diabetics may not have the typical flank tenderness that helps to differentiate pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract infection. Additional high-risk populations may include those with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, pregnancy, nosocomial infection, or infection by treatment-resistant pathogens. Treatment goals include symptom relief, elimination of infection to avoid renal damage, and identification of predisposing factors to avoid future recurrences. The primary imaging modalities used in patients with pyelonephritis are CT, MRI, and ultrasound. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infections across age groups [^1135JKJ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common outpatient infections, but predicting the probability of urinary tract infections through symptoms and test results can be complex. The most diagnostic symptoms of urinary tract infections include change in frequency, dysuria, urgency, and presence or absence of vaginal discharge, but urinary tract infections may present differently in older women. Dipstick urinalysis is popular for its availability and usefulness, but results must be interpreted in context of the patient's pretest probability based on symptoms and characteristics. In patients with a high probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms, negative dipstick urinalysis does not rule out urinary tract infection. Nitrites are likely more sensitive and specific than other dipstick components for urinary tract infection, particularly in the elderly. Positive dipstick testing is likely specific for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, but urine culture is still the test of choice. Microscopic urinalysis is likely comparable to dipstick urinalysis as a screening test. Bacteriuria is more specific and sensitive than pyuria for detecting urinary tract infection, even in older women and during pregnancy. Pyuria is commonly found in the absence of infection, particularly in older adults with lower urinary tract symptoms such as incontinence. Positive testing may increase the probability of urinary tract infection, but initiation of treatment should take into account risk of urinary tract infection based on symptoms as well. In cases in which the probability of urinary tract infection is moderate or unclear, urine culture should be performed. Urine culture is the gold standard for detection of urinary tract infection. However, asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, particularly in older women, and should not be treated with antibiotics. Conversely, in symptomatic women, even growth as low as 10² colony-forming unit/mL could reflect infection. Resistance is increasing to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Most uropathogens still display good sensitivity to nitrofurantoin. First-line treatments for urinary tract infection include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (when resistance levels are < 20%). These antibiotics have minimal collateral damage and resistance. In pregnancy, beta-lactams, nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be appropriate treatments. Interpreting the probability of urinary tract infection based on symptoms and testing allows for greater accuracy in diagnosis of urinary tract infection, decreasing overtreatment and encouraging antimicrobial stewardship.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

Selection of definitive antibiotic therapy for complicated UTI — In patients with confirmed complicated UTI, we suggest selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

THE CLINICAL LANDSCAPE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS

An estimated 400 million urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur each year globally, with over 200,000 associated deaths, making UTIs one of the most common bacterial diseases and drivers of antimicrobial usage. UTIs disproportionately affect women, up to 60% of whom experience at least one UTI in their lifetime. This association is generally attributed to anatomy, although hormonal factors also play an increasingly recognized role, including in relation to the vaginal microbiome. Traditionally, a UTI is defined by clinical signs and symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, pelvic or lower abdominal pain, pyuria, or urinary incontinence — often in combination with identification of an offending pathogen via urine culture. This symptom-based approach to UTIs can lack sensitivity or specificity in certain populations, including the very young and elderly, or individuals who are chronically catheterized, with urologic or neurologic abnormalities. For these patients, signs and symptoms can be ambiguous.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Current and emerging strategies to curb antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections [^113w9t1z]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria compromise patient outcomes and prolong hospital stays. Consequently, new strategies are needed to prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria. Over the past two decades, sizeable clinical efforts and research advances have changed urinary tract infection (UTI) treatment and prevention strategies to conserve antibiotic use. The emergence of antimicrobial stewardship, policies from national societies, and the development of new antimicrobials have shaped modern UTI practices. Future UTI management practices could be driven by the evolution of antimicrobial stewardship, improved and readily available diagnostics, and an improved understanding of how the microbiome affects UTI. Forthcoming UTI treatment and prevention strategies could employ novel bactericidal compounds, combinations of new and classic antimicrobials that enhance bacterial killing, medications that prevent bacterial attachment to uroepithelial cells, repurposing drugs, and vaccines to curtail the rising rates of antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic bacteria and improve outcomes in people with UTI.

### Diagnostic value of symptoms and signs for identifying urinary tract infection in older adult outpatients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113LV38Z]. The Journal of Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Evidence from included studies suggests that a number of symptoms and signs traditionally thought to be associated with UTI, may be of limited diagnostic value in older adults. This review highlights the complexity of diagnosing UTI in older adults, and the breadth of their clinical presentations. The results of this review are based on evidence from studies of variable quality and therefore should be treated with caution. Further high quality studies, with large numbers of participants, need to be performed to corroborate these findings. This would assist clinicians with prompt and accurate diagnosis of true UTI, encouraging appropriate treatment with antimicrobials. Clarity in this area may also help clinicians to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, reducing inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions for the latter condition, thereby improving antimicrobial stewardship. It is unclear how application of information from this review might translate into improved diagnostic rates of UTI in older adults or improve appropriate antimicrobial prescribing.

Self-treatment with antibiotics for recurrent UTI — Self-treatment can be paired with standing physician orders for urine culture before and possibly after treatment, but compared with continuous prophylaxis it is associated with a higher rate of infection (2.2 UTI per year vs 0.2 UTI per year). Self-treatment is an option for women with the ability to reliably recognize UTI symptoms and start antibiotics, those not suitable for long-term prophylaxis, or those who do not wish to take long-term therapy, and patients should contact their clinician if symptoms progress or fail to resolve within 48 hours. Fluoroquinolones are not preferred agents for self-treatment regimens, and we recommend use of other agents whenever possible.

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^113LH3ve]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114XF3PN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — patient education and shared decision-making emphasizes framing care beyond empiric antibiotics. It is reasonable to consider an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of rUTI as one of shared decision-making, in which patients are educated about the inaccuracy of diagnostic testing, the benefits and potential risks of antimicrobial use, and alternatives to standard antibiotic treatment, and we suggest documentation of the education provided and informed consent discussion. Many patients and providers do not know that localized cystitis typically is self-limited and rarely progresses to more severe disease, which can help define goals of care around symptom amelioration, prevention of long-term complications, and more appropriate antibiotic use.

### Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract infection recurrences in a large integrated US healthcare system [^115tHio8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance limits antibiotic options for outpatient treatment of UTIs and renders antibiotic treatment less effective. As repeated UTIs are a major cause of antibiotic resistance, a better understanding of uropathogens responsible for recurrence is needed. Importantly, given that antibiotic therapy for UTI is empiric and uropathogens increasingly demonstrate nonsusceptibility, continuously updated data on susceptibility patterns are critical to guide appropriate antibiotic prescribing as well as to inform interventions to prevent UTI recurrence. As the degree of resistance to the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for UTI evolves over time and may vary by region, it is also important to continuously monitor the local prevalence of uropathogens and their susceptibility to guide appropriate antibiotic use.

### Role of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infection management: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^114SJE14]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections and recurrent urinary tract infections pose substantial burdens on patients and healthcare systems. Testing and treatment strategies are increasingly important in the age of antibiotic resistance and stewardship.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of urinary tract infection testing and treatment strategies with a focus on antibiotic resistance.

Study Design

We designed a decision tree to model the following 4 strategies for managing urinary tract infections: (1) empirical antibiotics first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics if symptoms persist; (2) urine culture first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics; (3) urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist; and (4) symptomatic treatment first, followed by culture-directed antibiotics, if symptoms persist. To model both patient- and society-level concerns, we built 3 versions of this model with different outcome measures: quality-adjusted life-years, symptom-free days, and antibiotic courses given. Societal cost of antibiotic resistance was modeled for each course of antibiotics given. The probability of urinary tract infection and the level of antibiotic resistance were modeled from 0% to 100%. We also extended the model to account for patients requiring catheterization for urine specimen collection.

Results

In our model, the antibiotic resistance rate was based either on the local antibiotic resistance patterns for patients presenting with sporadic urinary tract infections or on rate of resistance from prior urine cultures for patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. With the base case assumption of 20% antibiotic resistance, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy and maximized symptom-free days. However, empirical antibiotics was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was below 6%, whereas symptomatic treatment was the most cost-effective strategy when antibiotic resistance was above 80%. To minimize antibiotic use, symptomatic treatment first was always the best strategy followed by urine culture first. Sensitivity analyses with other input parameters did not affect the cost-effectiveness results. When we extended the model to include an office visit for catheterized urine specimens, empirical antibiotics became the most cost-effective option.

Conclusion

We developed models for urinary tract infection management strategies that can be interpreted for patients initially presenting with urinary tract infections or those with recurrent urinary tract infections. Our results suggest that, in most cases, urine culture at the same time as empirical antibiotics is the most cost-effective strategy and maximizes symptom-free days. Empirical antibiotics first should only be considered if the expected antibiotic resistance is very low. If antibiotic resistance is expected to be very high, symptomatic treatment is the best strategy and minimizes antibiotic use.

### Recurrent urinary tract infections in women: diagnosis and management [^111PCAzk]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections, presenting as dysuria or irritative voiding symptoms, are most commonly caused by reinfection with the original bacterial isolate in young, otherwise healthy women with no anatomic or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract. Frequency of sexual intercourse is the strongest predictor of recurrent urinary tract infections in patients presenting with recurrent dysuria. In those who have comorbid conditions or other predisposing factors, recurrent complicated urinary tract infections represent a risk for ascending infection or urosepsis. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in all patient groups, but Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus, and other organisms are more common in patients with certain risk factors for complicated urinary tract infections. A positive urine culture with greater than 102 colony-forming units per mL is the standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections in symptomatic patients, although culture is often unnecessary for diagnosing typical symptomatic infection. Women with recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections can be treated with continuous or postcoital prophylactic antibiotics; other treatment options include self-started antibiotics, cranberry products, and behavioral modification. Patients at risk of complicated urinary tract infections are best managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, urine culture to guide subsequent therapy, and renal imaging studies if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^113YNbiD]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guidelines Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology and infectious diseases. The working group conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library of studies published until December 2024. Search terms included: urinary tract infection/UTI, complicated, complex, atypical, urinary tract abnormality/anomaly, recurrent/recurrence, chronic renal/kidney disease/failure, immunosuppression, adolescent, child, pediatric, infant, neonate/neonatal, definition, investigations, diagnosis, treatment, management, antibiotics, prophylaxis and imaging. Studies were included for review if they involved children under 18 years with any definition of cUTI and excluded if they focused solely on uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) or adults. Types of included studies were reviews, trials, comparative and cohort studies and existing guidelines were also reviewed for references. Four key controversies were identified from experience and available literature: definition of cUTI, investigations, treatment and follow-up. Evaluation of evidence quality and formulation of recommendations used GRADE methodology. After assessment of the literature on definition, cUTIs were categorized into 5 main subgroups, and respective management guidelines were formulated from the graded evidence by working group consensus.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^115GwfrB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that can result in significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy has, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to try to determine, from the best available evidence from randomized control trials, which agent is most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2003) and reference lists of articles were searched.

Selection Criteria

All trials were considered where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight studies were included, recruiting a total of 905 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between studied treatments with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. Only when cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, were there better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and less recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group, but the sample size is insufficient to ensure that differences found in the effect of the drugs were real.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific treatment regimen for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of outcomes measured. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to try to detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

### Quality appraisal of clinical guidelines for recurrent urinary tract infections using AGREE II: a systematic review [^113WX9RR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Of the eight CPGs identified for the assessment and treatment of recurrent UTI, our multidisciplinary review team could only recommend two as being of sufficiently high quality for use without adjustment. Another three were also considered to be of high quality, but these could only be recommended with modifications. This illustrates the need to improve CPG development on this topic. In line with previous evaluations, the scope and purpose and clarity of presentation domains had the highest scores, while the stakeholder involvement and applicability domains had the lowest scores.

The domains requiring further attention from CPG developers are discussed below.

Domain 2: Stakeholder involvement

It is important that the CPG development group includes professionals from all relevant groups, clearly defines CPG users, and seeks the views and thoughts of the target population. This could be achieved throughout a discussion meeting with patients, including patients in the development group or as external referents. Ideally, these patients should be trained to perform these tasks. Five CPGs in this review did consider patients' views during their development, but none reported those views. Simply providing the patients views and thoughts in a supplement helps with this issue. Further improvement for example could be to add "patient recommended" under the levels of evidence.

Domain 3: Rigour of development

Developmental rigour, including adequate assessment of the level of evidence of recommendations, probably influences the content of a CPG the most. We found various methods for reporting the evidence levels and grading recommendations among the included CPGs, which had the potential to hinder the user's ability to compare recommendations. GRADE provides a rigorous and explicit framework for rating the quality of evidence and strength of a recommendation, and its use could help to improve the quality of a CPG. Moreover, it is widely adopted and could be used as a standard for developing CPGs.

Consistent with a previous AGREE review, updating procedures were poorly reported, underlining the need for this to change. There has been little research into the time frame for updating CPGs, but intervals between 1 and 5 years have been suggested. Given that studies regarding prevention and diagnostics for recurrent UTI are far less common than those for studies regarding other pathology (e.g. malignancy), we decided that 5 years is an acceptable time frame. On that basis, six of the eight included CPGs may be considered up to date. Updating a whole guideline is an intensive and time-consuming process. Topics and recommendations often differ in the terms of the need for updating; therefore, partial updating seems like a logical solution.

### Treatments for symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy [^114swyqX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis, are serious complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is a large number of drugs, and combination of them, available to treat urinary tract infections, most of them tested in non-pregnant women. Attempts to define the optimal antibiotic regimen for pregnancy have, therefore, been problematic.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine, from the best available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which agent is the most effective for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy in terms of cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery and premature rupture of membranes, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic, and incidence of prolonged pyrexia.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (November 2009) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We considered all trials where the intention was to allocate participants randomly to one of at least two alternative treatments for any symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 10 studies, recruiting a total of 1125 pregnant women. In most of the comparisons there were no significant differences between the treatments under study with regard to cure rates, recurrent infection, incidence of preterm delivery, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, need for change of antibiotic and incidence of prolonged pyrexia. When cefuroxime and cephradine were compared, there were better cure rates (29/49 versus 41/52) and fewer recurrences (20/49 versus 11/52) in the cefuroxime group. There was only one other statistically significant difference when comparing outpatient versus inpatient treatment. Gestational age at birth was greater in women from the outpatient group (38.86 versus 37.21), while birthweight was on average greater in the inpatient group (3120 versus 2659).

Authors' Conclusions

Although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. All the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. Complications were very rare. All included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. Future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113EKioz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Follow-up evaluation in recurrent urinary tract infection — clinicians should repeat urine cultures to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy (Expert Opinion). After initiating antimicrobial therapy for UTI, clinical cure is expected within three to seven days, and it is reasonable to repeat microbiological assessment if UTI symptoms persist beyond seven days. Although a second antibiotic can be given empirically, this should only be done after a urine sample is obtained to minimize unnecessary treatment when laboratory data is inconsistent with persistent infection.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115K3ua3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) values and preferences — The panel states that most patients would wish to receive antimicrobial therapy for ASB if benefits outweigh harms, but where treatment is unlikely to confer a benefit, risks including adverse drug effects, CDI, and antimicrobial resistance suggest most would not wish to receive antimicrobial treatment. From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^116BugNg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

Regarding medical management for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to administer ciprofloxacin only if the local resistance is < 10% and:

- the entire treatment is given PO

- patient does not require hospitalization

- patient has anaphylaxis to β-lactam antibiotics.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis in women: a 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [^1132XuuX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Effectiveness of five different approaches in management of urinary tract infection: randomised controlled trial [^114eitib]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the impact of different management strategies in urinary tract infections.

Design Randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care.

Participants 309 non-pregnant women aged 18–70 presenting with suspected urinary tract infection.

Intervention Patients were randomised to five management approaches: empirical antibiotics; empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics; or targeted antibiotics based on a symptom score (two or more of urine cloudiness, urine smell, nocturia, or dysuria), a dipstick result (nitrite or both leucocytes and blood), or a positive result on midstream urine analysis. Self help advice was controlled in each group.

Main outcome measures Symptom severity (days 2 to 4) and duration, and use of antibiotics.

Results Patients had 3.5 days of moderately bad symptoms if they took antibiotics immediately. There were no significant differences in duration or severity of symptoms (mean frequency of symptoms on a 0 to 6 scale: immediate antibiotics 2.15, midstream urine 2.08, dipstick 1.74, symptom score 1.77, delayed antibiotics 2.11; likelihood ratio test for the five groups P = 0.177). There were differences in antibiotic use (immediate antibiotics 97%, midstream urine 81%, dipstick 80%, symptom score 90%, delayed antibiotics 77%; P = 0.011) and in sending midstream urine samples (immediate antibiotics 23%, midstream urine 89%, dipstick 36%, symptom score 33%, delayed antibiotics 15%; P < 0.001). Patients who waited at least 48 hours to start taking antibiotics reconsulted less (hazard ratio 0.57 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.89), P = 0.014) but on average had symptoms for 37% longer than those taking immediate antibiotics (incident rate ratio 1.37 (1.11 to 1.68), P = 0.003), particularly the midstream urine group (73% longer, 22% to 140%; none of the other groups had more than 22% longer duration).

Conclusion All management strategies achieve similar symptom control. There is no advantage in routinely sending midstream urine samples for testing, and antibiotics targeted with dipstick tests with a delayed prescription as backup, or empirical delayed prescription, can help to reduce antibiotic use.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113XstJL]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment not diagnosis — are defined by clinical presentation suggesting infection extending beyond the bladder with fever, other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or hemodynamic instability), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is encompassed in complicated UTI. UTI with systemic symptoms associated with transurethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization is encompassed in complicated UTI. Patients with complicated UTIs may have an indwelling urinary catheter, neurogenic bladder, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention as an underlying condition, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.
