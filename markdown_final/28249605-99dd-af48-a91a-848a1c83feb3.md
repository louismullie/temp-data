## Question

Blood glucose ranges in the hospital patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood glucose ranges in hospitalized patients, including definitions of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, ICU versus non-ICU targets, special populations, monitoring cadence, and how to individualize goals. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching consensus on inpatient glycemic targets. Then, I should verify the standard definitions of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Next, I will distinguish ICU from non-ICU targets and the rationale. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios like perioperative care, nutrition support, and high hypoglycemia risk. Finally, I will review monitoring frequency, safety thresholds, and how to individualize targets, and I will close with a concise synthesis that aligns with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the consensus framework so I don't jump to conclusions: contemporary guidelines converge on a pragmatic, safety-first approach with a default target of 140–180 mg/dL in most hospitalized adults, allowing 100–180 mg/dL in non-ICU settings when achievable without hypoglycemia, and avoiding targets below 110 mg/dL due to excess hypoglycemia without outcome benefit [^f3ec6c79] [^114c81a8] [^cbdb9cb5].

> I need to verify the definitions next. Hyperglycemia in the hospital is defined as blood glucose greater than 140 mg/dL, and treatment is generally indicated when glucose is persistently at or above 180 mg/dL, which is the threshold to initiate or intensify insulin in most patients [^3d4bac2b] [^29c6c442]. For hypoglycemia, level 1 is 54–69 mg/dL, level 2 is less than 54 mg/dL, and level 3 is a clinical event requiring assistance; levels 2 and 3 warrant immediate intervention, and level 1 should be treated promptly to prevent progression [^3d4bac2b].

> Now, critically ill ICU patients: I should confirm the default target and the caveat about tighter control. The standard target after initiating insulin is 140–180 mg/dL, with more stringent 110–140 mg/dL considered only in selected ICU patients using validated protocols and frequent monitoring, and targets below 110 mg/dL are not recommended due to increased hypoglycemia without consistent mortality benefit [^f3ec6c79] [^4bb5cecd] [^6fc8d8b5]. Wait, let me verify the evidence signal: large multicenter trials and meta-analyses show no mortality advantage for intensive 80–110 mg/dL targets and higher severe hypoglycemia, reinforcing the conservative stance [^f1b1c445] [^e7262d9c].

> For non-critically ill inpatients, I should double-check the default and the lower bound. The recommended target is 100–180 mg/dL if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, with 140–180 mg/dL as the most conservative and widely applicable range; premeal targets less than 140 mg/dL are reasonable in stable patients with prior tight control, but less stringent targets may be needed in those with limited life expectancy or high hypoglycemia risk [^f3ec6c79] [^114c81a8] [^cbdb9cb5]. Hold on, I should verify the initiation threshold: persistent hyperglycemia at or above 180 mg/dL confirmed on two occasions within 24 hours is the trigger to start or intensify insulin in most non-ICU adults [^29c6c442].

> Next, I should review special populations and scenarios. Perioperative patients with diabetes should aim for 100–180 mg/dL preoperatively when feasible, ideally 1–4 hours before surgery, aligning with Endocrine Society and ADA guidance [^0172bb46] [^6567206b]. For patients receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition, a target of 140–180 mg/dL is recommended by A.S.P.E.N. given the risk of both hyperglycemia and iatrogenic hypoglycemia during nutrition support [^5298034d] [^ee850c9a]. For high hypoglycemia risk or complex comorbidity, higher individualized targets such as 140–200 mg/dL may be appropriate, balancing safety over tightness [^cbdb9cb5].

> I will now examine monitoring cadence because timing affects safety and titration. In ICU patients on IV insulin, glucose should be checked every 1–2 hours initially until stable, then every 2–4 hours, and more frequently if unstable; in non-ICU patients who are eating, premeal and bedtime checks are standard, and if NPO, every 4–6 hours; for IV insulin, some protocols require checks as often as every 30 minutes during titration [^f0b6c530] [^d77146ae]. Wait, let me verify the CGM point: continuous glucose monitoring can be considered in selected high-risk inpatients with confirmatory POC for dosing, but it is not yet standard of care and requires institutional protocols and training [^11ac0c8e] [^502d97f3].

> But wait, what if the patient is on steroids, has renal failure, or is elderly with erratic intake? I need to ensure individualization is explicit. Targets should be adjusted for hypoglycemia risk, life expectancy, comorbidity burden, and care setting capabilities; for example, in terminal illness or when frequent monitoring is not feasible, accepting higher ranges may be safer, whereas in stable, younger patients with good prior control, aiming toward 100–140 mg/dL may be reasonable if hypoglycemia risk is low [^cbdb9cb5] [^f3ec6c79]. Hold on, I should verify that this principle is consistent across ADA and AACE: yes, both endorse tailoring within the 100–180 mg/dL window based on patient factors and safety [^f3ec6c79] [^cbdb9cb5].

> Next, I should review safety thresholds and when to modify therapy. If glucose falls below 100 mg/dL, I should reassess the regimen for overtreatment risk, and if below 70 mg/dL, I must modify insulin and address contributors; repeated hypoglycemia should trigger regimen simplification, de-intensification, or enhanced monitoring to prevent recurrence [^f3ec6c79] [^78ee63cf]. I need to ensure I note that severe hypoglycemia is independently associated with worse outcomes, reinforcing the principle to prioritize hypoglycemia avoidance even if it means accepting slightly higher average glucose [^8f2a20bc].

> Let me synthesize succinctly so nothing is missed. Default inpatient targets: 140–180 mg/dL for most adults, with 100–180 mg/dL acceptable in non-ICU settings when safe; ICU default is 140–180 mg/dL with consideration of 110–140 mg/dL only in select patients using validated protocols; initiate or intensify insulin at or above 180 mg/dL confirmed on two occasions; treat hypoglycemia at less than 70 mg/dL and avoid targets below 110 mg/dL due to harm from hypoglycemia; individualize based on comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, and care setting, and monitor with POC glucose or CGM where appropriate with confirmatory checks for dosing [^f3ec6c79] [^114c81a8] [^29c6c442] [^3d4bac2b] [^11ac0c8e].

---

In the hospital, **target glucose is 140–180 mg/dL** for most critically ill patients [^f3ec6c79] and 100–180 mg/dL for non-critically ill patients, balancing benefits and hypoglycemia risk [^114c81a8]. Hyperglycemia is defined as **> 140 mg/dL** [^3d4bac2b], and treatment is indicated when persistent glucose is ≥ 180 mg/dL [^29c6c442]. Hypoglycemia is **< 70 mg/dL** [^3d4bac2b], with level 2 hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dL requiring immediate intervention [^3d4bac2b]. Individualize targets for patients at high hypoglycemia risk, terminal illness, or severe comorbidities, and use insulin as first-line therapy with structured monitoring and protocols to minimize hypoglycemia [^cbdb9cb5] [^f3ec6c79].

## Definitions of glucose abnormalities

Standard definitions guide **clinical decision-making**:

| **Category** | **Definition** |
|-|-|
| Hyperglycemia | Blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) [^3d4bac2b] |
| Persistent hyperglycemia | ≥ 2 glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) within 24 hours [^29c6c442] |

## Glycemic targets in hospitalized patients

Glycemic targets **vary by clinical setting and patient condition**:

---

### Critically ill patients (ICU)

For most critically ill patients, the **target glucose range** is 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) [^f3ec6c79] [^4bb5cecd]. More stringent targets (110–140 mg/dL) may be considered for selected patients if achievable without significant hypoglycemia [^6fc8d8b5]. Intravenous insulin infusion is the **preferred method** for glycemic control, with frequent glucose monitoring (every 1–2 hours) [^f0b6c530].

---

### Non-critically ill patients (general medical-surgical wards)

For most non-critically ill patients, the **target glucose range** is 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia [^114c81a8] [^f3ec6c79]. Basal-bolus insulin regimens are preferred, and sliding-scale insulin alone is discouraged [^d1bd9ea0] [^a8f2a14f].

---

### Special populations and clinical scenarios

- **Perioperative patients**: Target glucose 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) [^0172bb46].
- **Patients receiving enteral/parenteral nutrition**: Target glucose 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) [^5298034d].
- **High hypoglycemia risk patients**: Higher targets (140–200 mg/dL) may be appropriate [^cbdb9cb5].

---

## Risks associated with hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia

Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are associated with **adverse outcomes**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Increased risk of infections, prolonged hospital stay, and higher mortality [^9beea7e4] [^4437f0cc].
- **Hypoglycemia**: Associated with increased mortality, cardiovascular events, and cognitive impairment [^8f2a20bc] [^f1b1c445].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Effective inpatient glycemic management **requires**:

- **Frequent glucose monitoring**: Point-of-care testing before meals and at bedtime; every 4–6 hours if NPO [^f0b6c530].
- **Structured insulin protocols**: Basal-bolus regimens with correction insulin [^d1bd9ea0].
- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Consider in high-risk patients or when available [^11ac0c8e] [^502d97f3].
- **Hypoglycemia prevention**: Individualize targets, adjust insulin regimens, and educate staff [^78ee63cf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical setting** | **Target glucose range** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Critically ill (ICU) | 140–180 mg/dL | - IV insulin infusion <br/> - Frequent monitoring |
| Non-critically ill | 100–180 mg/dL | Basal-bolus insulin regimen |
| Perioperative | 100–180 mg/dL | Preoperative target |
| Enteral/parenteral nutrition | 140–180 mg/dL | Nutrition support |
| High hypoglycemia risk | 140–200 mg/dL | Individualized targets |

---

In the hospital, **target glucose is 140–180 mg/dL** for most critically ill patients and 100–180 mg/dL for non-critically ill patients, with individualized adjustments based on patient characteristics and clinical context.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — blood glucose targets during nutrition support in adult hospitalized patients: We recommend a target blood glucose goal range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L) (Grade: Strong). Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients, both in the ICU and the non-ICU setting, and although a consensus conference recommended that blood glucose concentrations in hospitalized patients be maintained below 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), more recent large clinical trials failed to show benefit when such an aggressive target was achieved and the largest randomized controlled trial found a higher mortality with intensive treatment compared with those treated to a target blood glucose range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L).

### Glucose management in hospitalized patients [^58a7e294]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Glucose management in hospitalized patients poses challenges to physicians, including identifying blood glucose targets, judicious use of oral diabetes mellitus medications, and implementing appropriate insulin regimens. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels can lead to deleterious effects on wound healing, increased risk of infection, and delays in surgical procedures or discharge from the hospital. Previously recommended strict blood glucose targets for hospitalized patients result in more cases of hypoglycemia without improvement in patient outcomes. The current target is 140 to 180 mg per dL. Use of oral diabetes medications, particularly metformin, in hospitalized patients is controversial. Multiple guidelines recommend stopping these medications at admission because of inpatient factors that can increase the risk of renal or hepatic failure. However, oral diabetes medications have important nonglycemic benefits and reduce the risk of widely fluctuating blood glucose levels. There is no proven risk of lactic acidosis from metformin in patients with normal kidney function, and it can be used safely in many hospitalized patients with diabetes. Insulin dosing depends on the patient's previous experience with insulin, baseline diabetes control, and renal function. Other considerations include the patient's current oral intake, comorbidities, and other medications. Many patients can be managed using only a basal insulin dose, whereas others benefit from additional short-acting premeal doses. Historically, sliding scale insulin regimens have been used, but they have no proven benefit, increase the risk of hypoglycemia and large fluctuations in blood glucose levels, and are not recommended. Discharge planning is an important opportunity to address diabetes control, medication adherence, and outpatient follow-up.

### Inpatient management of diabetes mellitus [^6161f0ef]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There is now widespread appreciation of the importance of maintaining glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible among outpatients with diabetes. However, the importance of tight glucose control in inpatients is less well established. During the past several years, it has become apparent that hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, especially those in the postoperative setting, is associated with poorer outcomes. In addition, two randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with intensive glucose management in acutely ill patients. Based on these studies and our own experience, we propose guidelines and a framework for improving the glycemic control of hospitalized patients.

Background

Hyperglycemia is a frequent occurrence in adult hospitalized patients who receive nutrition support. Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (resulting from attempts to correct hyperglycemia) are associated with adverse outcomes in diabetic as well as nondiabetic patients. This American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Clinical Guideline summarizes the most current evidence and provides guidelines for the desired blood glucose goal range in hospitalized patients receiving nutrition support, the definition of hypoglycemia, and the rationale for use of diabetes-specific enteral formulas in hospitalized patients.

Method

A systematic review of the best available evidence to answer a series of questions regarding glucose control in adults receiving parenteral or enteral nutrition was undertaken and evaluated using concepts adopted from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. A consensus process was used to develop the clinical guideline recommendations prior to external and internal review and approval by the A.S.P.E.N. Board of Directors.

Results/Conclusions

1. What is the desired blood glucose goal range in adult hospitalized patients receiving nutrition support? We recommend a target blood glucose goal range of 140–180 mg/dL (7.8–10 mmol/L). (Strong) 2. How is hypoglycemia defined in adult hospitalized patients receiving nutrition support? We recommend that hypoglycemia be defined as a blood glucose concentration of < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L). (Strong) 3. Should diabetes-specific enteral formulas be used for adult hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia? We cannot make a recommendation at this time.

### Clinical review: consensus recommendations on measurement of blood glucose and reporting glycemic control in critically ill adults [^ad6e2f90]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The management reporting and assessment of glycemic control lacks standardization. The use of different methods to measure the blood glucose concentration and to report the performance of insulin treatment yields major disparities and complicates the interpretation and comparison of clinical trials. We convened a meeting of 16 experts plus invited observers from industry to discuss and where possible reach consensus on the most appropriate methods to measure and monitor blood glucose in critically ill patients and on how glycemic control should be assessed and reported. Where consensus could not be reached, recommendations on further research and data needed to reach consensus in the future were suggested. Recognizing their clear conflict of interest, industry observers played no role in developing the consensus or recommendations from the meeting. Consensus recommendations were agreed for the measurement and reporting of glycemic control in clinical trials and for the measurement of blood glucose in clinical practice. Recommendations covered the following areas: How should we measure and report glucose control when intermittent blood glucose measurements are used? What are the appropriate performance standards for intermittent blood glucose monitors in the ICU? Continuous or automated intermittent glucose monitoring - methods and technology: can we use the same measures for assessment of glucose control with continuous and intermittent monitoring? What is acceptable performance for continuous glucose monitoring systems? If implemented, these recommendations have the potential to minimize the discrepancies in the conduct and reporting of clinical trials and to improve glucose control in clinical practice. Furthermore, to be fit for use, glucose meters and continuous monitoring systems must match their performance to fit the needs of patients and clinicians in the intensive care setting.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^7f72c938]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes, intervention to normalize glycemia has yielded inconsistent results. Indeed, recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to showa significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control or have even shown increased mortality risk. Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts. These outcomes have contributed to confusion regarding specific glycemic targets and the means for achieving them in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients.

Recognizing the importance of glycemic control across the continuum of care, the AACE and the ADA joined forces to develop this updated consensus statement on inpatient glycemic management. The central goals were to identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and to describe the protocols, procedures, and system improvements needed to facilitate their implementation. This document is addressed to health care professionals, supporting staff, hospital administrators, and other stakeholders focused on improved management of hyperglycemia in inpatient settings. Consensus panel members extensively reviewed the most current literature and considered the following questions:
Does improving glycemic control improve clinical outcomes for inpatients with hyperglycemia?
What glycemic targets can be recommended in different patient populations?
What treatment options are available for achieving optimal glycemic targets safely and effectively in specific clinical situations?
Does inpatient management of hyperglycemia represent a safety concern?
What systems need to be in place to achieve these recommendations?
Is treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia cost-effective?
What are the optimal strategies for transition to outpatient care?
What are areas for future research?

### Advances in the management of hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus during hospitalization [^9beea7e4]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes mellitus, which affects over 537 million people worldwide, considerably increases the risk of emergency room visits and admissions to hospital. Inpatient hyperglycaemia in patients with or without diabetes mellitus is associated with higher rates of complications, extended hospital stays and increased mortality when compared with patients with normoglycaemia. The American Diabetes Association recommends a target range of 5.6–10.0mmol/l (100-180mg/dl) for levels of glucose in the blood of patients in intensive care units (ICUs), as well as in general medicine and surgery. Insulin therapy remains the cornerstone of managing inpatient hyperglycaemia, with intravenous insulin preferred in ICU and basal-bolus regimens favoured in non-ICU settings. While bedside capillary blood glucose monitoring is standard for adjusting insulin doses, continuous glucose monitoring provides a more comprehensive glycaemic assessment and enhances the prevention of hypoglycaemia in high-risk hospitalized patients. This Review outlines the latest evidence in managing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycaemia within hospitals.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^76b8851a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Hyperglycemia management in adults without prior diabetes hospitalized for noncritical illness — Recommendation 10.1: We suggest initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy (defined as basal or basal/bolus insulin) to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L) in those with hyperglycemia [defined as blood glucose (BG) > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)] during hospitalization; for patients with persistent hyperglycemia [≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose (POC-BG) measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥ 10.0 mmol/L) in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone], we suggest the addition of scheduled insulin therapy.

a. Definition of glucose abnormalities in the hospital setting.

Hyperglycemia has been defined as any blood glucose > 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this may require treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated blood glucose may be due to "stress hyperglycemia", a condition that can be established by a review of prior records or measurement of an A1C. A1C values > 6.5% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization. Hypoglycemia has been defined as any blood glucose < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many as < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/l), although this is lower than the ∼50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l]) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

i. Critically ill patients.

Based on the weight of the available evidence, for the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia, with a starting threshold of ≤ 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l). Once intravenous insulin is started, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dl (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/l). Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. However, targets < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of hypoglycemia, are highly recommended.

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some, but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) For non–critically ill patients, there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucoses < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoids therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized adult patients in non-critical care settings: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0f2dffb9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation 10.1 — adults with no prior history of diabetes hospitalized for noncritical illness: we suggest initial therapy with correctional insulin over scheduled insulin therapy for hyperglycemia [defined as BG > 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)] to maintain glucose targets in the range of 100 to 180 mg/ dL (5.6 to 10.0 mmol/L); for patients with persistent hyperglycemia [≥ 2 POC-BG measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL (≥ 10.0 mmol/L) in a 24-hour period], we suggest the addition of scheduled insulin therapy.

2. Glycemic targets in hospitalized patients

There is relatively strong evidence from randomized controlled trials for a glycemic target of blood glucose < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) in surgical patients in critical care units. However, in several studies of critically ill medical patients, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 40 mg/dl) was approximately threefold greater in intensively treated patients. The identification of hypoglycemia as an independent risk factor for death in the medical ICU population may merit caution in widely promoting the 80–110 mg/dl target range for all critically ill populations.

For patients in general medical-surgical units, the evidence for specific glycemic goals is less definitive. Epidemiologic and physiologic data suggest that higher blood glucose levels are associated with worse outcomes, but whether glucose is simply a marker of the severity of underlying illness or a mediator of adverse outcomes is unclear. Glycemic targets similar to those of outpatients may be difficult to achieve in the hospital due to the effects of stress hyperglycemia, altered nutritional intake, and multiple interruptions to medical care. Blood glucose levels shown to be associated with improved outcomes in these patients (fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all blood glucose readings < 180–200 mg/dl) would appear reasonable, if they can be safely achieved.

In both the critical care and noncritical care venue, glycemic goals must take into account the individual patient's situation as well as hospital system support for achieving these goals. A continuous quality improvement strategy may facilitate gradual improvement in mean glycemia hospital wide.

### Assessing inpatient glycemic control: what are the next steps? [^069685a4]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the emergence of glucometrics (i.e., systematic analysis of data on blood glucose levels of inpatients) as a subject of high interest, there remains a lack of standardization on how glucose parameters are measured and reported. This dilemma must be resolved before a national benchmarking process can be developed that will allow institutions to track and compare inpatient glucose control performance against established guidelines and that can also be supported by quality care organizations. In this article, we review some of the questions that need to be resolved through consensus and review of the evidence, and discuss some of the limitations in analyzing and reporting inpatient glucose data that must be addressed (or at least accepted as limitations) before hospitals can commit resources to gathering, compiling, and presenting inpatient glucose statistics as a health care quality measure. Standards must include consensus on which measures to report, the unit of analysis, definitions of targets for hyperglycemia treatment, a definition of hypoglycemia, determination of how data should be gathered (from chart review or from laboratory information systems), and which type of sample (blood or point of care) should be used for analysis of glycemic control. Hospitals and/or their representatives should be included in the discussion. For inpatient glucose control to remain a focus of interest, further dialogue and consensus on the topic are needed.

### Executive summary: standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^79962cbd]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes Care in the Hospital

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) Non–critically ill patients: there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucose levels < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

Treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients

On the basis of the available evidence, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia in the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, with a starting threshold of no higher than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l). Once IV insulin therapy has been initiated, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dl (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/l). Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. Targets < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l), however, are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, is highly recommended.

Treatment of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill patients

With no prospective, RCT data for establishing specific guidelines in noncritically ill patients, our recommendations are based on clinical experience and judgment. For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, premeal glucose targets should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunctionwith random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), as long as these targets can be safely achieved. For avoidance of hypoglycemia, consideration should be given to reassessing the insulin regimen if BG levels decline below 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). Modification of the regimen is necessary when BG values are < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l), unless the event is easily explained by other factors (such as a missed meal).

Occasional clinically stable patients with a prior history of successful tight glycemic control in the outpatient setting may be maintained with a glucose range below the aforementioned cut points. In contrast, higher glucose ranges may be acceptable in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities, as well as in those in patient-care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible.

We emphasize that clinical judgment in combination with ongoing assessment of the patient's clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose measures, the severity of illness, the nutritional status, or the concurrent use of medications that might affect glucose levels (for example, corticosteroids or octreotide), must be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

I. Critically ill patients

Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of no greater than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l).
Once insulin therapy has been started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients.
Intravenous insulin infusions are the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glycemic control in critically ill patients.
Validated insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, and with low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, are recommended.
With IV insulin therapy, frequent glucose monitoring is essential to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia and to achieve optimal glucose control.

II. Noncritically ill patients

For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, the premeal BG target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunction with random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved.
More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control.
Less stringent targets may be appropriate in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities.
Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin, with basal, nutritional, and correction components, is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control.
Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is discouraged.
Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents are not appropriate in most hospitalized patients who require therapy for hyperglycemia.
Clinical judgment and ongoing assessment of clinical status must be incorporated into day-to-day decisions regarding treatment of hyperglycemia.

III. Safety issues

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety concerns.
Education of hospital personnel is essential in engaging the support of those involved in the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.
Caution is required in interpreting results of POC glucose meters in patients with anemia, polycythemia, hypoperfusion, or use of some medications.
Buy-in and financial support from hospital administration are required for promoting a rational systems approach to inpatient glycemic management.

IV. Cost

Appropriate inpatient management of hyperglycemia is cost-effective.

V. Discharge planning

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting should begin at the time of hospital admission.
Discharge planning, patient education, and clear communication with outpatient providers are critical for ensuring a safe and successful transition to outpatient glycemic management.

VI. Needed research

A selected number of research questions and topics for guiding the management of inpatient hyperglycemia in various hospital settings are proposed.

Inpatient diabetes management — noncritically ill targets and insulin therapy: For most noncritically ill persons in the hospital setting, a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended; a lower target range (100 to 140 mg/dL) may be reasonable when glycemic control can be achieved without hypoglycemia, whereas less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity, terminal illness, limited life expectancy, or high risk for hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy following approved protocols is recommended as the preferred therapy for managing hyperglycemia in the hospital, and for noncritically ill persons with T2D, an individualized approach is recommended and may include consideration of noninsulin agents alone or in combination with insulin. For hospitalized persons with satisfactory oral intake, the insulin regimen should include basal, prandial, and correction doses; for those without adequate food intake, basal, prandial, and correction doses should be used as necessary, and extensive use of "sliding-scale" insulin should only be used for those whose glucose are in the target range most of the time, and only occasionally exceed it.

### Management of diabetes and hyperglycemia in the hospital: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^dc7e0621]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Inpatient hyperglycemia is common among adults, and management varies.

Purpose

To systematically identify guidelines on inpatient hyperglycemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, and specialty society websites were searched from 1 January 2010 to 14 August 2024.

Study Selection

Clinical practice guidelines pertaining to blood glucose management in hospitalized adults were included.

Data Extraction

Two authors screened articles and extracted data, and three assessed guideline quality. Recommendations on inpatient monitoring, treatment targets, medications, and care transitions were collected.

Data Synthesis

Guidelines from 10 organizations met inclusion criteria, and 5 were assessed to be of high quality per the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch & Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. All guidelines recommended monitoring blood glucose for patients with diabetes and nine for admission hyperglycemia. Eight guidelines recommended an upper blood glucose target of 180 mg/dL, five with a lower limit of 100 mg/dL and three of 140 mg/dL. Guidelines were in agreement on using capillary blood glucose monitoring, and three guidelines included discussion of continuous monitoring. Hyperglycemia treatment with basal-bolus insulin alone (n = 3) or with correction (n = 5) was most commonly recommended, while sliding scale insulin was advised against (n = 5). Guidance on use of oral diabetes medications was inconsistent. Five guidelines included discussion of transitioning to home medications. Recommendations for hypoglycemia management and diabetes management in older adults were largely limited to outpatient guidance.

Limitations

Non-English-language guidelines were excluded.

Conclusions

While there is consensus on inpatient blood glucose monitoring and use of basal-bolus insulin, there is disagreement on treatment targets and use of home medications and little guidance on how to transition treatment at discharge.

### Blood glucose levels should be considered as a new vital sign indicative of prognosis during hospitalization [^cad7cfb4]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The measurement of vital signs is an important part of clinical work up. Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear.

Methods

A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals.

Results

Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality.

Conclusion

In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the "fifth vital sign" for any hospitalized patient.

Preoperative glycemic targets for elective surgery — For adult patients with diabetes undergoing elective surgical procedures, we suggest targeting preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) and blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L), and when targeting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) is not feasible, we suggest targeting preoperative blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L). These recommendations apply only to scheduled elective procedures where time allows therapy implementation, and BG concentrations should be within the targeted range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours prior to surgery.

ii. Noncritically ill patients.

With no prospective, RCT data to inform specific glycemic targets in noncritically ill patients, recommendations are based on clinical experience and judgment. For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, premeal glucose targets should generally be < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) with random blood glucose < 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l), as long as these targets can be safely achieved.

Modification of the regimen is required when blood glucose values are < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l), unless the event is easily explained by other factors (such as a missed meal, etc.).

Occasional patients with a prior history of successful tight glycemic control in the outpatient setting who are clinically stable may be maintained with a glucose range below the above cut points. Conversely, higher glucose ranges may be acceptable in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities, as well as in those in patient-care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible.

Clinical judgment, combined with ongoing assessment of the patient's clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose measures, severity of illness, nutritional status, or concurrent use of medications that might affect glucose levels (e.g. steroids, octreotide) must be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing.

2. Treatment options in hospitalized patients

In the hospital setting, insulin therapy is the preferred method of glycemic control in majority of clinical situations. In the ICU, intravenous infusion is the preferred route of insulin administration. Outside of critical care units, subcutaneous insulin is used much more frequently. Oral agents have a limited role in the inpatient setting.

Point-of-care glucose monitoring in hospitalized diabetes advises that for people who are eating, point-of-care (POC) blood glucose monitoring should be performed before meals; for those not eating, glucose monitoring is advised every 4–6 h, and more frequent POC monitoring, ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h is the required standard for safe use of intravenous insulin in the hospital. POC blood glucose monitors are noted to be not as accurate or as precise as laboratory glucose analyzers and capillary blood glucose analyses are subject to artifacts; the FDA has established standards for capillary (finger-stick) POC blood glucose monitoring in the hospital. Best practice dictates confirming any high glucose result that does not correlate with clinical status by repeating the test first and measuring a sample in the clinical laboratory if the second result is similar, particularly for asymptomatic hypoglycemic events.

Fig. 1
Proposed framework for blood glucose control in ICU. The optimal blood glucose target likely varies according to the clinical setting. If the patient can eat, if there is no accurate glucose control protocol, if there is no need for a central venous and arterial line, or if nursing staff lacks experience with tight glucose control, liberal blood glucose control is advised with insulin used only to maintain blood glucose below 181–215 mg/dL [< 10–11.9 mmol/L]. If there is a validated protocol with confirmed high time in blood glucose target range and a minimal risk of hypoglycemia, tight glucose control (80–110 mg/dL [4.4–6.1 mmol/L]) can be considered. Otherwise, an intermediate glucose control (insulin only to maintain blood glucose below 150–180 mg/dL [< 8.3–10 mmol/L]) strategy is advised. Safe tight (80–110 mg/dL [4.4–6.1 mmol/L]) and intermediate (< 150–180 mg/dL [< 8.3–10 mmol/L]) blood glucose control requires a protocol that includes accurate and frequent measurements of blood glucose and avoids insulin boluses. Blood glucose is preferably measured using arterial blood and a blood gas analyzer, which yields a fast and accurate blood glucose measurement, and, simultaneously, a measurement of potassium (to act upon and prevent insulin-induced hypokalemia). Capillary blood glucose measurements are unreliable in ICU patients with poor tissue perfusion, and venous measurements may report falsely elevated blood glucose values during intravenous glucose infusion, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Short-acting insulin is preferably administered via continuous infusion through a dedicated lumen of a central venous line, to ensure continuous systemic availability and avoid large blood glucose fluctuations. When the arterial or central venous line is no longer needed, when the patient is being discharged to the ward, or when oral feeding is initiated, a more liberal approach to glucose control is advised, with insulin used only to maintain levels below 181–215 mg/dL [10–11.9 mmol/L]. Overly aggressive treatment of postprandial hyperglycemia may provoke hypoglycemia and large blood glucose fluctuations. In patients with known diabetes mellitus and in patients with persistent intravenous insulin need after resumption of oral feeding and at ICU discharge, transition to maintenance treatment (oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin and/or other glucose-lowering treatments) should be performed in consultation with an endocrinologist to ensure long-term follow-up. Any form of blood glucose control should avoid iatrogenic and severe hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and large blood glucose variability

### A consensus statement for continuous glucose monitoring metrics for inpatient clinical trials [^43d07a16]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes Technology Society organized an expert consensus panel to develop metrics for research in the use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) in a hospital setting. The experts met virtually in small groups both before and after an April 13, 2023 virtual meeting of the entire panel. The goal of the panel was to develop consensus definitions in anticipation of greater use of CGMs in hospital settings in the future. Establishment of consensus definitions of inpatient analytical metrics will be easier to compare outcomes between studies. Panelists defined terms related to 10 dimensions of measurements related to the use of CGMs including (1) hospital hypoglycemia, (2) hospital hyperglycemia, (3) hospital time in range, (4) hospital glycemic variability, (5) hospital glycemia risk index, (6) accuracy of CGM devices and reference methods for CGMs in the hospital, (7) meaningful time blocks for hospital glycemic goals, (8) hospital CGM data sufficiency, (9) using CGM data for insulin dosing, and (10) miscellaneous factors. The panelists voted on 51 proposed recommendations. Based on the panel vote, 51 recommendations were classified as either strong (43) or mild (8). Additional research is needed on CGM performance in the hospital. This consensus report is intended to support that type of research intended to improve outcomes for hospitalized people with diabetes.

### Intensive control of diabetes in the hospital: why, how, and what is in the future? [^1468a6d6]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

Intensive management of diabetes is identified as a critical component of inpatient care. However, the fundamental question that remains is whether controlling glycemia in noncritically ill diabetes patients at the lower end of the current guidelines improves outcomes of hospitalization, long-term outcomes of the primary condition, and long-term outcomes of diabetes compared with average glycemia greater than 180 mg/dl. A group of clinical investigators — Planning Research in Inpatient Diabetes (PRIDE) — is preparing randomized controlled trials with the hope of defining optimal glycemic targets for hospitalized patients with diabetes. Given the variety of clinical situations that can occur in the inpatient setting, many medical centers have established dedicated inpatient diabetes teams. There is ample evidence, albeit retrospective, that these teams improve inpatient glucose control and reduce lengths of hospital stays. Using hospitalization as an opportunity to educate patients about diabetes and to optimize their treatment regimen may improve long-term outpatient glycemic control.

Introduction

Hospital Hyperglycemia (HH) is traditionally defined as capillary or plasma glucose levels above 140 mg/dL in hospitalized individuals. However, pharmacological treatment is indicated for glucose levels exceeding 180 mg/dL, due to increased risks of complications and outcomes outside the targets for in-hospital glycemic control. HH affects individuals regardless of diabetes mellitus status, leading to worse outcomes such as higher hospital mortality rates, increased intensive care units (ICU) admissions, and longer hospital stays.

HH has been reported in 22–46% of non-critical hospitalized patients. Data from the Annual National Diabetes Inpatient Audit in the United Kingdom suggest that the prevalence of diabetes in hospitalized patients increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 20% in 2019. Glycemic control in hospitalized patients often remains underestimated, contributing to clinical inertia.

Improved glycemic management has been shown to reduce complications like infections, particularly those related to surgical sites and pneumonia, and hospital costs, especially when conducted by specialized teams dedicated to in-hospital glycemic control.

Persistent HH, defined as glucose levels > 180 mg/dL on two or more occasions within 24 h, require proactive glycemic control methods beyond sliding-scale insulin.

The treatment that is accessible in all hospitals, whether public or private, is insulin therapy. It should be prescribed with predetermined doses, as suggested below and in the recommendations (Table 1):

Summary of clinical trials reviewed for question 1

Overall, although a very tight glucose target (80–110 mg/dl [4.4–6.1 mmol/l]) was beneficial in a predominantly surgical ICU population, this target has been difficult to achieve in subsequent studies, including the recently published NICE-SUGAR study, without increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia. In addition, there has been no consistent reduction in mortality with intensive control of glycemia, and increased mortality was observed in the largest published study to date. The reasons for this inconsistency are not entirely clear. The positive results reported in the initial studies may have been attributable to differences in measurement and reporting of BG values, selection of participants, glycemic variability, or nutritional support. Nevertheless, recent attempts to achieve tight glycemic control either have not reduced or have actually increased mortality in multicenter trials and clearly led to higher rates of hypoglycemia.

Despite the inconsistencies, it would be a serious error to conclude that judicious control of glycemia in critically ill patients, and in non-ICU patients in general, is not warranted. First, on the basisof a largenumber of studies in a varietyof inpatient settings, uncontrolled hyperglycemia clearly is associated with poor outcomes. Second, although severe hypoglycemic events are observed in an unacceptably high number of patients receiving intensive insulin therapy with protocols targeting a BG of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), this risk can likely be minimized with relaxation of targets, improvement and standardization ofprotocols, and their careful implementation. Third, perhaps major beneficial effectson outcomes can be derived from a higher target range of glucose than 80–110 mg/dl in comparison with uncontrolled hyperglycemia.

Finally, until further information becomes available, it is prudent to continue to emphasize the importance of glycemic control in hospitalized patients with critical and noncritical illness while aiming at targets that are less stringent than 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), a topic that is discussed in detail subsequently.

### Normal glucose values are associated with a lower risk of mortality in hospitalized patients [^eb394f1a]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemia is a common comorbid condition in hospitalized patients, independent of the diagnosis of diabetes, and is associated with adverse outcomes. Although there is strong evidence suggesting that tight glycemic control is intimately linked to an improved outcome in the intensive care unit, hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is generally not considered a major therapeutic focus. It is important to determine target plasma glucose concentrations and glycemic thresholds associated with optimal benefits during hospitalization. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of plasma glucose on admission with in-hospital mortality and to identify the range of glycemic values associated with significant reductions of mortality risks in a heterogeneous group of hospitalized adult patients.

In addition, the panel suggests a BG target 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours preoperatively, which is also the recommended target for intra- and postoperative glycemic management.

Inpatient glucose metrics

Hospitals attempting to improve the quality of their glycemic control and clinical investigators who analyze glycemic management require standardized glucose measures for assessment of baseline performance and the effect of any intervention. Several methods have been proposed for determining the adequacyof glycemic control across a hospital or unit. A recent study indicated that a simple measure of mean BG provides information similar to that from more complex metrics (hyperglycemic index, time-averaged glucose). The "patient-day" unit of measure is anotherproposedmetric of hospital glucose data, especially when there is substantial variability in the duration of hospital stay. The patient-day metric may yield a more accurate assessment of the frequency of hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events, providing an approach for obtaining measures of performance for clinical investigation.

The absolute definition of high-quality BG control has not been determined. Of course, one should aim for the highest percentage of patients within a prespecified BG target range. The opposite holds true for hypoglycemia. What is reasonable for a hospital to achieve and with what consistency have not been studied, and information regarding best practices in this area is needed.

### Glucose management technologies for the critically ill [^29169368]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) both in patients with and without a previous diagnosis of diabetes. The optimal glucose range in the ICU population is still a matter of debate. Given the risk of hypoglycemia associated with intensive insulin therapy, current recommendations include treating hyperglycemia after two consecutive glucose > 180 mg/dL with target levels of 140–180 mg/dL for most patients. The optimal method of sampling glucose and delivery of insulin in critically ill patients remains elusive. While point of care glucose meters are not consistently accurate and have to be used with caution, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is not standard of care, nor is it generally recommended for inpatient use. Intravenous insulin therapy using paper or electronic protocols remains the preferred approach for critically ill patients. The advent of new technologies, such as electronic glucose management, CGM, and closed-loop systems, promises to improve inpatient glycemic control in the critically ill with lower rates of hypoglycemia.

### Hospital management of diabetes [^9cab644c]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The evidence continues to strengthen our understanding that improved glycemic control with the use of insulin therapy may significantly improve morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia, with or without a previous diagnosis of diabetes. However, many questions remain concerning the impact and relative contributions of blood glucose and insulin per se. Nevertheless, the publication of numerous and consistent studies have made it clear that the topic of glycemic management in the hospital requires a larger priority among clinicians caring for these patients. The recently published guidelines by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists are the first formal recommendations on this topic, but national guidelines for blood glucose levels cannot take into account all of the different challenges facing different hospitals. This suggests that each institution will require individualization of protocols even though the ultimate metabolic goals are identical. Furthermore, it is not realistic to expect those unfamiliar with diabetes therapy to appreciate all of the nuances and vagaries of insulin treatment. Like any medical treatment, a significant amount of time will need to be invested by the providers involved with the.care of these patients before a mastery of the therapy can be achieved. Nevertheless, because the rewards to our patients can be significant, we need to strive to improve the systems where we work. Individual clinicians with vast experience in diabetes care cannot be successful for the inpatient with diabetes unless the hospital has systems in place to effectively and efficiently facilitate the management of the metabolic needs of this population. The main challenge now is the safe and effective implementation of these guidelines in both small and large hospitals given the limited level of re-sources available in today's medical environment. Therefore, our single most important recommendation is to ensure that all clinicians involved in the management of these patients are in agreement about general philosophies of diabetes management. We would recommend that there are "champions" for each discipline: endocrinology, cardiology, anesthesiology, surgery, nursing, and pharmacy, all of which have developed hospital-specific guidelines for glycemic management. These recommendations can be slowly adapted, one unit at a time, until the entire hospital has transitioned to a more "diabetes-friendly" environment. The ultimate goal of well-controlled glycemia with minimal hypoglycemia should be possible for most hospitals, and we hope this review will assist clinicians in achieving this objective. We await additional outcome research with carefully controlled studies to confirm the value of these recommendations at different levels of glycemic control. We believe that we can already state with confidence that the preliminary evidence shows that, like outpatient diabetes management, metabolic control matters during acute illness.

Glycemic Targets in Hospital

The International Consensus on Time in Range consensus guidelines recommend a target percentage time in range (3.9–10 mmol/L, [70–180 mg/dL]) in the outpatient setting is 70%, but this is reduced to 50% for those at risk of hypoglycemia. There are no guidelines on percentage times in range that should be maintained in hospital. Percentage time in range should ideally be calculated using > 70% data for at least 14 days, and the overall calculation from short hospital admissions whilst people are unwell may be inappropriate. Furthermore, glycemia is likely to change hour by hour, and day by day, whilst people are unwell and it is difficult to meaningfully use the concept of "time in range" in that situation. Overall, published data relating to glucose control, time in range in hospital and clinical outcomes are unclear. The consensus view is that avoiding hypoglycemia is the priority, with the secondary aim of avoiding significant hyperglycemia.

JBDS-IP propose ensuring hypoglycemia avoidance (percentage time below range < 1%) and to minimize hyperglycemia. The usual JBDS-IP glycemic targets in hospital are 6 to 10 mmol/L (108–180 mg/dL)for the acutely unwell person, but we recognize for some individuals who are well in hospital, then the outpatient target of 3.9 to 10 mmol/L (70–180 mg/dL) may be acceptable (eg, in otherwise fit, well adults awaiting elective surgical procedures). Targets should therefore be individualized and the reasons why targets in hospital differ from the outpatient setting should be discussed with the individual. Further studies are required to establish appropriate CGM metrics for people in hospital.

For the acutely unwell person in hospital, if glucose is between 4.0 and 5.9 mmol/L (72–106 mg/dL) and CGM arrow(s) are trending down, this is indicative of looming hypoglycemiaand should be reviewed immediately by the individual and discussed with the clinical team. A small carbohydrate snack (4–8 grams) can arrest the fall to hypoglycemia (particularly if trend arrow downward). Other interventions may include adding glucose to an intravenous infusion or simply rechecking blood glucose levels sooner than planned. For admission for elective procedures and/or the peripartum period, standard targets may apply.

As mentioned above, less literature attention has been devoted to the relationship between the levels of average blood glucose sustained in the period preceding a hospital admission (in our case, for medical rather than surgical reasons) and in-hospital blood glucose levels. The approach to patients with T2DM during hospitalization is almost standardized, aiming to achieve a glycemic target that typically falls within the same ranges.

In most cases, oral antidiabetic therapies are suspended at hospital admission, and patients are transitioned to subcutaneous insulin administration using a basal-bolus regimen. There are exceptions for patients admitted to intensive care settings (where higher average glucose levels may be allowed due to acuity that benefits from more readily available resources), critically ill patients, and those considered more clinically stable: the latter group may be recommended to continue or resume home-based therapies also during hospitalization.

Reductions in the dose of basal insulin (by 10% to 20%) at time of hospitalization may be required for patients on basal heavy insulin regimens (defined as doses of basal insulin ≥ 0.6 to 1.0 units/kg/day), in which basal insulin is being used inappropriately to cover meal-related excursions in BG.

### International recommendations for glucose control in adult non diabetic critically ill patients [^ea50d74d]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Glucose control in ICUs should be a therapeutic objective. It is no longer possible to overlook severe hyperglycemia (> 10 mmol/L) although it is not yet possible to recommend a single glucose threshold common to all types of patients and diseases, especially as glucose control exposes patients to an increased risk of potentially harmful hypoglycemia. In addition, although mean glucose is an important therapeutic target to be achieved, recent data underscore the impact of many other factors (for example, variability in glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, presence or not of chronic hyperglycemia (diabetes). The safety and reliability of glucose monitoring techniques also need to be taken into account. Progress in the accuracy, harmonisation, and automation of these techniques is needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of glucose control, and diminish workload. There is no question of introducing tight glucose control into ICUs at all costs. However, further studies are needed to answer many unsolved questions: Which target glucose values should be used in which patients? How to monitor glucose levels? Which protocols should be used? In the meantime, each team should set up formal protocols in line with their technical and human resources.

QUESTION 1: DOES IMPROVING GLYCEMIC CONTROL IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR INPATIENTS WITH HYPERGLYCEMIA?

Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, irrespective of its cause, is unequivocally associated with adverse outcomes (,–). Hyperglycemia occurs in patients with known or undiagnosed diabetes, or it occurs during acute illness in those with previously normal glucose tolerance (termed "stress hyperglycemia").

Intervention directed at reducing blood glucose (BG) levels has resulted in improved outcomes in some, but not all, studies (,–). Several recent clinical trials in critically ill patients have reported no reduction in mortality from intensive treatment targeting near-euglycemia versus conventional management targeting BG < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l). Of considerable concern are reports of harm, with higher rates of severe hypoglycemia and even increased mortality resulting from intensive glycemic control. This variability in results may be attributable to several factors, including differences in intravenous (IV) insulin treatment protocols and their implementation, glycemic targets, patient populations, methods for glucose monitoring, and insulin adjustment.

The following section focuses primarily on results of recent studies with an RCT design that investigated patient outcomes with protocols targeting near-normalization of BG levels. Readers are referred to a previous ACE position statement, an ACE/ADA consensus statement, and a technical review for details related to earlier studies supporting inpatient glycemic management.

Data derived from surgical and medical intensive care units

Observational studies have documented that hyperglycemia after cardiothoracic surgical procedures is associated with higher rates (approximately twofold) of wound infection. Interventions to reduce hyperglycemia in this setting with IV insulin therapy decrease infection rates and cardiac-related mortality, in comparison with historical control subjects.

The results of several RCTs conducted in critically ill patients in medical and surgical intensive care units (ICUs) are summarized in Table 1 (,–). Intensive insulin therapy targeting arterial glucose levels of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l) in a surgical ICU patient population resulted in a significant decrease in morbid ity and mortality. However, implementation of the identical protocol in 1,200 medical ICU patients by the same investigators in the same institution diminished morbidity but failed to reduce mortality. A sixfold increase in severe hypoglycemic events (BG < 40 mg/dl [2.2 mmol/l]) was observed in the intensively treated group (18.7 vs. 3.1%), and hypoglycemia was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality.

### Continuous glucose monitoring in the ICU: clinical considerations and consensus [^26bc2a92]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Summary and recommendations/food for thought/future studies

Data therefore suggest that the optimal blood glucose target may be higher in patients with preexisting diabetes compared to those without. However, further study is needed to define the optimal level, because too high a level may also be associated with complications, such as infection. Importantly, most of the published data in this area are from studies using intermittent glucose testing, and newer data using CGM techniques should provide more information including the importance of glucose variability and time in range for patients with and without diabetes.

The effects of insulin resistance also need to be taken into account. HbA1c levels should be measured in all critically ill patients and care taken to avoid relative hypoglycemia in those with poor preadmission glucose control. However, the precise definition of "relative hypoglycemia" and whether it should be based on some measure of chronic baseline glucose or on the acute baseline remain unclear; the time factor over which the relative hypoglycemia occurs may also be important. The achievement of a fixed percentage decrease in blood glucose (i.e. the incidence of "relative hypoglycemia") will also be influenced by the target glycemic level. A large multicenter trial (NCT02244073) comparing a blood glucose target based on the admission HbA1c value to standard of care has been completed recently.

### Current standards of care for inpatient glycemic management and metabolic control: is it time for definite standards and targets? [^d835a9fe]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the available literature on the presence of diabetes in the inpatient population and its effect on outcomes.

Results

Diabetes is a progressively worsening epidemic in the United States. Patients with diabetes have a disproportionate representation among the inpatient population in this country, and their share of total health-care costs is both disproportionate and growing rapidly. Patients with diabetes are often admitted to the hospital not primarily because of their diabetes but rather because of the need for treatment of the end-stage complications of diabetes, such as cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease as well as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy, or because of unrelated illnesses for which diabetes is a complication. Diabetes is a frequent comorbid condition and increases the duration of hospitalization by 1 to 2 days. Numerous organizations have issued guidelines for outpatient diabetes management and metabolic control and have updated them periodically; however, no such guidelines or standards have been formulated for inpatient diabetes management.

Conclusion

In view of a rapidly growing body of evidence suggesting that enhanced glycemic control decreases morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperglycemia, such as those with new-onset diabetes, as well as in patients with previously established diabetes, the creation of clearly defined standards and targets for inpatient management of hyperglycemia and metabolic control seems important for improvement of outcomes in hospitalized patients with diabetes.

### International recommendations for glucose control in adult non diabetic critically ill patients [^a97277ff]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The purpose of this research is to provide recommendations for the management of glycemic control in critically ill patients.

Methods

Twenty-one experts issued recommendations related to one of the five pre-defined categories (glucose target, hypoglycemia, carbohydrate intake, monitoring of glycemia, algorithms and protocols), that were scored on a scale to obtain a strong or weak agreement. The GRADE (Grade of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used, with a strong recommendation indicating a clear advantage for an intervention and a weak recommendation indicating that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention is not clearly defined.

Results

A glucose target of less than 10 mmol/L is strongly suggested, using intravenous insulin following a standard protocol, when spontaneous food intake is not possible. Definition of the severe hypoglycemia threshold of 2.2 mmol/L is recommended, regardless of the clinical signs. A general, unique amount of glucose (enteral/parenteral) to administer for any patient cannot be suggested. Glucose measurements should be performed on arterial rather than venous or capillary samples, using central lab or blood gas analysers rather than point-of-care glucose readers.

Conclusions

Thirty recommendations were obtained with a strong (21) and a weak (9) agreement. Among them, only 15 were graded with a high level of quality of evidence, underlying the necessity to continue clinical studies in order to improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of glucose control.

### Point-of-care blood glucose testing for diabetes care in hospitalized patients: an evidence-based review [^4e7708f7]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2014). Low credibility.

Glycemic control in hospitalized patients with diabetes requires accurate near-patient glucose monitoring systems. In the past decade, point-of-care blood glucose monitoring devices have become the mainstay of near-patient glucose monitoring in hospitals across the world. In this article, we focus on its history, accuracy, clinical use, and cost-effectiveness. Point-of-care devices have evolved from 1.2 kg instruments with no informatics to handheld lightweight portable devices with advanced connectivity features. Their accuracy however remains a subject of debate, and new standards for their approval have now been issued by both the International Organization for Standardization and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. While their cost-effectiveness remains to be proved, their clinical value for managing inpatients with diabetes remains unchallenged. This evidence-based review provides an overall view of its use in the hospital setting.

### Glucose management in critically ill adults and children [^376fcd26]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Blood glucose management in people with acute myocardial infarction and critical illness has always attracted controversy. Compared with the era before 2001 when no attention was given to blood glucose management, DIGAMI-1 in 1995 and the first Leuven study in 2001 showed improved outcomes with strict control of blood glucose, thereby suggesting a causal association between hyperglycaemia and mortality risk. These landmark trials have set the standard in clinical practice that excessive hyperglycaemia is not acceptable. Multicentre trials contradicted the benefits of tight control of patients' blood glucose and results showed that different standard operating procedures for blood glucose control (eg, blood glucose meters or algorithms), divergent concomitant feeding strategies, and varying patient populations are important confounders. The general consensus now is that excessive hyperglycaemia (> 10 mmol/L) and severe hypoglycaemia (< 2.2 mmol/L) should be avoided in critically ill adults. If adequate blood glucose meters and clinically validated protocols for insulin-dosing are available, targeting of blood glucose concentrations to less than 8 mmol/L (moderate glycaemic control), while avoiding mild hypoglycaemia (< 3.9 mmol/L), is a reasonable strategy in adult patients who are critically ill. This recommendation is not based on findings from randomised controlled trials, but merely represents a very common, pragmatic approach by physicians at the bedside. As a result of the few properly validated technologies for tighter blood glucose control, targeting blood glucose concentrations to less than 6 mmol/L is not recommended, because its risk-to-benefit ratio becomes questionable. Because blood glucose control in the target of adult ranges does not improve patient outcomes for children in the intensive care unit, glucose management in this patient population should be limited to avoid excessive hyperglycaemia (> 10 mmol/L).

### Managing blood glucose in critically ill patients with or without diabetes [^c698e2a2]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Relationships between blood glucose concentration and outcome and also the optimum management of blood glucose remain highly contentious issues for critical care practitioners. Among the many controversies is whether critically ill patients with diabetes should be treated differently from those without diabetes. Krinsley and colleagues assembled a large observational database that sheds further light on the relationships of hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and glucose variability and risk of death in critically ill patients with and without diabetes. Defining the optimum treatment and whether this should differ by diabetic status requires high-quality primary interventional research.

### ACP releases guideline on intensive insulin therapy in… [^2e22d576]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Intensive insulin therapy is defined as the use of intravenous insulin to meet target blood glucose levels with frequent glucose testing and adjustment of insulin doses. In the intensive care unit setting, the usual target range for blood glucose is 80 to 110 mg per dL. In non-ICU settings, target glucose levels vary, ranging from 80 to 110 mg per dL to less than 200 mg per dL. Recommendation 1: Intensive insulin therapy should not be used to strictly control blood glucose in non-SICU/MICU patients with or without diabetes. Available evidence showed no reduction in mortality with a target blood glucose level of 80 to 180 mg per dL compared with a higher or unspecified target. Recommendation 3: A target blood glucose level of 140 to 200 mg per dL is recommended if insulin therapy is used in SICU/MICU patients. Because poorly controlled hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and worse health outcomes in ICU patients, a target blood glucose level of 140 to 200 mg per dL is appropriate. Insulin therapy targeted to this range is associated with similar mortality outcomes and a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared with therapy targeted to 80 to 110 mg per dL. There is not enough evidence to determine whether blood glucose levels of 180 to 200 mg per dL are associated with outcomes similar to those of lower target levels. Hypoglycemia was observed in studies using a range of target levels, although the risk was higher when lower target values were used.

Achieving glucose targets with low rates of hypoglycemia may be associated with titration characteristics of the protocol, patient characteristics, staffing ratios, and physician acceptance. Quality improvement and training initiatives should be incorporated in hospitals to achieve target glucose levels while minimizing rates of hypoglycemia in ICU patients.

European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to patients with myocardial infarction, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating glucose-lowering therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome with glucose levels > 10 mmol/L (> 180 mg/dL) and avoid episodes of hypoglycemia (blood glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L; ≤ 70 mg/dL).

Special Situations

In East Africa, for hospitalized patients with diabetes, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are associated with prolonged hospitalization, rehospitalization, increased morbidity, and high mortality. Efforts should therefore be made in hospitalized patients with diabetes to achieve glycemic targets and prevent both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

Inpatient Settings

Hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients is defined as blood glucose levels of > 7.8 mmol/L. Alterations in diet or changes in antihyperglycemic treatment are warranted when blood glucose levels are persistently above 7.8 mmol/L. If an HbA1c from the previous 3 months is unavailable, measuring the HbA1c in all patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia admitted to the hospital is recommended. On admission, HbA1c value ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol) implies that diabetes preceded hospitalization, taking into consideration that the patient does not have a hemoglobinopathy, recent episode of malaria, bleeding, or hemolysis. Blood glucose value of 3.9 mmol/L in hospitalized patients indicates hypoglycemia, whereas a blood glucose value of 3.0 mmol/L denotes clinically significant hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is defined as that associated with severe cognitive impairment regardless of blood glucose level.

For the majority of critically ill patients and non-critically ill patients, at a blood glucose value of 10.0 mmol/L insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia with the aim of achieving target glucose level in the range between 7.8 and 10.0 mmol/L. More stringent goals (blood glucose values between 6.1 and 7.8 mmol/L) in selected populations in the inpatient setting may occasionally be required and extreme caution taken to avoid hypoglycemia.

Blood glucose monitoring in patients who are eating should be performed before meals, while in patients who are not eating it should be performed every 4–6 h. For patients on IV insulin, blood glucose monitoring should be done every 30 min to 2 h.

Inpatient diabetes management — critically ill in the ICU: For critically ill persons, IV insulin infusion is recommended using validated protocols, and for those receiving IV insulin, point-of-care (POC) testing should be performed every 30 to 120 min; a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended for most, with more intensive targets between 110 to 140 mg/dL potentially appropriate in select populations while minimizing hypoglycemia risk.

### Comparison of accuracy guidelines for hospital glucose meters [^87772515]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

When used in hospital settings, glucose meter performance issues involve analytic comparability to lab-based testing, patient and sample variables, and clinical affects such as insulin treatment protocol outcomes and morbidity or outcome risk factors. Different tools are available to assess these issues, including accuracy and precision statistics along with clinical risk measures such as error grids or simulation testing. Regulatory, guidance, and professional bodies have advocated a number of varying recommendations for glucose meter performance in different situations and under different patient conditions. These are summarized and compared, but reconciling these guidelines can be confusing or difficult for providers. Blood glucose meters are useful in the management of patients in acute or assisted care facilities, but users must appreciate the variables that affect measurements and provide for oversight that can manage risk factors and maintain meter performance expectations.

### Pathways to quality inpatient management of hyperglycemia and diabetes: a call to action [^35b5cd5d]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in glycemic management of hospitalized patients. There is now broad consensus that both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients are associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality. There is less agreement, however, as to whether these associations actually reflect the effects of the quality of glucose management or are merely underlying paraphenomena of the severity of acute illness. Even more controversial is the actual potential impact of glycemic control during these hospitalizations that are often relatively brief, the specific glucose ranges that should be targeted, and the methods by which clinicians might achieve these.

In the 1960s, research on the benefits of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion during acute myocardial infarction began, but this line of inquiry was not focused on glucose control per se. Interest in the general field of glycemic management in the inpatient setting began in the mid 1990s. The next 10 years were marked by both prospective observational trials and randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the majority of which seemed to indicate that "lower is better": hospital complications, length of stay, cost, and even mortality could be dramatically decreased in a variety of critical care settings if mean glucose concentrations were reduced, usually with intravenous insulin, toward or within the euglycemic range. Some results, however, seemed too good to be true, especially in the context of such short hospital stays. This skepticism led to confirmatory trials, most conducted using a multicenter design. These could not confirm the initial positive findings from single-center investigations. There was resulting confusion as to how these results might shape clinical practice. Several consensus documents have emerged, each endorsing a more moderate approach to the management of glycemia in the hospitalized patient. Notably, all have called for more research in this area so that we can better understand the impact of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on inpatient outcomes and better delineate evidence-based standards for hospital practice.

9. Bedside blood glucose monitoring

Implementing intensive diabetes therapy in the hospital setting requires frequent and accurate blood glucose data. This measure is analogous to an additional "vital sign" for hospitalized patients with diabetes. Bedside glucose monitoring using capillary blood has advantages over laboratory venous glucose testing because the results can be obtained rapidly at the "point of care", where therapeutic decisions are made.

Bedside blood glucose testing is usually performed with portable meters that are similar or identical to devices for home SMBG. Staff training and ongoing quality control activities are important components of ensuring accuracy of the results. Ability to track the occurrence of hypo- and hyperglycemia is necessary. Results of bedside glucose tests should be readily available to all members of the care team.

For patients who are eating, commonly recommended testing frequencies are premeal and at bedtime. For patients not eating, testing every 4–6 h is usually sufficient for determining correction insulin doses. Patients on continuous intravenous insulin typically require hourly blood glucose testing until the blood glucose levels are stable, then every 2 h.

10. Discharge planning

It is important to anticipate the postdischarge antihyperglycemic regimen in all patients with diabetes or newly discovered hyperglycemia. The optimal program will need to consider the type and severity of diabetes, the effects of the patient's illness on blood glucose levels, and the capacities and desires of the patient. Smooth transition to outpatient care should be ensured, especially in those new to insulin therapy or in whom the diabetes regimen has been substantially altered during the hospitalization. All patients in whom the diagnosis of diabetes is new should have, at minimum, "survival skills" training before discharge. More expanded diabetes education can be arranged in the community. For those with hyperglycemia who do not require treatment upon discharge, follow-up testing through their primary care physician should be arranged, since many of these individuals are found to have diabetes when tested after discharge.

Regarding inpatient care for in-hospital hyperglycemia, more specifically with respect to glucose monitoring, SCCM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining frequent (≤ 1 hour, continuous or near-continuous) glucose monitoring rather than monitoring at > 1-hour intervals in the management of hyperglycemia in critically ill adult patients on IV insulin during periods of glycemic instability.

### International recommendations for glucose control in adult non diabetic critically ill patients [^4dd5d903]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Stress-induced hyperglycemia has been found to be associated with an increased morbi-mortality in critically ill patients. Thus, an excessive hyperglycemia (> 10 mmol/L) should be avoided in adult ICU patients.

- Due to persistent conflicting data and the increased risk of hypoglycemia, strict glycemic control cannot be a universal strategy regardless of the condition of patient and the training of the team.

- Continuous intravenous insulin is the only strategy permitted to efficiently control glycemia while decreasing the risk of glycemic variations in critically ill patients.

- In ICU, severe hypoglycemia (< 2.2 mmol/L) should be detected, even in the absence of warning clinical signs, using a close glycemic monitoring (repeated blood samples).

- Blood glucose concentrations determined with bedside point-of-care glucometers provides inaccurate measurements in critically ill patients. Thus, blood glucose measures should be preferentially performed on arterial (or venous) blood samples using classical laboratory devices or blood gas/glucose analyzers, especially in the case of extreme values.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients in non-critical care setting: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^d1bd9ea0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines on the management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients in the non-critical care setting.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, and a methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society members, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American Association of Diabetes Educators, European Society of Endocrinology, and the Society of Hospital Medicine reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia is a common, serious, and costly health care problem in hospitalized patients. Observational and randomized controlled studies indicate that improvement in glycemic control results in lower rates of hospital complications in general medicine and surgery patients. Implementing a standardized sc insulin order set promoting the use of scheduled basal and nutritional insulin therapy is a key intervention in the inpatient management of diabetes. We provide recommendations for practical, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and describe protocols, procedures, and system improvements required to facilitate the achievement of glycemic goals in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes admitted in non-critical care settings.
