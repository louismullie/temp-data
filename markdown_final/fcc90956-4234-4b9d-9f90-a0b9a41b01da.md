## Question

Difference between shingrix and zostavax

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences between Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine, RZV) and Zostavax (live attenuated zoster vaccine, ZVL). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about vaccine type and mechanism. Then, I should compare efficacy and real-world effectiveness. Next, I will examine durability of protection. After that, I need to verify regulatory indications and ACIP recommendations by age and immune status. I will then review dosing, route, and storage to avoid errors. I should evaluate safety and reactogenicity, consider special populations including immunocompromised patients, address prior Zostavax recipients, and finally check cost-effectiveness and summarize practical clinical guidance, making sure each assertion aligns with the best available evidence and ACIP guidance [^11368yFY].

> Let me first confirm the identities and classifications of the two vaccines, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating formulations. Shingrix is a recombinant, adjuvanted subunit vaccine that contains VZV glycoprotein E with the AS01B adjuvant and is given intramuscularly as a 2‑dose series, whereas Zostavax is a live attenuated Oka-strain VZV vaccine given as a single subcutaneous dose, and these foundational differences drive distinct safety, storage, and use cases [^11368yFY] [^114P63y3] [^113wsZLJ] [^113SwFjz].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic implications, because mechanism often predicts performance and contraindications. RZV's single-protein gE antigen plus AS01B adjuvant amplifies gE-specific CD4 T-cell and humoral responses and was designed to overcome immunosenescence, which helps explain its high and age-stable efficacy; by contrast, ZVL relies on limited replication of an attenuated whole virus to stimulate immunity, a strategy that can wane with age and is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons due to the live virus component [^114P63y3] [^1134GR4h] [^116BPQK5].

> Next, I should review efficacy from pivotal trials and comparative syntheses, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single data set. In randomized data, RZV showed approximately 97% efficacy against shingles in adults ≥ 50 years and about 91% in those ≥ 70 years with sustained performance over several years, while ZVL's efficacy against shingles was about 51% overall with 65% efficacy against postherpetic neuralgia and a notable decline with advancing age; a network meta-analysis confirmed RZV's statistical superiority to both placebo and ZVL, and initially I thought ZVL was clearly superior to placebo, but wait, the network meta restricted to RCTs found ZVL not statistically different from placebo, whereas analyses including broader study designs did find ZVL superior to placebo, so I need to reconcile that by noting design and power differences across analyses [^116KYwqX] [^114P63y3] [^114X1sFy] [^1173i4Ai].

> I will now examine real-world effectiveness to see if trial signals translate into practice. Let me check Medicare and health system data: two-dose RZV effectiveness was approximately 70% in Medicare beneficiaries, including effectiveness against postherpetic neuralgia, and around 76% in integrated health systems, with one-dose performance lower and reinforcing completion of the series; these estimates are understandably lower than trial efficacy due to outcome ascertainment and confounding in observational settings, but still robust across older age and immunosuppressed subgroups [^114LSHkv] [^115UnS7T].

> I need to ensure durability is accurately characterized, because waning materially changes recommendation timing. RZV maintains high efficacy with minimal waning through at least 3–4 years in the pivotal trials, with immune responses plateauing above baseline and extension studies indicating sustained protection out to roughly 11 years so far; in contrast, ZVL's protection wanes from about 68% in year 1 to roughly 32% by year 8 with negligible effect by year 11, which is a key reason it is no longer preferred by ACIP [^113qkNK8] [^1173f3wi] [^117AkJGV] [^117HbiwF].

> Let me think about regulatory indications and ACIP recommendations, because age thresholds and immune status matter. RZV is FDA-approved for adults ≥ 50 years and, importantly, for adults ≥ 18 years with immunocompromising conditions, with ACIP recommending two doses in immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years and extending recommendations to immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years; ZVL is FDA-approved for ≥ 50 years, but ACIP historically recommended it for immunocompetent adults ≥ 60 years and did not prefer it when RZV became available, reflecting efficacy and durability differences [^114QuFjr] [^116BPQK5] [^1137fhkA] [^1128jtN3] [^116USpuZ] [^11368yFY] [^114g2W58].

> I should double-check dosing, route, and timing details to avoid practical errors. RZV is 0.5 mL IM as a 2‑dose series at 0 and 2–6 months, and if the patient is or will be immunocompromised, the second dose can be given 1–2 months after the first; do not restart the series if late, and repeat a too-early second dose only if given < 4 weeks after dose 1; ZVL is a single 0.65 mL SC dose, but again, it is not preferred and is contraindicated in many immunocompromised settings [^113wsZLJ] [^116BB9NS] [^111gVXDQ] [^113SwFjz].

> Hold on, I should verify storage and handling because mix-ups have been reported. RZV requires refrigeration at 2–8°C and intramuscular administration, whereas ZVL requires freezer storage at −15°C or colder and subcutaneous administration; early post-licensure surveillance described administration errors when these distinctions were not observed, so reinforcing these logistics is critical in clinics [^114KD3wH] [^11368yFY].

> Next, I should review safety and reactogenicity with a clear-eyed look at trade-offs. RZV is more reactogenic, with about 85% reporting local or systemic symptoms and roughly 17% experiencing grade 3 reactions in trials, yet serious adverse event rates were similar to placebo and post-licensure VAERS data did not reveal unexpected patterns; I initially wondered if more pain equals better immunity, but a post hoc analysis suggests only a small association that is not clinically useful, so reactogenicity should be anticipated and managed but not overinterpreted, while ZVL generally causes milder reactions but, being live, carries risks in the immunocompromised [^111wGZYi] [^114JGnwW] [^114R2LuL].

> I will now examine special populations, especially the immunocompromised, since this is a pivotal divergence. RZV is recommended for adults ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunocompromised, with evidence of acceptable safety and immunogenicity across settings such as hematologic malignancies and autologous stem cell transplant, timed ideally during periods of lower immunosuppression for optimal responses; ZVL is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons due to the live virus, and case reports document serious outcomes when inadvertently given in this context [^116BPQK5] [^117P5SiN] [^111b5CVJ] [^112YCHes].

> Let me consider patients who already received Zostavax, because sequencing matters in practice. ACIP recommends administering the full two-dose RZV series to adults previously vaccinated with ZVL, typically with at least an 8‑week (≥ 2‑month) interval from the prior ZVL dose; studies show RZV elicits noninferior humoral and robust cellular responses in prior ZVL recipients compared with ZVL‑naïve adults, and although intervals < 5 years were not originally studied, no theoretical or empirical concerns suggest reduced safety or efficacy when shorter intervals are used per ACIP guidance [^114g2W58] [^113BQogs] [^1153Dc42] [^111MfXf7] [^116Cn3Hc] [^111sYiKr].

> I should verify cost-effectiveness considerations, because policy preferences often follow value as well as efficacy. Multiple analyses conclude RZV prevents more disease at lower overall costs than ZVL given its higher and more durable effectiveness across age strata, and this economic advantage complements ACIP's preferential clinical recommendation for RZV [^112gqSDM] [^111ibLoC] [^116KYwqX].

> But wait, what about screening for prior varicella or prior shingles — do I need to check serostatus or history first? ACIP advises no screening for varicella history before zoster vaccination and recommends administering the two RZV doses regardless of prior shingles or prior ZVL, delaying only until an acute zoster episode has resolved, which simplifies workflows and reduces missed opportunities to vaccinate [^115yz4d2] [^111gVXDQ] [^112EPPQE].

> In practical terms, I need to ensure clinicians can implement this without errors. Prefer RZV for essentially all eligible adults, prioritize completion of the 2‑dose series, use the accelerated 1–2 month interval when immunosuppression is imminent, store and administer RZV correctly in the refrigerator via IM route, avoid ZVL in immunocompromised patients, and if switching from prior ZVL, wait at least 8 weeks before starting RZV, documenting timing and counseling about expected reactogenicity so adherence remains high [^116BB9NS] [^114KD3wH] [^11368yFY] [^113BQogs].

> In summary, after double-checking mechanism, efficacy, durability, guidance, and logistics, Shingrix (RZV) is an adjuvanted recombinant vaccine with markedly higher and more durable protection, usable down to age 19 in immunocompromised adults and preferred by ACIP for routine use, whereas Zostavax (ZVL) is a single-dose live vaccine with lower efficacy, significant waning, and contraindications in immunocompromised patients, making it a nonpreferred alternative when RZV is available [^116BPQK5] [^114g2W58] [^113qkNK8] [^114P63y3].

Regarding **vaccine type** and **efficacy**, Shingrix is a recombinant subunit vaccine with > 90% efficacy [^114X1sFy] and durable protection [^116Gxpif], whereas Zostavax is a live attenuated vaccine with ~51% efficacy [^114P63y3] that wanes over time [^114oxE9t]. Shingrix is administered as a **2-dose IM series** [^113wsZLJ] and is safe for immunocompromised adults [^116BPQK5] [^117P5SiN], whereas Zostavax is a single SC dose [^113SwFjz] and is **contraindicated in immunocompromised patients** [^116USpuZ] [^112YCHes]. Shingrix is the **preferred vaccine** [^111gVXDQ] because of its superior efficacy [^114X1sFy] and broader eligibility [^114QuFjr] [^116BPQK5].

| **Feature** | **Shingrix (RZV)** | **Zostavax (ZVL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Vaccine type | Recombinant subunit (non-live) [^115aea1c] | Live attenuated virus [^113SwFjz] |
| Antigen | Glycoprotein E (gE) [^116BPQK5] | Live attenuated VZV |
| Adjuvant | AS01B [^116BPQK5] | None |
| Dosing schedule | 2 doses, 2–6 months apart [^111gVXDQ] | Single dose [^113SwFjz] |

| Efficacy | > 90% [^114X1sFy] [^117HbiwF] | ~51% [^114P63y3] |
| Duration of protection | ≥ 10 years [^116Gxpif] | 3–5 years, wanes significantly [^114oxE9t] [^113qkNK8] |
| Immunocompromised use | Yes [^116BPQK5] | No [^116USpuZ] |
| Reactogenicity | Higher (local/systemic reactions) [^111wGZYi] [^114JGnwW] | Lower [^114P63y3] |
| Storage | Refrigeration [^114KD3wH] [^11368yFY] | Freezer [^114KD3wH] |
| FDA approval | ≥ 50 years; ≥ 18 years immunocompromised [^114QuFjr] | ≥ 50 years [^1128jtN3] |
| Current recommendation | Preferred vaccine [^111gVXDQ] | No longer preferred [^111gVXDQ] |

Shingrix is **preferred** over Zostavax [^111gVXDQ] because it provides higher and more durable protection [^114X1sFy] [^1173f3wi], is suitable for immunocompromised patients [^116BPQK5], and maintains a favorable safety profile despite higher reactogenicity [^111wGZYi].

### Notes from the field: Vaccine administration errors involving recombinant zoster vaccine - United States, 2017–2018 [^11368yFY]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Two vaccines for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) are licensed for use in the United States and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Zoster vaccine live (ZVL; Zostavax, Merck), licensed in 2006, is a live attenuated virus vaccine administered as a single subcutaneous (SQ) dose. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZVL for adults aged ≥ 50 years, ACIP recommends ZVL for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years. Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline), licensed in October 2017, is also approved by the FDA for adults aged ≥ 50 years and is recommended by ACIP for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years. RZV is administered as a 2-dose intramuscular (IM) series, with the second dose given anytime from 2 to 6 months after the first. RZV is preferentially recommended by ACIP over ZVL. Furthermore, ACIP recommends that persons previously vaccinated with ZVL receive the full 2-dose RZV series.

RZV and ZVL differ with regard to vaccine type, dose, schedule, ACIP recommendation, route of administration, and storage requirements. Prior experience indicates that administration errors are reported most frequently shortly after vaccine licensure and publication of recommendations, likely because of lack of vaccine provider familiarity with the new vaccine.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114X1sFy]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Five randomized controlled trials, including 90,605 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, were analyzed in the network meta-analysis of laboratory or doctor-confirmed cases of herpes zoster. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo (vaccine efficacy 94%, 95% credible interval 79% to 98%) and the live attenuated vaccine (85%, 31% to 98%), whereas the live attenuated vaccine was not statistically different from placebo. These results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis restricted to immunocompetent patients only.

Four randomized controlled trials were included in the dose effects analysis, and only the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine showed statistical superiority to placebo, consistent with the findings in additional network meta-analyses restricted to four randomized controlled trials involving patients with no history of herpes zoster and those with a low risk of bias on random sequence generation.

Additional analyses based on all study designs, which included five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study, and the efficacy comparison using informative priors (five randomized controlled trials) confirmed that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was statistically superior to both placebo and the live attenuated vaccine, and that the live attenuated vaccine was statistically superior to placebo.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^114P63y3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Immunization for herpes zoster (HZ) aims to reverse the decline in cell-mediated immunity to varicella zoster virus that occurs with advancing age or immunocompromise. There are two vaccines available: one live attenuated (Zoster vaccine, live attenuated [ZVL]) and, more recently, a recombinant subunit vaccine (HZ/su).

- **Methods**: The literature relevant to the two HZ vaccines was reviewed.

- **Results**: ZVL has overall efficacies of 51% and 65% against HZ and postherpetic neuralgia, respectively, with a prominent decline in efficacy with advancing age of the vaccinee. This compares to approximately 90% efficacy against HZ for HZ/su that is minimally affected with advancing age. The efficacy of ZVL against HZ declines over 4 and 8 years, compared with minimal decline so far over 4 years with HZ/su and immunogenicity that is maintained for 9 years. Local and systemic reactogenicity to HZ/su is much greater than to ZVL.

- **Conclusions**: HZ/su establishes an important principle — that a single recombinant viral protein with an effective adjuvant combination can stimulate immunogenicity superior to that of a live attenuated vaccine, and that this can diminish immunosenescence. This provides hope for improvement of other vaccines for aging patients. However, key questions remain unanswered, including the durability of the efficacy of HZ/su, its efficacy as a booster for previous recipients of ZVL, and its efficacy in immunocompromised patients.

Four hundred thirty participants (215 in each study group) were matched and vaccinated. At 12 months after dose 2, the according-to-protocol cohort for immunogenicity consisted of 198 participants from the HZ-PreVac group (mean age [standard deviation], 71.2 [4.6] years) and 199 from the HZ-NonVac group (mean age, 70.7 [4.7] years). In the study, 51% and 50.8% of the participants, respectively, were women, and all participants were of White/European ancestry.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^115RNRM7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Michiaki Takahashi developed the live attenuated varicella vaccine in 1974. This was the first, and is still the only, herpesvirus vaccine. Early studies showed promise, but the vaccine was rigorously tested on immunosuppressed patients because of their high risk of fatal varicella; vaccination proved to be lifesaving. Subsequently, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in healthy children. Eventually, the varicella vaccine became a component of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, 2 doses of which are administered in the United States to approximately 90% of children. The incidence of varicella has dropped dramatically in the United States since vaccine licensure in 1995. The varicella vaccine is also associated with a decreased incidence of zoster and is protective for susceptible adults. Today, immunocompromised individuals are protected against varicella due to vaccine-induced herd immunity. Latent infection with varicella-zoster virus occurs after vaccination; however, the vaccine strain is impaired in its ability to reactivate.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^111L9SDZ]. Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In the 1970s, a major concern regarding the use of the newly developed vOka was the possibility that it might cause latent infection. There was apprehension that the vaccine virus could reactivate and result in zoster, potentially with a high frequency. Early studies involving children with leukemia, however, did not observe the expected increase in zoster; rather, they indicated that the frequency of zoster was reduced. In fact, long-term observations suggest that latency of the vaccine virus may confer an advantage. Periodic asymptomatic reactivation might occur, enhancing immunity to varicella.

### Live-attenuated varicella vaccine [^114R2LuL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). High credibility.

This article reviews the history and development of the live attenuated varicella vaccine from its early days in Japan to its widespread use throughout the world. The vaccine has proven extremely safe, with immunization administered to as many as 10 million healthy children and adults in the United States alone. The vaccine is highly immunogenic and offers close to 100% protection from severe chickenpox and 90% protection from illness. It is expected to have a major impact on the epidemiology of varicella and zoster in countries with high vaccine uptake.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^116HSpx5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

When vOka was first developed, there was a concern that zoster might become more common after immunization than after infection with wild-type VZV. Although vOka was attenuated and thus did not cause a significant acute illness, little was known at the time about its tendency to develop latency and subsequently to reactivate.

Consequently, extensive research was conducted to compare the incidence of zoster in immunized individuals with those who had experienced wild-type varicella. Early studies were conducted in children with leukemia who were immunized in the 1980s. It was found that the incidence of zoster in these vaccinees was significantly lower than among similar leukemic children who had contracted varicella from wild-type VZV.

Because observations in leukemic children might not be generalizable to a healthy population, there was also considerable interest in determining the incidence of zoster in healthy individuals who had received vOka. Two large studies utilizing electronic databases were conducted by members of Kaiser Permanente and the CDC. In the first study, conducted between 2005 and 2009, 322 subjects were enrolled, of whom 118 had been vaccinated. The incidence of zoster was 79% lower in vaccinated children than in unvaccinated children.

Interestingly, half of the cases of zoster detected in vaccinees were caused by wild-type VZV, suggesting either that they had been asymptomatically infected with wild-type VZV after receiving the vaccine or that they had already been infected with wild-type VZV prior to vaccination.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend considering offering the recombinant zoster vaccine to immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older, irrespective of prior receipt of the varicella vaccine or the live zoster vaccine, and without screening for a history of chickenpox.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^117HbiwF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes herpes zoster (HZ) on reactivation. Immunosenescence leads to a decrease of VZV-specific T-cell responses, which are thought to be the main mechanistic protection against VZV reactivation. Advanced age is, therefore, one of the major risk factors for developing HZ, with incidences increasing from 10/1000 person-years in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Vaccination represents a means to reduce HZ risk in older adults. In 2006, a live-attenuated HZ vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax; Merck Sharp & Dohme) was licensed and subsequently recommended in the United States for the prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 60 years. However, its efficacy decreases with age. In addition, efficacy against HZ is statistically significant only through year 5 and becomes negligible by year 11. Tseng et al. hypothesized that owing to declining effectiveness over time, revaccination of previous ZVL recipients might be beneficial. However, ZVL-boosted cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses decline significantly in 3 years in reimmunized individuals, with only memory responses remaining marginally higher compared with de novo–immunized individuals.

Given on a 2-dose schedule, the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix; GSK), consisting of the VZV glycoprotein E (gE) antigen and the AS01 B adjuvant system, demonstrated > 90% efficacy against HZ across all age strata, sustained over 4 years of follow-up. Since 2017, RZV has received licensure for the prevention of HZ in adults aged ≥ 50 years in several countries.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^117XXAxK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

After vOka was licensed in the United States, the vaccine continues to be evaluated. Immunized children and adults who manifest a serious rash or other symptoms post-vaccination are identified and studied. Post-licensure safety studies are mandated by the Food and Drug Administration because they provide information on safety and efficacy. The Worldwide Adverse Experience System, sponsored by Merck, was established in the late 1990s. It analyzes potential adverse events following varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccines. This program seeks to determine whether VZV recovered from patients with an adverse event after receiving the vaccine is vOka or wild-type VZV. The CDC also performs such laboratory determinations.

The type of VZV present in a rash that occurs shortly after vaccination continues to be of interest. The vOka in varicella vaccine is a live agent and could, in theory, infect an individual and give rise to disease despite its attenuation. The vaccine could occasionally be administered to an individual who is incubating wild-type VZV. After vaccination, a rash caused by infection with VZV could either be due to an adverse effect of vOka or it could be due to infection with wild-type VZV. If the latter, the rash could be the result of infection that occurred prior to vaccination, or it might indicate vaccine failure. During the early days after vOka was licensed, this type of analysis was particularly important because there were still many children who were actually developing varicella.

### Assessment of attenuation of varicella-zoster virus vaccines based on genomic comparison [^114Sjjba]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Live attenuated varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccines are used to prevent chickenpox and shingles. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur during the attenuation of parental strains are critical indicators of vaccine safety. To assess the attenuation of commercial VZV vaccines, genetic variants were comprehensively examined through high-throughput sequencing of viral DNA isolated from four VZV vaccines: Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella. Whole-genome comparison of the four vaccines with the wild-type strain (Dumas) revealed that the sequences are highly conserved on a genome-wide scale.

Among the 196 common variants across the four vaccines, 195 were already present in the genome of the parental strain (pOka), indicating that the variants occurred during the generation of the parental strain from the Dumas strain. Compared to the pOka genome, the vaccines exhibited distinct variant frequencies on a genome-wide level and within attenuation-related open reading frames. In particular, attenuation-associated 42 SNPs showed that Barycela, VarilRix, VariVax, and SKY Varicella are in ascending order regarding similarity with pOka-like genotypes, which might provide genomic evidence for the levels of attenuation. Finally, the phylogenetic network analysis demonstrated that genetic distances from the parental strain correlated with the attenuation levels of the vaccines.

The vaccine efficacy (VE) of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in reducing the use of pain medication for confirmed cases of herpes zoster (HZ) was assessed using an asymptotic standardized unconditional binomial test. The numbers of HZ-associated pain medications used and the duration of their use were also computed as means (ranges), whereby means were calculated as the arithmetic means and ranges as the differences between the maximum and the minimum values for a given participant group.

### Update on recommendations for use of herpes zoster vaccine [^114oxE9t]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

- **What recommendations are being reviewed**: Since 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine vaccination of all persons aged ≥ 60 years with 1 dose of herpes zoster vaccine.

- **Why are the recommendations being reviewed now**: After approval by the Food and Drug Administration for the use of the zoster vaccine in adults aged 50 through 59 years in 2011, ACIP initially considered use of the vaccine among adults in this age group but declined to change its recommendations at that time. This was due to shortages of Zostavax and limited data on long-term protection offered by the herpes zoster vaccine. A new review was conducted because the manufacturer has resumed the routine supply of Zostavax and additional data on long-term protection have become available.

- **What is currently recommended**: Considering that the burden of herpes zoster and its complications increases with age, and that the duration of vaccine protection in persons aged ≥ 60 years is uncertain, ACIP's recommendation remains unchanged. The herpes zoster vaccine is routinely recommended only for adults aged ≥ 60 years.

Because the protection offered by the herpes zoster vaccine wanes within the first 5 years after vaccination, and the duration of protection beyond 5 years is uncertain, it is unknown to what extent persons vaccinated before age 60 years will be protected as they age and their risk for herpes zoster and its complications increases. Because the duration of protection offered by the vaccine is uncertain, the need for revaccination is not clear.

### A phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of a varicella zoster glycoprotein e subunit vaccine candidate in young and older adults [^115bZKMR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

An adjuvanted recombinant varicella zoster virus (VZV) subunit vaccine is being developed for the prevention of herpes zoster and its complications.

- **Methods**: In a phase I/II, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, older adults (50–70 years) received two doses, two months apart, of an adjuvanted recombinant glycoprotein E vaccine (HZ/su; n = 45), a live attenuated Oka strain VZV vaccine (OKA; n = 45), or HZ/su and OKA administered concomitantly (n = 45). To evaluate safety prior to administration in older adults, young adults (18–30 years) were vaccinated with two doses two months apart of HZ/su (n = 10) or OKA (n = 10). Safety and immunogenicity were assessed up to 42 months for older adults immunized with HZ/su and up to 12 months for all others.

- **Results**: Few grade 3 events and no severe adverse events were reported. Fatigue, myalgia, headache, and injection site pain were the most common solicited reactions for HZ/su and occurred more frequently than with OKA. CD4(+) T-cell and humoral immune responses were much higher with HZ/su than with OKA and remained elevated until 42 months. Addition of OKA to HZ/su did not increase immunogenicity.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, the HZ/su adjuvanted subunit vaccine was well tolerated and more immunogenic than a live attenuated VZV vaccine. Clinical trial registration: NCT00492648 and NCT00492648.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, specifically with respect to immunization for immunocompromised adults, the CDC's 2018 guidelines recommend offering the recombinant zoster vaccine to patients taking low-dose immunosuppressive therapy (such as less than 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) or using inhaled or topical corticosteroids. The vaccine is also recommended for patients anticipating immunosuppression or those who have recovered from an immunocompromising illness.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine confers long-term protection against herpes zoster: Interim results of an extension study of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 [^113qkNK8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a disease caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which establishes lifelong latency in the dorsal root ganglia after the initial infection. HZ occurs most frequently after the age of 50 years, and the risk of HZ increases further with age due to immunosenescence. HZ can have painful and debilitating complications, such as post-herpetic neuralgia, yet it is preventable by vaccination. As vaccine-induced immunity can wane over time, it is critical to assess if vaccines induce long-lasting protective immunity.

For instance, a single dose of the live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL, Zostavax, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp) was 68% effective against HZ in individuals aged ≥ 50 years during the first year post-vaccination, but its effectiveness waned to 32% by the eighth year post-vaccination. Its efficacy against HZ in those aged ≥ 60 years also dropped from 62% in the first year post-vaccination to non-statistically significant levels beyond the eighth year post-vaccination.

The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix, GSK), consisting of recombinant varicella-zoster glycoprotein E (gE) and the AS01 B adjuvant system, administered as a 2-dose schedule, demonstrated ≥ 90% efficacy against HZ in all age groups ≥ 50 years. This level of efficacy was maintained over a 3.2- and 3.7-year follow-up period in two pivotal phase 3 trials (ZOE-50 and ZOE-70, respectively). While a correlate of protection has not been established at the time of writing, additional data have shown that immune responses to RZV plateau at a substantial level above baseline from the fourth year.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^111sYiKr]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The main limitation of these results is that intervals of < 5 years between a previous ZVL dose and 2 subsequent RZV doses have not been evaluated. However, there are no scientific data or theoretical concerns to indicate that RZV would be less safe or effective when administered with an interval of < 5 years. Accordingly, in older individuals (aged ≥ 50 years), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends administration of RZV at a shorter interval, but no sooner than 8 weeks after ZVL.

In conclusion, RZV induced strong humoral and polyfunctional CMI responses that persisted above prevaccination levels up to 1 year after RZV dose 2 in adults aged ≥ 65 years, irrespective of previous ZVL vaccination, without clinically significant differences in the RZV safety profile between study groups. Therefore, both ZVL-naive individuals and previous ZVL recipients are likely to similarly benefit from RZV vaccination.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^1153Dc42]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Protection against herpes zoster (HZ) induced by the live attenuated zoster vaccine Zostavax (ZVL) wanes within 3–7 years. Revaccination may renew protection. We assessed whether revaccination with the adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine candidate (HZ/su) induced comparable immune responses in previous ZVL recipients and ZVL-naive individuals (HZ-NonVac).

- **Methods**: In an open-label, multicenter study, adults aged ≥ 65 years, vaccinated with ZVL ≥ 5 years previously (HZ-PreVac), were matched to ZVL-naive adults (HZ-NonVac). Participants received two doses of HZ/su two months apart. The primary objective of noninferiority of the humoral immune response one month post-dose two was considered demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the adjusted anti-glycoprotein E geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio of HZ-NonVac over HZ-PreVac was < 1.5. HZ/su cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety were also assessed.

- **Results**: In 430 participants, the humoral immune response to HZ/su was noninferior in HZ-PreVac compared with HZ-NonVac (adjusted GMC ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.92–1.17]). Cellular immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety appeared to be comparable between groups. HZ/su was well-tolerated, with no safety concerns raised within one month post-dose two.

- **Conclusions**: HZ/su induces a strong immune response irrespective of prior vaccination with ZVL and may be an attractive option to revaccinate prior ZVL recipients.

Clinical Trials Registration: NCT02581410.

### Recombinant zoster vaccine (shingrix): Real-world effectiveness in the first 2 years post-licensure [^114LSHkv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine) was licensed to prevent herpes zoster, dispensed as two doses given 2–6 months apart among adults aged ≥ 50 years. Clinical trials yielded efficacy of > 90% for confirmed herpes zoster, but post-market performance has not been evaluated. Efficacy of a single dose and a delayed second dose, as well as efficacy among persons with autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions, have not been studied. We aimed to assess the post-market vaccine effectiveness of Shingrix.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study among Medicare Part D community-dwelling beneficiaries aged > 65 years. Herpes zoster was identified using a medical office visit diagnosis with treatment, and postherpetic neuralgia was identified using a validated algorithm. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to improve cohort balance and marginal structural models to estimate hazard ratios.

- **Results**: We found a vaccine effectiveness of 70.1% (95% confidence interval, 68.6–71.5) and 56.9% (95% CI, 55.0–58.8) for two and one doses, respectively. The two-dose vaccine effectiveness was not significantly lower for beneficiaries aged > 80 years, for second doses received at ≥ 180 days, or for individuals with autoimmune conditions. The vaccine was also effective among individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. The two-dose vaccine effectiveness against postherpetic neuralgia was 76.0% (95% CI, 68.4–81.8).

- **Conclusions**: This large real-world observational study of the effectiveness of Shingrix demonstrates the benefit of completing the two-dose regimen. Second doses administered beyond the recommended interval were still effective.

### Boosting immunity in recipients of live-attenuated zoster vaccine [^117CwPuk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The article by Levin et al. in this issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases provides important preliminary insight into the acquired immune responses to a second dose of the zoster vaccine in persons aged ≥ 70 years. No serious vaccine-related adverse events were observed, although the authors did not mention this in their discussion. The response to a first dose of the zoster vaccine was also evaluated across three age groups: 50–59 years, 60–69 years, and ≥ 70 years. VZV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels peaked at six weeks for all test groups. The IgG responses in all four groups were comparable, even for those receiving their first dose of the vaccine at ≥ 70 years of age.

- **Cell-mediated immune responses**: These were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunospot assays to measure interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion by effector and memory T cells. In contrast to the IgG response, significant differences were observed in the CMI responses of the four different study groups. The CMI responses in the group of individuals aged ≥ 70 years receiving their first dose were notably less robust. However, individuals aged ≥ 70 years receiving a booster dose 10 years after the first dose responded comparably to persons in the group aged 60–69 years. The booster in these individuals thus demonstrated a residual effect of the first dose.

The strongest CMI responses were obtained from persons 50–59 years old receiving their first dose of the vaccine. The authors speculate that booster doses might be expected to be more effective in adults receiving their first dose between the ages of 50 and…

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^116BPQK5]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Zoster Vaccine Recombinant, Adjuvanted (Shingrix, GlaxoSmithKline [GSK]) is a two-dose (0.5 mL each) subunit vaccine containing recombinant glycoprotein E in combination with adjuvant (AS01 B). It was licensed in the United States for the prevention of herpes zoster for adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended for immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 50 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2017.

On July 23, 2021, the FDA expanded the indication for recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) to include adults aged ≥ 18 years who are or will be at increased risk for herpes zoster due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. On October 20, 2021, ACIP recommended two doses of RZV for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications in adults aged ≥ 19 years who are or will be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed because of disease or therapy.

RZV is the first herpes zoster vaccine approved for use in immunocompromised persons. With moderate to high vaccine efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, RZV has the potential to prevent considerable herpes zoster incidence and related complications. This report updates previous ACIP recommendations for the prevention of herpes zoster.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^1134GR4h]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

A number of live vaccines for the protection of healthy children from viral diseases were successfully introduced before the varicella vaccine. These include poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, and mumps vaccines. For many years, varicella was considered too mild to warrant prevention. Serious complications of varicella, such as pneumonia and bacterial sepsis, both of which are now well recognized and justly feared, must have occurred in some children but may have been ignored.

In the 1960s, the standard of care for young children with leukemia, which previously had been virtually uniformly fatal, became treatment with anticancer drugs that ameliorated and often cured leukemia, which also were immunosuppressive. In the absence of a vaccine, epidemics of varicella recurred every winter and spring. These epidemics affected susceptible children regardless of whether they were immunosuppressed. However, varicella is a dangerous illness in immunosuppressed patients being treated for leukemia. The unanticipated consequence of the advance of medical therapy was that children could be cured of leukemia only to die of varicella.

Varicella thus no longer seemed too inconsequential to justify the development of a vaccine. Even in immunocompetent populations, varicella caused approximately 100 deaths per year in the United States. This may not seem like a large number of people, but both to the families involved and to society, it was intolerable.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^115AYpRo]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Our findings need to be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations of the study design. The sample size was calculated to demonstrate noninferiority of the humoral immune response with 99% power, and our matching strategy aimed to ensure that the selected baseline characteristics are similar in both groups. Nonetheless, matching resulted in a study population that was entirely of white heritage. In addition, as the United States was one of the few countries where ZVL coverage was sufficiently high, only US study centers participated.

In sum, we show that following vaccination with HZ/su, the humoral response in adults who were previously vaccinated with the live attenuated zoster vaccine was noninferior to that in adults without any previous vaccination against HZ. Robust cellular immune responses were observed in both groups. No clinically significant differences in safety and reactogenicity were observed between the two study groups. Taken together, HZ/su was well tolerated and induced a strong immune response irrespective of prior vaccination with ZVL, and may therefore be an attractive option to revaccinate prior ZVL recipients.

### Effectiveness of recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster in a real-world setting [^115UnS7T]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

A 2-dose series of recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was 97% effective against herpes zoster (HZ) in a pivotal clinical trial.

- **Objective**: To evaluate real-world effectiveness of RZV against HZ.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Four health care systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink.

- **Participants**: Persons aged 50 years or older.

- **Measurements**: The outcome was incident HZ defined by a diagnosis with an antiviral prescription. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard of HZ in vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons, with adjustment for covariates. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 minus the adjusted hazard ratio and was estimated by time since the last RZV dose and by corticosteroid use.

- **Results**: The study included nearly 2.0 million persons who contributed 7.6 million person-years of follow-up. After adjustment, VE of 1 dose was 64% and VE of 2 doses was 76%. After 1 dose only, VE was 70% during the first year, 45% during the second year, 48% during the third year, and 52% after the third year. After 2 doses, VE was 79% during the first year, 75% during the second year, and 73% during the third and fourth years. Vaccine effectiveness was 65% in persons who received corticosteroids before vaccination and 77% in those who did not.

- **Limitation**: Herpes zoster could not be identified as accurately in these observational data as in the previous clinical trials.

- **Conclusion**: Two doses of RZV were highly effective, although less effective than in the previous clinical trials. Two-dose effectiveness waned very little during the third and fourth years.

### Postlicensure safety surveillance of recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) - United States, October 2017-June 2018 [^111wGZYi]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV; Shingrix), an adjuvanted glycoprotein vaccine, was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for adults aged ≥ 50 years in October 2017. The previously licensed live-attenuated zoster vaccine (ZVL; Zostavax) is recommended for adults aged ≥ 60 years. RZV is administered intramuscularly as a 2-dose series, with an interval of 2–6 months between doses. In prelicensure clinical trials, 85% of 6,773 vaccinated study participants reported local or systemic reactions after receiving RZV, with approximately 17% experiencing a grade 3 reaction (erythema or induration > 3.5 inches or systemic symptoms that interfere with normal activity). However, rates of serious adverse events (i.e. hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death) were similar in the RZV and placebo groups.

After licensure, the CDC and FDA began safety monitoring of RZV in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). During the first 8 months of use, when approximately 3.2 million RZV doses were distributed (GlaxoSmithKline, personal communication, 2018), VAERS received a total of 4,381 reports of adverse events, 130 (3.0%) of which were classified as serious. Commonly reported signs and symptoms included pyrexia (fever) (1,034; 23.6%), injection site pain (985; 22.5%), and injection site erythema (880; 20.1%). No unexpected patterns were detected in reports of adverse events or serious adverse events.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, specifically with respect to immunization in immunocompetent adults, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend administering the second dose of the recombinant zoster vaccine 2–6 months after the first dose. Do not restart the vaccine series if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose. Repeat the second dose if the second dose of the recombinant zoster vaccine is given less than 4 weeks after the first dose. Administer 2 doses of the vaccine regardless of prior history of herpes zoster or prior receipt of the live zoster vaccine.

### Varicella vaccines [^116vfiJx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Live attenuated vaccines exist for varicella and herpes zoster. The varicella vaccine is largely administered in the immunocompetent population despite substantial evidence indicating its safety and effectiveness in immunocompromised groups.

Varicella vaccine has been in use for decades, and its safety and efficacy in healthy children are well documented in the literature. The vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with immunodeficiency. Recent studies have examined the immune response of the varicella vaccine in children with conditions such as hematological malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus with a CD4 T-cell count of at least 200 cells/μl, atopic dermatitis, and juvenile rheumatic diseases, finding that the vaccine was immunogenic in most cases. Additionally, the herpes zoster vaccine, the newest addition to the varicella vaccine family, has been proven to be well tolerated and effective in healthy adults, although the vaccination rate has been dismal.

Studies suggest that the varicella vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic in moderately immunocompromised children and could be beneficial in reducing the burden of viral infection. Similar studies in immunodeficient adults should be undertaken for the herpes zoster vaccine, which has been shown to lower the incidence of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^116g6wWU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) and RZV (SHINGRIX) are currently licensed or distributed in 62 countries worldwide. Although both vaccines are approved in all 28 countries within the European Union (EU), only 9 include recommendations for vaccination against herpes zoster in their national vaccination policies [245–250].

- **Zoster vaccine live**: Zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) is licensed in 57 countries and is available for the prevention of herpes zoster and its complications in 41. As of February 2021, 51 million doses of the zoster vaccine live have been distributed globally, with 30.5 million within the United States and 20.5 million in other countries. In 2020 alone, 2.2 million doses of ZOSTAVAX were distributed, with more than 90% of the total in Italy, the United Kingdom, Greece, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea.

	- In 2016, Ontario was the first Canadian province to publicly fund the zoster vaccine live for adults aged 65–70 years. In November 2016, Australia's National Immunization Program provided the vaccine without charge to adults aged 70 years, with a catch-up program for those aged 71–79 years. The program is funded until October 2021.

	- In March 2016, Japan extended approval of the vaccine (BIKEN), which has a higher titer of vOka than ZOSTAVAX, for the prevention of herpes zoster in individuals aged 50 years and older.

Live-attenuated zoster vaccine NBP608 (SKY Zoster), manufactured with vOka by SK Bioscience in the Republic of Korea, was approved by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

### The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults aged ≥ 65 years previously vaccinated with a live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^114jH2MP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In both study groups, while the proportion of CD4 T cells expressing three or four activation markers (polyfunctional CD4 T cells) increased after each RZV dose and remained above prevaccination levels at 12 months after dose 2, the proportion of CD4 T cells expressing a single activation marker decreased after each RZV dose and remained below the prevaccination level at 12 months after dose 2.

- **Expression of activation markers**: Expression of activation markers was similar in the two study groups. At all time points, CD40L (alone or especially in combination with other markers) was expressed in the vast majority of gE-specific CD4 T cells. IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α were usually expressed in combination with IL-2 and/or CD40L. The frequencies of CD4 T cells expressing individual and combinations of two, three, or four activation markers peaked one month after dose 2 and decreased thereafter, except for the frequency of those expressing CD40L alone, which peaked 12 months after dose 2.

- **Statistical correlation**: In both study groups, exploratory analyses showed a statistically significant positive correlation between anti-gE concentrations and gE-specific CD4 2+ T-cell frequencies at all time points, which was highest at one month after dose 2.

From RZV dose 1 through 12 months after dose 2, ≥ 1 SAE was reported by 18 (8.4%; 95% CI, 5.0%–12.9%) and 22 (10.2%; 95% CI, 6.5%–15.1%) participants from the HZ-PreVac and HZ-NonVac groups, respectively. Fatal SAEs were reported for 2 of 215 participants from the HZ-PreVac and 3 of 215 from the HZ-NonVac group. At least one pIMD was reported by 2 (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.

### Identifying optimal vaccination scenarios to reduce varicella zoster virus transmission and reactivation [^112u5MqW]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The chickenpox vaccine was first approved for use in the United States in 1995. Despite its successful use for a quarter century, global VZV vaccination policy remains a topic of much debate. It is a live-attenuated vaccine administered in two doses during childhood. The shingles vaccine is either a single (Zostovax) or double (Shingrix) dose recombinant vaccine given later in life to suppress reactivation.

Chickenpox vaccination is only used in a limited number of countries, and there are multiple reasons why most countries have not yet implemented vaccination. First, complications from chickenpox are rare, with less than 1% of infected individuals experiencing severe illness. Second, childhood immunization against VZV has been hypothesized to reduce natural VZV exposure in adults, which could then reduce VZV immune-boosting and cause additional reactivation. Third, low and intermediate levels of chickenpox vaccine coverage could shift the age distribution of chickenpox infection to older age groups, who would carry a higher burden of disease. Severe complications become more common in individuals who contract chickenpox at an older age. Fourth, as with other vaccine-preventable diseases, it is likely that natural infection provides longer immunity than a vaccine dose.

Despite the complexities surrounding VZV vaccination, some countries have chosen to vaccinate. Although the percentage of infections resulting in serious illness is low, when endemic VZV infects the majority, vaccination prevents a substantial number of serious cases, such as hospitalizations.

### Live, attenuated varicella zoster vaccination of an immunocompromised patient [^112YCHes]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

A vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster outbreaks in adults over the age of 60 years has recently been approved. A 76-year-old white female with a history of left axillary breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy was given a Zostavax injection by her primary care physician. Eight days later, the patient developed a rash. Given the recent administration of live, attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV), a diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous herpes zoster was made. The patient was treated successfully with a course of famciclovir for 10 days and cephalexin for 7 days for a secondary bacterial infection.

A review of the medical literature disclosed no reports of Zostavax given to adult cancer patients immunocompromised by systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, we believe this report is the first to describe the consequences of Zostavax administration to such a host. Clinicians should take care to review contraindications and precautions prior to administering the Zostavax vaccine.

### Herpes zoster vaccines [^116y1b4W]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The recombinant zoster vaccine (SHINGRIX) has undergone multiple trials to assess its safety and immunogenicity when administered alongside other vaccines in adults aged 50 and over.

- **Safety and immunogenicity with Pneumovax23**: A trial evaluating the concomitant administration of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) and Pneumovax23 revealed no immunologic interference, and no safety concerns were identified [240].

- **Safety and immunogenicity with Tdap**: A separate study assessed the coadministration of the first dose of RZV with the reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). The trial demonstrated noninferiority for all vaccine antigens, except pertactin. Notably, the pertactin-specific immune responses after coadministration of RZV and Tdap were favorable when compared to protective levels identified in a German household contact study. These findings do not suggest clinically relevant interference between RZV and Tdap, and no safety concerns were identified [241, 242].

- **Safety and immunogenicity with IIV4**: A phase III trial investigated the coadministration of RZV and the unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4). The results demonstrated noninferiority of antibody responses to both vaccines when compared to sequential administration. Importantly, there was no decrease in immunogenicity, and no safety concerns were noted [243].

Currently, there are no recommendations for the concomitant administration of the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and RZV, as the coadministration of two adjuvanted vaccines has not yet been evaluated [244].

### Cost-effectiveness of vaccination of immunocompetent older adults against herpes zoster in the Netherlands: A comparison between the adjuvanted subunit and live-attenuated vaccines [^116KYwqX]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A new adjuvanted HZ subunit vaccine (HZ/su or Shingrix®) might potentially overcome the shortcomings of ZVL. In Europe, HZ/su has been registered for all adults aged ≥ 50 years in 2018 and is a recombinant vaccine containing the VZV glycoprotein E adjuvanted with the AS01 B system. The vaccine has been developed to be given in a two-dose schedule, administered 2–6 months apart. Two large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that the protective efficacy of two doses of HZ/su against HZ incidence was 97% (95% CI 94–99%) among immunocompetent individuals aged ≥ 50 years and 91% (95% CI 87–95%) among those aged ≥ 70 years. The duration of protection is currently unknown, but the trial confirmed a relatively stable efficacy over four years of follow-up.

Due to the registration of HZ/su, governments have the option to reassess their vaccination policy for HZ in the near future, but cost-effectiveness analyses for HZ/su are scarce. Previous cost-effectiveness studies for the US, Hong Kong, and Germany exist; however, results from other countries are not directly transferable to the Dutch context due to potential differences in epidemiological conditions, existing vaccination policies against HZ and varicella, healthcare resource use, and relative prices. Moreover, no comparison of HZ/su with ZVL booster strategies has been performed, and a lack of studies incorporating real-world effectiveness data for ZVL is noted. Therefore, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of HZ vaccination for the Dutch setting. First, we compared the impact of HZ/su and ZVL in immunocompetent older adults using efficacy data.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, particularly with respect to immunization in immunocompromised adults, the CDC 2022 guidelines recommend offering vaccination before individuals become immunosuppressed, if possible. It is advised to time the vaccination when the immune response is likely to be most robust, which is during periods of lower immunosuppression and stable disease.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies: A phase 3, randomised, clinical trial and post-hoc efficacy analysis [^117P5SiN]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix) can prevent herpes zoster in older adults and autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1–2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments. We stratified participants according to their underlying diseases. The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after the last vaccination in all participants. Additionally, we evaluated the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Furthermore, we assessed the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We assessed immunogenicity in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort.

### Association between immunogenicity and reactogenicity: A post hoc analysis of 2 phase 3 studies with the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine [^114JGnwW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

A recurring question is whether transient reactions to vaccines translate into better immune responses. Using clinical data from two large phase 3 studies of the recombinant zoster vaccine, we observed a small but statistically significant association between the intensity of a frequent side effect (pain) after vaccination and immune responses to vaccination. However, despite the statistical correlation, the impact on the immune response is so small, and the immune response in individuals without pain already sufficient, that pain cannot be a surrogate marker for an appropriate immune response. Reactogenicity cannot be used to predict immunity after vaccination.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^1157ZX81]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

This study demonstrated that the humoral immune response to HZ/su, one month after the second dose, was noninferior in adults over 65 years who had received the live attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax) more than five years prior compared with those who had not received the vaccine. Additionally, HZ/su was well-tolerated in both study groups, with no safety concerns identified from the initial vaccination to one month post-dose two.

As in previous studies, HZ/su induced robust immune responses. Specifically, prior vaccination with ZVL did not negatively affect the humoral immune responses to HZ/su. Descriptive analyses revealed no apparent differences in CMI responses, as assessed by CD4 2+ T-cell frequencies, with post-vaccination increases observed in both study groups. These observations suggest that HZ/su vaccination may offer protection and could be an attractive option for revaccinating adults over 65 years who were vaccinated with ZVL over five years ago.

Consistent with previous findings, recipients of HZ/su frequently reported solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs). Reactogenicity, observed during phase two and phase three clinical trials with HZ/su, was characterized by transient injection site reactions, headaches, fatigue, and myalgia. The findings from this study indicate that reactogenicity is not exacerbated in older adults previously vaccinated with ZVL. Therefore, reactogenicity in HZ/su recipients who previously received ZVL is unlikely to differ substantially.

### Use of recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised adults aged ≥ 19 years: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^116BB9NS]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to immunization, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend administering the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine typically 2–6 months after the first dose. Consider administering the second dose 1–2 months after the first dose in persons being or going to be immunodeficient or immunosuppressed and who would benefit from a shorter vaccination schedule. Repeat a valid second dose at least 4 weeks after the previous dose if the second recombinant zoster vaccine dose is given sooner than 4 weeks after the first. Do not restart the vaccine series if more than 6 months have elapsed since the first dose.

### Immunogenicity and safety of the HZ/su adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine in adults previously vaccinated with a live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine [^111MfXf7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

This study is a phase 3, open-label, group-matched, multicenter study conducted in the United States. Adults aged ≥ 65 years who had been previously vaccinated with ZVL (Zostavax) at least 5 years prior to the study start (HZ-PreVac) and group-matched ZVL-naive adults (HZ-NonVac) were enrolled. The active phase of the study began in March 2016, with the first vaccination, and was completed in August 2016, one month after the second dose. The extended safety follow-up is expected to be completed in August 2017.

Participants in the HZ-NonVac group were matched to those in the HZ-PreVac group based on predefined variables including age (65–69, 70–79, ≥ 80 years), sex, race (white, African American, Hispanic, and other), and medical condition. Medical conditions were ranked hierarchically as immune-mediated diseases, diabetes mellitus, depression, pulmonary disorders, heart conditions, and none of these conditions, with participants being matched according to the highest-ranked condition.

Study participants were men or women aged ≥ 65 years at the time of the first vaccination with HZ/su. Adults eligible for inclusion in the HZ-PreVac group had received ZVL at least 5 years before the study started. Participants provided written informed consent before the study commenced. Adults were excluded from participation if they had received or were scheduled to receive a live vaccine within 30 days or had received any investigational or nonregistered drug or vaccine within 30 days.

### Final analysis of the ZOE-LTFU trial to 11 years post-vaccination: efficacy of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster and related complications [^1173f3wi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or adverse events (AEs) leading to withdrawal that were considered related to the investigational vaccine, study participation, or to a conGSK medication or vaccine during the entire ZOE-LTFU study. The most common reasons for study withdrawal were unrelated SAEs, consent withdrawal not related to an AE, and loss to follow-up. The study adds to the long-term safety profile of the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV), which has been established across multiple clinical trials and during over five years of post-licensure use.

- **Efficacy of RZV**: The efficacy of RZV in the ZOE-50/70 studies, along with the potential public health benefits, has contributed to changes in the national immunization programs of several countries. Some countries have introduced preferential recommendations in favor of RZV. Some, that did not previously recommend herpes zoster vaccination, have included RZV in their routine immunization programs, and some have lowered the recommended age of vaccination. Data from the ZOE-LTFU study, including high efficacy observed in all age groups and minimal waning of vaccine efficacy (VE) over time, might support further introductions and expansion of vaccination to all age groups ≥ 50 years.

- **Study limitations**: Our study had some limitations. Only approximately one-half of potentially eligible participants from ZOE-50/70 took part in the ZOE-LTFU study, although the participants in ZOE-LTFU were generally representative of those in the parent studies. Due to the high VE and favorable safety profile of RZV in ZOE-50/70, participants from the placebo group were offered the vaccine in a cross-vaccination study. Therefore, there was no placebo group.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of herpes zoster vaccines [^112vXqNP]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Timing of RZV for persons previously vaccinated with ZVL. Age and time since receipt of ZVL may be considered to determine when to vaccinate with RZV. Studies examined the safety and immunogenicity of RZV vaccination administered ≥ 5 years after ZVL; shorter intervals have not been studied. However, there are no data or theoretical concerns to indicate that RZV would be less safe or less effective when administered at an interval of < 5 years. Clinical trials indicated lower efficacy of ZVL in adults aged ≥ 70 years; therefore, a shorter interval may be considered based on the recipient's age when ZVL was administered. Based on expert opinion, RZV should not be given < 2 months after receipt of ZVL.

- **Coadministration with other vaccines**: CDC's general best practice guidelines for immunization advise that recombinant and adjuvanted vaccines, such as RZV, can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other adult vaccines. Concomitant administration of RZV with Fluarix Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine) (QIV) has been studied, and there was no evidence for interference in the immune response to either vaccine or safety concerns. Evaluation of coadministration of RZV with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax23) and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (Tdap, Boostrix) is ongoing. The safety and efficacy of administration of two adjuvanted vaccines (e.g. RZV and adjuvanted influenza vaccine [Fluad]), either concomitantly or at other intervals, have not been evaluated.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1173i4Ai]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the herpes zoster live attenuated vaccine with the herpes zoster adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine or placebo for adults aged 50 and older.

- **Design**: The study utilized a systematic review with Bayesian meta-analysis and network meta-analysis.

- **Data sources**: The data sources included Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to January 2017), grey literature, and reference lists of included studies.

- **Eligibility criteria for study selection**: The study included experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies that compared the live attenuated vaccine with the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, placebo, or no vaccine in adults aged 50 and older. Relevant outcomes were the incidence of herpes zoster (primary outcome), herpes zoster ophthalmicus, post-herpetic neuralgia, quality of life, adverse events, and death.

- **Results**: A total of 27 studies (22 randomized controlled trials) including 2,044,504 patients, along with 18 companion reports, were included after screening 2,037 titles and abstracts, followed by 175 full-text articles. Network meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found no statistically significant differences between the live attenuated vaccine and placebo for the incidence of laboratory-confirmed herpes zoster. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, however, was statistically superior to both the live attenuated vaccine (vaccine efficacy 85%, 95% credible interval 31% to 98%) and placebo (94%, 79% to 98%). Network meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials showed the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine to be associated with sta

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116RHuFr]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

Across all analyses, only three comparators were included: live attenuated vaccine, adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine, and placebo/no vaccine. The transitivity plots suggested that the effect modifiers were balanced across the treatments when these were reported; however, several of the analyses did not have information on all comparisons in the network (see appendix S12). Comparison-adjusted funnel plots were generated for the cases of suspected herpes zoster and injection site adverse events outcomes (see appendix S13). Only 11 unique trials existed for both of these outcomes, resulting in low power to examine publication bias and small study effects. Although the funnel plot for injection site adverse events was considered to be symmetrical, the funnel plot for suspected herpes zoster was asymmetrical. Further examination revealed three trials with large standard errors and negatively centered effect sizes, so a sensitivity analysis was done excluding these three trials. The results in table 4 and table 5 and in figure 3 and figure 4 are based on randomized controlled trials that included immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients, or both.

### Live attenuated varicella vaccine: Prevention of varicella and of zoster [^115VLiuN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Prelicensure studies of the safety and efficacy of vOka for the prevention of varicella in healthy children have been conducted extensively. Numerous clinical trials in the United States during the 1980s involved hundreds of healthy children as participants. These studies established that vOka is safe, well-tolerated, and protective against household exposures. Side effects were minor, occurring in less than 5% of vaccine recipients. Adverse reactions included pain, redness, and rash at the injection site, as well as systemic symptoms such as mild generalized rash and transient fever. Adolescents exhibited more adverse events compared to younger children. Most immunized children developed ELISA antibodies to VZV, which persisted for years post-vaccination, although their protective capacity remains uncertain. Similar safety and immunogenicity findings were observed in studies of children in Asia and Europe, where slightly different vOka formulations were tested.

Approximately 85% of children receiving one dose of vOka were protected from wild-type VZV infection after exposure to VZV-infected individuals. Those who did develop varicella post-exposure typically experienced mild infections. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in the United States and Finland, employing different vaccine doses, demonstrated that vOka provided protection to 90%–100% of recipients over several years. The degree of protection varied with the quantity of attenuated virus in the vaccine.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111KgoKG]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The results suggest that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is superior to the live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster infection, as measured by laboratory or doctor confirmed cases and suspected cases. Owing to a lack of data, the superiority of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine over the live attenuated vaccine in reducing the number of cases of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and post-herpetic neuralgia is inconclusive. The adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine was, however, associated with more adverse events at injection sites than the live attenuated vaccine.

On the basis of the limited indirect evidence available, no statistically significant differences were shown between the vaccines for serious adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, and death. A randomised controlled trial comparing the immunogenicity and safety of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine with the live attenuated vaccine will provide direct evidence on the relative safety of the two vaccines. As such, the results of this systematic review will need to be updated with evidence from this trial, as well as any additional new trials completed after the literature search. Differences between the dosages of the vaccine were not observed, suggesting the standard doses are appropriate for clinical use.

- **Strengths and limitations of this study**: This systematic review has several strengths. As no trials currently compare the safety and effectiveness of the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and live attenuated vaccine, the analysis provides critical insights into their relative benefits and risks.

To compare the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of the herpes zoster live attenuated vaccine with the herpes zoster adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine or placebo for adults aged 50 and older, a systematic review with Bayesian meta-analysis and network meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Data sources**: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to January 2017), along with grey literature and reference lists of included studies, were utilized.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115m6Wm4]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Withdrawal due to adverse events — six randomised controlled trials, including 35,678 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, were included in the network meta-analysis of withdrawal due to adverse events, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant (see Table 4 and Table 5). This was consistent in the dose-effect analysis (see Appendix S23) and in all additional analyses (see Appendix S21).

Potential immune-mediated diseases — only two randomised controlled trials, including 29,311 immunocompetent patients, were included in the meta-analysis on potential immune-mediated diseases (see Table 4 and Table 5); there was no statistical difference between the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine and placebo. No additional analyses were possible for this outcome.

Death — seven randomised controlled trials, including 102,718 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, were included in the network meta-analysis for observed death during the study period, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant (see Table 4 and Table 5). This was consistent in the dose-effect analysis (see Appendix S23) and in all additional analyses (see Appendix S22).

Rank heat plot — the rank heat plot suggests that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is the most effective vaccine against herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and post-herpetic neuralgia, with fewer serious adverse events and deaths compared to using the live attenuated vaccine or placebo. The live attenuated vaccine is safer for injection site and systemic adverse events, with fewer withdrawals due to adverse events.

### Live attenuated zoster vaccine boosts varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific humoral responses systemically and at the cervicovaginal mucosa of Kenyan VZV-seropositive women [^114DAjgR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a promising vector for recombinant vaccines. Because human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines are believed to require mucosal immunogenicity, we characterized mucosal VZV-specific humoral immunity following VZVOka vaccination.

- **Methods**: Adult Kenyan VZV-seropositive women (n = 44) received a single dose of the live zoster VZVOka vaccine. The anamnestic responses to the virus were followed longitudinally in both plasma and mucosal secretions using an in-house glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with safety and reactogenicity monitored. VZV seroprevalence and baseline responses to the virus were also characterized in our cohorts (n = 288).

- **Results**: Besides boosting anti-VZV antibody responses systemically, vaccination also boosted anti-VZV immunity in the cervicovaginal mucosa with a 2.9-fold rise in immunoglobulin G (P < .0001) and a 1.6-fold rise in immunoglobulin A (IgA) (P = .004) from the time before immunization and 4 weeks post-vaccination. Baseline analysis demonstrated high avidity antibodies at the gastrointestinal and genital mucosa of VZV-seropositive women. Measurement of VZV-specific IgA in saliva is a sensitive tool for detecting prior VZV infection.

- **Conclusions**: VZVOka vaccine was safe and immunogenic in VZV-seropositive adult Kenyan women. We provided compelling evidence of VZV's ability to induce genital mucosa immunity. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT02514018.

### Final analysis of the ZOE-LTFU trial to 11 years post-vaccination: Efficacy of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine against herpes zoster and related complications [^117AkJGV]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). Primary infection with VZV causes varicella (chickenpox), usually in children. During primary infection, the virus enters sensory nerves and becomes latent; reactivation of the latent virus causes HZ, usually in older adults. The incidence of HZ increases with age.

HZ often begins with a prodromal phase with pain, itching, and numbness, followed by a blistering rash that can leave residual scarring. HZ can result in complications including post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), disseminated infections, secondary bacterial infection, ophthalmic and neurological complications, and vasculopathy. PHN, defined as pain persisting for more than 90 days after commencement of the HZ rash, is the most frequent complication of HZ, and its incidence rises with older age. It is difficult to manage and can last for months to years, with a substantial impact on quality of life.

A large proportion of the population is at risk for HZ and HZ-related complications, especially as populations are aging in most parts of the world. Vaccines against HZ are approved from 50 years of age; thus, it is important to demonstrate that vaccinated individuals continue to be protected as they grow older, as the risk of HZ and associated complications rises with age. Long-term follow-up of the first licensed HZ vaccine (live attenuated zoster vaccine [zoster vaccine live, ZVL, Zostavax, MSD]) indicated that vaccine efficacy (VE) waned substantially over time and was 51.3%, 39.6%, and 21.1% for follow-up periods of 0–4.9 years.

### Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of herpes zoster vaccines in adults aged 50 and older: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112gqSDM]. BMJ (2018). High credibility.

The findings reported in this study are consistent with a review of the evidence conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years and older. Although a literature review was performed, the CDC did not conduct a systematic review or network meta-analysis. The CDC also carried out a cost analysis and found that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine prevented more disease at lower overall costs than the live attenuated vaccine. However, an additional cost-effectiveness analysis might provide further clarity.

Importantly, the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine requires two doses to be administered intramuscularly at 0 and 2–6 months, whereas the live attenuated vaccine requires a single subcutaneous dose. As such, a comparison of cost, including the vaccine route of administration as well as storage and handling, is necessary. A retrospective cohort study published after the literature search found the live attenuated vaccine to be effective, but immunity waned after five years. The study also noted that as people aged, the vaccine became less effective.

The results of this systematic review indicate that the adjuvant recombinant subunit vaccine is likely more effective than the live attenuated vaccine for preventing herpes zoster. Additionally, the dose effects analysis suggested that standard doses are appropriate. Clinicians and policymakers can use these results to inform their recommendations about these vaccines.
