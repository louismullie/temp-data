## Question

Which oral antibiotic is optimal for treating pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which oral antibiotic is optimal for treating pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether we are dealing with community-acquired pneumonia and the usual outpatient adult without comorbidities. Then, I should verify how comorbidities shift the recommended empiric oral options. Next, I will review safety, stewardship, and local resistance considerations that influence "optimal". After that, I need to check inpatient and step-down oral therapy nuances, special populations such as pediatrics, and the role of newer oral agents. Finally, I should synthesize a clear, prioritized recommendation with dosing and duration while double-checking guideline alignment and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Most outpatient questions like this refer to community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults, where the "optimal" oral agent depends on site of care, comorbidities, and local macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, with stewardship emphasizing the narrowest effective option to minimize resistance and adverse events [^117J4ouG] [^115ZzQTE].

> Wait, let me verify the most common scenario. For adult outpatients with nonsevere CAP and no comorbidities, ATS/IDSA 2019 and AAFP 2022 list high-dose amoxicillin 1 g three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, while macrolide monotherapy is considered only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is below 25% [^112EaToB] [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single "best" drug; I should balance efficacy with stewardship and safety. Amoxicillin is generally the preferred oral first-line for these low-risk adults because it's effective against typical CAP pathogens with the narrowest spectrum, aligns with WHO "Access" stewardship principles, and avoids the broader safety liabilities seen with respiratory fluoroquinolones, while macrolide monotherapy is less reliable where resistance is high and carries cardiovascular and other risks, although evidence quality around macrolide harms varies and needs local context [^115ZzQTE] [^114NCFtS] [^116EUyQ5].

> Let me think about penicillin allergy and atypical coverage needs. Doxycycline is an equally acceptable alternative for uncomplicated outpatients, especially with beta-lactam allergy or when some atypical coverage is desired, provided local resistance patterns and individual tolerability are considered, and I should confirm that severe allergy history truly precludes beta-lactams before defaulting to broader classes [^112EaToB] [^116EUyQ5].

> I need to check how comorbidities change the calculus. For adult outpatients with comorbid conditions such as chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia, guidelines recommend either a beta-lactam with a macrolide or doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, but given the adverse event profile and resistance selection of fluoroquinolones, many clinicians prefer amoxicillin-clavulanate plus doxycycline as a narrower, safer combination when feasible [^111GDt9s] [^111GDt9s] [^1144qSuY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should be precise about inpatients and oral therapy timing. For hospitalized patients, initiation is typically parenteral with oral step-down once clinically stable; recommended inpatient regimens include a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone for nonsevere CAP, with beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus fluoroquinolone for severe CAP, and then conversion to appropriate oral agents at stability, although some data suggest oral-only approaches can work in carefully selected nonsevere inpatient cases, which I should treat as exceptions rather than the rule [^116LD2BE] [^111svHTd].

> I should confirm duration and when shorter courses are acceptable. Standard duration is at least 5 days contingent on clinical stability, but updated guidance allows consideration of shorter courses, even down to 3 days in select nonsevere inpatients who achieve stability, so I must individualize by stability criteria such as normalizing vitals, mentation, and oral intake before stopping, and avoid overtreatment [^115BfusZ] [^113DyKsv].

> Next, I should review special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In school-aged children with suspected bacterial CAP, amoxicillin is first-line in the outpatient setting when antibiotics are indicated; in nursing home residents managed on site, oral therapy can be appropriate for selected patients; and in adults who test positive for influenza or COVID-19 with a convincing viral syndrome, I should avoid empiric antibiotics unless clinical concern for bacterial coinfection remains, particularly for otherwise healthy outpatients [^114DFwpz] [^1173K7Wf] [^112S2QnK].

> Let me also examine the role of newer oral options and make sure I don't overuse them. Lefamulin and omadacycline have oral formulations and were noninferior to moxifloxacin in trials, but given stewardship and cost, they should be reserved for specific scenarios such as intolerance or resistance to standard agents, rather than used routinely as "optimal" first choices [^111eWH23] [^113HB9Rg].

> But wait, what if someone argues for routine macrolide monotherapy in outpatients as "optimal"? I should double-check that this is only acceptable where local macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae is under 25%, otherwise failure risk rises, and even where resistance is low, patient-specific risk of QT prolongation and drug interactions must be weighed carefully before selecting a macrolide [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].

> I will now synthesize the practical answer. For the most common case — adult outpatient, nonsevere CAP, no comorbidities — the optimal oral choice is amoxicillin 1 g three times daily, with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily as an equally acceptable alternative, whereas macrolide monotherapy should be used only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is below 25% and the patient lacks cardiac or drug–drug interaction risks; for outpatients with comorbidities, amoxicillin-clavulanate plus doxycycline is a preferred, narrower combination when tolerated, reserving respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy for those who cannot take combinations or in whom coverage needs and risks justify it, all aligned with stewardship principles favoring the narrowest effective agent [^112EaToB] [^114NQhP1] [^116EUyQ5] [^115ZzQTE].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and follow-up elements. Whatever regimen is chosen, reassess at 48–72 hours for clinical response, de-escalate based on microbiology when available, and treat for a minimum of 5 days once stability is reached, while recognizing that in select nonsevere inpatients who rapidly stabilize, shorter validated courses may suffice per updated guidance and early switch to oral therapy safely shortens hospitalization without compromising outcomes [^115BfusZ] [^113DyKsv] [^114VYMRp].

The optimal oral antibiotic for pneumonia depends on patient comorbidities and local resistance patterns [^117J4ouG]. For **healthy outpatients without comorbidities**, use **amoxicillin 1 g PO TID** or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID [^112EaToB]; macrolides are an option only if local pneumococcal resistance is < 25% [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5]. For **outpatients with comorbidities**, use amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily) [^114NQhP1] [^111GDt9s] [^115usEk8]. For **pediatric patients**, amoxicillin is first-line; macrolides are reserved for suspected atypical pathogens [^114DFwpz] [^113mKYmj]. Treatment duration is typically 5–7 days, with shorter courses (minimum 3 days) if clinical stability is achieved.

## Recommended oral antibiotics for pneumonia

### Adults without comorbidities

- **Amoxicillin**: 1 g PO TID [^112EaToB] [^116EUyQ5].
- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg PO BID [^112EaToB] [^111GDt9s].
- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin or clarithromycin only if local pneumococcal resistance is < 25% [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].

---

### Adults with comorbidities

- **Amoxicillin/clavulanate**: Preferred beta-lactam [^114NQhP1] [^111GDt9s].
- **Third-generation cephalosporins**: Cefpodoxime or cefuroxime plus a macrolide or doxycycline.
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily [^114NQhP1] [^115usEk8].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **amoxicillin** is first-line therapy [^114DFwpz] [^113mKYmj], and **macrolides** are reserved for suspected atypical pathogens [^114DFwpz].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

Several factors influence **oral antibiotic selection** for pneumonia:

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Older adults and those with chronic conditions may require broader-spectrum antibiotics [^114NQhP1] [^117J4ouG].
- **Severity of illness**: Severe cases may necessitate combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy.
- **Local resistance patterns**: High resistance rates may limit the use of certain antibiotics, such as macrolides [^115Q2y7p] [^116EUyQ5].
- **Patient allergies and contraindications**: Allergies to beta-lactams or macrolides necessitate alternative regimens [^114NQhP1] [^1144qSuY] [^115ZzQTE].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting antibiotic efficacy

Clinical trials and guidelines **support the efficacy** of recommended oral antibiotics [^111o69Rj]. Amoxicillin is a first-line option for uncomplicated pneumonia [^112EaToB]; doxycycline is an alternative [^116EUyQ5]; macrolides are appropriate in areas with low resistance rates [^115Q2y7p]; and fluoroquinolones are suitable as monotherapy for patients with comorbidities or severe illness.

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic duration varies with clinical stability and severity. The **standard course** is 5–7 days for most patients [^114NQhP1] [^115BfusZ], and **shorter courses** have a minimum of 3 days for clinically stable patients [^113DyKsv].

---

## Potential side effects and contraindications

Each antibiotic class has specific side effects and contraindications [^1144qSuY] [^113xXLZv]:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Common side effects** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-lactams | - Allergic reactions <br/> - Gastrointestinal upset | - Allergy to beta-lactams |
| Macrolides | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - QT prolongation | - Allergy to macrolides <br/> - QT prolongation |
| Fluoroquinolones | - Tendon rupture <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - CNS effects | - Allergy to fluoroquinolones <br/> - QT prolongation <br/> - Tendon disorders |
| Tetracyclines | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Photosensitivity | - Pregnancy <br/> - Children under 8 years |

---

## Special considerations

Immunocompromised patients may need **broader-spectrum antibiotics** or combination therapy [^117F8r49]. Pregnant patients should avoid **tetracyclines** and **fluoroquinolones**; **beta-lactams** are preferred. Patients with chronic lung disease may require **broader-spectrum antibiotics** due to increased risk of **resistant pathogens** [^114NQhP1] [^117J4ouG].

---

The optimal oral antibiotic for pneumonia depends on **patient-specific factors**, **illness severity**, and **local resistance patterns** [^116EUyQ5]. Amoxicillin, doxycycline, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones are effective options, and treatment typically lasts 5–7 days.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114NQhP1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, particularly focusing on empiric antibiotic therapy in the outpatient setting for patients with comorbidities, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend the administration of a combination therapy consisting of a β-lactam (such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and a macrolide (including azithromycin 500 mg PO on the first day followed by 250 mg PO daily, clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg PO once daily). Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended, including levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg PO daily, for outpatients with CAP and comorbidities. These comorbidities may include chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, malignancy, or asplenia.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms on how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are aging and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcomes. These factors may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalization or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region, and their local susceptibility pattern.

One complicating fact is the lack of a definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients, making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcomes in CAP patients.

### Efficacy of exclusively oral antibiotic therapy in patients hospitalized with nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia: A retrospective study and meta-analysis [^111svHTd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of oral antibiotics in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia and to identify factors precluding oral therapy, a meta-analysis and a retrospective cohort study were conducted.

In the **meta-analysis**, inpatient oral and parenteral therapy in community-acquired pneumonia were compared. Studies were reviewed independently and rated by two reviewers, and results were summarized.

In the **retrospective cohort study**, outcomes in hospitalized patients treated with oral versus parenteral therapy were compared. The study included seven studies involving 1366 patients, excluding those with severe pneumonia or impaired oral absorption. There was no significant difference in the relative risk of mortality at the end of treatment or at follow-up. However, the mean length of hospital stay was shorter (6.1 days vs. 7.8 days) in patients taking oral antibiotics compared to those on parenteral therapy.

In the cohort, 18% (124/698) of patients received oral-only therapy; these patients were younger (median age, 75 vs. 78 years, P = 0.01) and had lower mean pneumonia severity index scores (101 vs. 119, P < 0.0001) than those receiving parenteral therapy. In multivariable models, oral-only patients had a median length of stay 1.3 days shorter (95% CI: 0.4 days to 2.2 days; P = 0.008) and a median antibiotic cost 56 dollars lower (95% CI: 53 dollars to 58 dollars; P < 0.0001) compared to the parenteral group, but mortality was similar.

Although prospective data are limited, oral antibiotics appear to be an effective alternative for certain patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Empiric antibiotic therapy for moderate-to-severe community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114MjWSZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). High credibility.

The optimal empiric antibiotic regimen for moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is uncertain.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of antibiotics for empiric therapy of moderate to severe CAP using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

- **Data sources**: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to July 03, 2024.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCT).

- **Participants**: Adults with moderate to severe CAP.

- **Interventions**: Any empiric antibiotic regimen versus another, placebo, or no treatment.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Paired reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials.

- **Methods of data synthesis**: We conducted frequentist random-effects NMAs addressing patient-important outcomes and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Results**: 143 RCTs involving 29,157 participants proved eligible. Effects are in comparison with respiratory fluoroquinolones alone. Penicillins alone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.67; RD 33 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 88 more), 2nd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.02; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 135 more), and 3rd generation cephalosporins alone (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77; RD 42 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 102 more) or combined with a macrolide (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.84; RD 45 more per 1000, 95% CI 3 fewer to 111 more) may be inferior in reducing treatment failure (all low certainty). The evidence among other antibiotic regimens remains uncertain.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous-to-oral lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: The phase III LEAP 1 trial [^111eWH23]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Monotherapy with lefamulin, a novel pleuromutilin antibiotic with intravenous and oral formulation options, was found to be noninferior to moxifloxacin in terms of efficacy. It was generally safe and well tolerated for treating community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Lefamulin's spectrum of activity effectively targets the bacteria that cause CABP.

### Exclusive oral antibiotic treatment for hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111EvFLC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of different methods of administration and types of beta-lactams for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This post-hoc analysis involved randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on patients hospitalized for CAP, specifically comparing 3-day versus 8-day durations of beta-lactam treatments. The trials concluded non-inferiority in shorter treatment durations. We included patients who received either amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) or third-generation cephalosporin (3GC) regimens, administered exclusively either intravenously or orally for the first three days, followed by either five days of oral placebo or AMC according to randomization. The decision regarding the route and molecule was left to the physician in charge.

The primary outcome evaluated was treatment failure at 15 days after the initial antibiotic intake. Failure was defined as a temperature > 37.9°C, lack of resolution or improvement in respiratory symptoms, or the need for additional antibiotic treatment for any reason. Logistic regression was used to assess the primary outcome according to the route of administration. Inverse probability treatment weighting with a propensity score model was applied to adjust for the non-random assignment of treatment routes and potential confounders. The difference in failure rates was also assessed across several subpopulations, including AMC versus 3GC treatments, intravenous versus oral AMC administration, patients with multi-lobar infections, patients aged ≥ 65 years, and patients with CURB65 scores of 3–4.

We included a total of 200 patients from the original trial, with 93 out of 200 (46.5%) patients treated exclusively with intravenous therapy.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: A critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States.

For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids.

Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoro.

### Identifying the best initial oral antibiotics for adults with community-acquired pneumonia: A network meta-analysis [^111o69Rj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare rates of clinical response and mortality for empiric oral antibiotic regimens in adults with mild-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and the reference lists of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. We included randomized trials of adults with radiologically confirmed mild to moderate CAP initially treated orally and reporting clinical cure or mortality. Abstracts and studies were reviewed in parallel for inclusion in the analysis and for data abstraction. We performed separate analyses by antibiotic medications and antibiotic classes and presented the results through network diagrams and forest plots sorted by p-scores. We assessed the quality of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias framework, as well as global and local inconsistency.

- **Results**: We identified 24 studies with 9361 patients: six at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk, and 12 at high risk. Nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were most likely to achieve clinical response (p-score 0.79, 0.71, and 0.69 respectively), while penicillin and amoxicillin were least likely to achieve clinical response. Levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (p-score 0.85, 0.75, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively). By antibiotic class, quinolones and macrolides were most effective for clinical response (0.71 and 0.70 respectively), with amoxicillin-clavulanate plus macrolides and beta-lactams being less effective.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: A systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Objective**: To assess the associations between three key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

- **Evidence review**: Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

- **Findings**: Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among eight observational studies identified, the four largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the four smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs. β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs. β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6%.

### Comparison of initial empirical antibiotic regimens in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^114pR1bB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine both direct and indirect evidence to compare initial antibiotic options for patients with SCAP. Our analysis provides important insights to guide clinical decision-making regarding antibiotic choice for these patients. From our analysis, we derived several key findings: β-lactam plus macrolide emerged as the best choice for patients with SCAP, in alignment with international guidelines. Fluoroquinolone monotherapy can be considered a reasonable alternative when β-lactam plus macrolide is not appropriate. However, β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone should be avoided.

Early antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SCAP. Although atypical microorganisms are responsible for 8–20% of SCAP cases, their role in the disease process is significant. Therefore, empiric antibiotic treatment targeting atypical pathogens is associated with a reduction in clinical failure rates among hospitalized adults with CAP. In addition to their antibacterial effects, macrolides possess broad anti-inflammatory properties. When combined with β-lactams, macrolides improve early clinical responses, reduce inflammation, enhance gas exchange, alleviate sepsis and organ failure, and lower mortality risk. Consistent with the result of a previous study, we recommend β-lactam plus macrolide as the preferred empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients with SCAP.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid diseases. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: A consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy, but society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

- **Research question**: There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

- **Study design and methods**: This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

- **Results**: The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: Rapid evidence review [^116EUyQ5]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically in terms of empiric antibiotic therapy in an outpatient setting for patients without comorbidities, the AAFP 2022 guidelines recommend administering high-dose amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide. However, the use of a macrolide should be considered only if local macrolide resistance rates for pneumococcus are below 25%. These recommendations apply to adult outpatients with CAP who do not have comorbid conditions.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: What's in a name [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

In the past, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered to have the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we explore the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia and assess whether these definitions reflect variations in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment.

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality. Patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host factors, such as genetic predispositions and underlying diseases, can influence the severity of community-acquired pneumonia presentation. The distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe forms is comparable.

Initial antibiotic therapy for patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delays in treatment are associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies suggest additional benefits of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. Consequently, the initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci in preventing episodes of severe disease is still unknown.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable.

### Omadacycline for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia [^113HB9Rg]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Omadacycline, a new once-daily aminomethylcycline antibiotic agent, can be administered intravenously or orally, and reaches high concentrations in pulmonary tissues. It is active against common pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (Pneumonia Severity Index risk class II, III, or IV) to receive omadacycline (100 mg intravenously every 12 hours for two doses, then 100 mg intravenously every 24 hours) or moxifloxacin (400 mg intravenously every 24 hours). A transition to oral omadacycline (300 mg every 24 hours) or moxifloxacin (400 mg every 24 hours), respectively, was allowed after 3 days; the total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. The primary endpoint was early clinical response, defined as survival with improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea) and no worsening of symptoms at 72 to 120 hours without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. A secondary endpoint was investigator-assessed clinical response at a post-treatment evaluation 5 to 10 days after the last dose, with clinical response defined as resolution or improvement in signs or symptoms to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was unnecessary. A noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points was used.

- **Results**: The intention-to-treat population included 386 patients in the omadacycline group and 388 patients in the moxifloxacin group. Omadacycline was noninferior to moxifloxacin.

- **Results**: This study enrolled 551 patients at 66 centers across 18 countries between February 2016 and May 2017. Approximately 25% of patients were enrolled before the protocol amendment noted above. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between treatment groups, with the noted exception that 47.8% and 39.3% of patients were aged ≥ 65 years in the lefamulin and moxifloxacin groups, respectively.

- **Baseline characteristics (intent-to-treat population)**: Table 2 presents baseline characteristics. Patient disposition is illustrated in Figure 1. See Table 1 for definitions of the patient populations. Abbreviations used include CABP (community-acquired bacterial pneumonia), CE (clinically evaluable), IACR (investigator assessment of clinical response), ITT (intent-to-treat), microITT (microbiological ITT), microITT-2 (microbiological ITT-2), mITT (modified ITT), MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and TOC (test of cure).

- a Met criteria for CABP: received at least the prespecified minimal amount of the intended dose of the study drug and minimum duration of treatment, IACR not indeterminate, did not receive a concomitant antibacterial therapy (other than adjunctive linezolid) that is potentially effective against CABP pathogens (except in the case of clinical failure), and had no other confounding factors that interfered with the outcome assessment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116LD2BE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for non-severe CAP, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend the following:

- **Combination therapy**: Administer a β-lactam (options include ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) combined with a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID).

- **Monotherapy**: Alternatively, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, is appropriate.

These recommendations apply to adult inpatients with non-severe CAP who present no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity, we found no evidence of, or even trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups.

Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S. pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults.

Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would enhance treatment strategies.

### Reply to Huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines, to which we strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented, the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP.

We recommended amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for the treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent, if not superior, to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing.

### Efficacy and safety of oral and early-switch therapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized controlled trial [^112WGZRC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the safety, efficacy, and cost of oral therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In patients with nonsevere pneumonia, conventional (parenteral) treatment was compared with the oral route; in patients with severe pneumonia, conventional treatment was compared with early switch from parenteral to oral therapy.

- **Subjects and methods**: We randomly assigned 85 hospitalized patients with nonsevere pneumonia to one of two groups. Forty-one patients received oral antimicrobials from admission, and 44 received parenteral antimicrobials until they had been afebrile for 72 hours before switching to oral treatment. We also randomly assigned 103 patients with severe pneumonia, who had initially been treated with parenteral antimicrobials, to one of two groups. Forty-eight patients were switched to oral therapy after 48 hours of treatment (early switch), and 55 received a full 10-day course of parenteral antibiotics.

- **Results**: Among patients with nonsevere pneumonia, there were no deaths in the oral treatment group and one death (2%) in the parenteral treatment group (95% confidence interval [CI] for between-group [oral minus parenteral] difference: -7% to 2%, P = 0.3). The time to resolution of morbidity was ≤ 5 days in 34 (83%) patients in the oral treatment group and 39 (88%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.5). There were treatment failures in 4 (10%) patients in the oral treatment group and 14 (32%) patients in the parenteral treatment group (P = 0.02). Among patients with severe pneumonia, there was one (2%) death in the early-switch group and no deaths in the other group.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mKYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP); however, rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose, and duration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

- **Results**: A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%). Macrolides accounted for the majority of non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing.

### High-dose, short-course levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia: a new treatment paradigm [^115usEk8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin demonstrates concentration-dependent bactericidal activity most closely related to the pharmacodynamic parameters of the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the ratio of peak plasma concentration (C(max)) to MIC. Increasing the dose of levofloxacin to 750 mg exploits these parameters by increasing peak drug concentrations, allowing for a shorter course of treatment without diminishing therapeutic benefit. This was demonstrated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind investigation that compared levofloxacin dosages of 750 mg per day for 5 days with 500 mg per day for 10 days for the treatment of mild to severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the clinically evaluable population, the clinical success rates were 92.4% (183 of 198 persons) for the 750-mg group and 91.1% (175 of 192 persons) for the 500-mg group (95% confidence interval, -7.0 to 4.4). Microbiologic eradication rates were 93.2% and 92.4% in the 750-mg and 500-mg groups, respectively. These data demonstrate that 750 mg of levofloxacin per day for 5 days is at least as effective as 500 mg per day for 10 days for the treatment of mild-to-severe CAP.

### Overview of recent studies of community-acquired pneumonia [^115nsRFh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

All recent studies of antibacterial drugs for the indication of community-acquired pneumonia submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration have been designed as noninferiority studies. We provide a summary of results of seven recent clinical studies of oral antibacterial drugs for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. In these seven studies, the majority of patients enrolled had Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team scores of I or II. The percentage of randomized subjects with pathogens identified at baseline ranged from 47% to 76%, and the percentage of subjects with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated at baseline ranged from approximately 6% to 20%. The primary endpoint in these studies was clinical cure, assessed 7–21 days after completion of therapy. Clinical cure rates were over 80% in the intent-to-treat populations and over 90% in the per-protocol populations. We also briefly summarize the results from several recently submitted clinical studies of intravenously administered antibacterial drugs for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, in which we found similar results.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia in general medical wards: Outcomes and impact of initial antibiotic selection [^114t41w2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Most international guidelines recommend empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) to be based on the site of care. Some patients with severe CAP are managed in general wards because of limited intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability or due to the unrecognition of pneumonia severity. Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment for severe CAP outside the ICU has not yet been established. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the impact of initial antibiotic selection on the outcomes of patients with severe CAP who were admitted and managed in general wards.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included consecutive patients hospitalized for presumed CAP in general wards over a 1-year period. Severe CAP was identified using the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. Initial antibiotic treatment in the first 24 hours was collected. The primary outcome was the rate of unfavorable outcomes (a composite outcome of treatment failure and in-hospital death). The secondary outcome was the number of hospital-free days assessed 30 days after enrollment into the study.

- **Results**: There were 94 patients hospitalized with CAP, of which 50 (53.2%) patients were compatible with severe CAP. An etiologic diagnosis was found in 43 (45.8%) patients. The most common pathogens identified in patients with severe CAP were Staphylococcus aureus (28.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.9%). Patients with severe CAP had significantly more positive blood cultures than patients with non-severe CAP.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115iwg2w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria, reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent practice guidelines have been published addressing the treatment of CAP. These guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern. Appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

The cost, morbidity, and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These patients represent heterogeneous groups, so it is important to use risk stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is a critical component in the management of these patients. It is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy to minimize treatment failure risks and reduce the morbidity of CAP.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning empiric antibiotic therapy in the inpatient setting for nonsevere CAP, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend considering combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftaroline, or ceftriaxone) and doxycycline 100 mg BID. This is suggested as an alternative option for adult patients with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has led to various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen is often unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved due to changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens.

- **Treatment guidelines**: Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. Additionally, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, specifically concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy, the ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend deciding on the duration based on validated measures of clinical stability. These measures include the resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and the ability to tolerate oral intake. Antibiotics should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for at least 5 days in patients with CAP.

### Telithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a pooled analysis [^1152kMva]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The efficacy of telithromycin has been assessed in six Phase III studies involving adults with mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a degree of severity compatible with oral therapy. Patients received telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days in three open-label studies (n = 870) and three randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled studies (n = 503). Comparator antibacterials were amoxicillin 1000 mg three times daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, and trovafloxacin 200 mg once daily. Clinical and bacteriological outcomes were assessed 7–14 days post-therapy. Among telithromycin-treated patients, per-protocol clinical cure rates were 93.1% and 91.0% for the open-label and comparative studies, respectively.

Telithromycin treatment was as effective as the comparator agents. High eradication and clinical cure rates were observed for infections caused by key pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, including isolates resistant to penicillin G and/or erythromycin A (95.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (89.5%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (90%). Telithromycin was also highly effective in patients with infections caused by atypical and/or intracellular pathogens and those at increased risk of morbidity. Telithromycin was generally well tolerated.

Telithromycin 800 mg once daily for 7–10 days offers a convenient and well-tolerated first-line oral therapy for the empirical treatment of mild to moderate CAP.

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: Do we know when, what and for how long to treat [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries, accounting for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social, and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to critically consider the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to determine when, how, and for how long it should be treated.

This review has identified various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents, and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens.

More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment, and how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens.

### Comparative safety of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of outpatient community-acquired pneumonia among otherwise healthy adults [^1144qSuY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Evidence is limited regarding the comparative safety of antibiotic regimens for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We compared the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) associated with antibiotic regimens for CAP treatment among otherwise healthy, non-elderly adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted an active comparator new-user cohort study (2007–2019) of commercially-insured adults aged 18–64 years diagnosed with outpatient CAP, evaluated via chest x-ray, and dispensed a same-day CAP-related oral antibiotic regimen. ADE follow-up duration ranged from 2–90 days (e.g. renal failure [14 days]). We estimated risk differences [RD] per 1000 treatment episodes and risk ratios using propensity score weighted Kaplan-Meier functions. Ankle/knee sprain and influenza vaccination were considered as negative control outcomes.

- **Results**: Of 145,137 otherwise healthy CAP patients without comorbidities, 52% received narrow-spectrum regimens (44% macrolide, 8% doxycycline) and 48% received broad-spectrum regimens (39% fluoroquinolone, 7% β-lactam, 3% β-lactam + macrolide). Compared with macrolide monotherapy, each broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen was associated with increased risk of several ADEs (e.g. β-lactam: nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain [RD per 1000, 3.20; 95% CI, 0.99–5.73]; non–Clostridioides difficile diarrhea [RD per 1000, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.47–6.82]; vulvovaginal candidiasis/vaginitis [RD per 1000, 3.57; 95% CI, 0.87, 6.88]). Narrow-spectrum antibiotic regimens largely conferred similar risk of ADEs. We generally observed similar risks of each negative control outcome.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: A review [^117J4ouG]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740,000 hospitalizations, and 41,000 deaths in the US annually.

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with two or more signs (e.g. temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count 10,000/μL) or symptoms (e.g. new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (e.g. air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at the highest risk for CAP and its complications, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified; of those, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia.

All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (e.g. antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when these pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider the disease severity and patient risk factors.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. Key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach involves initial antimicrobial therapy, providing coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens, while the European approach focuses on pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on atypical pathogens. In North America, ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy. In contrast, these patients in Europe would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Fundamental issues contributing to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous-to-oral lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic, for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: the phase III LEAP 1 trial [^116bo2sQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) results in significant morbidity and mortality. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for approximately 5% to 15% of all community-acquired pneumonias in the United States, with higher rates in Europe. Other causative bacterial pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and atypical pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. The emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of new therapies. Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae to β-lactams, clindamycin, tetracyclines, and macrolides has been observed, with rates reaching up to 40%. Furthermore, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has been reported. The need for novel therapies is also driven by antimicrobial stewardship and safety concerns associated with current antibiotics. For instance, fluoroquinolones carry a black box warning for tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and hypoglycemia.

The novel pleuromutilin antibiotic lefamulin inhibits the 50S ribosomal subunit at the peptidyl transferase center. Lefamulin demonstrates in vitro activity against the aforementioned CABP pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); notably, its efficacy is unaffected by resistance mechanisms to β-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, and glycopeptides. Lefamulin has a favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, with intravenous (IV) and oral dosing regimens in clinical trials achieving comparable drug exposures.

### Clinical experience in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: lessons from the use of fluoroquinolones [^1171TV3A]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The treatment of CAP has been complicated by several factors, including the expanding spectrum of causative organisms and the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance among respiratory pathogens. Initial antimicrobial treatment for patients with CAP is usually selected empirically and should provide appropriate coverage against the most common causative organisms, including resistant strains. Respiratory fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, are the only antimicrobials that are highly active against the pathogens most frequently implicated in CAP, including macrolide-resistant and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., and atypical agents. This paper reviews recent studies involving adult patients with CAP that suggest that levofloxacin, as compared with other conventional antibiotic treatments, may be associated with better clinical outcomes.

### How long should we treat community-acquired pneumonia [^116L3Dg2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The studies reviewed in this article suggest that a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy is comparable to standard therapy for treating community-acquired pneumonia. This approach promotes a reduction in adverse events, microbial resistance, cost, and improves patient compliance.

Community-acquired pneumonia has traditionally been treated with a 7–14-day course of antimicrobial therapy. However, there have been few well-controlled trials regarding the optimal duration of therapy, resulting in no consensus on the length of therapy among different organizational guidelines. Several recent studies have demonstrated that shorter course antibiotic regimens are effective in treating community-acquired pneumonia.

Short-course antibiotic therapy is equivalent to the standard length of therapy for clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Minimization of drug exposure reduces selection pressure for resistant strains, strengthens patient compliance, and potentially reduces adverse events, such as Clostridium difficile infections.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Low credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardized tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for the appropriate assessment of the severity of illness and for the establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically.

Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include the spectrum of activity, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include the administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for the management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are re

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes significant mortality, morbidity, and high costs worldwide. The empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of managing patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side effects, an empirical, effective, and individualized antibiotic treatment is necessary. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for clinical stability criteria.

New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies focusing on the long-term management of pneumonia are needed.

### Empiric antibiotic coverage of atypical pathogens for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adults [^114dGdnT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by various pathogens, traditionally divided into 'typical' and 'atypical' categories. Initial antibiotic treatment of CAP is usually empirical, customarily covering both typical and atypical pathogens. At the time of writing, no sufficient evidence exists to support this broad coverage, while limiting coverage is bound to reduce toxicity, resistance, and expense.

- **Objectives**: The main objective was to estimate the mortality rate and the proportion of treatment failure using regimens containing atypical antibiotic coverage compared to those that had typical coverage only. Secondary objectives included the assessment of adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 3, 2012, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infection Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients hospitalized due to CAP were included, comparing antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage (quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptogramins, or ketolides) to a regimen without atypical antibiotic coverage.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included trials. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity using a Chi(2) test.

- **Main results**: We included 28 trials, encompassing 5939 randomized patients. The atypical antibiotic was administered as monotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of oral solithromycin versus oral moxifloxacin for treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: A global, double-blind, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial (SOLITAIRE-ORAL) [^111WiW3F]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and treatment recommendations, each with specific limitations, vary globally. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of solithromycin, a novel macrolide, with moxifloxacin for treatment of CABP.

- **Methods**: We conducted this global, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority trial at 114 centers in North America, Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with clinically and radiographically confirmed pneumonia of Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class II, III, or IV were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based central block randomization procedure (block size of four), to receive either oral solithromycin (800 mg on day 1, 400 mg on days 2–5, placebo on days 6–7) or oral moxifloxacin (400 mg on days 1–7). Randomization was stratified by geographical region, PORT risk class (II vs III or IV), and medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study sponsor, investigators, staff, and patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was early clinical response, defined as an improvement in at least two of four symptoms (cough, chest pain, sputum production, dyspnea) with no worsening in any symptom at 72 hours after the first dose of the study drug, with a 10% non-inferiority margin. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT-01756339.

### Effectiveness of early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in severe community acquired pneumonia: Multicentre randomised trial [^114VYMRp]. BMJ (2006). High credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of an early switch to oral antibiotics with the standard 7-day course of intravenous antibiotics in severe community-acquired pneumonia, a multicentre randomised controlled trial was conducted. The setting included five teaching hospitals and two university medical centres in the Netherlands.

The trial involved 302 patients in non-intensive care wards with severe community-acquired pneumonia; 265 patients fulfilled the study requirements. The intervention consisted of three days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, followed, when clinically stable, by oral antibiotics or by seven days of intravenous antibiotics. The main outcome measures were clinical cure and the length of hospital stay.

Results indicated that 302 patients were randomised (mean age 69.5 years, standard deviation 14.0; mean pneumonia severity score 112.7, standard deviation 26.0). Thirty-seven patients were excluded from the analysis due to early dropout before day 3, leaving 265 patients for intention-to-treat analysis. Mortality at day 28 was 4% in the intervention group and 6% in the control group (mean difference 2%, 95% confidence interval -3% to 8%). Clinical cure was achieved in 83% of the intervention group and 85% of the control group (2%, -7% to 10%). The duration of intravenous treatment and length of hospital stay were reduced in the intervention group, with mean differences of 3.4 days (3.6 [1.5] versus 7.0 [2.0] days; confidence interval 2.8 to 3.9) and 1.9 days (9.6 [5.0] versus 11.5 [4.9] days; confidence interval 0.6 to 3.2), respectively.

In conclusion, an early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia is safe and decreases the length of hospital stay by approximately two days.

### Azithromycin [^113xXLZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia conducted in the US, azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose via the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day orally to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses intravenously for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses orally to complete 7 to 10 days of therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcomes — namely cure, improved, and success (defined as cure plus improved) — among the 277 patients seen 10 to 14 days post-therapy were evaluated.

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial conducted in the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin following the same regimen were evaluated for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates, specifically cure, improved, and success (cure plus improved), among the 84 patients observed 10 to 14 days post-therapy were assessed.

Microbiological determinations in both trials were conducted at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, reassessed at subsequent visits. Serological testing was performed on specimens from both baseline and final visits. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates obtained from the evaluable groups are as follows:

- **Combined bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin**: The presumed bacteriological outcomes 10 to 14 days post-therapy for patients treated with azithromycin were recorded. The details of these outcomes are essential for understanding the efficacy of azithromycin in treating community-acquired pneumonia.

### Ketek [^1152BHHK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: KETEK was studied in four randomized, double-blind, controlled studies and four open-label studies for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Patients with mild to moderate CAP, who were considered appropriate for oral outpatient treatment, were enrolled in these trials. Patients with severe pneumonia were excluded based on any one of the following criteria: ICU admission, need for parenteral antibiotics, respiratory rate greater than 30/minute, hypotension, altered mental status, oxygen saturation less than 90% by pulse oximetry, or white blood cell count less than 4000/mm³. The total number of clinically evaluable patients in the telithromycin group included 2016 patients.

- **Clinical cure rates**: Clinical cure rates by pathogen from the four CAP controlled clinical trials in microbiologically evaluable patients given KETEK for 7–10 days or a comparator are displayed in Table 7. Cure rates for patients with CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae were determined from patients in controlled and uncontrolled trials. Of 333 evaluable patients with CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, 312 (93.7%) achieved clinical success. Only patients considered appropriate for oral outpatient therapy were included in these trials. More severely ill patients were not enrolled. Blood cultures were obtained in all patients participating in the clinical trials of mild to moderate community-acquired pneumonia. In a limited number of outpatients with incidental pneumococcal bacteremia treated with KETEK, a clinical cure rate of 88% (67/76) has been observed.

KETEK is not indicated for the treatment of severe pneumonia.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: There is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggest that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone regarding its effectiveness.

### What factors influence physicians' decisions to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia [^116Yi6GD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

One of the major factors influencing the length of stay for patients with community-acquired pneumonia is the timing of conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotics. We measured physician attitudes and beliefs about the antibiotic switch decision and assessed physician characteristics associated with practice beliefs.

- **Design**: Written survey assessing attitudes about the antibiotic conversion decision.

- **Setting**: Seven teaching and non-teaching hospitals in Pittsburgh, Pa.

- **Participants**: Three hundred forty-five generalist and specialist attending physicians who manage pneumonia in seven hospitals.

- **Measurements and results**: Factors rated as "very important" to the antibiotic conversion decision were: absence of suppurative infection (93%), ability to maintain oral intake (79%), respiratory rate at baseline (64%), no positive blood cultures (63%), normal temperature (62%), oxygenation at baseline (55%), and mental status at baseline (50%).

	- The median thresholds at which physicians believed a typical patient could be converted to oral therapy were: temperature ≤ 100 mm Hg, and room air oxygen saturation ≥ 90%. Fifty-eight percent of physicians felt that "patients should be afebrile for 24 hours before conversion to oral antibiotics", and 19% said, "patients should receive a standard duration of intravenous antibiotics". In univariate analyses, pulmonary and infectious diseases physicians were the most predisposed towards early conversion.

### Comparison of ceftriaxone plus macrolide and ampicillin/sulbactam plus macrolide in treatment for patients with community-acquired pneumonia without risk factors for aspiration: An open-label, quasi-randomized, controlled trial [^113zaTNU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pneumonia is caused by a wide variety of pathogens and is one of the most common infections worldwide. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is caused by bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Moraxella catarrhalis*, or viruses such as the influenza virus. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen. For example, the susceptibilities of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors were reported as 99.5%, 59.3–78.0%, and 7.7–20.2%, and the susceptibilities of these species to third-generation cephalosporins were reported as 96.8%, 100%, and 1.0%. Antibiotics were therefore selected based on presumptive bacteria in consideration of the patient's age, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory findings, severity, and so on.

Ceftriaxone (CTRX) and ampicillin/sulbactam (ABPC/SBT) are recommended by various guidelines for pneumonia in a number of countries as the first-line antibiotics for CAP. Both of these antibiotics are active against a similar range of microorganisms, except for anaerobic bacteria, which are the predominant pathogens in aspiration pneumonia. Because the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to CTRX is relatively low, some guidelines recommend ABPC/SBT for the treatment of aspiration pneumonia. In previous reports that did not consider aspiration risks, no significant differences were found between CTRX and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ABPC/SBT for the treatment of pneumonia. Only one paper has addressed these specifics.
