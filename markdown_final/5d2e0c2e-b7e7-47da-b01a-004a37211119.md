## Question

How does the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies affect the development of pulmonary hypertension in SLE?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how antiphospholipid antibodies affect the development of pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus, including the mechanisms involved, supporting clinical evidence, and relevant guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define the relevant entities and the scope of pulmonary hypertension phenotypes in SLE. Then, I should quantify the epidemiologic association between aPL and PH/PAH. Next, I will examine pathophysiological mechanisms, distinguishing thrombotic from non-thrombotic pathways. After that, I need to appraise the quality and heterogeneity of evidence, including cohort, case-control, and guideline statements. Finally, I should translate this into clinical implications for screening, classification, and management, making sure to verify any guideline recommendations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and scope so I don't conflate terms. Pulmonary hypertension in SLE spans WHO Groups 1 (PAH), 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease/hypoxia), 4 (chronic thromboembolic PH), and 5 (multifactorial), and the aPL-related concerns primarily intersect Groups 1 and 4, with a smaller contribution to Group 5 via complex immune–thrombotic interplay, so I need to keep both PAH and CTEPH in view when discussing risk and mechanisms [^115ATW1d] [^112KgRhE] [^113zZnjs].

> Next, I should review the strength of association from pooled and cohort data. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis across 31 studies and 4,480 SLE patients found that aPL positivity roughly doubled the odds of PH overall and was also associated with APAH, with lupus anticoagulant and IgG anticardiolipin showing the strongest signals; pooled ORs were around 2.3 for PH and 2.6 for APAH, suggesting clinically meaningful risk enrichment in aPL-positive SLE cohorts [^1169qmVh]. Wait, let me verify consistency in smaller cohorts; in a UK SLE clinic, lupus anticoagulant was the only significant predictor of echocardiographically defined PAH, and several contemporary SLE-PAH series have reiterated associations with LA and, variably, anti-RNP and anti-cardiolipin, reinforcing a reproducible but modest effect size across settings [^114xuTbb] [^11799p29] [^116u975F].

> I will now examine the thrombotic mechanism because it is the most straightforward causal pathway. aPL drive a prothrombotic milieu via endothelial activation, impaired fibrinolysis, platelet activation, and inhibition of natural anticoagulant pathways; in the pulmonary circulation, this translates into venous thromboembolism and in situ thrombosis, which can evolve into chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension with fibrotic arterial remodeling and fixed vascular obstruction, particularly when recurrent or nonresolving [^116Kpb85] [^117MTPUp]. Hold on, I should verify the prevalence of CTEPH in APS; observational APS cohorts suggest CTEPH in roughly 3–4% of APS patients, with risk factors including prior PE, recurrent VTE, thrombocytopenia, and triple aPL positivity, aligning with guideline emphasis on screening APS in CTEPH workups [^116uNckK] [^114CQsX8] [^113zZnjs].

> But wait, what if the pulmonary hypertension is "primary" PAH rather than thromboembolic disease. Let me consider non-thrombotic, immune-mediated mechanisms. Immune complex deposition, complement activation, and inflammatory infiltrates in pulmonary arterioles have been described in SLE-PAH, and B-cell and T-cell–mediated injury can promote endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and remodeling, providing a plausible pathway for PAH in aPL-positive SLE even without overt thrombosis; clustering analyses also identify an aPL-predominant phenotype among SLE patients with PH, supporting a direct immune–vascular mechanism alongside thrombosis [^112KgRhE] [^114pno8Y] [^111oCT51]. Hold on, I should verify whether thrombosis was excluded in these mechanistic descriptions; yes, some series explicitly describe PAH in SLE-PAH patients with aPL and no imaging evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, arguing for non-thrombotic contributions in a subset [^11799p29].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are framed correctly for both CTEPH and PAH phenotypes. For CTEPH, current ESC/ERS guidelines recommend lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation for all patients and specifically advise vitamin K antagonists when APS is present, given recurrent thrombosis concerns and observational signals with direct oral anticoagulants; they also recommend that all CTEPH patients be evaluated by a CTEPH team for surgery, balloon angioplasty, or medical therapy, with PEA as treatment of choice for accessible central disease and BPA or riociguat for inoperable or residual cases [^114CQsX8] [^111QN6En] [^115zktWd]. For SLE-PAH, immunosuppression may confer benefit in select patients, particularly early disease with inflammatory features, whereas anticoagulation decisions must balance bleeding risk and thrombotic phenotype; guidelines also advise that PAH-CTD therapy follow the IPAH algorithm, with disease-specific consideration of immunosuppression in SLE or MCTD-associated PAH [^112k1gU8] [^11799p29].

> Next, I should review screening and risk stratification so I don't overgeneralize. EULAR recommends screening all SLE patients for APS at diagnosis, which operationalizes aPL testing in routine care. In parallel, emerging SLE-specific PAH risk models incorporate clinical variables and autoantibodies such as anti-RNP and anti-Ro/La, and some cohorts identify Raynaud phenomenon and capillaroscopic scleroderma-pattern as risk markers, suggesting that a composite risk approach could guide echocardiographic surveillance and referral for right heart catheterization when indicated [^1137LFLK] [^113RiW9X] [^113wpQWD]. Hold on, I should verify whether guidelines endorse universal PH screening in SLE; unlike SSc, there is no mandated annual screening algorithm in SLE, but expert reviews emphasize vigilance for symptoms, biomarkers, and echocardiographic red flags given delayed diagnoses and worse outcomes [^115ATW1d] [^114NS64e].

> Let me synthesize and double-check that I'm not overstating causality. The weight of evidence supports that aPL confer a roughly twofold increased risk of PH in SLE, with the signal strongest for LA and IgG anticardiolipin, and manifests through two principal, not mutually exclusive pathways: thromboembolic disease culminating in CTEPH and immune-mediated vascular injury driving PAH. Guidelines operationalize this by recommending APS testing in CTEPH and VKA-based anticoagulation in CTEPH with APS, while SLE-PAH management integrates immunosuppression and standard PAH therapies tailored to hemodynamics and comorbidity profile [^1169qmVh] [^114CQsX8] [^112k1gU8]. I should confirm that this conclusion aligns with contemporary cohorts and reviews; yes, multiple SLE-PAH series and pathophysiology summaries converge on a dual-mechanism model with clinically actionable distinctions for CTEPH versus PAH phenotypes in aPL-positive patients [^11799p29] [^112KgRhE] [^116uNckK].

---

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) increase the risk of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in SLE through **thrombotic and inflammatory pathways** [^113UxPsY]. The main mechanisms are **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** from recurrent pulmonary emboli [^117MTPUp] and **pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)** from endothelial injury, vasoconstriction, and vascular remodeling [^112KgRhE]. aPL-positive SLE patients have a 2–3-fold higher PH risk [^1169qmVh], especially with lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin positivity [^1169qmVh]. Management includes anticoagulation for CTEPH [^111QN6En], immunosuppression for PAH [^112k1gU8], and targeted PH therapies; early detection and tailored therapy improve outcomes [^116u975F].

---

## Epidemiological association between aPL and PH in SLE

- **Prevalence**: PH prevalence in SLE is ~2–14% [^117A1vML]; aPL-positive patients have higher risk [^1169qmVh].
- **Risk increase**: Meta-analysis shows aPL-positive SLE has a 2.28-fold higher PH risk (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.65–3.15) [^1169qmVh].
- **Specific antibodies**: Lupus anticoagulant (LA) and IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) are particularly linked to PH [^1169qmVh] [^114xuTbb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking aPL to PH in SLE

aPL promote PH in SLE via **thrombotic and non-thrombotic mechanisms**:

---

### Thrombotic mechanisms

- **Pulmonary embolism**: aPL increase venous/arterial thrombosis, causing recurrent PE and CTEPH [^112jFbYy] [^116uNckK].
- **In situ thrombosis**: aPL drive microthrombi in pulmonary arterioles, raising vascular resistance [^116tsSJH] [^114sS821].
- **Non-resolution of thrombi**: Impaired fibrinolysis and persistent thrombi contribute to CTEPH [^114idrPU] [^117MTPUp].

---

### Non-thrombotic mechanisms

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: aPL activate endothelium, increasing permeability, vasoconstriction, and remodeling [^115jnntp] [^112KgRhE].
- **Inflammation**: Cytokines and immune complexes promote vascular remodeling and PAH [^112KgRhE] [^111oCT51].
- **Autoantibody deposition**: aPL/immune complexes in pulmonary vessels cause injury and remodeling [^112KgRhE] [^111oCT51].

---

## Clinical manifestations and diagnostic challenges

PH in aPL-positive SLE presents with **non-specific symptoms** (dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, syncope) and is often diagnosed late [^115ATW1d]. Diagnosis requires **echocardiography** for screening, **right heart catheterization** for confirmation, and **CTEPH workup** with V/Q scan/CTPA and aPL testing when CTEPH is suspected [^114CQsX8] [^113zZnjs].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on **PH type and severity**:

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticoagulation (VKA) | CTEPH with APS | Prevent thrombosis; VKA preferred in APS [^111QN6En] [^112UNEBa] |
| Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) | Operable CTEPH | Remove chronic thrombi; improves survival [^114CQsX8] [^115zktWd] |
| Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) | Inoperable/distal CTEPH | Dilate obstructed vessels; reduces PH [^114CQsX8] [^115zktWd] |
| Immunosuppression (e.g. cyclophosphamide) | PAH with active SLE | Reduce inflammation; improve hemodynamics [^112k1gU8] [^11799p29] |
| Targeted PAH therapies (ERA, PDE-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin) | PAH | Vasodilation; reduce remodeling [^112k1gU8] |

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

PH in aPL-positive SLE carries **worse prognosis** than in aPL-negative patients, with higher mortality and morbidity [^notfound]. Early detection and tailored therapy (anticoagulation, immunosuppression, targeted PAH treatments) improve outcomes [^116u975F].

---

Antiphospholipid antibodies increase PH risk in SLE through thrombotic and inflammatory mechanisms; **management should be individualized** based on PH phenotype, with anticoagulation for CTEPH and immunosuppression plus targeted therapies for PAH.

### Pulmonary thromboembolism as the initial manifestation in a child with antiphospholipid syndrome in the emergency department [^116DPQgZ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis at any level of the vascular tree and the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. The syndrome may be idiopathic or secondary to an underlying autoimmune disorder. The disease is uncommon in children, and manifestations are diverse and underreported. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy who presented with features of pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency department. Subsequently, he proved to have systemic lupus erythematosus with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. He had no signs of systemic lupus erythematosus at presentation. In conclusion, antiphospholipid syndrome should also be kept as a possibility in children presenting for the first time with pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency department.

### Subclinical pulmonary hypertension in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus associated with minor disease manifestations [^114Dm53F]. Pediatric Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate pulmonary hypertension (PH) in 852 childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) patients. This was a large multicenter study conducted in 10 Pediatric Rheumatology Services of São Paulo state, Brazil. PH was defined as systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 35 mmHg and/or measurement of the mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure > 15 mmHg by transthoracic echocardiogram. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, disease activity score (SLEDAI-2K), disease damage score (SLICC/ACR-DI) and treatments were also evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Bonferroni correction (p < 0.002). PH was observed in 17/852 (2%) cSLE patients. Effort dyspnea occurred in 3/17, chest pain in 1/17 and right ventricle dysfunction in 3/17 cSLE patients. None had pulmonary thromboembolism or antiphospholipid syndrome. Further comparison between 17 cSLE with PH and 85 cSLE control patients without PH with similar disease duration [15 (0–151) vs. 15 (0–153) months, p = 0.448], evaluated at the last visit, revealed higher frequencies of fever (47 vs. 9%, p < 0.001), reticuloendothelial manifestations (41 vs. 7%, p < 0.001) and serositis (35 vs. 5%, p = 0.001) in the former group. Frequencies of renal and neuropsychiatric involvements and antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as the median of SLEDAI-2K and SLICC/ACR-DI scores, were comparable in both groups (p > 0.002). Normal transthoracic echocardiography was evidenced in 9/17 (53%), with median cSLE duration of 17.5 months (1–40) after PH standard treatment. PH was a rare manifestation of cSLE occurring in the first two years of disease. The majority of patients were asymptomatic with mild lupus manifestations. The underlying mechanism seemed not to be related to pulmonary thromboembolism and/or antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome [^116kUyKo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The major purpose of the 1999 international consensus criteria for definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is to facilitate the selection of uniform groups of patients for clinical and experimental studies. An early evaluation suggests that the criteria fulfill this purpose when tested in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus-like diseases. The criteria will likely need modification as investigators appraise and reach consensus about new information on APS. The international APS symposium has had an important role in this process and provides a mechanism for facilitating future advances in this subject.

### Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137GXEL]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis investigating the association between miscarriage and future CVD in women. We found that women with a history of miscarriage or recurrent miscarriage are at a higher risk of CHD than women who have not experienced miscarriage(s). On average, women with a history of miscarriage are at a 45% higher risk of CHD, and recurrent miscarriage was associated with a twofold risk of CHD. No association was found between a history of miscarriage and future cerebrovascular events, but due to the small number of studies, it was not possible to analyse the association between recurrent miscarriage and cerebrovascular events.

Several aetiological arguments have been proposed to support a common mechanistic pathway for CVD and miscarriage. Recent evidence suggests that the determinants of the association may aggregate in families, as women with a history of recurrent miscarriage were more likely to have parents who experience CHD. This would be supportive of a genetic or epigenetic cause, although behavioural and environmental risk factors will also aggregate in families.

Immune disorders

The association between miscarriage and antiphospholipid syndrome is well established. Antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipids found in cell membranes, which results in the formation of blood clots. Consequently, women with antiphospholipid syndrome have a greater risk of CHD, intracardiac thrombi, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy, most likely resulting from injury to the cell membranes of endothelial cells. Women with antiphospholipid syndrome also have a greater risk of miscarriages, recurrent miscarriage being an indication for testing for antiphospholipids in some cases. The greater occurrence of miscarriages may be the result of activation of complement by antiphospholipid antibodies that bind to placental trophoblast cells. Other immune disorders including Lupus, which often co-occurs with antiphospholipid syndrome, have also been implicated in both CVDand miscarriage risk.

### Classification of primary antiphospholipid syndrome as systemic lupus erythematosus: analysis of a cohort of 214 patients [^1141Bz7A]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the limitations of the SLICC (Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics) classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS).

Methods

Retrospective study of a cohort of APS patients (Sydney criteria). We successively excluded patients with (1) at least one "SLE-specific" manifestation (biopsy-proven SLE nephropathy, arthritis, cutaneous, or neurologic SLE manifestations, pericarditis, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, oral and nasal ulcers, non-scarring alopecia, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Sm antibodies), (2) any other autoimmune connective tissue disease, and/or (3) antinuclear antibodies > 1/320. Careful file review confirmed PAPS among the remaining patients. We then assessed the number of SLICC criteria each patient met.

Results

Among these 214 APS patients, we excluded 85 with at least one SLE-specific manifestation, 8 with another connective tissue disease, and 21 with antinuclear antibodies > 1/320, leaving 100 patients with primary APS. Among them, 28% met at least 4 SLICC classification criteria including one clinical and one immunological criterion (antiphospholipid antibodies, aPL, by definition) and could thus theoretically be classified with SLE. Fourteen had an arterial phenotype (50%), 9 a history of catastrophic APS (32%), and 18 a triple-positive profile for aPL (64%). None had developed SLE during a median follow-up of 12 [6.5–17] years.

Conclusion

Because 28% of our patients with longstanding and strictly defined PAPS could be mistakenly classified as SLE, they were at risk of deleterious therapeutic management. We therefore suggest that any future classification for SLE should specifically require at least one SLE-specific criterion for patients with aPL.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: pathogenic mechanisms [^1139VA2L]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Despite the strong association between antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thrombosis, the pathogenic role of aPL in the development of thrombosis has not been fully elucidated. Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms may be categorized into two types. First, aPL may act in vivo by disrupting the kinetics of the normal procoagulant and anticoagulant reactions occurring on cell membranes. Second, aPL may stimulate certain cells thereby altering the expression and secretion of various molecules. In this article, we review the mechanisms by which aPL may develop thrombotic events.

### Risk factors for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [^114idrPU]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Although there is increasing awareness of the important disease burden associated with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the pathogenesis of the disease has not been fully elucidated, and factors contributing to its development remain poorly defined. Although current data suggest that CTEPH does not result from traditional, known thrombophilia or defective plasma fibrinolysis, it has been suggested that levels of Factor VIII and antiphospholipid antibodies (alongside increased lupus anticoagulant), two thrombophilic factors associated with recurrent thrombosis, are elevated in association with CTEPH. Differences in the expression of type-1 plasminogen activator-inhibitor in CTEPH thrombi (compared with thrombi seen in acute pulmonary embolism) suggest that in situ thrombosis within vascularized fibromuscular obstructions may favor the persistence of thrombi, contributing to disease progression. Additional risk factors have been evaluated in patients with CTEPH, including blood groups (which reflect genetically determined erythrocyte-bound oligosaccharide structures) and lipoprotein (a). Certain medical conditions (splenectomy, ventriculo-atrial shunt/(infected) intravenous lines, acute pulmonary embolism, and chronic inflammatory states) have been established as independent risk factors for CTEPH. In particular, the link between splenectomy and CTEPH has gained considerable attention, with speculation that abnormal post-splenectomy erythrocyte activities or abnormal platelet activation may be involved. Although some patients may be genetically susceptible to pulmonary arterial hypertension, genetic variants linked with CTEPH have yet to be determined. Improved understanding of risk factors for CTEPH is an important goal, allowing better targeting of at-risk groups, facilitation of appropriate intervention, and potential limitation of disease progression.

### Thrombophlebitis in systemic lupus erythematosus… [^111U3S5z]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Thrombophlebitis occurred in 14 of 114 patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Abnormal clotting occurred despite the presence of thrombocytopenia or circulating anticoagulants in some of the patients, and the development of pulmonary emboli was verified in seven. Although infrequently reported, the association of thrombophlebitis with active SLE is apparently not uncommon. While there were no features that distinguished this group of patients from other groups of patients with SLE, there are some possible mechanisms. Recognition of this complication of SLE is important because of the frequent occurrence of SLE-induced pleuritis and its similarity to the pain of pulmonary emboli. Peck B, Hoffman GS, Franck WA.

Regarding specific circumstances for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, BSR 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with thrombotic events, damage, and adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
Reevaluate antiphospholipid antibodies, if previously negative, before pregnancy or surgery, or in the presence of a new severe manifestation or vascular event.

### Pulmonary manifestations in antiphospholipid syndrome [^116tsSJH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary manifestations in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are relatively rare compared to other clinical signs of this disease. However, pulmonary microthrombosis is among the most frequent arterial complications of APS. Timely diagnosis of pulmonary manifestations is required due both to their severity and to the high mortality rate. The spectrum of pulmonary disorders in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is sometimes referred to as the "antiphospholipid lung syndrome", and includes thromboembolism of lung arteries, pulmonary hypertension, adult respiratory distress syndrome, intra-alveolar hemorrhages, postpartum syndrome, and others. Timely diagnosis and correct therapy, as well as good patient-doctor collaboration, can result in stabilization of the patient's condition.

### Prevalence, risk factors and echocardiographic predictors of pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: towards a screening protocol [^112ynorG]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

We did not find a correlation with Raynaud's phenomenon, vasculitis, cutaneous lupus, or renal or haematological manifestations. However, serositis, specifically pericarditis, seems to be a common risk factor in most series.

Overall, our study adds to the growing body of evidence on SLE-PH risk factors and highlights the importance of monitoring for serositis and cardiorespiratory symptoms in patients with SLE, particularly those older and with longer disease duration. Anti-Ro positivity is also an important and common risk factor, as it may be a marker of more severe SLE disease activity and an increased risk of PAH. Finally, the TAPSE/sPAP ratio is a useful echocardiographic marker for PH, which may have important clinical implications in identifying and monitoring patients with SLE-PH.

Early diagnosis of PH is associated with improved long-term survival. Therefore, early detection of PH has been identified as a crucial step in improving the outcome of this devastating condition. The new PH guidelines recommend an annual evaluation of patients with CTD with overlapping features of SSc. It is evident in SSc (DETECT Study) that a multimodal approach using TTEand biomarkers is a sensitive, non-invasive tool to identify PH with minimal false negatives. As this was a TTE screening study (not symptom based), asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients were diagnosed. The presence of dyspnoea, chest pain and cough should be questioned periodically, as this is a simple and effective way to predict the risk of PH in patients with SLE. However, a diagnosis based exclusively on symptoms is a late diagnosis, with all that implies. Although dyspnoea is a relatively common symptom, a small percentage of patients experience moderate-to-severe exertional dyspnoea. In addition, NT-proBNP and usTnI had a high positive predictive value for heart disease and PH.

### The antiphospholipid syndrome | NEJM resident 360… [^117NYm3m]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pearls Q: Are patients with antiphospholipid antibodies always symptomatic. A: Patients who are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies may present with no related symptoms. Such patients are usually identified during an evaluation for systemic autoimmune diseases, early miscarriages, an elevated activated partial-thromboplastin time, or a false positive result of a syphilis test. Q: Is the diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome established when antiphospholipid antibodies are identified. A: The diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome requires positive antiphospholipid-antibody tests; however, not every positive test has diagnostic importance. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with persistent, moderate-to-high-risk antiphospholipid-antibody profiles and in patients with any antiphospholipid-antibody–related finding.

A: Stroke and transient ischemic attack are the most common arterial events in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome. Patients with venous thromboembolism most commonly present with lower-extremity deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both. Antiphospholipid-antibody–related complications of pregnancy generally develop after 10 weeks of gestation; losses before 10 weeks, especially if not recurrent, would more commonly be attributed to chromosomal defects. Antiphospholipid-antibody positivity should be included in the differential diagnosis if a patient presents with thrombosis at a young age, with an unusual site of or recurrent thrombosis, with late pregnancy loss, with early or severe preeclampsia, or with the HELLP syndrome.

For most patients with persistent antiphospholipid antibodies and otherwise unprovoked venous thromboembolism, discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy would be associated with an unacceptably high risk of recurrent thrombosis. However, the benefit of prolonged anticoagulation is less certain in patients who are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies and in whom thrombosis was provoked — for example, by a surgical procedure — and in patients with laboratory tests for antiphospholipid antibodies that become negative over time.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome in children and adolescents [^115qbkit]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) can be associated with significant morbidity in children and adolescents. Renal involvement in SLE appears to be more severe and more frequent in the pediatric age group, with the major predictors for poor outcome being the severity of histopathologic lesions, severity of renal impairment at diagnosis, and hypertension. In addition to currently recognized cardiovascular and pulmonary involvement, accelerated atherosclerosis is of increasing concern in young individuals with SLE, because of both disease effects and medication usage. Neuropsychiatric SLE seen in childhood ranges from subtle cognitive dysfunction to severe central nervous system involvement; however, there is controversy over the value of different diagnostic studies. APS in children may be associated with SLE, idiopathic, or associated with viral infections. Systemic anticoagulation is recommended for patients with thrombotic events, but long-term management has not been well studied in children.

### Prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies and association with incident cardiovascular events… [^113YnoNf]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Association between positive aPL based on either manufacturer's threshold or at least 40 units threshold and future ASCVD events were assessed in Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known cardiovascular risks including age, ethnicity, smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and lipid profiles. aCL indicates anticardiolipin. Meaning These results suggest that some aPL are associated with increased ASCVD risk in the general population; longitudinal studies with serial laboratory assessments will be needed to further explore these associations. Importance The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies and their association with future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Individuals with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have greater risk of cardiovascular events than expected based on traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors.

1, 2 Mechanisms proposed to explain this risk include inflammation-mediated disruption of vascular integrity and activation of platelets and coagulation pathways resulting in cardiovascular tissue remodeling. clinical manifestations. 6, 15 aPS/PT recognizes prothrombin complexes with anionic phosphatidylserine and associates closely with positive lupus anticoagulant testing. 7 A systematic review of 10 retrospective studies found a significant association between aPS/PT positivity and thromboembolic events. 8 The IgA isotypes of aCL and aβ2GPI have also been shown to associate with features of APS such as thrombosis and pregnancy loss, perhaps especially among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. 9–11, 16. Our data suggest that the presence of certain aPL, particularly the IgA isotypes of aCL and aβ2GPI, even when measured at a single time point, are associated with future ASCVD events.

We can speculate that aβ2GPI IgA might increase ASCVD risk by impairing HDL function and/or increasing proatherogenic circulating oxidized LDL. Here, we found that female participants were more likely to have aCL IgM and aPS/PT IgM; however, this difference disappeared when limiting the analysis to aPL present at moderate or high titer. SLE develops in Black female individuals at rates that are 3 to 4 times higher than their White counterparts. 39 While it is sometimes suggested that Black patients with SLE are less likely to have criteria aPL, 33 the data to support this assertion are not strong.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome: a challenging hypercoagulable state with systemic manifestations [^112jFbYy]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic disease that causes venous and arterial thrombosis in virtually any organ and is responsible for fetal losses and pregnancy disorders. Previously, APS was thought to be present mainly in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The spectrum of clinical manifestations is wide, because the thrombotic process may involve arterial and venous vessels of any size in any organ. At present, there is no evidence to support or refute specific treatment strategies for primary prophylaxis of thrombosis.

Regarding preventative measures for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to primary thromboprophylaxis, EULAR 2019 guidelines recommend to initiate prophylactic treatment with low-dose aspirin in patients with SLE and no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications with high-risk antiphospholipid antibodies profile.

### Prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in systemic sclerosis and association with primitive pulmonary arterial hypertension and endothelial injury [^112oVr9q]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Autoantibodies against cardiolipin (aCL) and beta2-glycoprotein 1 (beta2-GPI) were detected by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISAs) in successively hospitalised SSc patients admitted during a 24-month period. These patients were compared to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Results

108 SSc patients were included: 61 had limited cutaneous SSc, 47 had the diffuse sub-type, 16 had primitive pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and 34 had digital ulcerations. The control groups consisted of 37 RA and 38 SLE patients. The prevalence of aCL positivity was lower in SSc patients vs SLE patients (14 vs 47%; p < 0.001), lower in RA patients vs SLE patients (19 vs 47%; p < 0.001), and not different in SSc vs RA patients (14 vs 19%; NS). The mean aCL titer was also lower in SSc vs SLE patients (8 ± 10 vs 15 ± 20; p < 0.001). In SSc patients, positivity for aCL was associated with PAH (p = 0.009) and the aCL titer correlated with that of the von Willebrand antigen factor (r = 0.23; p = 0.045). The prevalence of anti beta2-GPI positive patients (IgG and/or IgM) was 5% in the SSc group, 18% in the SLE group and 5% in the RA group (SLE vs SSc and SLE vs RA; p = 0.005).

Conclusion

We found that the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in SSc patients was low. However, aCL antibodies were associated with PAH and endothelial injury.

### Risk factors for the development of the disease in antiphospholipid antibodies carriers: a long-term follow-up study [^112cWxpb]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired immune disorder defined by the presence of thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity along with positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), such as anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies (AB2GPI), and lupus anticoagulant (LA). The APS diagnosis requires both clinical (thrombosis and/or obstetric complications) and analytical evidence (confirmed presence of aPL). This is stated in the Sapporo international consensus, and later revised in Sydney.

The estimated incidence of aPL carriers in the general population is 5%. Recently, a higher incidence of antiphospholipid antibodies, especially antibodies not included in the classification criteria, has been described in the general population and related with subclinical arteriosclerosis.

The thrombosis rates in these patients are different according to the studied populations. Thrombosis rates of 3.8% have been reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with positive aPL. The annual incidence of thrombosis in patients with positive aPL antibodies but without history of thrombosis or obstetric manifestations is different between the reported studies, ranging from 0, in patients without associated disorders, to 1.3–2.8/100 patients-year, in studies that mix healthy population with SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Rates of 7.4/100 patient-years have been reported in women with recurrent abortions. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the main studies published on this subject.

Several predictive factors for thrombosis in patients with analytical but no clinical criteria for APS have been described. Among them, male gender, previous thrombosis, smoking, hypertension, and SLE are the most frequently cited. At the analytical level, LA has been the antibody most strongly associated with thrombosis. Other authors have also found association with aCL IgG or with AB2GPI. On the other hand, some authors have also found an increased risk of thrombosis in patients without clinical APS but with multiple positivity for the different aPL.

There is no consensus regarding the aPL profile that better predicts the obstetric complications. Both LA and aCL have been reported in the literature by different authors. Opatrny et al. reported a meta-analysis to measure the strength of association between recurrent fetal loss and the presence of aPL in women without autoimmune diseases. They concluded that LA was the antibody most strongly associated with recurrent fetal loss. Lockshin et al. in a multicenter prospective PROMISSE study, found an increased risk of fetal loss in patients with thrombosis or SLE history and positive LA.

### Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and autoimmune diseases [^113qBt62]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The arbitrary division between antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome has not proven useful. Antiphospholipid antibodies in the absence of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome often occur as epiphenomena in many autoimmune diseases. They are very common in systemic lupus erythematosus. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a significant comorbidity in lupus but is uncommon in Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and systemic vasculitis. Evidence is growing that antiphospholipid antibodies may have a pathogenic role in pulmonary hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis of autoimmune diseases.

### Effectiveness of a multidisciplinary clinical pathway for women with systemic lupus erythematosus and / or antiphospholipid syndrome [^112KndJM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with an incidence of 8/100 000 predominantly diagnosed in women of childbearing age. Similarly, primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is also diagnosed in women of childbearing age and characterised by venous or arterial thrombosis (thrombotic APS) or pregnancy complications (obstetric APS) in combination with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Co-incidence of APS occurs in 20%–35% of patients with SLE and the overall incidence of APS is estimated to be around 5/100 000. As such, the desire to have children is a common issue for patients with SLE and APS and therefore a pregnancy wish should be addressed as integral part of the management of patients with SLE and/or APS (SLE/APS).

From a maternal perspective, patients with SLE are at increased risk of flares and patients with APS are at increased risk of thromboembolic events (TEE) during pregnancy. Additionally, patients with SLE/APS are at higher risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational hypertensive disease (including pre-eclampsia and haemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets (HELLP) syndrome) and miscarriage. From a fetal/neonatal perspective, there is an increased risk for prematurity, fetal growth restriction (FGR), stillbirth and neonatal death. Also, infants born to SLE mothers who carry anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies have a 1%–2% risk of congenital heart block associated with neonatal lupus erythematosus.

As a consequence, some decades ago pregnancy was actually discouraged in women with SLE because of the potential severe pregnancy complications and disease exacerbations with pregnancy loss up to 43% in 1965. Fortunately, increasing insights in the determinants that can negatively impact maternal and fetal outcomes, pregnancy loss in patients with SLE decreased to 17% in 2003. Consequently, pregnancies in patients with SLE are nowadays more and more embraced, rather than discouraged, taking into account the challenges in the management of pregnant patients with SLE/APS. This view is emphasised within the recently published Joint European League Against Rheumatism, European Renal Association and American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ERA-EDTA/ACR) recommendations for the management of patients with SLE/APS with a pregnancy wish. Within these recommendations, preconception counselling is considered essential. It seems self-evident that prepregnancy counselling of patients with SLE/APS requires expertise from different specialisms and could therefore benefit from a multidisciplinary approach by a specialised team.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: identification of risk factors and haemodynamics characteristics in a multicentre retrospective cohort [^116u975F]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies and multiple organ involvement. Among the different visceral involvements of SLE, pulmonary hypertension (PH) strongly impacts the prognosis of the affected patients.PH is a clinical syndrome defined by haemodynamic criteria. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance of the pulmonary circulation can result from multiple mechanisms in patients with SLE, as, for example, hypoxia due to parenchymal lung disease, pulmonary venous hypertension due to left heart disease, pulmonary thromboembolisms and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.WHO group I PH, also known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is characterised by increased pulmonary resistance without lung parenchyma and left heart involvement and without signs of thromboembolism.PAH has an autoimmune component and is frequently associated with connective tissue diseases, such as SLE and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In the context of SLE, PAH presents unique challenges in terms of diagnosis, management and prognosis. The clinical presentation of PAH in SLE can be non-specific and variable, ranging from mild exertional dyspnoea to severe right heart failure and death. However, these symptoms are often overlooked or attributed to other causes, delaying the diagnosis of PAH and contributing to poor outcomes. The diagnosis of PAH in SLE requires a high index of suspicion and a systematic approach. Initial evaluation typically includes a thorough medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and non-invasive imaging studies such as echocardiography. The definitive diagnosis of PAH requires performing right heart catheterisation to confirm the presence of elevated pulmonary arterial pressures and to assess the severity of pulmonary vascular resistance. The management of PAH in SLE is challenging and requires a multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, pulmonologists, cardiologists and specialised PAH centres. Treatment strategies aim to control symptoms, delay disease progression and improve survival. Thus, an early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment are key to improving long-term outcomes of patients with SLE with PAH. Certain SLE manifestations and immunological abnormalities have been identified as predictors of PAH in observational cohort studies: Raynaud's phenomenon, active renal disease, cutaneous vasculitic manifestations, anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) positivity and antiphospholipid antibodies positivity were shown to predict PAH development. The development of screening and prognostic algorithm is crucial to identify high-risk patients who should undergo clinical and instrumental screening for PAH(similarly to the DETECT algorithm for SSc), and also for optimised disease monitoring and stratification. We set out to analyse clinical, immunological and capillaroscopy features in patients with SLE-PAH.

Regarding specific circumstances for systemic lupus erythematosus, more specifically with respect to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, EULAR 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate long-term VKA therapy after the first arterial or unprovoked venous thrombotic event in patients with SLE associated with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome.

### High impact of antiphospholipid syndrome on irreversible organ damage and survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus… [^111rh8zR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Antiphospholipid syndrome with thrombotic manifestations is a major predictor of irreversible organ damage and death in patients with SLE. Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important cause of thrombosis in SLE7 and may be linked to the development of accelerated atherosclerosis. 8 Therefore, many individuals with lupus would be expected to experience long-term complications and even die as a consequence of APS. Some articles published in the early 1990s pointed to the relationship of antiphospholipid antibodies9, 10 and APS11 with thrombosis and increased mortality in lupus patients. At diagnosis, 135 patients had antiphospholipid antibodies tested. Forty-nine of them were positive for aCLs and/or LA. Twelve patients fulfilled criteria for definite APS. During follow-up, antiphospholipid antibodies were tested in 198 patients and detected in 85 of them.

The noninclusion of APS in the baseline model made thrombosis a significant final explanatory variable, which suggests that the influence of APS on survival is dependent of thrombotic manifestations. Our results show that APS is an important predictor of irreversible organ damage and mortality in patients with SLE. Increased mortality linked to APS is due to thrombosis, as a consequence of both acute events and irreversible organ damage. Thus, the subgroup of patients with definite APS has been identified as high risk among those with SLE. They found a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis among patients with LA and increased mortality related to both deep vein thrombosis and LA positivity. Gulko et al10 studied 139 patients with SLE to determine the impact of several variables on survival. They found that aCL positivity and thrombosis, together with renal failure, age, and infection, were major predictors of mortality.

This study confirms the role of APS as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE, at least when associated with arterial thrombotic manifestations. Other studies have shown thrombotic recurrences in patients receiving only antiaggregants25 or anticoagulation therapy to an international normalized ratio below 3.
0. 25, 28 Also, the low risk of fatal bleeding in patients with APS receiving warfarin to a target international normalized ratio of
3. 5 has been shown. 28 Accordingly, early anticoagulant treatment is mandatory after the first thrombotic event in lupus patients with antiphospholipid antibodies.

### Deciphering the transcriptomic landscape of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111oCT51]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can demonstrate severe multi-organ damages. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe complication of SLE that can affect about 3% SLE, with an unfavorable prognosis that often serves as a major cause of mortality among SLE patients. PAH can also significantly impair the patient's physical capacity and diminish their quality of life.

PAH is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension, often designated as type I PH. The underlying mechanism of SLE-PAH has not yet been thoroughly understood. SLE-PAH's pathophysiology differs dramatically from other non-connective tissue disease-related PAH (CTD-PAH). The unique pathophysiology of SLE-PAH is linked to aberrant immune system activity and several investigations have found an association between immune complexes and SLE-PAH. Positivity of anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody has been reported to increase the risk of PAH in SLE patients. The deposition of antinuclear antibodies, immunoglobulins, and complement in pulmonary vessels, a finding reminiscent of the immune complex deposition in lupus nephritis, has been reported in several studies. A novel HLA-DQA1*03:02 mutation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region has been associated with poor prognosis in SLE-PAH. This finding suggests a role for aberrant immune cell function in SLE-PAH pathogenesis. The mutation of HLA-DQA1*03:02 influences the formation of a homodimer of HLA-DQ αβ heterodimers and the binding of the CD4 + Tcell coreceptor molecule. The affinity of the MHC/peptide and the T cell receptor is enhanced and therefore leads to the activation of T cells. The Additionally, it has been proven that T-cell hyperactivation is a significant contributor to both inflammation and vascular remodeling in SLE-PAH. Furthermore, previous research demonstrated that immunosuppressive therapy could lead to better outcomes for patients with SLE-PAH. These studies collectively demonstrated that, in addition to the mechanisms specific to PAH, inflammation plays a crucial role in the development of SLE-PAH.

Results

Overall clinical characteristics of enclosed patients and groups comparison

A total of 107 patients was included in the study, 20 (18.5%) with PAH and 87 (81.5%) without PAH. The demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients stratified for group are described in table 1. The median (IQR) age at SLE diagnosis was 42.3 (34.3–49.7) and 45.5 (34.2–54.6) years, respectively, for patients with SLE-PAH and patients with SLE without PAH. The median (IQR) follow-up was 13.4 (6.7–19.7) and 13.4 (6.4–20.3) years, respectively, for patients with SLE-PAH and patients with SLE without PAH. Among the study participants, 5 patients with SLE-PAH (25%) and 15 patients with SLE without PAH (17%) had a paediatric onset of the disease. The age at SLE diagnosis and the length of the follow-up were not different between SLE patients with and without PAH (respectively, p = 0.21 and p = 0.82). The majority of patients were women (84, 78.5%), which is lower than the female predominance typically reported in SLE cohorts. No male patients were observed in the SLE-PAH group. Most patients were Caucasian (100, 93.5%), 7 patients were of not Caucasian origin, without ethnicity differences between SLE-PAH and not PAH groups (p = 0.36). Of the 20 identified patients with SLE-PAH, 2 died from non-SLE-related causes and 2 were lost to follow-up after 13.4 (± 1.5 SD) and 6.8 (± 1.5 SD) years, respectively. All patients with SLE referring to the control group were on active follow-up at the time of the inclusion.

### Remnant cholesterol predicts risk of recurrent thrombosis beyond LDL-cholesterol in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome [^114gQMCM]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 325 patients with APS (36.85 ± 13.35 years old; 63.08% female) were enrolled in this study. Serum RC levels of the participants ranged from 0.15 to 1.69 mmol/L. Based on RC tertiles, patients were categorized into three groups (T1: ≤ 0.45; T2: > 0.45, ≤ 0.60; T3: > 0.60, mmol/L), setting RC > 0.60 mmol/L as the threshold for abnormally high RC. Baseline characteristics revealed that history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, elevated levels of TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG, and immunosuppressant treatment were associated with higher baseline RC level (Table 1). Conversely, hydroxychloroquine treatment correlated with lower RC levels. Besides, higher RC levels seemed to be associated with elevated CRP.

Association of RC with thrombotic risk in patients with APS

Over a median follow-up period of 35 months, 51 patients experienced 59 thrombotic events, comprising 24 venous, 19 arterial, and 16 microvascular events (Table 2). Kaplan–Meier survival analyses revealed that patients with higher RC levels experienced a markedly increased all-cause thrombotic risk than those with lower RC (log-rank P < 0.001, Fig. 2 A). This elevated risk was consistent across various types of thrombosis: venous (log-rank P = 0.041, Fig. 2 B), arterial (log-rank P = 0.082, Fig. 2 C) and microvascular disease (log-rank P = 0.013, Fig. 2 D).

### Antiphospholipid antibodies can identify lupus patients at risk of pulmonary hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169qmVh]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening condition that may affect outcomes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The role of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) on the risk of PH is controversial. Therefore our objective was to estimate the risk of PH (WHO groups 1–5) including associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH, WHO group 1 only) related to aPL in patients with SLE.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, congress abstracts, and reference lists of eligible studies were searched through 2015. Studies were selected if they included SLE patients with descriptions of the exposure to aPL and the outcomes (PH including APAH). Two reviewers extracted study characteristics and outcome data from published reports. Estimates were pooled using random effects models and sensitivity analyses. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42015016872.

Results

Of 984 identified abstracts, 31 primary studies (five cohorts, 13 case-control, 13 cross-sectional) met inclusion criteria, including 4480 SLE patients. Prevalence of PH in aPL-positive vs. aPL-negative SLE patients was 12.3% vs. 7.3%, respectively. The overall pooled odds ratio (OR) for PH was 2.28 (95% CI, 1.65 to 3.15) (I 2 = 39%). The risk of APAH was also significantly increased (OR = 2.62 [95% CI, 1.11–6.15]). The risk of PH was the highest for lupus anticoagulant (OR = 1.96 [95% CI, 1.31–2.92]) and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (OR = 2.64 [95% CI, 1.30–5.36]) while other antibodies were not significantly associated with PH.

Conclusions

Among SLE patients, aPL can identify patients at risk for PH and APAH. These findings warrant implementation of effective screening and early treatment strategies.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease: a case report [^115X6A7m]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is diagnosed based on both clinical criteria and laboratory criteria. The clinical signs include recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis. APS occurs in about 15–50% chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients. Surgical treatment for severe CTEPH with APS is still challenging because the perioperative management may be complicated due to the presence of thrombotic events and bleeding complications. Otherwise there is a risk that coronary artery disease may be overlooked in CTEPH patients with APS. Evaluation of coronary artery disease should be considered in symptomatic APS patients; however, sometimes coronary angiography is necessary even in asymptomatic patients.

Ballon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has been known as an effective endovascular treatment; however, its effectiveness is limited to only distal lesions, and PEA is the most appropriate treatment for CTEPH with central lesions. Because in PEA, the patients have to be cooled down to 18 °C, rewarming requires more than 1 h. Therefore, concomitant procedures can be usually performed during rewarming.

### Prevalence, risk factors and echocardiographic predictors of pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: towards a screening protocol [^112zAZTh]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) significantly affects the lungs and heart, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a severe manifestation that leads to considerable morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

We aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of probable SLE-PH, assess the main echocardiographic predictors and develop a potential screening strategy.

Methods

A prospective single-centre study was conducted on 201 patients with SLE who underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Patients meeting PH criteria were referred for right heart catheterisation (RHC).

Results

Among patients, 88.56% were women, 85.57% were of Spanish origin and 43.78% had structural heart disease. Out of these, 16 (7.96%) had intermediate or high probability criteria for PH according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2022. Six RHCs confirmed PH with a prevalence of 2.99% for SLE-PH and 1.99% for SLE-pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Key Risk Factors

Key risk factors included age, cardiorespiratory symptoms, serositis, anti-Ro, cardiac biomarkers and altered pulmonary function tests (PFTs). PH was linked to a higher Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) (mean SDI 4.75 vs 2.05, p < 0.001) and increased mortality risk in a 2-year follow-up (12.50% vs 1.08%, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

In our cohort, 7.96% of patients with SLE had an intermediate or high PH probability. By RHC, six patients (2.99%) met the ESC/European Respiratory Society criteria for PH and four (1.99%) for PAH. The main risk factors were older age, cardiorespiratory symptoms, serositis, anti-Ro, cardiac biomarkers and altered PFTs. PH was a severe SLE complication, suggesting the need for earlier diagnosis through data-driven screening to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

### Pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^116Kpb85]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is a distinct disorder with the clinical features of recurrent thrombosis in the venous or arterial circulation and fetal losses. Its serological marker is the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood of these patients. The relation between the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids and thromboembolic complications is well established over the last 25 years but the pathophysiology of the syndrome is largely unclear. Even after all these years, there is a persisting debate about the specificity and sensitivity of the assays for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies. We now accept that antibodies to beta2-glycoprotein I rather than to anionic phospholipids are the major pathological antibodies, although there is no clear consensus on how the presence of these antibodies correlates with the different clinical manifestations of the syndrome. In this review, we discuss the current methods of detection of the antibodies and our insight into the pathobiology of the syndrome. We propose a mechanism for describing how the presence of anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies relates to the different clinical manifestations observed.

### Application of EULAR and European Society of Cardiology recommendations with regard to blood pressure and lipid management in antiphospholipid syndrome [^115TrGoZ]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorder (RMD) characterised by a plethora of macrovascular and microvascular thrombotic manifestations. APS is associated with life-threatening complications due to arterial thrombosis in the coronary, cerebrovascular and/or pulmonary circulation, supporting the need for strict control of risk factors associated with their development and recurrence.

Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia have been recognised as independent predictors of recurrent thromboses in APS, including cardiovascular events. However, a high prevalence of unachieved blood pressure (BP) and lipid targets has been documented in patients with APS. The 2022 EULAR recommendations for cardiovascular risk (CVR) management in RMDsproposed that, after assessment of both traditional and disease-related CVR features, BP and lipid treatment in APS should follow general population guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that optimal CVR management, including BP and lipid modification therapy, should be tailored to individual patient risk assessment.

Numerical estimates calculated with the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) are recommended by the ESCto risk-stratify patients for CVR factor management, including modifications of baseline risk for systemic autoimmune disorders. Qualitative clinical risk modifiers have also been introduced to refine risk in high-CVR disorders, including diabetes mellitus (DM). Cardiometabolic risk phenotypes associated with DMmay also prevail in APS compared with other high-CVR disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Identification of subclinical atherosclerotic plaques on vascular ultrasound (VUS) is also proposed by the ESCas a risk classifier to modify clinical risk estimated by SCORE. A 2.5–4-fold higher risk for subclinical atherosclerosis has been described in APS versus the general population, comparable to that observed in patients with DM.

Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are included, along with the antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile, in the adjusted Global APS Score (aGAPSS) which was developed to predict recurrent thrombotic events in APS. A more recent version of the aGAPSS focusing on the prediction of arterial events, the aGAPSS for cardiovascular disease (aGAPSS CVD), further included obesity, smoking and DM as independent predictors for CVR assessment in APS. Hitherto, the contribution of any of the aforementioned general and disease-related risk assessment modalities to guide BP and lipid management in APS remains unknown.

A multicenter, longitudinal cohort study was undertaken from January 2003 to January 2020. The study collected data on 3,624 consecutively evaluated patients diagnosed as having SLE. The diagnosis of PAH was confirmed by right-sided heart catheterization. Cox proportional hazards regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to fit the model. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis were performed for validation.

Results

Ninety-two lupus patients (2.54%) developed PAH during a median follow-up of 4.84 years (interquartile range 2.42–8.84). The final prediction model included 5 clinical variables (acute/subacute cutaneous lupus, arthritis, renal disorder, thrombocytopenia, and interstitial lung disease) and 3 autoantibodies (anti-RNP, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB). A 10-year PAH probability-predictive nomogram was established. The model was internally validated by Harrell's concordance index (0.78), the Brier score (0.03), and a satisfactory calibration curve. According to the net benefit and predicted probability thresholds, we recommend annual screening in high-risk (> 4.62%) lupus patients.

Conclusion

We developed a risk stratification model using routine clinical assessments. This new tool may effectively predict the future risk of PAH in patients with SLE.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease: a case report [^115scWwd]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder of acquired hypercoagulability characterized by recurrent vascular thrombosis. APS is diagnosed based on both clinical criteria and laboratory criteria. The clinical signs include recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis such as myocardial infarction and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). According to the results of several cohort studies, APS occurs in about 15–50% CTEPH patients. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the most appropriate treatment for CTEPH with central lesions, however, there have been few reports describing detailed results of PEA in CTEPH patients with APS.

Furthermore, in patients with APS, the management of anticoagulation becomes complex because of hypercoagulation and bleeding tendency. Neurological complications including stroke and severe thrombocytopenia were more common after PEA in patients with APS. In APS patients prior to main surgery, management of platelet count is problematic. In APS patients, prevalence of thrombocytopenia was found. Therefore, the anticoagulant therapy after PEA for CTEPH patients with APS should be introduced carefully and strictly, however, it is also necessary to pay attention to the bleeding tendency. Further studies regarding the impact of APS on outcomes of PEA are warranted.

In PEA, after establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient was cooled down to 18 °C and thromboendarterectomy was performed using a cycle of 15 min of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest followed by 10 min of systemic reperfusion. Therefore, bleeding complications can be more seriously in PEA than other cardiac surgeries because of inhibition in coagulation ability due to deep hypothermia. Moreover, PEA sometimes develops critical endobronchial bleeding, therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the bleeding tendency in CTEPH patients with APS.

Recently, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has been performed more frequently in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension due to distal lesions. BPA has been known as an effective endovascular treatment; however, its effectiveness is limited to only distal lesions, and PEA is the most appropriate treatment for CTEPH with central lesions. In the present case, only PEA was judged to be effective in treating severe pulmonary hypertension.

### Primary antiphospholipid syndrome and antiphospholipid syndrome associated to systemic lupus: are they different entities? [^112QcaEe]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and antiphospholipid syndrome associated to lupus (SAPS) have several overlapping characteristics. As systemic manifestations are also reported in patients with PAPS, and as a subgroup of PAPS patients could evaluate to a SAPS, the differentiation between the two types of APS could be performed based on the clinical experience of the medical teams and is related to a variety of clinical, biological, histological and genetic features. Several data are available in the literature with respect to the identification of distinctive features between these two entities. However, there are some limitation in the interpretation of results issued from studies performed prior to updated Sydney criteria. Based on recent data, a certain number of features more frequent in one type of APS as compared to the other could be distinguished. The major differentiation between these two entities is genetical. New genetic data allowing the identification of specific subgroups of APS are ongoing.

### Cluster analysis of autoantibodies in 852 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus from a single center [^115xsQnV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Associations between autoantibodies and clinical features have been described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein, we aimed to define autoantibody clusters and their clinical correlations in a large cohort of patients with SLE.

Methods

We analyzed 852 patients with SLE who attended our clinic. Seven autoantibodies were selected for cluster analysis: anti-DNA, anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anticardiolipin (aCL) immunoglobulin (Ig)G or IgM, lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anti-Ro, and anti-La. Two-step clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used.

Results

Five clusters were identified. A cluster consisted of patients with only anti-dsDNA antibodies, a cluster of anti-Sm and anti-RNP, a cluster of aCL IgG/M and LAC, and a cluster of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Analysis revealed 1 more cluster that consisted of patients who did not belong to any of the clusters formed by antibodies chosen for cluster analysis. Sm/RNP cluster had significantly higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension and Raynaud phenomenon. DsDNA cluster had the highest incidence of renal involvement. In the aCL/LAC cluster, there were significantly more patients with neuropsychiatric involvement, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. According to the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics damage index, the highest frequency of damage was in the aCL/LAC cluster. Comparison of 10 and 20 years survival showed reduced survival in the aCL/LAC cluster.

Conclusion

This study supports the existence of autoantibody clusters with distinct clinical features in SLE and shows that forming clinical subsets according to autoantibody clusters may be useful in predicting the outcome of the disease. Autoantibody clusters in SLE may exhibit differences according to the clinical setting or population.

### Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: risk factors and management [^116uNckK]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may cause chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Current knowledge regarding prevalence and risk factors for CTEPH among APS patients is limited. We sought to determine clinical features and biomarkers that could identify APS subjects suffering from CTEPH, and describe the prevalence, course and treatment outcomes of patients with APS-CTEPH.

Methods

504 APS patients were treated in our center during 2008 to 2019. We studied clinical and laboratory features of 69 APS patients, comparing 19 patients diagnosed with CTEPH (APS-CTEPH) and treated accordingly, with 50 consecutive age and gender matched patients with no evidence of pulmonary hypertension (APS-No-CTEPH).

Results

CTEPH prevalence was 3.8% in our APS cohort and was linked with the following parameters: primary APS (p < 0.05); prior pulmonary embolism (p < 0.001); recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) (p < 0.001); lower platelet counts (p < 0.001); triple anti-phospholipid antibodies positivity (p < 0.001), higher titers of anti-cardiolipin IgG (p < 0.001), anti-B2GPI IgG (p < 0.001), and high Russell viper venom time ratio (RVVT-ratio) (p < 0.05). Additionally, history of catastrophic APS was more prevalent in APS-CTEPH vs APS-No-CTEPH (p < 0.05). Of APS-CTEPH patients, 15/19 underwent pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA): In 12/15 the procedure was elective and resulted in good perioperative and long-term outcomes, while only 1 of 3 patients that underwent urgent PEA survived.

Conclusions

CTEPH is relatively common in APS. Primary APS, prior PE, recurrent VTE, thrombocytopenia and specific anti-phospholipid antibodies predict CTEPH in APS. Active assessment for CTEPH in APS patients should be considered, as PEA was found to be effective and relatively safe, especially if electively performed.

### Prevalence, risk factors and echocardiographic predictors of pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: towards a screening protocol [^115ATW1d]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a connective tissue disease (CTD) that can affect various organs and systems, including the lungs and heart. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare but serious complication of SLE associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and it might be the third leading cause of death in patients with SLE.PH can be silent, and clinical manifestations are typically absent in the early stage, with a delay of 2–4 years between the onset of symptoms and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) diagnosis. The exact mechanism of SLE-PH is still not fully understood but may involve inflammation, vasculitis and thrombosis, and early detection and management of the condition are challenging.

Among the CTDs, systemic sclerosis (SSc) has the highest prevalence of PH, followed by SLE. However, the prevalence of SLE-PH varies widely in the literature, ranging from 2% to 20%, and a growing body of evidence suggests that it may be underdiagnosed.

SLE-PH can manifest as any of the five groups of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2022 classification: group 1 (PAH), group 2 (PH due to left heart disease), group 3 (PH due to lung diseases or hypoxia), group 4 (chronic thromboembolic PH) and group 5 (PH with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms). The classification should be based on the predominant mechanism and may change over time, as the underlying mechanisms can evolve or change.

Despite the increasing recognition of SLE-PH, there is still a lack of consensus on the best approach for diagnosis and management. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms further and develop new strategies for earlier diagnosis.

The 2022 European guidelines for PH emphasise using right heart catheterisation (RHC) in classifying PH.RHC provides important haemodynamic data that are crucial in determining the underlying pathophysiology and subtype of the condition.

### Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in childhood: presentation with an inferior caval vein mass [^114ysHo6]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism remains one of the important causes of pulmonary hypertension in children. The causes of venous thromboembolism are varied and include antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a severe variant of APS characterised by disseminated thrombosis and microangiopathy resulting in multiorgan failure. CAPS can occur independently (primary APS) but mainly occurs in association with systemic lupus erythematosus including the paediatric population. We report a young girl with primary CAPS who presented with pulmonary hypertension and an inferior vena cava mass masquerading as a tumour.

### Autoantibody clustering of lupus-associated pulmonary hypertension [^114NS64e]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary hypertension is an important potential complication of connective tissue diseasesand a leading cause of death in SLE. A dilated pulmonary artery on chest CTor an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure on transthoracic echocardiogram is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, especially in patients with connective tissue diseases such as scleroderma, in whom the use of echocardiography for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary hypertension has been validated. Right heart catheterisation is required to confirm a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and aids in WHO pulmonary hypertension group classification. Unlike in scleroderma, there are no guidelines for screening or monitoring pulmonary hypertension in SLE. This is in part because pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis, prevalence, risk factors and natural history in SLE remain poorly understood.

SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension prevalence and serological and clinical associations vary by geographical location. For example, there is a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of 2% in a Taiwanese SLE cohortbut 23% in a Pakistani SLE cohort. Prabu et al found an association of pulmonary hypertension with lupus anticoagulant in an SLE cohort in the UK while associations with antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP)and anticardiolipin antibodieshave been reported in Chinese SLE cohorts. Anti-Ro and anti-La have been associated with pulmonary hypertension in a French SLE cohort. The REVEAL (Registry to Evaluate Early And Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension disease management) cohort, which included 1892 US patients with 1-year survival data, 339 of whom had systemic sclerosis, and 110 of whom had SLE, demonstrated a significant ethnicity difference comparing scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension versus SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension: Caucasian (84% vs 37%), African–American (11% vs 32%) or Hispanic (4% vs 18%) (p < 0.0001). Generally, African–American patients with pulmonary hypertension have a higher mortality than Caucasian patients with pulmonary hypertension, such that these differences in prevalence across connective tissue diseases imply a potentially important health disparity.

### The lung in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^114sS821]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may develop a broad spectrum of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension are the most common complications, but microvascular pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary capillaritis, and alveolar haemorrhage have also been reported. Clinicians should seriously consider these types of vascular injury when evaluating patients with APS who present with dyspnoea, fever, and infiltrates on chest radiography.

### Ovarian stimulation for ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome [^115XcSkz]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current evidence regarding the relationship between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome and female infertility, as well as the risks associated with ovarian stimulation for ovulation induction and IVF. To establish, based on this information, guidelines for safe and successful assisted reproductive technology (ART).

Design

A MEDLINE computer search was performed to identify relevant articles.

Result(S)

Systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome are not related to infertility, except for cases of amenorrhea accompanying severe flares, renal insufficiency-related hypofertility, and ovarian failure secondary to cyclophosphamide (CTX) therapy. The most threatening conditions in affected women undergoing ovarian stimulation are lupus flares and thrombosis, with the latter being especially associated with the occurrence of an overt ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Friendly ovarian stimulation, single embryo transfer, avoidance of OHSS, administration of coadjuvant therapy, and use of natural E(2) or P through a nonoral route may constitute the safest approach. Systemic lupus manifested in acute flares, badly controlled arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, advanced renal disease, severe valvulopathy or heart disease, and major previous thrombotic events are situations on which to discourage ART, especially due to the high risk of complications for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and puerperium.

Conclusion(S)

Ovarian stimulation for ovulation induction and IVF seems to be safe and successful in well-selected women with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome.

### The association of antiphospholipid antibodies with cardiopulmonary manifestations of systemic sclerosis [^11785UMZ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence and correlates of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) in systemic sclerosis (SSc).

Methods

Nine hundred and forty SSc patients were tested for APLA using an ELISA assay at recruitment. Clinical manifestations were defined as present, if ever present from SSc diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associations of APLA.

Results

One or more types of APLA were present in 226 (24.0%) patients. Anticardiolipin (ACA) IgG (ACA-IgG) antibodies were associated with right heart catheter-diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), with higher titres corresponding with a higher likelihood of PAH (moderate titre (20–39 U/ml) ACA-IgG odds ratio [OR] 1.70, 95% CI: 1.01–2.93, p = 0.047; high titre (> 40 U/ml) ACA-IgG OR 4.60, 95% CI:1.02–20.8, p = 0.047). Both ACA-IgM (OR 2.04, 95% CI: 1.4–3.0, p < 0.0001) and ACA-IgG (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.2–2.8, p = 0.005) were associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD). Increasing ACA-IgM and IgG titres were associated with increased likelihood of ILD. ACA-IgG was a marker of coexistent pulmonary hypertension and ILD (ILD-PH) (OR 2.10, 95% CI: 1.1–4.2, p = 0.036). We also found an association between ACA-IgG and digital ulcers (OR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.16–2.67, p = 0.008) and ACA-IgM and Raynaud's phenomenon (OR 2.39, 95% CI: 1.08–5.27, p = 0.031). There was no association between APLA and SSc disease subtype, peak skin score, presence of other autoantibodies, mortality or other disease manifestations.

Conclusions

The association of APLA with PAH, ILD, ILD-PH, Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers suggests that endothelial abnormalities and small vessel thrombosis may be important in the pathogenesis of these disease features.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome and the heart: a case series and literature review [^116fTPJQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by a high tendency of developing thrombotic events. It is diagnosed in the presence of specific laboratory criteria (positivity for lupus anticoagulant, and the presence of anticardiolipin and aβ2GPI antibodies) and clinical criteria such as thrombosis in any district (arterial or venous) and pregnancy morbidity. Being a multisystem disease, the heart is commonly affected by direct (autoimmune mediated action) or indirect (thrombosis) pathological mechanisms. Heart valve lesions are the most frequent manifestations; however, the haemodynamic significance is quite uncommon but when it occurs it may require surgery that further complicates the picture due to the high risk of thrombosis. Coronary arteries and myocardium are also affected leading to ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Other findings include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis. The consequences of heart involvement may be significant in overt disease. The treatment of cardiac complications is challenging and requires an in-depth knowledge of the disease.

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^1127c8gB]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — genetic and hemostatic associations: Although coagulation and fibrinolysis genes drive venous thromboembolic (VTE) risk, their contribution to CTEPH is considered limited. Reported associations with higher CTEPH risk include non-blood group 0, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, fibrinogen polymorphism, and possibly factor V Leyden; BMPR2 is not mutated in CTEPH. Elevated factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels that persist after pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) have been observed, suggesting a role in pathogenesis.

### Prevalence and risk factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with lupus [^114xuTbb]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with rapid deterioration and poor prognosis in SLE, especially during pregnancy. The prevalence of PAH in SLE in non-tertiary centres is uncertain. This study aims to estimate the point prevalence of PAH and identify risk factors for PAH in a large cohort of SLE patients.

Methods

A prospective cross-sectional study of 288 patients with SLE were recruited from lupus clinics in Birmingham, UK. Resting transthoracic echocardiography was performed to estimate the pulmonary artery pressures and to assess cardiac morphology and function. PAH was defined as systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) > 30 mmHg. We assessed potential risk factors such as the presence of lung disease, respiratory muscle weakness, autoantibodies, smoking, RP and APS.

Results

Of 288 patients who consented for participation, 283 patients were suitable for analysis. Twelve patients were found to have PAH with sPAP > 30 mmHg. The range of sPAP in our PAH patients was 31–59 mmHg and three patients had sPAP > 40 mmHg. The only significant risk factor for PAH was LAC (P = 0.005).

Conclusions

The point prevalence of PAH was 4.2% in our cohort of patients with SLE. Most of the PAH cases were found to be of mild severity (< 40 mmHg). The significant association of LAC and presence of APS in PAH cases suggests that thrombosis may play an important role in PAH with SLE. This is important, as it is treatable.

### Accrual of thromboembolic events and antiphospholipid syndrome in new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a population-based inception cohort study [^1166AhUy]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

This population-based study aimed to determine timing and incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) relative to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) onset and assess relationships between TE, APS and anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) during follow-up.

Methods

We included all medical-record confirmed new-onset SLE patients in Southeast Norway (population 2.9 million) 2000–2017 who fulfilled the 2019 European Alliance of Rheumatology Associations/American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. APS was defined by the 2006 Sydney classification criteria, and aPL positivity was determined following international guidelines. Key outcomes were APS, TE and death. We estimated outcome-free survival using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Results

Among 700 new-onset SLE patients followed for a mean of 8 years (SD 5.0), 13% (89/700) experienced a new TE. TE incidence peaked at 59 per 100 person-years (95% CI 38 to 87) in the first year of SLE among aPL positive patients diagnosed with APS, falling to 12 (95% CI 6.2 to 21) in the subsequent 4 years. In patients without APS, corresponding TE incidences were 2.6 (95% CI 1.4 to 4.3) and 0.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.4), respectively. The lowest TE incidence was in aPL-negative patients aged < 50 years, with 1-year TE-free survival of 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.0). Beyond the first year, TE-free survival rates did not differ between SLE patients positive and negative for aPL. Standardised mortality rate in patients with and without APS was 4.7 (95% CI 1.8 to 10.7 and 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.3).

Conclusions

This population-level study reveals high risk of TE, particularly for aPL positive patients around the time of SLE diagnosis. The elevated TE risk requires attention and early preventive strategies in newly diagnosed SLE.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^112k1gU8]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease — therapy recommendations and considerations — states that "Drugs for PAH should be prescribed in PAH-CTD according to the same treatment algorithm as in IPAH (Figure 9)". Disease-specific therapy may help in select CTDs, as "Immunosuppressive therapy combining corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide may result in clinical improvement in patients with SLE- or mixed CTD-associated PAH, while it is not recommended in PAH-SSc". Comorbidities affect choices: "Patients with SSc and other CTDs may have ILD and/or HFpEF, which needs to be considered when initiating PAH therapy". Anticoagulation guidance is nuanced, since "In SSc, the long-term risk/benefit ratio of oral anticoagulation is unfavourable because of an increased risk of bleeding, while VKAs are recommended in PAH-CTD with a thromboembolic predisposition (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome)". As for prostacyclin therapy, "Continuous i.v. epoprostenol therapy improved exercise capacity, symptoms, and haemodynamics in a 3-month RCT in PAH-SSc", though "a retrospective analysis showed a better effect of i.v. epoprostenol on survival in IPAH compared with PAH-SSc". Broader management includes that "The choice of PAH therapy in the context of SSc and its systemic manifestations may consider other vascular damage such as digital ulcers", and transplant candidacy should be individualized because "Connective tissue disease should not be considered as an a priori contraindication for LTx, where a multidisciplinary approach optimising SSc management before, during, and after surgery is recommended", and "Indications and contraindications for transplantation have to be adapted to the specificities of CTD, with a special focus on digestive (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and intestinal disease), cardiac, renal, and cutaneous involvement".

### Thoracic involvement in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases: pathogenesis and management [^112KgRhE]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

The prevalence of SLE-PAH is about 5%, with a 1-year survival better than that of SSc-PAH. The presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-RNP and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are independent predictors of PAH development in SLE. Particularly in SLE patients with antiphospholipid antibodies positivity, chronic thromboembolic PH (group IV) should also be included in the list of differential diagnoses with SLE-PAH.

Beyond the above mentioned mediators of endothelial dysfunction, macrophagic and lymphocytic infiltration as well as deposits of both immunoglobulins and complement have been shown in the wall of small pulmonary arteries in patients with SLE-PAH, supporting an important pathogenetic role of inflammation and autoimmunity. B cells contribute to pulmonary vascular injury and remodelling by producing autoantibodies that cause endothelial dysfunction, while cytotoxic T cells appear to play a role in arterial muscularization. Thus, both acute (e.g. fibrinoid necrosis and vasculitis) and chronic lesions (e.g. intimal and periadventitial fibrosis, thickening of the media) may be found in SLE-PAH. In this regard, the existence of two major phenotypes of PAH secondary to SLE has been postulated: a "vasculitic subtype" detectable in patients with high SLE disease activity (e.g. Systemic Lupus Eriyhematosus Disease Activity Index 2000, SLEDAI-2 K > 9, concomitant presence of rash, arthritis and nephritis) and a "vasculopatic subtype" characterized by a low activity of SLE and severe PAH. This might also explain why, although the outcome is generally more favourable than in SSc-PAH patients, the prognosis of some patients with severe SLE-PAH is poor, with right heart failure and arrhythmias being the most common causes of death.

### Pulmonary disease in systemic lupus erythematosus and the antiphospholpid syndrome [^111Z3fy5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by disturbances in innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Multiple systems and organs may be involved. Tissue damage and dysfunction are mediated by autoantibodies and immune complex formation. The lungs are among the organ systems commonly involved. The pulmonary manifestations usually occur in patients with multisystem disease and include: pleural involvement, parenchymal disease, pulmonary vascular disease and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Manifestations may range from sub-clinical abnormalities to life threatening disorders. Many of the pulmonary manifestations characteristic of SLE are seen in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as well, in both the primary and secondary syndrome. In this review the diverse pulmonary manifestations are described as well as the diagnostic modalities available, including the use of induced sputum evaluation for early diagnosis and follow up. New treatment modalities are referred to.

### Autoantibody clustering of lupus-associated pulmonary hypertension [^114pno8Y]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study using a clustering technique to evaluate the autoantibody profiles associated with SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension in a US, ethnically diverse cohort. We found that SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension disproportionately affects African–Americans and stratified into clinically relevant clusters, which differed by age and immunological activity, and were defined by specific autoantibody profiles. All autoantibodies selected for this study were readily available and could be measured routinely in most medical centres.

As demonstrated in other diverse pulmonary hypertension cohorts, African–Americans had a higher prevalence of pulmonary hypertension compared with Caucasian and Asian patients, with African–Americans making up more than half of the SLE cohort with pulmonary hypertension compared with 37.8% of those without pulmonary hypertension. Although there were no significant differences in ethnicity across clusters, there were trends of autoantibody profiles associating with African–American patients with SLE pulmonary hypertension. Cluster 3, the only cluster with anti-La positivity, was majority African–American, while cluster 1, the only cluster with false positive-RPR, was equally divided between African–American and Caucasian patients.

In the setting of SLE-associated pulmonary hypertension, our study identified five autoantibody profiles with three stable clusters representing unique phenotypes: antiphospholipid antibody predominant (cluster 1), anti-Ro and anti-La predominant (cluster 3), and neutral (cluster 5). Clusters 1 and 2 exhibited an antiphospholipid antibody predominant profile with the highest levels of anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant, respectively. Anticardiolipin was previously identified as a risk factor in a Chinese cohort, while lupus anticoagulant was found in a UK cohort.

Cluster 3 was defined by anti-Ro and anti-La, possibly representing an SLE phenotype with features of Sjogren's, which can be associated with pulmonary hypertension. This is consistent with work by Hachulla et al showing significantly higher incidences of anti-Ro and anti-La in patients with SLE with pulmonary hypertension compared with those without, suggesting these autoantibodies may be risk factors for pulmonary hypertension in SLE. In our previous work on clusters of SLE, we found a cluster described by anti-Ro and La as well.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: results from the French pulmonary hypertension registry [^112QsBDd]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

We identified all patients with SLE and PAH (SLE-PAH) who were enrolled in the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry with a diagnosis confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC). A control group of 101 patients with SLE without known PAH was selected from SLE expert centers participating in the Pulmonary Hypertension Registry. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios associated with potential predictors of death were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

Of the 69 patients with SLE-PAH identified in the French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry, 51 were included in the study. They did not differ from the control group regarding age, sex, or duration of SLE at the time of the analysis but had a higher frequency of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. The delay between SLE diagnosis and PAH diagnosis was 4.9 years (range, 2.8–12.9) years. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were 89.4% (95% CI, 76.2%-96.5%) and 83.9% (95% CI, 68.8%-92.1%), respectively. The survival rate was significantly better in patients with anti-U1-RNP antibodies (P = .04).

Conclusions

Patients with SLE-PAH have an overall 5-year survival rate of 83.9% after the PAH diagnosis. Anti-SSA/SSB antibodies may be a risk factor for PAH, and the presence of anti-U1-RNP antibodies appears to be a protective factor regarding survival.

Clinical manifestations of APLS

Cardiac manifestations in APLS include valvular disease, coronary artery disease, intracardiac thrombus formation, pulmonary hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac valvular pathology includes irregular thickening of the valve leaflets due to deposition of immune complexes that may lead to vegetations and valve dysfunction. These lesions are frequent and may be a significant risk factor for stroke. Noninfectious and noninflammatory but rather thrombotic or fibrotic/calcific lesions are found in patients with primary APLS. APLS is combined with SLE in about 40% of all APLS patients and consequently heart valvular lesions can also be caused by a SLE specific mechanism. Non-autoimmunogenic reasons for heart valve failure in APLS-patients are possible as well. The most commonly affected valve is the mitral, followed by the aortic and tricuspid valves; because the surface of the left-sided valves is more vulnerable to micro injuries due to stress, jet effect and turbulence. Notably, the incidence of arterial embolization is estimated to be 77% in patients with APLS and simultaneous mitral valve disease. Several studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between the aCL titers and valvular heart disease severity. Most patients develop a mild form of valvular regurgitation while 4–6% of patients progress to severe valvular regurgitation necessitating replacement surgeries. The rather young age of the patients and the most often necessary long-term anticoagulation for APLS seem to make a mechanical valve the first choice if a replacement is needed but thromboembolic complications render a mechanical valve in danger of dysfunction. The advantage of a bioprosthesis is the independence of oral anticoagulation, however valve failure due to excessive pannus and consecutive stenosis renders replacement inevitable after some years. Additionally, accelerated atherosclerosis increases the risk of coronary artery disease; the etiology seems to be more related with inflammatory and immunopathologic factors as compared with traditional Framingham cardiovascular risk factors. The presence of intracardiac thrombus is a rare but potentially a life-threatening manifestation of APLS. Thrombus formation, a potential cause of pulmonary and systemic emboli, may occur in any cardiac chamber but most frequently on the right side. Antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with various other thrombogenic complications such as recurrent thrombosis, thrombocytopenia and serious bleeding abnormalities. Of those patients with APLS who present with thrombosis, 30 ± 55% will present with venous thrombosis, especially of the lower limbs. Repeat episodes of thrombosis are often of the same type. However, it is paradox that despite the well-documented coexistence of autoantigens and its antibodies in blood of APLS patients for long periods, thrombotic events occur only sporadically. Eventually, it can be assumed that thrombotic events occur much more often but only in microvasculature or smaller vessels, resulting in deterioration of organ function such as renal failure, cerebral damages or impairment of the myocardial function by multiple recurrent microthromboses or microemboli. Neurologic manifestations of APLS have been reported to include recurrent cerebral infarcts, headaches, migraines and visual disturbances. Other manifestations of APLS include skin ulcers (pyoderma gangrenosum- like or livedoid vasculitis) due to fibrin deposition within the lumens of superficial dermal vessels as well as diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Of note, acute diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be present in fully anticoagulated patients that could be attributed to a non-thrombotic pathogenesis in contrast to typical alveolar haemorrhage. Catastrophic APLS (cAPLS) is an acute condition with multiple vascular occlusions resulting in failure of several organs simultaneously or over a short period of time (days to weeks). It can be triggered by surgery, infection or changes in anticoagulation therapy. cAPLS presents a mortality of 50% and can resemble syndromes such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), SLE vasculitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or sepsis.

### The impact of antiphospholipid antibodies / antiphospholipid syndrome on systemic lupus erythematosus [^115XMj7n]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

aPLs are a major determinant of the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with SLE. They adversely affect clinical manifestations, damage accrual and prognosis. Apart from the antibodies included in the 2006 revised classification criteria for APS, other non-classical aPLs might help in identifying SLE patients at increased risk of thrombotic events. The best studied are IgA anti-β2-glycoprotein I, anti-domain I β2-glycoprotein I and aPS-PT. Major organ involvement includes kidney and neuropsychiatric systems. aPL/APS severely impacts pregnancy outcomes. Due to increased thrombotic risk, these patients require aggressive cardiovascular risk factor control. Primary prophylaxis is based on low-dose aspirin in high-risk patients. Warfarin is the gold-standard drug for secondary prophylaxis.

### Clinical lesson to not overlook venous thrombosis: a case of primary antiphospholipid syndrome [^114pBdCJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his early 30s presented to us with progressive shortness of breath limiting activities of daily living. An important clue in history was the episode of a deep vein thrombosis 5years ago treated with short-term anticoagulation. His echocardiography revealed elevated estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. A CT pulmonary angiography confirmed chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Blood investigations established primary antiphospholipid syndrome. He underwent pulmonary endarterectomy, relieving his symptoms and was started on indefinite oral anticoagulation with warfarin. He is currently under follow-up with no recurrence of thrombosis. We wish to highlight the importance of an appropriate workup of venous thrombosis in all patients. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare disease with important implications in the management of patients with thromboses. The delay in his diagnosis had several causes including the unclear distinction between provoked and unprovoked thrombosis and socioeconomic factors in a developing nation limiting referral and testing.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus: is the whole greater than the sum of its parts? [^112sMd3Z]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article compares the manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the presence and absence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), the hallmark autoantibodies of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The combination of SLE and APS appears to be of greater concern than either entity alone. APS complicates SLE by adding a vaso-occlusive factor to the inflammatory component that adversely affects the prognosis of those who have lupus and aPLs. The increase in both morbidity and mortality when both are present has significant therapeutic implications. Anticoagulation may be a safer and more appropriate therapeutic option than instituting a regimen of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents with all their attendant adverse effects. It falls upon the physician to clearly define the disease entity and fully evaluate the disease process.

Discussion

PAH is a severe complication of SLE, which can lead to right ventricular dysfunction and, consequently, death. Several studies have suggested that PAH associated with SLE can be a heterogeneous entity with different possible causes (left heart disease, lung parenchyma disease, etc) and variable treatment response. Identifying risk factors can contribute to improving screening, early diagnosis and optimising treatment management. We showed that patients with SLE-PAH had a higher frequency of anti-RNP positivity, LAC positivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, mucocutaneous and neurological involvement than patients with SLE without PAH. An MCA analysis confirmed that patients with SLE with PAH had distinct clinical and laboratory features compared to patients with SLE without PAH. Analysis of NVC findings revealed a significantly higher prevalence of the SD pattern in patients with SLE-PAH with significantly reduced capillary density and increased frequency of giant capillaries. Logistic regression analysis identified Raynaud's phenomenon as an independent predictor of PAH in patients with SLE, with anti-RNP positivity showing a trend towards significance.

The pathogenesis of PAH is characterised by the involvement of multiple pathways, including an imbalance between mediators promoting vasodilation and vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation, and pulmonary vascular remodelling, resulting in increased pulmonary resistances. Our capillaroscopy results suggest the presence of a peripheral microangiopathy observed at the nailfold bed of patients with SLE-PAH, which may parallel the microangiopathy occurring in the pulmonary vascular bed in PAH. Further confirming the role of systemic microcirculatory reactivity in the development of PAH, we established that the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon was a predictor of PAH in patients with SLE. The role of pulmonary bed vasospasm in raising the pressure in the pulmonary bed has been proposed in SSc. However, more than a causative association between Raynaud's phenomenon and increased pulmonary arterial pressures, the two may both represent a common endothelial dysfunction, explaining the predictive value of Raynaud's phenomenon for PAH in SLE.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: identification of risk factors and haemodynamics characteristics in a multicentre retrospective cohort [^11799p29]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Anti-RNP antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with an increased risk of PAH among patients with SLE. Several autoantibodies may cause endothelial damage, vasoconstriction, immune complex formation, and may deposit on the pulmonary arterial wall. In a study on individuals of Asian origin, anti-RNP and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were independent predictors of PAH in patients with SLE, with ORs of 5.3 and 3.7, respectively. A systematic literature review conducted on Asian cohorts reported a higher frequency of anti-RNP antibodies (51.5%) and anti-cardiolipin antibodies (46.6%) in patients with SLE-PAH. While some studies have found a higher prevalence of anti-RNP antibodies among patients with SLE and PAH, others have not confirmed this data. In our study, a trend towards a higher frequency of anti-RNP antibodies and LAC (but not anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies) was observed in patients with PAH.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are classically associated with APS and a higher risk of arterial or venous thrombosis and recurrent miscarriages. Cefle et al found a higher frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies among patients with suspected echocardiographic diagnosis of PAH compared with those without signs of PAH. However, other studies failed to confirm this association.

Multiple molecular pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of PAH in SLE, including: endothelial activation, inflammation and autoantibodies. It is not yet clear the contribution of each single pathway in different patients. The main implication of this hypothesis is that multimodal treatment strategies, employing both immunomodulators and pulmonary vasodilators to act on multiple converging pathophysiological pathways, would be more advantageous in PAH treatment in the context of SLE. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated the positive effect of CYC therapy on haemodynamic parameters and WHO functional class in patients with SLE and PAH. In CYC-responsive patients factors associated with a good response were the presence of a less severe form of PAH at diagnosis from both a clinical and haemodynamical standpoint. This data would indicate that in the early stages of PAH, there may be greater responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and the need to develop screening tools for PAH in patients with SLE. However, it is also interesting to observe that the previous use of CYC did not prevent the occurrence of PAH in some of our patients.

### First nomogram for predicting interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension in SLE: a machine learning approach [^114C19z8]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

ILD and PAH represent life-threatening complications of SLE, underscoring the critical need for early detection and intervention to mitigate mortality. To address this, we developed and validated a clinical prediction model — the first of its kind — to estimate the absolute risk of ILD-PAH in SLE patients using a large, representative cohort. Our nomogram integrates routinely assessed clinical parameters, ensuring practical applicability in real-world settings. The model demonstrated strong discriminative ability, appropriate calibration, and clinical utility across a range of probability thresholds, as evidenced by decision curve analysis. This tool enables clinicians worldwide to identify high-risk SLE patients who may benefit from intensified monitoring or early therapeutic intervention.

Our analysis identified five robust predictors of ILD-PAH in SLE, aligning with and expanding upon prior research. While previous studies have reported associations between autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA, anti-RNP) and pulmonary involvement in SLE, findings have been inconsistent regarding specific manifestations (ILD vs. PAH). The inclusion of anti-dsDNA positivity as a protective factor (with an inverse association with ILD-PAH) in our study is intriguing, as it contrasts with prior studies. To explore possible immunological explanations, we considered several possibilities. First, anti-dsDNA antibodies may compete with other autoantibodies for antigen binding sites under certain physiological conditions. This competition could be influenced by the structural characteristics or specificity of the antigens involved. Alternatively, anti-dsDNA antibodies might mark a distinct SLE endotype with unique organ tropism. Finally, it is also possible that this association reflects treatment effects. For example, patients with anti-dsDNA positivity may receive more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, which could impact the observed outcomes. Further investigation is needed to clarify these potential mechanisms.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy [^111isRpC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is frequently associated with complications during pregnancy. Miscarriage and maternal thrombosis are the most common problems, but prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, and pulmonary hypertension can complicate pregnancy as well. The correct treatment of these women requires an accurate preconceptual counseling and a close collaboration between obstetricians and physicians. Doppler studies of the umbilical and uterine arteries play an important role in predicting APS-related complications during pregnancy.

Factors related to the development of damage

Logistic regression analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess associations between individual variables and development of damage (Table 2). The univariate analysis showed longer disease duration; additionally, antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) positivity, infections requiring hospitalization (ever), the presence of hypertension (ever), and the presence of nephrotic syndrome (ever) were associated with the presence of damage. Neither sex nor ethnicity showed a significant association with the presence of damage. Current HCQ monotherapy was associated with the absence of damage. In the multivariate analysis, disease duration (OR 1.147 [95% CI 1.077–1.227], P < 0.001), hypertension (OR 3.214 [95% CI 1.040–9.932], P = 0.043), and aPL positivity (OR 3.559 [95% CI 1.161–10.908], P = 0.026) were significantly associated with presence of damage, and current HCQ monotherapy (OR 0.162 [95% CI 0.042–0.633], P = 0.009) was again associated with the absence of damage. No differences in number or type of organ systems involved or in antiinflammatory medication use were found between patients currently receiving HCQ monotherapy and other patients.

### Anticardiolipin and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I antibodies and lupus-like anticoagulant: prevalence and significance in systemic sclerosis [^115pL7ME]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that both anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-beta(2) glycoprotein I (abeta(2)GPI) antibodies may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related vascular impairment.

Objectives

To evaluate the prevalence of aCL and abeta(2)GPI antibodies and lupus-like anticoagulant (LAC) in patients with SSc and healthy controls. We also investigated a possible relationship between clinical and biological variables of patients with SSc and the presence of aCL/abeta(2)GPI antibodies and/or LAC.

Methods

Measurements of aCL and abeta(2)GPI antibodies, and LAC were performed in 69 consecutive patients with SSc and 69 age- and sex-matched controls. Clinical and biological findings were compared between patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies.

Results

aCL and abeta(2)GPI antibodies and/or LAC were detected in 13 (19%) of 69 consecutive patients with SSc; in the healthy control group, aCL antibody was found in only one (2%) subject (P = 0.0007). None of the healthy controls had abeta(2)GPI antibody and/or LAC. Moreover, pitting scars, pulmonary arterial hypertension, macrovascular involvement as well as severity of capillary impairment (using nailfold videocapillaroscopy) were more frequent in SSc patients with aCL/abeta(2)GPI antibodies and/or LAC compared with those without.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that antiphospholipid antibodies may have a role in the genesis of vascular involvement related to SSc. Finally, the assessment of antiphospholipid antibodies (aCL and abeta(2)GPI antibodies, as well as LAC) may contribute to a better recognition of clinical features in patients with SSc; in essence, the patients with aCL/abeta(2)GPI antibodies and/or LAC may require close monitoring of vascular changes, including in particular pulmonary arterial hypertension and digital infarcts.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease: a case report [^111RUVPz]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by the production of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with recurrent vascular thrombosis. There have been few reports of combination of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and coronary artery disease in APS, therefore, it is unclear about appropriate treatment strategy.

Case Presentation

The patient was a 39year-old-lady who had been suffering from hypoxia without chest pain. Transthoracic echocardiography showed severe pulmonary hypertension and mild hypokinesis of left ventricular anteroseptal wall. Simultaneously with the diagnosis of CTEPH, coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. She underwent pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) successfully. CABG could be performed concomitantly during rewarming. During perioperative period, she was free from any thromboembolic and bleeding events despite receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies.

Conclusions

PEA concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting was feasible for APS patients complicated with CTEPH and coronary artery disease. APS patients with the presence of left ventricular dysfunction should be evaluated for coronary artery disease.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a rare coagulative disorder with antiphospholipid antibody mediated pro-thrombotic state mainly characterised by hypercoagulable complications. Cardiac manifestations of APS include arterial or venous thromboses, valve diseases, coronary artery disease, intracardiac thrombus, pulmonary hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy, with the functional impairment of heart valves being the most common manifestation, which commonly associated with Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also known as non-bacterial thrombotic, verrucous, or marantic endocarditis, originally described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, is a well-known complication of APS. We present a successful aortic valve replacement in a 48 years old lady with aortic valve Libman-sacks endocarditis and APS who presented with acute pulmonary oedema.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: pulmonary hypertension phenotypes [^117A1vML]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Connective tissue disease–associated pulmonary hypertension (PH) shows variable prevalence and adverse outcomes; PH can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (prevalence, 0.5–14%), mixed connective tissue disease (prevalence, ~0.5%), and systemic sclerosis (SSc; prevalence, 8–12%), and in SSc it worsens survival and, after interstitial lung disease, is the leading cause of mortality in SSc. Patients with SSc–pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are predominantly women, and patients with isolated PAH often develop PH after a duration of 10–15 years. Median survival is less than 4 years for patients with SSc–PAH; patients with SSc with interstitial lung disease alone have a median survival of 5–8 years, whereas those with interstitial lung disease and PH have 1-, 2-, and 3-yr survival of 82, 46, and 39%, respectively.

### Cardiac manifestations in the antiphospholipid syndrome [^115jnntp]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Experimental evidence reveals that aPL are not only markers of APS, but also may play a causative role in the development of vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. The pathogenic mechanisms of aPL seem to be heterogeneous, including endothelial cell activation, the direct inhibition of the activated protein C pathway, abnormalities in platelet function, and in complement activation. aPLs induce proadhesive, proinflammatory, and procoagulant molecules that provide a persuasive explanation for induction of thrombosis in APS. Cardiac manifestations in APS include valve abnormalities (valve thickening and vegetations), occlusive arterial disease (atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction), intracardiac emboli, ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension. aPL may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis in APS patients. Valve disease is the most important and most common cardiac manifestation of APS. The precise mechanism by which valves become deformed is not yet fully known.

Predictors of PAH in patients with SLE

We assessed if patients with SLE-PAH showed significant clinical differences from patients with SLE without PAH. To this end, we performed an MCA (online supplemental table 4). The aim of this analysis was to reduce the dimensionality of the complex data to a few variables without losing information. The first four dimensions of MCA explained 49.2% of the total variance. The first dimension accounted for 17.0% of variance, and it was mostly driven by the antiphospholipid autoantibodies profile and presence of APS; the second dimension accounted for 13.2% of the variance and it was mostly driven by presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-RNP autoantibody positivity and presence of haematological and serosal manifestations. Patients with SLE-PAH distributed differently from patients with SLE without PAH along the first two dimensions of MCA (figure 2A). Values of both first and second dimensions were significantly higher in patients with PAH than in patients without PAH (figure 2B). Thus, the MCA analysis showed that patients with SLE with PAH presented with different clinical and immunological features from patients with SLE without PAH.

### Pulmonary hypertension, antiphospholipid antibodies, and syndromes [^113UxPsY]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibodies have been associated with two types of pulmonary hypertension (PHT), the thromboembolic type, after deep venous thromboses in the lower limbs complicated by pulmonary embolism and the "primary" plexogenic type. The PHT may occur in the absence of any other manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), and cases have been recorded with very high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies. It may also accompany systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and may manifest with or without other features of the APS. It may also form part of the clinical presentation of a "primary" APS. Its prevalence is of the order of 1.8–3.5% of the manifestations of the APS depending on the series. Primary "idiopathic" PHT has long been regarded as an "immunological" disorder. Its manifestations are essentially to the primary type seen with the connective tissue disorders such as SLE, APS, mixed connective tissue disease, calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia variety of systemic sclerosis and Sjögren's syndrome. The high prevalence of PHT in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection who demonstrate low CD4 counts points to a close relationship between the T regulatory cells (Treg) and the development of PHT, and this hypothesis is discussed in this review. Genetic and chromosomal aspects of PHT are also discussed.

Abstract

Objectives

The aim of our work was to identify specific patterns in clinical features and nailfold capillary changes that may help in screening for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

We identified patients with SLE and type I PAH (n = 20) without other connective tissue diseases and collected demographic, clinical and laboratory features. We selected as controls patients with SLE who underwent cardiopulmonary screening to exclude PAH (n = 87): we collected demographic, clinical and laboratory features and performed nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC).

Results

All patients with SLE-PAH were women; age and disease duration were not different from patients with SLE without PAH. Lupus anticoagulant (LAC)+and anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP)+were more prevalent in patients with SLE-PAH (respectively, PAH 45.0% vs no-PAH 20.5%, p = 0.042; PAH 45.0% vs no-PAH 19.5%, p = 0.035). No differences were observed for anti-Sm, anti-Ro, anti-La and anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2GPI antibodies. Among clinical features, mucocutaneous and central nervous system involvement were more prevalent in patients with SLE-PAH than in SLE controls (respectively, PAH 65.0% vs no-PAH 34.5%, p = 0.024; PAH 25.0% vs no-PAH 8.0%, p = 0.046). Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) was more prevalent in patients with SLE-PAH than in SLE controls (PAH 60.0% vs no-PAH 13.8%, p < 0.001). RP was a predictor of PAH in patients with SLE (OR 3.8 (0.9–14.8)). We performed NVC on nine patients with PAH and on controls: we observed a significantly higher prevalence of scleroderma pattern at NVC in SLE-PAH than controls (PAH 66.7% vs no-PAH 9.2%, p < 0.001). Patients with SLE-PAH showed a lower number of capillary density and a higher frequency of giant capillaries.

Conclusions

Our data showed that LAC+, RNP+, RP and a scleroderma pattern at NVC was indicative for patients with SLE-PAH. Our results pointed to generalised microvascular involvement and a hypercoagulation state in patients with SLE-PAH. The variables we identified could be used to implement a screening algorithm to identify patients with SLE at risk of developing PAH.

### Predictive value of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance ratio in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113hygAR]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe and often fatal complication associated with connective tissue disorder. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common cause of PAH in Western countries and has become the leading cause. Compared with the 5-year survival rate of 92–96% of SLE patients without PAH, the clinical outcome of SLE patients with PAH is dramatically worse, as evidenced by reduced 3- and 5-year survival rates of 81% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67–0.90] and 68% (95% CI 27 0.52–0.80), respectively, according to a comprehensive meta-analytic review.

SLE-associated PAH is characterized by marked pulmonary vascular remodeling proximal to the lung capillary bed due to the genetic background, pulmonary vasculitis, autoantibody-mediated immune response, and immune complex deposition in the walls of pulmonary vessels. As the disease progresses, systemic hypotension becomes more common in these patients at follow-up, which limits the application of targeted therapy and manifests as different reactions to vasoactive agents. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the opposite changes in pulmonary and systemic arterial pressures, such as the interdependent relationship between the left and right circulation, interventricular cross-talk and systemic inflammation. The ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance (Rp: Rs) is one of the calculated parameters that reflects the interaction and coupling between the right and left circulation and has been suggested as a useful marker for assessing the operability of patients with congenital cardiac diseases associated with PAH.

Current guidelines recommend that patients with PAH should aim to achieve and/or maintain a low-risk status with optimized medical therapy as a treatment goal. At follow-up, the 2022 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) four-strata model based on three noninvasive parameters and the simplified risk stratification tool proposed at the 6th Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension are recommended to assess the risk status, while neither of them include systemic parameters. Thus, in this study, we investigated whether the indicator Rp: Rs, reflecting the relationship between systemic and pulmonary circulation, could provide prognostic insights into SLE-associated PAH.

### Evaluation and management of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension-consensus statement from the ISHLT [^116DHDtr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) — maintaining a high index of suspicion is essential in patients with risk factors in the context of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients with a new diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in patients with unexplained dyspnea. Risk factors include CT findings suggestive of CTEPH, evidence of PH on echocardiogram, large clot burden, recurrent or unprovoked PE, history of splenectomy, infected pacemaker leads, chronic inflammatory disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, hypothyroidism, ventriculo-atrial shunt, and persistent symptoms despite anticoagulation. There is no indication to administer thrombolytic therapy to prevent CTEPH, and if CTEPH is suspected, screening investigations should be performed after 3 months of anticoagulation with echocardiogram and VQ scan, with earlier assessment if worrisome signs or symptoms of heart failure are present.

### Comprehensive risk assessment for pulmonary manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus: a large-scale Korean population-based longitudinal study [^116uox3D]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The findings of our study have significant clinical and research implications. Clinically, the identification of a higher risk of pulmonary manifestations in SLE patients underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and early intervention strategies to manage and mitigate these risks. The particularly high risks of ILD and pulmonary hypertension suggest that these conditions should be prioritised in routine screenings and follow-up care for SLE patients. From a research perspective, our study highlights the importance of considering confounding factors such as smoking status, BMI and comorbidities in future investigations. Notably, our study is the first to involve a non-white population, providing valuable insights into the risk of pulmonary manifestations in a different cohort. The use of a large, population-based dataset with comprehensive adjustments for these variables provides a more accurate assessment of the true burden of pulmonary manifestations in SLE. Additionally, our findings call for further research into the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to pulmonary manifestations in SLE patients and the development of targeted therapies to address these specific risks. Overall, our study contributes valuable insights that can inform both clinical practice and future research endeavours in the field of SLE and pulmonary health.

Our study has several limitations. First, the diagnoses of SLE, pulmonary manifestations and other comorbidities were based on ICD-10 codes, which may lead to overestimation or underestimation. To mitigate this issue, we adopted a conservative approach by using both ICD-10 codes and the RID programme registration code for SLE. Second, the absence of serological and radiologic data prevented us from including these factors in our analyses, highlighting the need for future studies to incorporate such data. Thus, we could not incorporate some important factors into our analyses. For example, we did not have information on the presence of autoantibodies, and thus, the impact of disease overlap (eg, coexisting Sjögren's disease) and antiphospholipid syndrome. In particular, antiphospholipid syndrome has been suggested to be important in the development of severe pulmonary manifestations such as ARDS, intra-alveolar haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension. Third, this study was conducted using a Korean dataset, and therefore, additional studies in other countries or among different ethnicities are necessary to generalise our findings.

In conclusion, the risk of pulmonary manifestation was approximately 3.3-fold higher in subjects with SLE compared with matched control cohort. In particular, the risks of ILD and pulmonary hypertension were relatively high compared with other pulmonary manifestations.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^113zZnjs]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) suspicion criteria — CTEPH evaluation should be considered when computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for pulmonary embolism shows suggestive signs and/or if estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure is > 60 mmHg on echocardiogram; it should also be considered when dyspnoea or functional limitations persist post‑PE and in asymptomatic patients with risk factors or a high CTEPH prediction score. Risk factors named include permanent intravascular devices, inflammatory bowel diseases, essential thrombocythaemia, polycythaemia vera, splenectomy, antiphospholipid syndrome, high‑dose thyroid hormone replacement, and malignancy.

### Primary, secondary, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: is there a difference? [^114i5Ftt]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Following broad recognition of the disorder called Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), it has come to be subcategorized into Primary (PAPS), Secondary (SAPS), and Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS). Primary utilized when there is no associated disorder, secondary with an associated autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and "catastrophic" when thrombosis occurs at multiple sites in a short space of time. Are these entities different? Such differences should be demonstrated in terms of their clinical presentation, disease course, pathogenesis, or management. If no differences exist, is there a basis for continued use of these terms? This manuscript will attempt to explore distinctions between subgroups of the APS and reasons for or against perpetuation of these classifications in the literature.

### First nomogram for predicting interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension in SLE: a machine learning approach [^112LAnkT]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, our model incorporates SLEDAI scores, which reflect global disease activity and have been linked to pleuropulmonary complications in the RELESSER cohort. This aligns with reports that SLE-ILD patients exhibit higher frequencies of arthritis, serositis, and Raynaud's phenomenon, as well as thrombocytopenia, which may disrupt endothelial integrity. However, the relationship between organ involvement and ILD-PAH risk remains controversial. For instance, while renal disease was negatively associated with PAH in some cohorts, pericardial effusion and anti-RNP antibodies emerged as consistent risk factors. Our use of multivariable logistic regression model minimized selection bias, ensuring that only statistically and clinically relevant variables were retained.

Our study is the first to implicate CRP as a potential risk marker for SLE-PAH/ILD, a finding warranting further mechanistic investigation. Additionally, we observed demographic divergences: SLE-PAH patients tended to be younger, whereas SLE-ILD was associated with longer disease duration. Serositis, frequently reported in SLE-ILD and SLE-PAH, may reflect secondary pulmonary pathophysiology rather than primary SLE activity. These insights were synthesized from a systematic evaluation of candidate variables, addressing gaps in earlier studies that lacked multivariate adjustments or longitudinal designs. Their research pointed out average interval from SLE diagnosis to PAH diagnosis was 3.66 years and 70% of the patients developed PAH within 5 years after SLE onset. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of SLE patients following the diagnosis of PAH were 87.7%, 76.8%, and 70.1%. There were some differences contrasting to ours due to different population characteristics and comparative predictive performance, and we didn't focus on the clinical implications like prognosis. Besides, our results revealed pericarditis patients had higher rates of pleuritis (77.8% vs. 65%, a data not showed) in SLE-ILD-PAH patients, supporting pericarditis as a marker of generalized serosal involvement or a broader serositis burden. Given this, pericarditis might serve as a "red flag" for potential pulmonary complications in SLE patients, meriting closer monitoring.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy: a comprehensive literature review [^111JG5uF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy outcomes and clinical manifestations in APS

Pregnancy has been associated with an increased likelihood of progression from preclinical autoimmune conditions to fully developed autoimmune diseases in predisposed women.

Maternal outcomes in obstetric APS

Obstetrical antiphospholipid syndrome has several manifestations, both maternal and fetal. Maternal outcomes include abdominal pain, general malaise, and chest pain. Gestational hypertensive disease is another maternal outcome with associated risks including placental abruption, and proteinuria, but thrombosis, dyspnea, or pulmonary embolism may also occur.

Cutaneous diseases such as livedo racemosa are some atypical clinical manifestations of APS, Pulmonary injuries such as pulmonary arterial hypertension or alveolar hemorrhage, or even cardiac diseases like nonbacterial Libman-Sacks endocarditis, along with neurological manifestations such as altered mental status, migraine, seizure, or chorea can also occur. Regarding the liver, it may appear to be both a thrombotic and a nonthrombotic disease. From the thrombotic ones we mention Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and from the other category we remember cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and portal hypertension.

A study evaluating fetal thymus size in maternal autoimmune diseases explores its variations in systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome identified an association between maternal autoimmune inflammation and alterations in fetal immune organ development, particularly affecting thymic growth. This research found a significantly reduced fetal thymus-thoracic ratio (TTR) in pregnancies complicated by antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's syndrome relative to healthy pregnancies. The reduction in TTR observed in affected pregnancies suggests that inflammatory processes associated with these autoimmune conditions may impair fetal thymus development, potentially leading to compromised neonatal immune function. Furthermore, additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to explore the long-term impacts of reduced thymic growth on neonatal and pediatric immune outcomes in this patient population.

### Cardiac manifestations in antiphospholipid syndrome [^1163MFa2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease associated with arterial and venous thrombotic events and recurrent fetal loss. Cardiac manifestations in APS primarily include accelerated atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease. There is increased cardiovascular mortality in APS. Cardiovascular risk is even higher in secondary APS in lupus patients. Several traditional and disease-related, autoimmune-inflammatory risk factors are involved in APS-associated atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APA), lupus anticoagulant, anti-oxLDL and other antibodies have been implicated in vascular events underlying APS. The primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis and CAD in these diseases includes drug treatment, such as the use of statins and aspirin, as well as lifestyle modifications. Apart from atherosclerosis and CVD, other cardiac manifestations may also be present in these patients. Among these conditions, valvular disease including thickening and vegetations is the most common. APA are involved in the pathogenesis of Libman-Sacks endocarditis usually associated with SLE. In addition, ventricular dysfunction, intracardiac thrombi and myxomas, pulmonary hypertension may also exist in APS patients. Early diagnosis of APS, thorough examination of the heart, control of traditional risk factors by lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy, probably anti-inflammatory treatment, and close follow-up of APS patients may help to minimize cardiovascular risk in these individuals.

### Antiphospholipid syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus [^115m9tUs]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Renal biopsies occasionally show a combination of thrombotic microangiopathy as a result of antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus nephritis. The thrombosis in this case preceded the onset of lupus probably by approximately 8 yr, consisting of repeated fetal loss and venous thrombosis. More severe disease may have both arterial and venous thrombotic manifestations, including pulmonary emboli and cerebrovascular lesions. The antiphospholipid syndrome bears no relationship to the class of lupus nephritis but is accompanied by more frequent and greater hypertension and greater azotemia and interstitial fibrosis, and is associated with worse outcomes than lupus nephritis without antiphospholipid syndrome.

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with SLE without PAH (SLE no PAH) and with SLE and associated PAH (SLE PAH) at enrolment

Focusing on the comparison between groups, we observed a higher frequency of anti-RNP and LAC positivity in the SLE-PAH group; whereas, the frequency of patients positive for anti-Sm, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-cardiolipin IgG and IgM, and anti-beta2GPI IgG and IgM antibodies was similar between the two groups. The frequency of APS was similar between the two groups (SLE-PAH 27.8%, SLE without PAH 16%, p = 0.3). Of note, patients with SLE with PAH and with antiphospholipid antibodies had no signs of pulmonary thromboembolisms on imaging.

Baseline median (IQR) SLEDAI-2K score was 2 (0–2), with no differences between the two groups (SLE-PAH 2.00 (0.00–4.00), SLE without PAH 2.00 (0.00–2.00), p = 0.469). Regarding the ACR/EULAR classification criteria domains, mucocutaneous (p = 0.024) and central nervous system involvement (p = 0.046) was more prevalent among patients with SLE-PAH; frequency of arthritis (p = 0.96), serositis (p = 0.1) and renal involvement (p = 0.28) was not different (table 1). The frequency of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon was significantly higher among patients with SLE-PAH (p < 0.001). The use of various immunosuppressants was similar between the two groups of patients, except for CYC which was more frequently used in patients with SLE-PAH (table 1). Interestingly, of the 13 patients treated with CYC, five received treatment 6.9 (1.4–8.3) years before the diagnosis of PAH. For three patients, CYC was started at the time of PAH diagnosis. The remaining five patients received CYC 1.4 (1.3–2.9) years after the diagnosis of PAH. After excluding male patients from the SLE without PAH group, a comparison restricted to female patients yielded similar results (data not shown).

### Primary antiphospholipid syndrome: a distinct entity? [^117XhqCS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Although antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was first fully described in the context of connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it was soon recognised that the condition can exist on its own. APS appears to represent a clinical spectrum, both in terms of APS features and the presence of other autoimmune conditions. The clinical and serological characteristics of "primary" APS (PAPS) are similar to those of secondary APS, although the clinical features are more commonly recognised in the presence of another autoimmune or inflammatory condition. Furthermore, patients with PAPS may subsequently develop SLE. It is important to identify PAPS, since it is likely to be a contributing factor for a significant proportion of patients with a variety of vascular, neurological and other conditions. It may emerge as more common than secondary APS.
