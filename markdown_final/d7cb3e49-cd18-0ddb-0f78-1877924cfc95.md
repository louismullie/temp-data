Recommendations for managing Mono

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing infectious mononucleosis, including diagnosis, treatment, activity restrictions, and return-to-play guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify the cornerstone of management, which is supportive care. Next, I will examine the role of antivirals and corticosteroids and when, if ever, they are indicated. After that, I need to assess splenic risk and craft activity restrictions, including imaging decisions. Finally, I will outline a staged return-to-activity plan and special populations, and close with counseling points and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on symptoms alone, because IM can mimic streptococcal pharyngitis and other viral illnesses. The most efficient initial test in adolescents and young adults is a CBC with differential and a heterophile antibody test, where atypical lymphocytes greater than 10% and a positive heterophile substantially increase the likelihood of IM, though heterophile can be falsely negative early in illness, so if suspicion remains high, EBV-specific serology can be used to confirm, and I should remember that posterior cervical lymphadenopathy and palatal petechiae raise the pretest probability meaningfully [^9a7c471e] [^0cd73e54].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging in routine diagnosis. I initially thought ultrasound might help detect splenomegaly early, but hold on, I should correct that: routine splenic imaging is not recommended in uncomplicated IM because most patients have some splenic enlargement early on and there is no correlation between absolute spleen size and rupture risk, so imaging should be reserved for suspected splenic injury or when early return-to-play decisions require serial size assessment, not for routine diagnosis [^0d613129] [^a6622c41].

> Next, I should review the foundation of management, which is supportive care. I need to ensure I emphasize rest, hydration, and analgesics, and I should double-check that antipyretics like acetaminophen are preferred while avoiding aspirin in adolescents due to Reye syndrome risk, and I must counsel that most patients improve within 2 to 4 weeks, though fatigue can persist longer in a subset, which sets expectations appropriately [^110791e2] [^c38e57cb] [^9a7c471e].

> I will now examine antivirals, and I should confirm the strength of evidence. The Cochrane review shows no clinically meaningful benefit of acyclovir or valacyclovir for symptom duration or severity in IM, with only very low-quality evidence suggesting small, short-lived improvements that are not practice-changing, so routine antivirals are not recommended for uncomplicated IM, and I need to ensure I communicate this clearly to avoid unnecessary prescriptions [^bed0e1f4] [^6bcc446a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about corticosteroids either. I should confirm that steroids are not indicated for routine symptom control in uncomplicated IM, as Cochrane and sports medicine guidelines agree there is insufficient evidence for benefit and potential harm, but I need to remember the exceptions: steroids are appropriate for impending airway obstruction from tonsillar edema, severe hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, or myocarditis, where the anti-inflammatory effect can be lifesaving, so I should reserve them for these complications rather than use them broadly [^c02babbc] [^4de2672b] [^e2c732d4].

> Now, I need to assess splenic risk and activity restrictions carefully. Splenic rupture is rare but clinically significant, with most cases occurring within the first 2 to 3 weeks and a nontrivial proportion being atraumatic, so I should advise avoiding contact or high-exertion activities for at least 3 to 4 weeks from symptom onset in all patients, and I should explain warning signs such as sudden left upper quadrant or referred shoulder pain that warrant urgent evaluation [^1cf287ea] [^d801d567] [^bd50960c].

> But wait, what if the patient is an athlete eager to return earlier? I should double-check the staged approach. For afebrile patients with improving energy and examination, supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity can be trialed around 2 weeks, with gradual progression if tolerated, while contact or collision sports should remain off-limits until at least 3 to 4 weeks, and if early return to contact is contemplated, serial ultrasound can be considered to document that spleen size is decreasing or stable, recognizing that single measurements are unreliable due to normal variability and that imaging is not mandatory in routine care [^ec1d0096] [^10bfd31b] [^1cf287ea].

> I should confirm the imaging strategy when it is used. If there is concern for splenic injury or rupture, CT is the modality of choice for detailed assessment, whereas if the goal is to track spleen size for return-to-play decisions, serial ultrasound is reasonable because it avoids radiation and can demonstrate trends, though I must caution that there is no validated size threshold that predicts rupture risk, so clinical judgment remains paramount [^d10dd227] [^a6622c41] [^e1a4ca17].

> Let me consider special populations and complications. In children, airway obstruction from tonsillar hypertrophy is the most common reason for hospitalization, so I need to monitor for stridor and respiratory distress and escalate care promptly if obstruction is imminent, and in immunocompromised patients, IM can be severe or complicated, so I should maintain a lower threshold for imaging, laboratory monitoring, and specialist referral, and I should remember that ampicillin or amoxicillin can provoke a morbilliform rash in IM and should be avoided unless there is a compelling bacterial indication [^9754fc38] [^9a7c471e] [^247c128b].

> Next, I should review return-to-play documentation and shared decision-making. Clearance should be based on clinical status rather than imaging alone, and I need to ensure the athlete is afebrile, asymptomatic, well hydrated, and has adequate energy, with explicit counseling on the residual risk of splenic rupture that persists beyond 3 weeks albeit at diminishing frequency, and I should document the shared decision-making conversation if early return is pursued [^10bfd31b] [^d801d567].

> I will now examine patient education and follow-up. I should advise on hydration, rest, and symptom control, warn about the ampicillin rash, and provide anticipatory guidance on the typical 2 to 4 week recovery trajectory with possible prolonged fatigue, and I should arrange follow-up to reassess symptoms, complications, and readiness for activity escalation, reinforcing that most patients recover fully but a minority have persistent fatigue or rare complications that warrant further evaluation [^c38e57cb] [^9a7c471e].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: confirm IM with CBC and heterophile, reserving EBV-specific serology when needed; provide supportive care exclusively in uncomplicated cases; avoid antivirals; reserve corticosteroids for airway compromise, hemolysis, severe thrombocytopenia, or myocarditis; restrict contact activities for at least 3 to 4 weeks; allow supervised low-intensity, nonimpact activity around 2 weeks only if clinically ready; use CT for suspected injury and serial ultrasound selectively for early return-to-play decisions; and tailor decisions in children and immunocompromised patients with explicit counseling and documentation, which aligns with AMSSM, AAFP, and primary care guidance [^a5a3c834] [^48e7d6f9] [^9a7c471e].

For infectious mononucleosis, **supportive care is the cornerstone** [^110791e2] — rest, hydration, and acetaminophen or NSAIDs for fever and pain [^c38e57cb]. Avoid **contact sports for at least 3–4 weeks** [^1cf287ea] due to splenic rupture risk [^d801d567]; consider serial ultrasound if early return is planned [^1cf287ea]. Antivirals are not recommended for routine use [^6bcc446a] [^bed0e1f4], and corticosteroids are reserved for severe complications (e.g. airway obstruction, hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, myocarditis) [^4de2672b] [^c02babbc]. Most patients recover in 2–4 weeks [^c38e57cb], but fatigue may persist; advise gradual return to activity and monitor for complications [^10bfd31b].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

IM typically presents with **fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, and hepatosplenomegaly** [^9a7c471e]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by laboratory testing:

- **Heterophile antibody test (Monospot)**: Sensitivity ~87%, specificity ~91% [^9a7c471e]; false negatives early in illness [^9a7c471e].
- **EBV-specific serology**: More sensitive/specific but slower and more expensive [^9a7c471e].
- **CBC with differential**: Atypical lymphocytes (> 10%) support diagnosis [^0cd73e54].

---

## General supportive care

Supportive care is the **mainstay of treatment** for uncomplicated IM [^110791e2]:

- **Rest**: Encourage rest during the acute phase; gradual return to activity as symptoms improve [^c38e57cb].
- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake [^c38e57cb].
- **Analgesics/antipyretics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for fever and pain [^c38e57cb].
- **Avoidance of certain medications**: Do not use ampicillin/amoxicillin due to high risk of rash (~43–100%) [^247c128b].

---

## Activity restrictions and return-to-play guidelines

Splenomegaly and risk of **splenic rupture** necessitate activity restrictions:

- **Contact sports**: Avoid for at least 3–4 weeks from symptom onset [^1cf287ea] [^48e7d6f9].
- **Non-contact activities**: May resume after 2 weeks if afebrile, asymptomatic, and energy is adequate [^ec1d0096] [^10bfd31b].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; consider serial ultrasound if early return to contact sports is planned [^1cf287ea] [^0d613129].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

### Antiviral therapy

Routine antiviral therapy is **not recommended** [^6bcc446a]; acyclovir may modestly reduce viral shedding but does not significantly improve clinical outcomes [^bed0e1f4].

---

### Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are **not recommended for routine use** [^e2c732d4]; reserve for severe complications (e.g. impending airway obstruction, hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, myocarditis) [^4de2672b] [^c02babbc].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to track recovery and detect complications. Clinicians should monitor for **splenic rupture** (abdominal pain, shoulder pain, syncope) [^d801d567] and watch for **chronic fatigue**, which may persist in ~10% at 6 months [^bed0e1f4].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be educated about the **self-limited nature** of IM, expected recovery timeline, and activity restrictions [^c38e57cb]. Emphasize **hygiene** to reduce transmission (avoid sharing drinks, utensils, or personal items) [^c38e57cb].

---

## Complications and special considerations

- **Splenic rupture**: Rare (~0.1–0.5%) [^d801d567]; most cases occur within 2–3 weeks of symptom onset [^d801d567].
- **Airway obstruction**: More common in children; monitor closely [^9754fc38].
- **Chronic fatigue**: Persistent fatigue in ~10% at 6 months [^bed0e1f4].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of severe disease; monitor closely [^9a7c471e].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Supportive care | First-line for all patients [^110791e2] |
| Antivirals | Not recommended routinely [^6bcc446a] [^bed0e1f4] |
| Corticosteroids | Reserve for severe complications [^4de2672b] [^c02babbc] |
| Contact sports | Avoid for 3–4 weeks [^1cf287ea] [^48e7d6f9] |
| Non-contact activity | Resume after 2 weeks if asymptomatic [^ec1d0096] [^10bfd31b] |
| Imaging | Not routine; consider serial ultrasound if early return planned [^1cf287ea] [^0d613129] |

---

Management of infectious mononucleosis centers on **supportive care**, activity restriction to mitigate splenic risk, and selective use of corticosteroids for severe complications. Most patients recover fully within 2–4 weeks, but fatigue may persist and complications can occur, warranting careful follow-up and patient education [^c38e57cb].

### About infectious mononucleosis (mono) [^c38e57cb]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Infectious mononucleosis, also called "mono, " is a contagious disease.
- Most people with mono get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but some may feel fatigued for several more weeks.
- There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. Sign and symptoms Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:

- Extreme fatigue
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Headaches and body aches
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits
- Swollen liver or spleen or both
- Rash Enlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms. For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends. While most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, some may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for 6 months or longer. Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis.

You can help protect yourself by not kissing people who have infectious mononucleosis; or sharing drinks, food, or personal items with them. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose infectious mononucleosis based on symptoms. Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. However, specific tests may be needed for patients who do not have a typical case of infectious mononucleosis. The blood work of patients who have infectious mononucleosis due to EBV infection may show: Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever Do not take penicillin antibiotics If you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin.

Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis. Avoid contact sports Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.

Infectious mononucleosis — imaging and early activity guidance specifies that SOR Recommendation grade: B: If imaging is obtained to evaluate for spleen injury or rupture, computed tomography (CT) is recommended given the additional detail provided, and if imaging is intended for determining spleen size and/or early return to sport (RTS), serial ultrasound (US) imaging can be considered; CT is indicated when there is concern for splenic rupture or other splenic complication, and in the absence of a baseline spleen measurement, serial ultrasound examinations are recommended to aid in determining RTS. SOR Recommendation grade: B: It is reasonable to engage in a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity aerobic activities 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms for those athletes who are afebrile, have an adequate energy level, and have an improving clinical examination, whereas delaying RTS should be considered in the presence of ongoing clinical signs/symptoms, lack of athlete readiness, and/or IM-associated complications, and treatment must be individualized.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) noncontact activity and shared decision-making — early activity parameters: Previous guidance emphasized refraining from high-intensity activity for the first 3 weeks of illness and absence of splenomegaly, while acknowledging there are no well-designed large clinical trials (SOR Recommendation grade: C). Premature return earlier than 2 to 3 weeks to heavy exertion may prolong symptoms, yet there is support for considering low-level, supervised activity earlier than 3 weeks within an individualized plan. Resumption of light activity assumes avoidance of contact or abdominal trauma, no significant exertion or Valsalva, the athlete is asymptomatic, and progression of noncontact sport-specific activity should then be gradually increased as judged by clinical progress.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^68886cd1]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — return-to-sport (RTS) guidance in infectious mononucleosis (IM) athletes states that there exists no guidelines specific to RTS in IM for athletes for whom a laboratory abnormality was detected during the initial assessment, and that additional factors to consider into clearance decisions include the risk of contact and/or collision, the age of the athlete, timing within the athlete's season, and other athlete-specific factors. Given that the risk for splenic rupture peaks at 2 weeks after symptom onset, refraining from high exertional activities during that time and avoiding any contact activities for at least 3 weeks after symptom onset is recommended. If the athlete is clinically stable and wants to return to participation in contact before the 3 to 4 week from symptom onset timeframe, serial US measurements to document that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size may provide further information for the physician and athlete in understanding the risks associated with RTS. SOR Recommendation grade: C.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^d8c64996]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement — evaluation and management of infectious mononucleosis (IM) in athletes: Clinical evaluation for IM can be nonspecific with physical examination limitations and poor inter-rater reliability; laboratory confirmation of IM is useful (SOR A). Supportive care is the treatment for uncomplicated IM in athletes; the role of antivirals and corticosteroids in reducing time until symptom resolution remains unclear, while corticosteroids are indicated when IM is complicated by impending airway obstruction, hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, or myocarditis (SOR B). Imaging of the spleen is not necessary in routine management unless splenic injury and/or rupture is suspected; most if not all athletes have at least some degree of early splenic enlargement and there are no data that correlate spleen size to splenic rupture (SOR B). The use of measuring spleen size at a single time point has not been demonstrated due to wide variability of normal values and lack of a clear association between spleen size and complications (SOR B). If imaging is obtained to evaluate for splenic injury or rupture, computed tomography (CT) is recommended; if imaging is indicated for determining spleen size and/or early return to play (RTS), serial US imaging can be considered (SOR B).

### Antiviral agents for infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) [^bed0e1f4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome, usually caused by the Epstein Barr virus (EPV), characterised by lymphadenopathy, fever and sore throat. Most cases of symptomatic IM occur in older teenagers or young adults. Usually IM is a benign self-limiting illness and requires only symptomatic treatment. However, occasionally the disease course can be complicated or prolonged and lead to decreased productivity in terms of school or work. Antiviral medications have been used to treat IM, but the use of antivirals for IM is controversial. They may be effective by preventing viral replication which helps to keep the virus inactive. However, there are no guidelines for antivirals in IM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiviral therapy for infectious mononucleosis (IM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3, March 2016), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2016), Embase (1974 to 15 April 2016), CINAHL (1981 to 15 April 2016), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2016) and Web of Science (1955 to 15 April 2016). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antivirals versus placebo or no treatment in IM. We included trials of immunocompetent participants of any age or sex with clinical and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of IM, who had symptoms for up to 14 days. Our primary outcomes were time to clinical recovery and adverse events and side effects of medication. Secondary outcomes included duration of abnormal clinical examination, complications, viral shedding, health-related quality of life, days missing from school or work and economic outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the included studies' risk of bias and extracted data using a customised data extraction sheet. We used the GRADE criteria to rate the quality of the evidence. We pooled heterogeneous data where possible, and presented the results narratively where we could not statistically combine data.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with a total of 333 participants in our review. Three trials studied hospitalised patients, two trials were conducted in an outpatient setting, while the trial setting was unclear in two studies. Participants' ages ranged from two years to young adults. The type of antiviral, administration route, and treatment duration varied between the trials. The antivirals in the included studies were acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir. Follow-up varied from 20 days to six months. The diagnosis of IM was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters. The risk of bias for all included studies was either unclear or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for all outcomes and so the results should be interpreted with caution. There were statistically significant improvements in the treatment group for two of the 12 outcomes. These improvements may be of limited clinical significance. There was a mean reduction in 'time to clinical recovery as assessed by physician' of five days in the treatment group but with wide confidence intervals (CIs) (95% CI -8.04 to -1.08; two studies, 87 participants). Prospective studies indicate that clinical signs and symptoms may take one month or more to resolve and that fatigue may be persistent in approximately 10% of patients at six-month follow-up, so this may not be a clinically meaningful result. Trial results for the outcome 'adverse events and side effects of medication' were reported narratively in only five studies. In some reports authors were unsure whether an adverse event was related to medication or complication of disease. These results could not be pooled due to the potential for double counting results but overall, the majority of trials reporting this outcome did not find any significant difference between treatment and control groups. There was a mean reduction in 'duration of lymphadenopathy' of nine days (95% CI -11.75 to -6.14, two studies, 61 participants) in favour of the treatment group. In terms of viral shedding, the overall effect from six studies was that viral shedding was suppressed while on antiviral treatment, but this effect was not sustained when treatment stopped. For all other outcomes there was no statistically significant difference between antiviral treatment and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The effectiveness of antiviral agents (acyclovir, valomaciclovir and valacyclovir) in acute IM is uncertain. The quality of the evidence is very low. The majority of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias and so questions remain about the effectiveness of this intervention. Although two of the 12 outcomes have results that favour treatment over control, the quality of the evidence of these results is very low and may not be clinically meaningful. Alongside the lack of evidence of effectiveness, decision makers need to consider the potential adverse events and possible associated costs, and antiviral resistance. Further research in this area is warranted.

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^10bfd31b]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) position statement — return to play after infectious mononucleosis (IM): It is reasonable to engage in a trial of supervised, nonimpact, low-intensity activity 2 wk from the onset of symptoms for those athletes who are afebrile, have an adequate energy level, and have an improving clinical examination; conversely, delaying RTS should be considered when there are ongoing clinical signs/symptoms, lack of athletic readiness, and/or IM-associated complications, and treatment must therefore be individualized (SOR C). It appears that premature (earlier than 2 to 3 wk from symptom onset) return to activities may prolong recovery and prolong the duration of symptoms, most notably fatigue, and may be associated with deconditioning and/or a decrease in performance; there are some data, however, to suggest that early return to low-level exercise is beneficial, and given these uncertainties, a shared decision-making (SDM) model for return-to-sport decisions is recommended (SOR C). The time for safe return to contact play is unclear; given the risk for splenic rupture, a time frame of at least 3 to 4 wk from onset of symptoms is recommended, SDM should be used for individualized RTS decisions, and in situations where an athlete with acute IM is considering an early return to activity (before 3 to 4 wk from symptom onset for contact sport) serial ultrasound imaging could be considered to confirm that the spleen size is decreasing or stable in size (SOR C).

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^b6a22e6e]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Medical Society of Sports Medicine position statement — infectious mononucleosis (IM) in athletes — states that IM is caused primarily by the Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV), presents with fever, pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly, and can be confirmed by a positive heterophile antibody ("Monospot"), polymerase chain reaction, or antibodies specific to EBV. Individuals with acute IM may be quite asymptomatic and feel well enough to participate in sports, but splenic enlargement is common and rupture is a relatively rare occurrence typically occurring within a month of symptom onset, complicating sports participation and often prompting activity restriction; management is primarily supportive with no role for antivirals or corticosteroids, and variability in presentation with splenic rupture risk makes return to play/return to sport decisions challenging.

### Steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis [^c02babbc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or the kissing disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. It is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous herpes virus that is found in all human societies and cultures. Epidemiological studies show that over 95% of adults worldwide have been infected with EBV. Most cases of symptomatic infectious mononucleosis occur between the ages of 15 and 24 years. It is transmitted through close contact with an EBV shedder, contact with infected saliva or, less commonly, through sexual contact, blood transfusions or by sharing utensils; however, transmission actually occurs less than 10% of the time. Precautions are not needed to prevent transmission because of the high percentage of seropositivity for EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is self-limiting and typically lasts for two to three weeks. Nevertheless, symptoms can last for weeks and occasionally months. Symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly and fatigue. Symptom relief and rest are commonly recommended treatments. Steroids have been used for their anti-inflammatory effects, but there are no universal criteria for their use.

Objectives

The objectives of the review were to determine the efficacy and safety of steroid therapy versus placebo, usual care or different drug therapies for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis.

Search Methods

For this 2015 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2015) and EMBASE (January 1974 to August 2015). We also searched trials registries, however we did not identify any new relevant completed or ongoing trials for inclusion. We combined the MEDLINE search with the Cochrane search strategy for identifying randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We adapted the search terms when searching EMBASE.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the effectiveness of steroids with placebo, usual care, or other interventions for symptom control for people with documented infectious mononucleosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

For this 2015 update, we did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion. The previous version of the review included seven trials with a total of 362 participants. Four trials compared the effectiveness of a steroid to placebo for short-term symptom control in glandular fever, one to aspirin, and two trials explored the effects of steroids in conjunction with an antiviral. Heterogeneity between trials prevented a combined analysis. Trials under-reported methodological design features. Three trials did not adequately describe sequence generation for randomisation. Four trials provided adequate details of allocation concealment. All trials were double-blind but four were not specific as to who was blinded. Loss to follow-up was under-reported in four trials, making it difficult to exclude attrition bias. The risk of selective reporting in the included trials was unclear. Across the trials, no benefit was found in 8/10 assessments of health improvement. Two trials found benefit of steroid therapy over placebo in reducing sore throat at 12 hours (eight-day course odds ratio (OR) 21.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94 to 227.20; one-dose OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 16.32), but the benefit was not maintained. In combination with an antiviral drug, participants in the steroid group had less pharyngeal discomfort between days two to four (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) compared to placebo. Across the trials the effects on other common symptoms were less clear. Two trials set out to measure safety; they documented no major adverse effects. In two other trials adverse events were reported, including respiratory distress and acute onset of diabetes. However, the association of the events with the steroid is not definite.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to the efficacy of steroids for symptom control in infectious mononucleosis. There is a lack of research on the side effects and long-term complications.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infectious mononucleosis (IM) management — "Standard treatment of EBV infections include supportive measures", and because transmissibility "is low, so patient isolation is not necessary". "Aspirin should be avoided in adolescents", and individuals with IM "should be advised to avoid excessive alcohol and acetaminophen". Antiviral benefit is unproven: "A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials of acyclovir… failed to show a clinical benefit compared to placebo". Corticosteroids "may be clinically indicated" for severe complications, but a Cochrane Review found benefits only "for the first 12 hours", which were "lost at 2–4 days", concluding steroids "should be avoided"; furthermore, due to oncogenic concerns, steroids "should not be used in patients who have uncomplicated IM". For bacterial coinfection, "Antibiotics should be used if there is a concomitant streptococcal pharyngitis", but "ampicillin or amoxicillin should be avoided".

### Infectious mononucleosis: rapid evidence review [^9a7c471e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

### Splenic rupture in infectious mononucleosis: a systematic review of published case reports [^27f4c762]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common viral illness that predominantly causes sore throat, fever and cervical lymphadenopathy in adolescents and young adults. Although usually a benign, self-limiting disease, it is associated with a small risk of splenic rupture, which can be life-threatening. It is common practice therefore to advise avoiding vigorous physical activity for at least 4–6 weeks, however this is not based on controlled trials or national guidelines. We reviewed published case reports of splenic rupture occurring in the context of IM in an attempt to ascertain common factors that may predict who is at risk.

Method

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed for case reports or series published between 1984 and 2014. In total, 52 articles or abstracts reported 85 cases. Data was extracted and compiled into a Microsoft Excel(®) spreadsheet.

Results

The average patient age was 22 years, the majority (70%) being male. The average time between onset of IM symptoms and splenic rupture was 14 days, with a range up to 8 weeks. There was a preceding history of trauma reported in only 14%. Abdominal pain was the commonest presenting complaint of splenic rupture, being present in 88%. 32% were successfully managed non-operatively, whereas 67% underwent splenectomy. Overall mortality was 9%.

Conclusions and Recommendations

From our data, it appears that men under 30 within 4 weeks of symptom onset are at highest risk of splenic rupture, therefore particular vigilance in this group is required. As cases have occurred up to 8 weeks after the onset of illness, we would recommend avoidance of sports, heavy lifting and vigorous activity for 8 weeks. Should the patient wish to return to high risk activities prior to this, an USS should be performed to ensure resolution of splenomegaly. The majority of cases reviewed had no preceding trauma, although previous studies have suggested this may be so minor as to go unnoticed by the patient. It is therefore prudent to warn patients about the symptoms of splenic rupture to ensure prompt presentation and minimise treatment delay rather than focusing purely on activity limitation.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) splenomegaly assessment and RTP decision-making — Physical examination is unreliable and advanced imaging lacks normal-reference data; given variable spleen size, imaging for RTP should be used as individually indicated with consideration of serial studies, yet without baseline and serial examinations determining when the spleen has stopped enlarging and is decreasing back to normal cannot be accurately made; for athletes with laboratory abnormalities there are no IM-specific return-to-play guidelines, so clinical judgment and resolution of the individual complication dictate resumption, and most RTP decisions must be based on clinical and functional measures and usually will not involve imaging.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) research priorities in athletes — IM commonly affects young athletes with varied presentations and early features of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy, and the article identifies needs for studies on oral steroids, antiviral therapies, or vaccines; because splenic rupture is extremely rare and risk studies across splenomegaly degrees and return-to-activity timetables are not feasible, the authors propose defining the natural history of splenic size with baseline and follow-up measurements, correlating with symptoms, examination, and laboratory findings, and exploring the role of exercise, noting that many athletes participate without complication and better natural-history data may prevent unnecessary activity restrictions.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) diagnosis — History alone can raise concern for IM, and clinicians are recommended to maintain a level of suspicion based on overall presentation; a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that signs and symptoms lack sensitivity, although splenomegaly, palatal petechiae, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy increased the likelihood; hematologic findings were more accurate and serologic testing is indicated; typical illness may include fever that can rarely exceed > 40°C or > 104°F and last up to 3 weeks; in a systematic review, lack of sore throat (sensitivity 0.81; Likelihood Ratio range 0.51–0.62) or lack of headache (sensitivity 0.66; LR range 0.63–0.73) reduced the likelihood of IM.

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults [^d79652c2]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Splenomegaly can be due to several mechanisms but is almost always a sign of a systemic condition. Patient habits, travel, and medical conditions can increase risk of splenomegaly and suggest etiology. Symptoms can suggest infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic causes. Physical examination will typically reveal splenomegaly, but abdominal ultrasonography is recommended for confirmation. Physical examination should also assess for signs of systemic illness, liver disease, and anemia or other hematologic issues. The most common causes of splenomegaly in the United States are liver disease, malignancy, and infection. Except for apparent causes such as infectious mononucleosis, basic laboratory analysis and ultrasonography are the first-line steps in determining etiology. Malaria and schistosomiasis are common in tropical regions, where as many as 80% of people may have splenomegaly. Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Splenectomies and spleen reduction therapies are sometimes performed. Any patient with limited splenic function requires increased vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics for procedures involving the respiratory tract. Acute infections, anemia, and splenic rupture are the most common complications of splenomegaly, and people with splenomegaly should refrain from participating in contact sports to decrease risk of rupture.

### Does this patient have infectious mononucleosis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^0cd73e54]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Early, accurate diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis can help clinicians target treatment, avoid antibiotics, and provide an accurate prognosis.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding the value of the clinical examination and white blood cell count for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Data Sources

The databases of PubMed (from 1966–2016) and EMBASE (from 1947–2015) were searched and a total of 670 articles and abstracts were reviewed for eligibility.

Study Selection

Eleven studies were included that reported data sufficient to calculate sensitivity, specificity, or both for clinical examination findings and white blood cell count parameters compared with a valid reference standard.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were abstracted from each article by at least 2 reviewers, with discrepancies reconciled by consensus. Clinical findings evaluated in only 1 study are reported with sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and 95% confidence interval, which were calculated from the available data. Findings evaluated in only 2 studies were summarized with their range, findings evaluated in 3 studies were summarized with a univariate random-effects summary, and findings evaluated in 4 or more studies were summarized with a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and LRs for the diagnosis of mononucleosis.

Results

Mononucleosis is most commonly present among patients aged 5 to 25 years (especially those aged 16–20 years, among whom approximately 1 in 13 patients presenting with sore throat has mononucleosis). The likelihood of mononucleosis is reduced with the absence of any lymphadenopathy (summary sensitivity, 0.91; positive LR range, 0.23–0.44), whereas the likelihood increases with the presence of posterior cervical adenopathy (summary specificity, 0.87; positive LR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]), inguinal or axillary adenopathy (specificity range, 0.82–0.91; positive LR range, 3.0–3.1), palatine petechiae (specificity, 0.95; positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 2.1–13]), and splenomegaly (specificity range, 0.71–0.99; positive LR range, 1.9–6.6). Symptoms are of limited value for the diagnosis of mononucleosis; sore throat and fatigue are sensitive (range, 0.81–0.83) but nonspecific. The presence of atypical lymphocytosis significantly increases the likelihood of mononucleosis (summary LR, 11.4 [95% CI, 2.7–35] for atypical lymphocytes ≥ 10%, 26 [95% CI, 9.6–68] for those with 20%, and 50 [95% CI, 38–64] for those with 40%). The combination of a patient having greater than 50% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes also is useful (specificity, 0.99; positive LR, 54 [95% CI, 8.4–189]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adolescent and adult patients presenting with sore throat, the presence of posterior cervical, inguinal or axillary adenopathy, palatine petechiae, splenomegaly, or atypical lymphocytosis is associated with an increased likelihood of mononucleosis.

### Common questions about infectious mononucleosis [^9754fc38]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr is a ubiquitous virus that infects 95% of the world population at some point in life. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are often asymptomatic, some patients present with the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The syndrome most commonly occurs between 15 and 24 years of age. It should be suspected in patients presenting with sore throat, fever, tonsillar enlargement, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal inflammation, and palatal petechiae. A heterophile antibody test is the best initial test for diagnosis of EBV infection, with 71% to 90% accuracy for diagnosing IM. However, the test has a 25% false-negative rate in the first week of illness. IM is unlikely if the lymphocyte count is less than 4,000 mm3. The presence of EBV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies confirms infection, but the test is more costly and results take longer than the heterophile antibody test. Symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoids and antivirals do not reduce the length or severity of illness. Splenic rupture is an uncommon complication of IM. Because physical activity within the first three weeks of illness may increase the risk of splenic rupture, athletic participation is not recommended during this time. Children are at the highest risk of airway obstruction, which is the most common cause of hospitalization from IM. Patients with immunosuppression are more likely to have fulminant EBV infection.

### A quantitative study of the decision threshold for the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis [^c44c42fa]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ordering a serologic test for infectious mononucleosis (IM) in all young patients with sore throat is costly and impractical. The test threshold to determine when to order a diagnostic test for IM based on the patient's symptoms has not been previously studied.

Objective

To determine the test threshold for IM in the management of patients with sore throat.

Design and Setting

Online surveys were sent to a convenience sample of US primary care clinicians regarding their decision making about whether or not to order a test for IM in a patient with sore throat.

Method

7 clinical vignettes were created, each with a different combinations of symptoms and signs. The probability of IM for each vignette was estimated by the investigator based on the number of symptoms present to generate a plausible range of disease probabilities. Clinicians were then asked to decide whether to test or not test for IM, and mixed-effect logistic regression was used to determine the test threshold for IM where half of physicians chose to test and half chose not to test.

Results

A total of 117 clinicians provided responses for a total of 819 clinical vignettes. The overall test threshold for IM as estimated using the logistic regression was 9.5% (95% CI: 8.2% to 10.9%). The test threshold for clinicians practicing greater than 10years was significantly higher than for those practicing less or equal to 10years (10.5% vs 7.3%, P = 0.02). No significant differences between specialties and practice sites were found with respect to the test threshold.

Conclusion

This study identified a test threshold for IM of approximately 10% based on realistic clinical vignettes. This threshold was stable regarding the clinician's specialty and practice sites and could be used in the development of a clinical prediction rule to determine the cutoff for low- versus high-risk groups.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^71f436ca]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infection in the patient on immunosuppressive therapy — management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on holding therapy during acute infectious mononucleosis with close monitoring and serologies. Once acute infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed, one strategy is to hold immunosuppressive therapy and follow for cytopenia and hyperferritinemia at least weekly, and physicians may choose to check antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to VCA typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, IgG to VCA develops in the first few weeks and persists for life, and IgG to EBNA develops within 2 to 4 months and also persists for life; ideally, immunosuppression should be held until IgG VCA/EBNA is positive and the IgM to VCA is undetectable. Patients who develop cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia should be referred immediately for hospitalization and urgent evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with present strategies including plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, etoposide, or calcineurin inhibitors; alternatively, if clinically recovered and IBD symptoms recur, EBV polymerase chain reaction can be checked and, if the copy number is low, it is reasonable to resume IBD therapy.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) splenic enlargement — natural history and serial ultrasound findings show that patients diagnosed with IM demonstrate splenic enlargement beginning within a few days after symptom onset, with rapid early enlargement that peaks 1 to 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. In hospitalized IM patients, ultrasound found most (16 of 19 subjects) within the normal range (defined as measuring less than 12 cm in length, 7 cm wide and 4 cm deep) 4 weeks after diagnosis, though 16% (3 of 19 subjects) were not; these 3 patients were reimaged at 8 weeks and were subsequently in the normal range. In collegiate athletes, all IM cases had splenic enlargement with maximum splenic length increasing by a mean of 33.6% from baseline values (range 3.9% to 95.8%), peak enlargement at a mean of 12.3 days (range 6–23 days) after symptom onset, a decrease in spleen size of approximately 1% per day after peak, and resolution of splenomegaly by 4 to 6 weeks in all but 1. SOR Recommendation grade: B: The use of measuring splenic size at a single time point has not been demonstrated because of the wide variability of normal values and lack of clear association between splenic size and associated complications.

### About infectious mononucleosis (mono) | EBV and mono… [^5c28c368]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Infectious mononucleosis, also called "mono, " is a contagious disease.
- Most people with mono get better in 2 to 4 weeks, but some may feel fatigued for several more weeks.
- There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis. Sign and symptoms Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis include:

- Extreme fatigue
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Headaches and body aches
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits
- Swollen liver or spleen or both
- Rash Enlarged spleen and a swollen liver are less common symptoms. For some people, their liver or spleen or both may remain enlarged even after their fatigue ends. While most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks, some may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can last for 6 months or longer. Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against infectious mononucleosis.

You can help protect yourself by not kissing people who have infectious mononucleosis; or sharing drinks, food, or personal items with them. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose infectious mononucleosis based on symptoms. Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose infectious mononucleosis. However, specific tests may be needed for patients who do not have a typical case of infectious mononucleosis. The blood work of patients who have infectious mononucleosis due to EBV infection may show: Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. You can help relieve symptoms of infectious mononucleosis by:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever Do not take penicillin antibiotics If you have infectious mononucleosis, you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin.

Based on the severity of the symptoms, a healthcare provider may recommend treatment of specific organ systems affected by infectious mononucleosis. Avoid contact sports Because your spleen may become enlarged as a result of infectious mononucleosis, you should avoid contact sports until you fully recover. Participating in contact sports can be strenuous and may cause the spleen to rupture.

The definition of severe recurrent throat infections is arbitrary, but recent criteria have defined severe tonsillitis as: five or more episodes of true tonsillitis a year; symptoms for at least 1 year; and episodes that are disabling and prevent normal functioning. Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, and it can be difficult to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis, but more accurate tests take longer to deliver results. Bacteria are cultured from few people with tonsillitis. Other causes include infectious mononucleosis from Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, hepatitis A, and rubella.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of tonsillectomy in children and adults with acute recurrent or chronic throat infections? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cold-steel tonsillectomy and diathermy tonsillectomy.

### Infectious mononucleosis complicated by acute hepatitis And myocarditis: a response to corticosteroids [^6c2c755c]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis, or glandular fever, is a viral illness which commonly affects young adults. Symptoms can vary from sore throat, enlarged lymph glands, lethargy and weight loss to more serious clinical manifestations such as myocarditis or hepatitis. Treatment is usually conservative although there has been significant debate over the role of oral corticosteroids, especially in more serious cases. Evidence based medicine suggests that there is little to no role for steroids, but there are enough published case reports where steroid therapy has been potentially life saving that the debate continues. We present a case of a fit and well man who had significant multi-organ involvement secondary to infectious mononucleosis, and our experience of oral corticosteroid treatment.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^55549c92]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Return to contact activity after IM: The appropriate time for safe return to contact play is unclear, although, given the risk for splenic rupture, a time frame of at least 3 weeks commonly is recommended; return can occur only after the athlete has no remaining clinical symptoms, is afebrile, and has a normal energy level, and the risk for splenic rupture likely decreases as more time passes, allowing for individualized RTP decisions depending on the athlete, sport, and other factors (SOR C).

### Nonoperative management of spontaneous splenic rupture in infectious mononucleosis: a case report and review of the literature [^8958aa87]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous rupture of the spleen is a rare complication of infectious mononucleosis with no clear consensus on appropriate management. Although management of traumatic splenic rupture has largely moved to nonoperative treatment, splenectomy is still frequently used in dealing with rupture of the diseased spleen. Here we report the case of a 16-year-old boy with splenic rupture secondary to laboratory-confirmed infectious mononucleosis in the absence of trauma. Nonoperative management including ICU admission, serial computed tomography scans, and activity limitation was used successfully. Our experience, along with a review of the literature, leads us to conclude that splenic preservation can be a safe alternative to splenectomy in hemodynamically stable patients with spontaneous splenic rupture. This is of particular importance in the pediatric population, which is at higher risk for postsplenectomy sepsis.

Abdominal complaints in patients with infectious mononucleosis should alert the surgeon to the potential, and possibly fatal, risk of splenic rupture. Radiologic evaluation by ultrasonography and computed tomography is indicated for appropriate management. We describe a case in which a diagnosis of splenic rupture occurring spontaneously on a background of infectious mononucleosis was made as a result of a high index of suspicion. The patient was treated conservatively.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^4ab75cb5]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Return to light activity after IM: In most cases, athletes will not feel well enough to participate in activity for several weeks; although the risk for splenic rupture is extremely low, given that most of these occur within the first 3 weeks of illness, independent of spleen size, it is generally felt that it is safe to resume light activity 3 weeks from the onset of symptoms, as long as the athlete is afebrile, has a good energy level, and does not have any significant associated abnormalities; the risk of splenic rupture likely diminishes as more time progresses, therefore, delaying return to play should be considered if clinical features, lack of athlete readiness, and/or associated complications are present, and treatment must therefore be individualized to account for all of these issues (SOR C).

Infectious mononucleosis splenic rupture risk is low but clinically important; splenomegaly in IM is nearly universal, but splenic rupture is rare, and the true incidence is cited to occur in 0.1% to 0.2% in most reviews; the spleen appears most vulnerable in the first 3–4 weeks of illness, and in a review of 55 cases almost all occurred in the first 3 weeks with half not traumatic, with rupture occurring spontaneously or from trauma related to altered splenic architecture.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^2967d381]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Mononucleosis — spleen size assessment and early activity restriction — Spleen size varies widely, so "One-time imaging of the spleen for assessment of splenomegaly at the time of illness is not recommended" and, without an individual baseline, "a single ultrasonographic splenic size determination cannot reliably be used to determine splenomegaly"; examples show variability ("just more than 7% of the athletes had a baseline spleen length of > 13 cm", a spleen length of "11 cm" may be normal for someone whose baseline is "7 cm", and baseline "14 cm" could be mislabeled). Because exertion can precipitate rupture, "it is advisable to avoid any form of exertion, including sports activities"; a Valsalva-related "stool softener may be prescribed", and "Such precautions are advised for the first 3 weeks of illness".

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^d801d567]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) — incidence, timing, and outcomes: Athletes with acute IM who continue to participate carry a small but unquantifiable risk of complications including splenic rupture and death, with an early review estimating splenic rupture risk as 0.1% to 0.5%. In a systematic review, mean time to splenic rupture was 14 days with a maximum of 8 weeks; average age was 22 years, 70% were men, 14% were traumatic, 88% presented with abdominal pain, 32% were treated operatively, and overall mortality was 9%. In a military retrospective review, mean time to rupture was 15.4 days (SD 13.5; median 11.5), with 73.8% within 21 days (95% CI, 0.736 to 0.942) and 90.5% within 31 days (95% CI, 0.794 to 0.970); most cases involved men (83.3%), below 25 years (71.4%), and were atraumatic (80.5%); in 88.1%, IM was diagnosed after rupture; 71.4% returned to full activity (45.7% within 90 days; 25.7% within 90 to 365 days); those not returning (n = 10) reported persistent abdominal pain (n = 8), anxiety (n = 1), or unrelated concerns (n = 1); and there were no fatalities reported.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^89eb93da]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.2.1.1 Epstein Barr Virus

There is increasing interest in Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection in IBD patients because of the risk of severe complications, including haemophagocytic syndrome and post-mononucleosis type lymphomas after primary infection and haemophagocytic syndrome and post-transplant type lymphoma during latent infection. A Spanish tertiary care centre studied 1483 patients aged over 17 years between 2006 and 2016. They assessed EBV seroprevalence and seroconversion and documented those who developed complications while on azathioprine. EBV had a role in tumour development in three out of five patients on azathioprine, but only one (in a 66-year-old man) occurred during a primary infection. The authors conclude that the risk of haemophagocytic syndrome and lymphoma on thiopurine therapy is not restricted to young males. This is confirmed in a USA paediatric IBD follow-up cohort, where 3/5 patients with haemophagocytic syndrome (all on thiopurines) were female. There was no association with use of infliximab or methotrexate (although numbers on methotrexate were much smaller). It remains unclear whether screening for EBV status should be done routinely in adults. In paediatric patients who are particularly at risk from primary EBV infection, there may be more justification for screening in order to avoid thiopurine use in those who are seronegative. Routine EBV testing prior to thiopurine therapy remains controversial.

### Infectious mononucleosis: new concepts in clinical presentation, epidemiology, and host response [^d484313b]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is an infectious disease that presents clinically in only a small percentage of individuals despite almost universal infection with the causative agent. Here, we review the latest concepts in the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and host response of this disease.

Recent Findings

Several recently published papers/reviews describe IM as a condition caused by one of several etiologic agents including, cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), Roseola virus (HHV-6) and Toxoplasmosis amongst others; this review focuses on IM as solely caused by the human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4). Since the initial discovery of the virus in the 1960s and its subsequent discovery as the primary etiologic agent for IM it has been associated with several human cancers and autoimmune disorders. Recent published findings show a correlation between HHV-4 and the autoimmune disorder, multiple sclerosis (MS), suggesting earlier IM could possibly act as a causative factor. Considering the important links being made with IM to so many cancers and autoimmune disorders it is surprising that a standard investigative procedure has yet to be determined for this disease. A standard approach to the investigation of IM would ensure more cases are diagnosed, particularly atypical cases, this would benefit epidemiological studies, and more immediately help practitioners distinguish viral from bacterial throat infections, enabling them to treat accordingly.

Summary

The understanding of the latest concepts in clinical presentation, epidemiology and host response to IM would benefit greatly from the introduction of a standard procedure for its investigation and diagnosis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis in HIV — therapy after immune reconstitution: In HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV RNA on potent antiretroviral (ARV) therapy who have a CD4 ≥ 250/mm3, coccidioidomycosis should be managed no differently than it is in the general population (AII). For patients who meet the above criteria with focal pulmonary disease, treatment with triazole antifungal should continue for a minimum of 6 months (AII). For patients with diffuse pulmonary disease and those with extrathoracic dissemination, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 12 months and usually much longer, and for patients with detectable HIV viremia or CD4 < 250/mm3, antifungal therapy at full dose should continue (BIII).

Recommendation 16. Where initial tests for infection are negative, all patients with persistent diarrhoea should be referred for upper GI endoscopy with biopsy for the assessment of:
coeliac and coeliac‐like enteropathy
lymphocytic infiltration to suggest autoimmune enteropathy
small bowel biopsy and jejunal aspirates to exclude giardia
lymphoma (T and B cells)
infection (CMV, enteroviruses)
nodular lymphoid hyperplasia

Recommendation 17. Centres should agree a protocol with the local gastroenterology team to guide observations and indicate the pathological samples to be taken at endoscopy in adults with CVID.

The consensus was clear that both upper and lower GI endoscopies should be examined to exclude lymphoma, and respondents emphasized the importance of working closely with histopathologists and gastroenterologists. The respondents recognized the lack of evidence regarding the underlying reasons for the increased risk of malignancy in CVID, but there was clear consensus for the need to exclude malignancy in this clinical context. Both rounds of the survey included statements which included specific methods for identification of viruses and CD4 and CD8 T cells in gastrointestinal biopsies, and these all received high levels of agreement. However, the expert group felt that these were too restrictive, and that the intent of the recommendations was to highlight the need to exclude specific infections and lymphoma without limiting the methodologies used. The statements were condensed to reflect this.

Consensus was not reached regarding examination of stool samples for EBV and AAFB; however, it was recommended that if biopsies are taken EBV should be excluded.

Recommendations for adults with CVID and pernicious anaemia

Recommendation 18. Adults with CVID and pernicious anaemia should have:
an upper GI endoscopy performed within 6 months of diagnosis
monitoring arranged according to local gastroenterology guidance

### Treating opportunistic infections among HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association / Infectious Diseases Society of America [^361a8eb8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2004). Low credibility.

The National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC have developed guidelines for treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) among adults and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These guidelines are intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women; they complement companion guidelines for treatment of OIs among HIV-infected children and previously published guidelines for prevention of OIs in these populations. They include evidence-based guidelines for treatment of 28 OIs caused by protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including certain OIs endemic in other parts of the world but that might be observed in patients in the United States. Each OI section includes information on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, monitoring and adverse events, management of treatment failure, prevention of recurrence, and special considerations in pregnancy. Tables address drugs and doses, drug toxicities, drug interactions, adjustment of drug doses in persons with reduced renal function, and data about use of drugs in pregnant women.

HIV/HBV coinfection — management of partial virologic response is specified as follows: In adherent patients with a partial virologic response to tenofovir, the drug should be continued with monitoring of HBV DNA levels (BII). Improved virologic response has been reported with the addition of entecavir to TDF; however, whether such "intensification therapy" is required is unclear. However, documented in vivo resistance to tenofovir has not yet been reported. For patients on less potent agents, those with partial virologic responses (< 2 log10 drop in HBV DNA levels from baseline at 24 weeks) should be switched to a more potent regimen such as tenofovir (TDF or TAF) with emtricitabine or entecavir (if on adefovir) because of the risk of development of drug resistance to the initial therapy (BII).

### Ampicillin sodium [^247c128b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

The possibility of superinfections with mycotic organisms or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. In such cases, discontinue the drug and substitute appropriate treatment.

A high percentage (43 to 100 percent) of patients with infectious mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Typically, the rash appears 7 to 10 days after the start of oral ampicillin therapy and remains for a few days to a week after the drug is discontinued. In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin.

Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of infectious mononucleosis by Epstein-Barr virus in Mexican children [^cf432a66]. BMC Research Notes (2012). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious mononucleosis:

- **Definition**: IM, also known as mono or "kissing disease", is an acute infection characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.
- **Pathophysiology**: IM is most frequently caused by the EBV transmitted through infected saliva during kissing.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of IM in the US is estimated at 500 cases per 100,000 population per year, with the peak incidence between ages 15–24 years. However, over 90% of adults globally are EBV seropositive.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EBV infection include age, specifically adolescents and young adults, intimate oral contact, transfusion of infected blood, solid organ transplantation, and hematopoietic cell transplantation.
- **Disease course**: Young children are often asymptomatic, and symptoms frequently occur in adolescents and young adults. Clinical manifestations include pharyngitis, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, generalized muscle aches, hepatosplenomegaly, maculopapular rash, jaundice, arthritis, conjunctivitis, and edema. Complications include hematological complications (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, TTP, HUS, and DIC), neurologic complications (Guillain-Barre syndrome, facial paralysis, meningoencephalitis, aseptic meningitis, transversal myelitis, peripheral neuritis, cerebellitis, and optical neuritis), splenic rupture, airway obstruction, pneumonia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (prolonged fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, exanthem, hepatic dysfunction, and cytopenia).
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most patients achieve complete resolution within weeks, and mortality rates are low (5.3%). EBV remains dormant post-recovery, but symptomatic reactivation is rare. Primary EBV infection may result in chronic multisystem disease, presenting as either recurrent symptoms emerging months to years after the initial illness or as persistent IM syndrome, involving proliferation of B cells, NK cells, and T cells. Chronic active EBV infection is a rare but severe complication characterized by a disease course lasting > 6 months, histologic evidence of major organ involvement (such as interstitial pneumonia, hemophagocytosis, uveitis, lymphadenitis, or persistent hepatitis), and the detection of EBV DNA, RNA, or proteins in affected tissues. Prognosis is poor, with most patients dying within a few years due to complications such as progressive pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, or NK/T-cell nasal lymphoma. Chronic active EBV infection is more prevalent in Asia and South America.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^3ea4cdb2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report updates and combines earlier versions of guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV-infected adults (i.e., persons aged ≥ 18 years) and adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13–17 years), last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. It has been prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care providers, HIV-infected patients, and policy makers in the United States. These guidelines address several OIs that occur in the United States and five OIs that might be acquired during international travel. Topic areas covered for each OI include epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; and special considerations during pregnancy. These guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists from the United States government and academic institutions. For each OI, a small group of specialists with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the guidelines were last published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting held at NIH in June 2007. After these presentations and discussion, the revised guidelines were further reviewed by the co-editors; by the Office of AIDS Research, NIH; by specialists at CDC; and by HIVMA of IDSA before final approval and publication. The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of evidence supporting the recommendation, so that readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information regarding the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information regarding the use of interferon-gamma release assays for the diagnosis of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection; 4) updated information concerning drug interactions that affect the use of rifamycin drugs for prevention and treatment of TB; 5) the addition of a section on hepatitis B virus infection; and 6) the addition of malaria to the list of OIs that might be acquired during international travel. This report includes eleven tables pertinent to the prevention and treatment of OIs, a figure that pertains to the diagnois of tuberculosis, a figure that describes immunization recommendations, and an appendix that summarizes recommendations for prevention of exposure to opportunistic pathogens.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e7b7c3e8]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for about one in 50 of all ambulatory care visits and resulting in considerable costs. Most sore throats are self limitingand are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus is responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15–30% of those in children.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics provides only modest beneficial effect in reducing symptoms and fever. 7 8 However, prescribing rates remain disproportionately high. High rates of antibiotic prescriptions contribute to antibiotic resistanceand also lead to the "medicalising" of sore throat, which can result in increased rates of patient (re)attendance. In developed countries, prescribing is no longer justified to prevent complications from group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Peritonsillar abscess occurs in fewer than two in 10 000 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections, whereas non-suppurative complications (such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis) are extremely rare.

The pressure for clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat leaves a therapeutic vacuum. Corticosteroids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators in human airway endothelial cells which cause pharyngeal inflammation and ultimately symptoms of pain. Corticosteroids are beneficial in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis, croup, and infectious mononucleosis. We therefore hypothesised that corticosteroids would offer similar symptomatic relief from sore throat because of their anti-inflammatory effects, and undertook a systematic review to examine the effect of systemic corticosteroids on adults and children with sore throat.

### EBV-driven B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders: from biology, classification and differential diagnosis to clinical management [^8bb3dff4]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, B-cell type

CAEBV disease is an uncommon EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder affecting B-cells, T-cells or NK cells. It is currently defined as a severe progressive illness of > 6 months that begins as a primary EBV infection or is associated with heavily elevated anti-EBV viral capsid antigen IgG ⩾1:5120 or anti-EBV early antigen IgG ⩾1:640 or markedly elevated EBV DNA in the peripheral blood with histological evidence (lymphocytic infiltration) of major organ involvement and increased EBER or proteins in the affected tissues in patients without an immunosuppressive condition. It was first described by Straus as 'the chronic mononucleosis syndrome' to differentiate this disease from chronic fatigue syndrome. The major organ involvement denotes lymphadenitis, persistent hepatitis, splenomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, hypoplasia of the bone marrow or uveitis. The etiology of CAEBV is uncertain.EBV stimulates secretion of a variety of cytokines and chemokines in both EBV-infected cells and non-infected cells. The current recommendation is to specify the nature of the EBV-infected cells as being B-cells, T-cells or NK cells. In this review, we focus only on CAEBV, B-cell type. For T-cell or NK cell types, please consult the article by Kimura et al.

Introduction

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. The guidelines addressed the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP as well as persistent and chronic ITP with regard to hospitalization, observation, and treatment selection of both first- and second-line agents. The guidelines also carried forward recommendations from the 2011 ASH guidelines for ITP related to diagnostic testing in patients with ITP, management of Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles mumps rubella vaccine–associated ITP. This review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) represents a heterogeneous group of rare disorders. There is considerable morbidity and mortality as a result of non‐infectious complications, and this presents clinicians with management challenges. Clinical guidelines to support the management of CVID are urgently required. The UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network and the British Society for Immunology funded a joint project to address this. A modified Delphi Survey was conducted for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the non‐infectious blood, respiratory, gut and liver complications of CVID. A steering group of 10 consultant immunologists and one nurse specialist developed and reviewed the survey statements and agreed the final recommendations. In total, 22 recommendations and three areas for research were developed.

Discussion

This is the first set of UK recommendations for the monitoring and management of non‐infectious complications of CVID. We used the Delphi method to produce several consensus statements. This method was chosen as there is not a sufficiently large evidence base for the diagnosis and management of any of these complications on which to develop evidence‐based guidelines, as is often the case with rare diseases. We started with 63 statements; 59 statements reached consensus and were condensed into 22 recommendations.

The steering group identified a number of significant non‐infectious complications of CVID to address in the Delphi statements. There is an inevitable overlap with infectious disease, particularly where exclusion of infection is critical to the diagnosis of non‐infectious complications. As a result, some statements regarding infectious complications had to be included. GLILD was not addressed, as a UK consensus statement on the management of GLILD has recently been published 9.

The increased risk of malignancy in this group of patients is acknowledged; the statements recommending for regular clinical assessment (including weight) and regular monitoring blood tests were included to take this into account. Development of further guideline/consensus on screening and monitoring for cancers such as gastric cancer and lymphomas will be required in the future.

The survey respondents were representative of medical consultants specializing in immunology working in the United Kingdom, although there was a low response rate from the nurses' group. Overall, the majority of participants (80%) had more than 10 years' experience in immunology, cared for 50 or more CVID patients (70%) and worked in 21 of the 36 immunodeficiency centres in the United Kingdom. Fifty‐two per cent (n = 44) of the current consultant immunologist workforce contributed to developing these recommendations, including the members of the steering group.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV/HCV-coinfected adults and adolescents — treatment should be considered in non-pregnant, HCV-infected patients with abnormal transaminases and biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis with inflammation, fibrosis, and compensated liver disease, and a liver biopsy is optional before therapy for genotypes 2 or 3. Baseline serum HCV RNA level and HCV genotype are the primary predictors of response, and sustained virologic response rates with peg-IFN-α plus ribavirin range from 44% to 73% for genotypes 2 and 3 and from 14% to 29% for genotype 1. Response improves when CD4 cell counts are > 200 cells/mm3; therefore, cART should be considered before anti-HCV therapy when CD4 cell counts are < 200 cells/mm3. Anti-HCV treatment is not recommended during pregnancy because ribavirin is teratogenic. In adults with genotype 1, protease inhibitor triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir in concert with peg-IFN-α and ribavirin achieved sustained virologic responses in up to 68% of treated patients.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma: Section last reviewed and updated on 2/22/2023. Last literature search conducted 1/31/2023. Recommendation 13 (UPDATED 2/22/2023): Among immunocompetent patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel recommends against COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty of evidence). Recommendation 14 (NEW 2/22/2023): Among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who do not qualify for other treatments, who place a higher value on the uncertain mortality reduction and a lower value on the potential adverse effects of convalescent plasma would reasonably select convalescent plasma.

Adults with CVID and Helicobacter pylori

Recommendation 12. Adults with CVID and H. pylori should be offered eradication in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline CG184 (Gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia in adults: investigation and management) 14.

Adults with CVID and diarrhoea

Recommendation 13. In adults with CVID and diarrhoea for more than 2 weeks the following infections should be excluded:
Campylobacter
Clostridium difficile toxin
Giardia
Salmonella
Shigella
Cryptosporidia
Microsporidia
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Norovirus
Other intestinal parasites (for example, isospora)

In the free text section, a number of respondents favoured a stepwise approach, with first‐line investigations to exclude Campylobacter, C. difficile toxin, Giardia, Salmonella and Shigella, only proceeding to investigating for viruses, mycobacteria and other parasites if these first‐line tests are negative.

Recommendation 14. Adults with CVID and non‐infectious diarrhoea or malabsorption should be referred to a consultant gastroenterologist and a dietician.

Recommendation 15. Where initial tests for infection are negative, all patients with persistent diarrhoea should be referred for lower GI endoscopy with biopsy for the assessment of:
GLILD – including typical and atypical Crohn's disease
inflammatory bowel disease, including typical and atypical ulcerative colitis
lymphocytic infiltration to suggest autoimmune enteropathy
lymphoma (T and B cell)
infection [CMV, enteroviruses, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)]

### American medical society of sports medicine position statement: mononucleosis and athletic participation [^8d6b2ff7]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epidemiology in infectious mononucleosis (IM) describes humans as the only source, with transmission "primarily through oral secretions", including sharing cups or food or close contact such as sneezing, and notes an incubation period of EBV of 30–50 days. In children " < 16 years old" with clinically diagnosed IM, "85.4% were because of EBV and 14.6% were because of cytomegalovirus (CMV)". In young adults "between 15 and 19 years old", the annual symptomatic IM rate is "between 200 and 800 cases per 100,000". Among freshmen, "30% to 50%" remain susceptible with an "annual incidence of 1% to 5%". A United Kingdom study with "2325 participants" found "96.4% of women and 95.5% of men by age 20 to 25 years were seropositive for EBV", and "each year increase in age corresponded to a 12% increase in the rate of seropositivity". It also states that EBV is "not uncommon" to be unrecognized in children because symptoms are generally less severe than in older adults.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^11cb9770]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) detection assays and hepatic enzymes — clinical utility: Detection of EBV can be done from cultures of circulating lymphocytes or molecular amplification of EBV DNA in circulating lymphocytes, but these tests are not generally needed for diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and are not available to most practitioners. Viral load monitoring by polymerase chain reaction has been used primarily to identify transplant recipients at high risk for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease but can be used to confirm acute IM. Hepatic transaminase levels are commonly elevated in IM, although usually only mildly, occurring in approximately 50% of cases, and the importance of these transient elevations in determining return to play remains unclear.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^f35f3087]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

VIRAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Viruses are the most common causes of acute pharyngitis. In particular, respiratory viruses predominate and include adenovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, human coronaviruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus are the most common pathogens associated with infectious mononucleosis, which is often characterized by pharyngitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Distinguishing between IM infectious mononucleosis-associated pharyngitis and infectious pharyngitis is difficult by clinical presentation alone and can lead to overprescription of antibiotics in 76% of presentations. Individuals may be asymptomatically colonized with viruses and lead to interpretative confusion when detected using multiplex panels. Recent publications have shed insight into the asymptomatic carriage of various respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (children 40%–45%, adults 34.9%); adenoviruses (children 10%, adults 8%); rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (children 16%, adults 5%); parainfluenza viruses (children 1%, adults 2.6%); respiratory syncytial virus (children 2%, adults 6.5%); human metapneumovirus (children 2%, adults 0%); and non–SARS-CoV-2 human coronaviruses (children 2%, adults 1%). Diagnostic tools to correctly identify the bacterial and viral causes of pharyngitis are needed to avoid unnecessary delays in care and inappropriate antibiotic treatment.

### Severe infectious mononucleosis in the older adult: a case report and review of the literature [^3592aad4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis (IM), a diagnosis classically made in adolescence and young adulthood. IM is uncommon later in life generally because of previous exposure. When the disease does affect advanced age groups, diagnostic challenges exist and delays to appropriate treatment may occur.

Case Presentation

An 86-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of severe generalized weakness for greater than one week. Significant findings in the ED consisted of thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function testing, and atypical lymphocytosis. Infectious Monospot testing was positive. Given his clinical presentation, hospitalization was required. A broad workup in the hospital setting revealed a principal diagnosis of IM based on EBV DNA quantification and EBV IgM positivity. After a weeklong hospital stay, he was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation.

Discussion

This case highlights the importance of considering IM in advanced age groups who are not typically considered classic for the presentation and avoiding diagnostic closure in unrevealing workups. Although IM is rarely reported in patients beyond the third decade of life, our patient's severe fatigue and laboratory findings warranted further evaluation with immunologic studies, clinching the diagnosis.

Conclusion

This report illustrates the need for emergency providers to consider IM in the differential even for older adults given their potential for decompensation.

### Recommendations for the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in adults [^c8a9fdfd]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome induced by aberrantly activated macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. The primary (genetic) form, caused by mutations affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity and immune regulation, is most common in children, whereas the secondary (acquired) form is most frequent in adults. Secondary HLH is commonly triggered by infections or malignancies but may also be induced by autoinflammatory/autoimmune disorders, in which case it is called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; or MAS-HLH). Most information on the diagnosis and treatment of HLH comes from the pediatric literature. Although helpful in some adult cases, this raises several challenges. For example, the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria developed for children are commonly applied but are not validated for adults. Another challenge in HLH diagnosis is that patients may present with a phenotype indistinguishable from sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Treatment algorithms targeting hyperinflammation are frequently based on pediatric protocols, such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, which may result in overtreatment and unnecessary toxicity in adults. Therefore, dose reductions, individualized tailoring of treatment duration, and an age-dependent modified diagnostic approach are to be considered. Here, we present expert opinions derived from an interdisciplinary working group on adult HLH, sponsored by the Histiocyte Society, to facilitate knowledge transfer between physicians caring for pediatric and adult patients with HLH, with the aim to improve the outcome for adult patients affected by HLH.

Respiratory complications

There is an overlap between infectious and non‐infectious respiratory complications of CVID. For this reason, the Steering Group decided to include statements regarding identification and management of bronchiectasis. The management of upper respiratory tract infections is not addressed in this guideline.

Recommendation 6. Adults with CVID and ongoing frequent respiratory tract infections should have a HRCT chest at least every 5 years to monitor for the development of bronchiectasis.

Recommendation 7. Adults with CVID and bronchiectasis and ongoing frequent respiratory tract infections should have a HRCT chest at least every 5 years to monitor the progression of bronchiectasis.

Recommendation 8. Adults with CVID and splenomegaly should have annual pulmonary function tests (PFT) including transfer factor to monitor for the development of interstitial lung disease.

Recommendation 9. Centres should agree monitoring, action or referral thresholds for adults with CVID with features of respiratory complications with the local Respiratory team.

Recommendation 10. Adults with CVID and bronchiectasis should be managed jointly with a consultant chest physician and an immunologist.

In the free text section, all the respondents stressed the importance of using clinical judgement and individual patient assessment to determine the exact frequency of computerized tomography (CT) scanning and pulmonary function tests (PFT). It is acknowledged that in some cases more frequent scanning or PFT may be indicated. The radiation risk associated with CT scanning was highlighted by respondents commenting that some patients with CVID may be particularly radiosensitive, and thus potentially more susceptible to ionizing radiation. The role of PFT in place of, and as an adjunct to, HRCT was emphasized by several respondents in order to minimize radiation exposure. The committee concluded that alternatives such as low‐dose HRCT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be considered.

GI complications

Infectious diarrhoea is the most common GI complication in CVID 12, while 9–15% of patients are reported to develop non‐infectious GI complications 8, 13. Diagnosis of non‐infectious GI complications requires that infection is excluded as a cause of symptoms. As a result, the steering group agreed to include statements relating to infection in the Delphi survey, even though infectious complications are not the main focus of these guidelines.

Recommendation 11. Adults with CVID and evidence of malabsorption should have the following investigations:
haematinics
calcium
vitamin D
fat soluble vitamins

Respondents highlighted that malabsorption should be considered in patients with unexplained weight loss.

### Consensus-based guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in critically ill children and adults [^70189023]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a hyperinflammatory syndrome that often requires critical care support and remains difficult to diagnose. These guidelines are meant to aid in the early recognition, diagnosis, supportive care, and treatment of patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in ICUs.

Data Sources

The literature searches were performed with PubMed (MEDLINE).

Study Selection

Keywords and medical subject headings terms for literature search included "macrophage activation syndrome", hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", and "hemophagocytic syndrome".

Data Extraction

The Histiocyte Society developed these consensus recommendations on the basis of published reports and expert opinions with level of evidence provided for each recommendation. They were endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

Data Synthesis

Testing for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis should be initiated promptly in all patients admitted to ICUs with an unexplained or disproportionate inflammatory response, especially those with rapid clinical deterioration. Meeting five or more of eight hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 2004 diagnostic criteria serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Early aggressive critical care interventions are often required to manage the multisystem organ failure associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Thorough investigation of the underlying triggers of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, including infections, malignancies, and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, is essential. Early steroid treatment is indicated for patients with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and is often valuable in patients with acquired hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (i.e., secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) without previous therapy, including macrophage activation syndrome (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease) without persistent or relapsing disease. Steroid treatment should not be delayed, particularly if organ dysfunction is present. In patients with macrophage activation syndrome, whose disease does not sufficiently respond, interleukin-1 inhibition and/or cyclosporine A is recommended. In familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and severe, persistent, or relapsing secondary macrophage activation syndrome, the addition of prompt individualized, age-adjusted etoposide treatment is recommended.

Conclusions

Further studies are needed to determine optimal treatment for patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in ICUs, including the use of novel and adjunct therapies.

Treating malaria in HIV-infected patients — because Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum infection should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to therapy (AIII). When suspicion of malaria is low, antimalarial treatment should not be initiated until the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigations, but treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results may be delayed (AIII). Treatment recommendations for HIV-infected patients are the same as HIV-uninfected patients (AIII), choice of therapy is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, the patient's clinical status, and the likely drug susceptibility of the infected species, and for region-specific recommendations clinicians should refer to the CDC malaria website and the CDC Malaria Hotline.
