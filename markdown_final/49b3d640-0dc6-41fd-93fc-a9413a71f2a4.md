## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chronic severe neck pain with bilateral arm symptoms, insidious onset, constant for > 3 months, severity 8, with associated numbness and tingling, and wants clear diagnostic and management logic with embedded citations throughout the narrative. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem definition and key red flags. Then, I should generate and prioritize the differential diagnosis. Next, I will outline an evidence-based diagnostic workup including examination, imaging, and electrodiagnostics. After that, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and stage the management from conservative care to interventional and surgical options, followed by prognosis, monitoring, and patient education, verifying each step against guidelines and outcome data as I go [^112bMHmB] [^113mU6WU].

> Let me first confirm the clinical synthesis: chronic (> 3 months), severe, constant neck pain radiating bilaterally to the arms with numbness and tingling strongly suggests a cervical radicular process, and the bilateral nature raises concern for multilevel involvement or concomitant cervical cord compromise, so I need to keep myelopathy in mind and actively screen for it [^116S3TCb] [^111vkoEz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to build a differential and weigh probabilities. Multilevel cervical radiculopathy from spondylosis or disc herniation is common and would explain dermatomal sensory changes, with C7 and C6 most frequently involved, but cervical spondylotic myelopathy or myeloradiculopathy must be considered given bilateral symptoms and chronicity, while facet-mediated neck pain, entrapment neuropathies, and thoracic outlet syndrome remain mimics or contributors that I should exclude clinically [^112JjCVH] [^113ePv4e] [^11565qXj] [^116S3TCb].

> I should double-check the examination plan to separate radiculopathy from myelopathy and mimics. I will perform a focused neurologic exam including strength, dermatomal sensation, and reflexes (triceps commonly affected), and use Spurling, shoulder abduction, and upper limb tension tests to rule in radiculopathy while carefully screening for myelopathy signs such as gait disturbance, hand clumsiness, pathologic reflexes, and hyperreflexia; the cervical flexion-rotation test and neurodynamic testing help stratify and track impairment and guide therapy selection [^116S3TCb] [^115P5mao] [^111vkoEz].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy because guidance differs by context. One could say "image after conservative care", but that applies chiefly to new symptoms without red flags; here the symptoms are chronic and bilateral with persistent neurologic complaints, so a cervical MRI without contrast is appropriate now to define nerve root and cord pathology, while CT is reserved if MRI is contraindicated or OPLL is suspected, and contrast MRI is indicated if infection or malignancy is a concern; I initially thought to defer imaging, but given the chronicity and bilateral neurologic symptoms, I should not delay MRI in this scenario [^112bMHmB] [^1156VQ3e] [^117MvHAM] [^114TU3YD] [^116S3TCb].

> I need to check when electrodiagnostics add value. If clinical and imaging findings are discordant or I must distinguish multilevel radiculopathy from peripheral entrapment (for example, carpal tunnel or ulnar neuropathy), EMG/NCS can clarify lesion localization; importantly, specialized physiologic markers like the cutaneous silent period remain preserved in radiculopathy and are more useful to flag myelopathy, which I should consider if clinical findings suggest cord disease [^116S3TCb] [^111B5823].

> Let me think about the working diagnosis. Given the chronic time course, bilateral arm radiation, and sensory symptoms with an insidious onset, the most likely diagnosis is chronic multilevel cervical radiculopathy secondary to degenerative spondylosis, while I keep cervical myeloradiculopathy on the differential pending exam and MRI to exclude cord involvement that would alter urgency and management [^116S3TCb] [^114bRJTi] [^113ePv4e].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management and ensure it is guideline-concordant. A structured physical therapy program emphasizing cervical and thoracic mobilization or manipulation, neural and scapular stabilization, and intermittent mechanical traction can be offered, with short-term collar use for symptom relief; traction parameters from retrospective data suggest 8–12 lb for 15 minutes, up to three times daily for several weeks, recognizing that evidence quality varies, and I will pair this with education and graded activity to maintain function [^113mU6WU] [^115DZLNq] [^115FWBSJ] [^1117hDyc].

> I should confirm pharmacologic options and their role. For analgesia and inflammation, short courses of NSAIDs are reasonable unless contraindicated, with muscle relaxants for spasms and consideration of neuropathic agents such as gabapentinoids for radicular pain, while monitoring response and side effects; I need to reassess at defined intervals to avoid prolonged ineffective medication use [^114zeqPE] [^116S3TCb].

> Hold on, I will now examine interventional options if conservative measures fail and imaging confirms correlating pathology. Cervical epidural steroid injections can offer short-term pain relief but carry procedural risks that should be discussed and mitigated with image guidance; in highly selected patients with chronic cervical radicular pain, pulsed radiofrequency adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion has RCT-level evidence of modest short-term benefit, whereas facet-directed procedures are reserved for facetogenic pain rather than true radiculopathy [^116S3TCb] [^111DXHby] [^11565qXj] [^111REXsC].

> I need to ensure surgical thresholds are clear. Indications include progressive neurologic deficit, intractable or disabling pain despite 4–6 weeks (often longer in practice) of guideline-based conservative therapy with corroborating MRI pathology, or presence of myelopathy; standard options such as ACDF yield 80–90% arm pain relief in appropriately selected radiculopathy patients, and contemporary data suggest ambulatory ACDF can be non-inferior to overnight stay for selected individuals, while predominant neck pain (versus arm pain) may portend less favorable satisfaction and disability outcomes at 12 months [^114bRJTi] [^112t3MYU] [^113Q744V] [^117M2b5Q].

> But wait, what about expected course and prognosis; I should contextualize this to set expectations. Many acute radiculopathy cases improve spontaneously, yet chronic symptoms beyond three months have a lower likelihood of spontaneous resolution; traction-based conservative care showed approximately 78% response in selected cohorts, and when surgery is needed for radiculopathy, outcomes for pain relief are generally high, whereas for coexisting myelopathy, long-term registry data suggest stability in patient-reported outcomes from 1 year through extended follow-up after decompression, which helps in counseling about durability if myelopathy is present [^114bRJTi] [^1117hDyc] [^116M2Qab].

> I should double-check follow-up structure and measurement. Establish baseline pain ratings and validated function metrics (for example, Neck Disability Index and patient-specific functional measures), re-evaluate at about 2, 6, and 12 weeks to track response and pivot care, and consider MRI by 6 weeks if there is inadequate improvement; prognostic modeling suggests baseline NDI is the strongest predictor of 12-month outcomes after surgery, which I should use for expectation-setting and shared decision-making [^116qbmCY] [^115P5mao] [^112z19n1].

> Let me reconsider red flags and patient education so I do not miss evolving cord disease. I will counsel the patient to report any new gait imbalance, hand clumsiness, hyperreflexia, falls, or bowel/bladder changes urgently, as these features raise concern for degenerative cervical myelopathy that warrants expedited MRI and surgical referral given the risk of progression and the potential for better outcomes with timely decompression [^111vkoEz] [^115ieCpK].

> In summary, I need to ensure a coherent, stepwise plan: confirm the neurologic exam and provocative tests, obtain a cervical MRI now given chronic bilateral radicular symptoms, initiate guideline-based conservative therapies including PT with traction and NSAIDs while monitoring at predefined intervals, consider targeted injections or pulsed radiofrequency if nonoperative measures fail and imaging correlates, and refer for surgical evaluation if deficits progress or pain remains disabling, recognizing that ACDF offers high rates of arm pain relief and ambulatory pathways can be safe for selected patients [^112bMHmB] [^113mU6WU] [^116S3TCb] [^112t3MYU].

The most likely diagnosis is **cervical radiculopathy** [^114bRJTi] due to chronic nerve root compression from degenerative cervical spondylosis or disc herniation [^117GwPNu], given the insidious onset, constant severe neck pain radiating to both arms, and numbness/tingling. MRI is the initial imaging of choice [^112bMHmB] to confirm **nerve root compression** and exclude **myelopathy** or other serious pathology [^114TU3YD]. Management should start with NSAIDs [^114zeqPE], neuropathic agents, and a multimodal physical therapy program [^113mU6WU]; consider epidural steroid injections if symptoms persist, and refer for surgical evaluation if there is progressive neurological deficit or refractory pain [^116S3TCb].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to patient** |
|-|-|-|
| Cervical radiculopathy | - Neck pain radiating to arms <br/> - Numbness/tingling <br/> - Motor weakness <br/> - Reflex changes [^112JjCVH] | Highly consistent |
| Cervical myelopathy | - Neck pain <br/> - Bilateral arm symptoms <br/> - Gait disturbance <br/> - Hand clumsiness <br/> - Hyperreflexia <br/> - Bowel/bladder dysfunction [^111vkoEz] | Possible, but no clear myelopathic signs reported |
| Peripheral neuropathy | - Distal symmetric numbness <br/> - Tingling <br/> - Weakness [^116S3TCb] | Less likely due to proximal radiation pattern |
| Brachial plexopathy | - Arm pain <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Sensory changes [^117GwPNu] | Less likely due to bilateral involvement and neck pain |
| Thoracic outlet syndrome | - Arm pain <br/> - Numbness <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Positional symptoms [^117SEr4B] | Less likely due to constant symptoms and neck pain |
| Myofascial pain syndrome | - Neck pain <br/> - Referred arm pain <br/> - Trigger points [^111tqt5H] | Less likely due to neurological symptoms |

---

Given the chronicity, severity, bilateral radiation, and neurological symptoms, **cervical radiculopathy** is most likely [^112GyuyJ].

## Pathophysiology of cervical radiculopathy

Cervical radiculopathy results from **compression or irritation of the cervical nerve roots** [^112JjCVH], most often due to degenerative changes (disc herniation or spondylosis). Compression leads to inflammation, ischemia, and demyelination, causing pain, sensory disturbances, and motor weakness [^114bRJTi].

---

## Clinical evaluation

- **History**: Detailed characterization of pain, neurological symptoms, functional impairment, and red flags (e.g. myelopathy, malignancy, infection) [^112bMHmB].
- **Physical examination**: Neurological examination assessing motor strength, sensory deficits, reflex changes, and provocative tests (Spurling's, distraction, Valsalva) [^115P5mao].
- **Functional assessment**: Neck Disability Index (NDI) to quantify disability and monitor treatment response [^116qbmCY].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **MRI**: Initial imaging modality of choice to visualize nerve root compression, disc herniation, and exclude myelopathy or other serious pathology [^112bMHmB].
- **CT**: Useful if MRI is contraindicated or to assess bony structures [^1156VQ3e].
- **X-ray**: Limited utility but may show degenerative changes [^117T9GvW].

---

## Conservative management

- **Medications**: NSAIDs [^114zeqPE], neuropathic agents (gabapentin, pregabalin), muscle relaxants [^116S3TCb].
- **Physical therapy**: Multimodal approach including mechanical intermittent cervical traction, stretching, strengthening exercises, cervical and thoracic mobilization/manipulation [^113mU6WU].
- **Epidural steroid injections**: Consider if symptoms persist despite conservative measures [^116S3TCb].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for **progressive neurological deficit** — manifested by motor weakness, reflex changes, or sensory loss — or for refractory pain that persists despite conservative therapy [^114bRJTi]. It is also indicated when **myelopathy** is present with evidence of spinal cord compression or dysfunction [^112TSoxC].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis for cervical radiculopathy is **generally favorable**, with most patients improving with conservative management, though chronic symptoms may persist and surgical intervention may be necessary in refractory cases [^114bRJTi] [^112GyuyJ].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **cervical radiculopathy** [^114bRJTi] due to chronic nerve root compression. MRI is the **initial imaging modality of choice** [^112bMHmB], and conservative management should be initiated [^113mU6WU]. Surgical intervention may be necessary if neurological deficits progress or symptoms persist despite conservative treatment [^116S3TCb].

Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition that usually results from compression and inflammation of the cervical nerve root or roots in the region of the neural foramen. It is frequently caused by cervical disc herniation and cervical spondylosis. The diagnosis can be established by history and physical examination, but care should be taken, as diagnoses can mimic or coexist with cervical radiculopathy, such as entrapment neuropathies. The pathophysiology, presentation, and clinical evaluation of cervical radiculopathy are discussed.

### Cervical radiculopathy [^114bRJTi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disorder involving dysfunction of cervical nerve roots that commonly manifests as pain radiating from the neck into the distribution of the affected root. Acute cervical radiculopathy generally has a self-limited clinical course, with up to a 75% rate of spontaneous improvement. Thus, nonsurgical treatment is the appropriate initial approach for most patients. When nonsurgical treatment fails to relieve symptoms or if a significant neurologic deficit exists, surgical decompression may be necessary. Surgical outcomes for relief of arm pain range from 80% to 90% with either anterior or posterior approaches.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neck pain, specifically with respect to physical therapy for neck pain with radiating pain, APTA 2017 guidelines recommend offering mechanical intermittent cervical traction. This should be combined with other interventions such as stretching and strengthening exercises, as well as cervical and thoracic mobilization/manipulation in patients with chronic neck pain with radiating pain. Additionally, provide education and counseling to encourage participation in occupational and exercise activities.

### Nonoperative management of cervical radiculopathy [^116S3TCb]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy describes pain in one or both of the upper extremities, often in the setting of neck pain, secondary to compression or irritation of nerve roots in the cervical spine. It can be accompanied by motor, sensory, or reflex deficits and is most prevalent in persons 50 to 54 years of age. Cervical radiculopathy most often stems from degenerative disease in the cervical spine.

The most common examination findings are painful neck movements and muscle spasm. Diminished deep tendon reflexes, particularly of the triceps, are the most common neurologic finding. The Spurling test, shoulder abduction test, and upper limb tension test can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging is not required unless there is a history of trauma, persistent symptoms, or red flags for malignancy, myelopathy, or abscess. Electrodiagnostic testing is not needed if the diagnosis is clear, but it has clinical utility when peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity is a likely alternate diagnosis.

Patients should be reassured that most cases will resolve regardless of the type of treatment. Nonoperative treatment includes physical therapy involving strengthening, stretching, and potentially traction, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and massage. Epidural steroid injections may be helpful but have higher risks of serious complications. In patients with red flag symptoms or persistent symptoms after four to six weeks of treatment, magnetic resonance imaging can identify pathology amenable to epidural steroid injections or surgery.

### Cervical radiculopathy: Is a prosthesis preferred over fusion surgery? A systematic review [^113BNdEk]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses on the comparison between fusion and prosthesis in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy mainly analyze studies including mixed patient populations: patients with radiculopathy with and without myelopathy. The outcome for patients with myelopathy is different compared to those without. Furthermore, apart from decompression of the spinal cord, restriction of motion is one of the cornerstones of the surgical treatment of spondylotic myelopathy. From this point of view, the results for arthroplasty might be suboptimal for this category of patients. Comparing clinical outcomes in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy is therefore a more valid method to compare the true clinical effect of the prosthesis to that of fusion surgery.

- **Aim**: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of cervical arthroplasty (ACDA) to the clinical outcomes of fusion (ACDF) after anterior cervical discectomy in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy and to evaluate differences with mixed patient populations.

- **Methods**: A literature search was completed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, CENTRAL, and CINAHL using a sensitive search strategy. Studies were selected by predefined selection criteria, including patients exclusively suffering from cervical radiculopathy, and the risk of bias was assessed using a validated Cochrane Checklist adjusted for this purpose. An additional overview of results was added from articles considering a mix of patients suffering from myelopathy with or without radiculopathy.

- **Results**: Eight studies were included.

### Clinical outcomes after surgery for cervical radiculopathy performed in public and private hospitals: A nationwide relative effectiveness study [^115KeGJC]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). High credibility.

This was a comparative effectiveness study of consecutive patients who underwent surgery for degenerative cervical radiculopathy in six public (n = 3,730) and six private (n = 1,020) hospitals in Norway between January 2012 and August 2020. Data were retrieved from the government-funded Norwegian Registry for Spine Surgery (NORspine), intended for research and quality improvement. This registry includes data from all hospitals performing cervical spinal surgery with 100% inclusion in 2020. Approximately 82% of those who undergo surgery for degenerative cervical radiculopathy in Norway are included in the registry. Most of the patients who are not recorded in the registry have undergone emergency surgery, particularly during weekends and holidays.

- **Methods**: The study is presented in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. It was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK-Midt; 2016/840) and the scientific committee of the NORspine. Consent to participate in the NORspine is voluntary and not required for access to the treatment.

All patients who underwent surgery for degenerative cervical radiculopathy with an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion were eligible for inclusion. In order to make the groups of patients as comparable as possible, patients with myelopathy, those who underwent surgery using a posterior approach, and those who had previously undergone cervical spinal surgery were excluded. The NORspine does not include patients aged < 16 years, those unable to…

### Occupation-related cervical spine disease in orthopaedic surgeons [^1142f5q7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Musculoskeletal injury can substantially affect orthopaedic surgeons and their productivity. The objective of this study was to assess occupation-related neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy among orthopaedic surgeons and to identify the potential risk factors for injury.

- **Methods**: An online survey was sent to orthopaedic surgeons via their state orthopaedic society. The survey consisted of items related to orthopaedic practices, such as the number of arthroscopic procedures performed and the use of microscopes/loupes. The prevalence, potential causes, and reporting practices of neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy among orthopaedic surgeons were also assessed.

- **Results**: There were 685 responses from surgeons representing 27 states. A total of 59.3% of respondents reported neck pain, and 22.8% reported cervical radiculopathy. After adjusting for age and sex, surgeons performing arthroscopy had an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 8.3, P = 0.007) for neck pain. Only five of the surgeons with neck pain and one of those with cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy had ergonomic evaluations.

- **Conclusion**: Neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy are common among orthopaedic surgeons. Associated factors included older age, higher stress levels, and performing arthroscopy. Cervical injuries are rarely reported, and ergonomic workplace evaluations are infrequent.

### Improvements in neck and arm pain following an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion [^113Q744V]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis was conducted to quantify improvements in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) neck and arm pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Short Form-12 (SF-12) Mental (MCS) and Physical (PCS) Composite scores following an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). ACDF is evaluated with patient-reported outcomes. However, the extent to which these outcomes improve following ACDF remains poorly defined.

A surgical registry of patients who underwent primary, one- or two-level ACDF during 2013 to 2015 was reviewed. Comparisons of VAS neck and arm, NDI, and SF-12 MCS and PCS scores were performed using paired t-tests from preoperative to each postoperative time point. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to estimate the reduction in neck and arm pain over the first postoperative year. Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with predominant neck (pNP) or arm (pAP) pain, as well as for one- versus two-level ACDF.

Eighty-nine patients were identified in the study. VAS neck and arm, NDI, and SF-12 PCS improved from preoperative scores at all postoperative time points (P < 0.05 for each). Across the first postoperative year, patients reported a 2.7-point (44.2%) reduction in neck and a 3.1-point (54.0%) reduction in arm pain (P < 0.05 for each). Sixty-one patients with pNP and 28 patients with pAP reported reductions in neck and arm pain over the first 6 months and 12 weeks postoperatively, respectively (P < 0.05 for each).

Patients who underwent one-level ACDFs experienced a 47.2% reduction in pain.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111KCknQ]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Non-specific and subtle early features that overlap with other neurological conditions can delay the diagnosis. Incomplete neurological assessments by professionals with a poor awareness of the disease further contribute to this delay. A retrospective study of medical records of 42 patients in Israel who underwent surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) noted an average delay of 2.2 years (range 1.7 months to 8.9 years) from initiation of symptoms to diagnosis. On average, 5.2 ± 3.6 consultations were required before a diagnosis was made. Forty-three percent of these patients had symptoms of numbness and pain in their hands and were initially diagnosed, and sometimes treated, for carpal tunnel syndrome. In our clinical experience, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially when diagnosed bilaterally, is often incorrect, and DCM usually accounts for these symptoms.

### Impact of predominant symptom location among patients undergoing cervical spine surgery on 12-month outcomes: an analysis from the Quality Outcomes Database [^117M2b5Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Low credibility.

The impact of the type of pain presentation on outcomes of spine surgery remains elusive. This study aimed to assess the impact of predominant symptom location (predominant arm pain vs predominant neck pain vs equal neck and arm pain) on postoperative improvement in patient-reported outcomes.

The Quality Outcomes Database cervical spine module was queried for patients undergoing 1- or 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative spine disease. A total of 9,277 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these patients, 18.4% presented with predominant arm pain, 32.3% presented with predominant neck pain, and 49.3% presented with equal neck and arm pain. Patients with predominant neck pain were found to have higher (worse) 12-month Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores (coefficient 0.24, 95% CI 0.15–0.33; p < 0.0001). The three groups did not differ significantly in odds of return to work and achieving minimal clinically important difference in NDI score at the 12-month follow-up.

Analysis from a national spine registry showed significantly lower odds of patient satisfaction and worse NDI scores at 1 year after surgery for patients with predominant neck pain compared with patients with predominant arm pain and those with equal neck and arm pain after 1- or 2-level ACDF. With regard to return to work, all three groups (arm pain, neck pain, and equal arm and neck pain) were found to be similar after multivariable analysis.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^11565qXj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Data extracted from studies designed for other objectives highlights certain trends. More procedures were performed on one to two joints than on multiple joints, and a large majority of procedures were unilateral. No sustained complications or side effects were reported that could be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or RFA, even in cases where the TON was ablated bilaterally alone or in combination with other medial branches.

- **Studies discussing facet joints**:
	- Research by the same group of investigators has focused on determining, through controlled blocks performed one level at a time, the number and distribution of affected joints in patients with chronic neck pain following whiplash. In the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement. Although elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis often experience multiple levels concomitantly affected, the clinical significance of this concerning other degenerative changes (e.g. uncovertebral joints, cervical discs) remains unclear. Performing MBB at multiple segments may lead to unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial RFA but for subsequent procedures as well.

- **Case reports**:
	- There are two published case reports of dropped head syndrome following cervical medial branch RFA. In one instance, s

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^1112o1Y7]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The C2–3 facet joint pathology is considered a valid etiology of cervicogenic headaches. The C2–3 facet joint is innervated by the third occipital nerve (TON); hence, headaches arising from C2–3 pathology were called third occipital headache in the past. Lord and colleagues evaluated the prevalence of TON headache among 100 patients with neck pain for at least 3 months following whiplash using history, physical examination, and diagnostic cervical medial branch block (MBB) with local anesthetics (LA). The prevalence of TON headache in this cohort was 27% (95% CI 18% to 36%) and as high as 53% (95% CI 37% to 68%) among those with headache as the dominant symptom. No unique features on history or examination correlated with positive MBB results. Patients with a positive block were significantly more likely to be tender over the C2–3 facet joint, with a sensitivity of 85%.

Reports in the literature suggest available evidence is not definitive on any symptoms or signs being specific for the cervical facet joints as the cause of pain. The generally accepted reference standard for diagnosing the cervical facet joints as the primary cause of pain is relief of the pain following cervical MBB with LA of nerves that supply the putative painful joint(s). Diagnostic blocks are performed at segments suggested by matching the distribution of the patient's pain with known referral patterns or by identifying tender areas under fluoroscopy.

### Cervical sagittal alignment and related factor analysis and prediction model in patients undergoing revision surgery after anterior cervical fusion [^115pwfBn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

From January 2010 to January 2022, 110 patients with symptomatic myelopathy/radiculopathy who underwent cervical fusion through ACCF or ACDF were consecutively collected from the hospital database. Eleven patients' radiographic images and other additional follow-up data were missing. Therefore, 99 patients (65 male and 34 female) were eligible for this study. Patients were divided into two groups (A and B). Patients in group A underwent revision surgery after the first surgery failed, whereas patients in group B underwent surgery with the same surgeon as patients in group A without failure. Data were retrieved from the medical records.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Weakness, pain in the neck and shoulder, upper limb numbness, impaired muscle tone, or signs and symptoms of peripheral nerve injury after excluding other systemic diseases; hyperreflexia hypertonia, positive pathological signs, and symptoms of upper motor neuron injury; patients with a follow-up period of more than 2 years with complete radiographic data; adult patients (> 18 years old).

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients with incomplete radiographic images; patients missing during follow-up; patients with cervical tumor or other cervical diseases; patients with a history of revision surgery due to cervical trauma.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: A multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^113jTSkU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

This prospective study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee (EK‐2010‐0271, 16‐5149‐AE). It was registered as NCT 02170155 in Zurich and Toronto. Informed written consent was obtained from each participant before study enrollment. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.

- **Study population**: Thirty-eight patients with mild to moderate degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) were recruited between 2017 and 2019. This included 19 patients with radiologically established cervical myelopathy, indicated by T2-weighted hyperintensity. Of these, 24 were recruited at University Hospital Balgrist, Zurich, Switzerland, from the spine surgery outpatient clinic, and 14 were recruited at Toronto Western Hospital, Canada. The DCM group consisted of patients with mild (n = 30, with modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association [mJOA] score ≥ 15) to moderate injury (n = 8, with 12 ≤ mJOA ≤ 14), with a mean age of 58.45 years (SD = ± 11.47 years), and included eight females. The 38 healthy participants, significantly younger than the DCM group (p < 0.001), had a mean age of 41.18 years (SD = ± 12.75 years), and included seven females. Of these healthy controls, 24 subjects were from University Hospital Balgrist and 14 were from Toronto Western Hospital. Inclusion criteria for DCM patients were the presence of degenerative cervical spinal cord compression with focal myelopathy on MRI and/or clinical signs and symptoms of cervical myelopathy, such as clumsy hands, segmental sensory deficits, pain, gait disturbances, and bladder dysfunction.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^117SEr4B]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

With regard to criteria for the inclusion of patients, many authors stress the value of elaborate history taking. Except on pain, however, we found no specific mention of history taking being included in the diagnostic criteria of studies.

Neck pain radiating into the arm or cervicobrachial pain is a common feature in cervical radiculopathy (CR), but not a distinguishable one per se, as it could have other causes such as thoracic outlet syndrome or referred pain. Nerve root compression is supposed to result in both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Possibly, future selection criteria should also take these different natures of pain into account. A more specific definition of CR should therefore include an ability to distinguish the nerve root pain present in CR from other musculoskeletal disorders and other neurological conditions, such as brachial plexus pathology, pseudo-radicular pain, peripheral nerve entrapment, or even non-specific neck pain.

We did not find any mention of the use of validated questionnaires for distinguishing neuropathic from nociceptive pain such as the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ), ID Pain, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN-4), or painDETECT. Because neuropathic pain has a worse prognosis than nociceptive pain and there are treatments that specifically target neuropathic pain, future studies could consider using the questionnaires to select and tailor participants to different treatment strategies.

Diagnostic labeling could well include results from physical examination. Only five studies mentioned this aspect, highlighting a gap in thorough diagnostic protocols.

### Ambulatory care vs overnight hospitalization after anterior surgery for cervical radiculopathy: The FACADE randomized clinical trial [^112t3MYU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The FACADE study was published in 2024 in the journal JAMA Network Open. It investigated whether ambulatory care is non-inferior to overnight hospital surveillance in patients after anterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical radiculopathy. This multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial included 105 patients (54 female, 51 male). Adult patients aged 18–62 years who underwent the specified surgical procedure for cervical radiculopathy were included. Key exclusion criteria were cervical myelopathy, unemployment, comorbidities necessitating extended sick leave or previous cervical operation, active malignancy, pregnancy, and the use of alcohol, drugs, or narcotics.

Interventions compared in the study were ambulatory care, which involved discharge 6–8 hours after the procedure (n = 52), and overnight hospital surveillance lasting more than 24 hours (n = 53). The primary outcome measured was the difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in the Neck Disability Index at six months (13.3% vs. 12.2%; MD 1.1, 95% CI -4.6 to 6.8). Secondary outcomes included no significant difference in arm pain at six months (1.7% vs. 1.6%; MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.8 to 1), and no significant difference in neck pain at six months (2.1% vs. 1.8%; MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.7 to 1).

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^111REXsC]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Data extracted from studies designed for other objectives

More procedures were performed on one to two joints than on multiple joints, and a large majority of procedures were unilateral. No sustained complication or side effects were reported that can be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or RFA, even in cases in which the TON was ablated bilaterally alone or in combination with other medial branches.

- **Studies reporting bilateral and/or multi-level cervical medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation**: Studies have shown that investigators sought to determine, through controlled blocks performed one level at a time, the number and distribution of affected joints in patients with chronic neck pain after whiplash. In the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement. Although elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis often have multiple levels concomitantly affected, the clinical significance of this in the context of other degenerative changes (e.g. uncovertebral joints, cervical discs) is unclear. Performing MBB at multiple segments may lead to the unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial RFA but for subsequent procedures as well.

Case reports have documented two instances of dropped head syndrome following cervical medial branch RFA.

A 75-year-old man presented with neck pain (neck visual analog scale score: 4), bilateral radiating arm pain (arm visual analog scale score: 5/6), and gait disturbance for 3 months (Supplemental Digital Content 1). On admission, neurologic examination revealed a spastic gait, hand clumsiness, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Pathologic Babinski sign and ankle clonus were present. Muscle strength of both upper and lower extremities was decreased.

Grip and release test was performed 12 times for 20 seconds each. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 8. However, he reported no dysuria or constipation. An evaluation of the patient's trauma history revealed that he experienced severe trauma to the neck following a fall from 5 meters, 31 years ago, but he experienced no neurologic deficit or any sign of spinal cord injury. He had been admitted to a local private hospital for 1 week and underwent radiographic examination.

Posterior AOD was suspected at axial CT scans then, but he was discharged without receiving any surgery from the hospital because his pain improved after brace and pain medications. Since that time, he has been working as a farmer for 30 years without any significant problems but with almost impossible daily activity at the time of admission.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: A multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^111srsvn]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Background and purpose**: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a prevalent form of spinal cord dysfunction in adults. This study utilizes quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess neurodegeneration in both the cervical cord and brain, providing valuable insights into DCM's impact on neural structures.

- **Methods**: This multicenter study includes multiple cohorts from diverse centers globally. Quantitative MRI measures were used to evaluate neurodegenerative changes, focusing on the cervical cord volume and brain regions often affected by DCM.

- **Results**: The findings reveal significant correlations between cervical cord volume reduction and specific brain region atrophy. These results highlight the extended impact of DCM beyond the spine, affecting brain structures and potentially influencing clinical outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Quantitative MRI offers a powerful tool for assessing neurodegenerative changes in DCM. The integration of cervical cord and brain analyses may enhance understanding and management of the disease.

The compelling evidence from this study emphasizes the need for comprehensive diagnostic approaches in DCM, considering both the cervical cord and brain for a complete assessment of neural degeneration.

### Neurological manifestations of cervical spondylosis: An overview of signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology [^113ePv4e]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The neurological manifestations of cervical spondylosis include symptomatic compression of the spinal cord (myelopathy), nerve roots (radiculopathy), or a combination of the two (myeloradiculopathy). The term myeloradiculopathy herein defines these often indistinct and inseparable entities. The pathophysiology of myeloradiculopathy is multifactorial in nature, and the natural history of untreated myeloradiculopathy is not clearly defined. We review the signs, symptoms, and clinical findings of cervical myelopathy, radiculopathy, and myeloradiculopathy. Standard grading techniques are also reviewed.

### Long-term results after surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116M2Qab]. Neurosurgery (2024). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a frequent cause of spinal cord dysfunction, and surgical treatment is considered safe and effective. However, long-term results after surgery are limited. This study investigated long-term clinical outcomes through data from the Norwegian registry for spine surgery.

- **Methods**: Patients operated on at the university hospitals serving Central and Northern Norway were approached for long-term follow-up after 3 to 8 years. The primary outcome was the change in the Neck Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were changes in the European Myelopathy Scale score, quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D), numeric rating scales (NRS) for headache, neck pain, and arm pain, and the perceived benefit of surgery assessed by the Global Perceived Effect scale from 1 year to long-term follow-up.

- **Results**: We included 144 patients operated on between January 2013 and June 2018. In total, 123 participants (85.4%) provided patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at long-term follow-up. There was no significant change in PROMs from 1 year to long-term follow-up, including:

	- Neck Disability Index (mean 1.0, 95% CI −2.1 to 4.1, P = 0.53),
	- European Myelopathy Scale score (mean −0.3, 95% CI −0.7 to 0.1, P = 0.09),
	- EQ-5D index score (mean −0.02, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.05, P = 0.51),
	- NRS neck pain (mean 0.3, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.9, P = 0.22),
	- NRS arm pain (mean −0.1, 95% CI −0.8 to 0.5, P = 0.70),
	- NRS headache (mean 0.4, 95% CI −0.1 to 0.9, P = 0.11).

	- According to Global Perceived Effect assessments, 106 out of 121 patients (87.6%) reported being stable or improved ("complete recovery", "much better").

### Naglazyme [^112m2Wez]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Spinal or cervical cord compression with resultant myelopathy is a known and serious complication of MPS VI. Such compression is expected to occur in the natural history of the disease, including in patients on Naglazyme. There have been postmarketing reports of patients treated with Naglazyme who experienced the onset or worsening of spinal or cervical cord compression requiring decompression surgery. Patients with MPS VI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal/cervical cord compression, such as back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, and urinary and fecal incontinence, and given appropriate clinical care.

### Cochrane review on the role of surgery in cervical spondylotic radiculomyelopathy [^1169LWyR]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

This study involved a search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The authors of the identified randomized controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data. The trials selected for this study included all the truly unconfounded or quasi-randomized controlled investigations allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to:

- **Trial groups**: 1) "best medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management", or 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.

The objective was to determine whether surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcomes compared to conservative management. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate whether the timing of surgery (immediate or delayed due to persistence or progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcomes.

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce pain and disability but is associated with a small but definite risk. This study sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery.

Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^1114yLnd]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This is the first systematic review on definitions and selection criteria for cervical radiculopathy (CR). Although CR is often mentioned as a distinct entity in the assessment of patients with neck pain, most studies use their own criteria to subclassify patients with CR, making comparisons difficult.

One limitation was that we included only published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Relevant unpublished trials were not included, which could lead to publication bias. However, if they exist, these studies are likely to be small, increase heterogeneity, and thus are unlikely to change our results.

For this review, we excluded studies that focused solely on surgical interventions, as such studies may recruit a different patient group to justify the need for invasive treatment.

We recommend aiming for a consensus on a definition of CR and selection criteria among experts in this area, preferably with criteria that are quantifiable with validated clinical tests. Data from two recent RCTs support the clinical finding that patients usually report more arm pain than neck pain. We suggest defining CR as: "Radiating pain in the arm with motor, reflex, and/or sensory changes (such as paraesthesiae or numbness), provoked by neck posture(s) and/or movement(s)". It is the researchers' intent to conduct a Delphi study on this definition among different international researchers and practitioners. We propose the following selection criteria: pain radiating into the arm and motor, reflex, and/or sensory changes in the upper limb.

### Diagnostic role of flexion-extension central motor conduction time in cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^1148XUKi]. Spine (2021). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a disease resulting from progressive compression of the spinal canal and the cervical cord due to degenerative changes of the cervical vertebrae and is usually concomitant with aging. Representative degenerative conditions of cervical stenosis are intervertebral disc protrusion, spondylolisthesis, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). They provoke symptoms that range from mild neck pain and radiating pain to spinal cord syndromes such as paresthesia, weakness, clumsy hand, and gait disturbance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized as a diagnostic tool for confirming cord compression. Many patients with CSM show not only static cord compression in a neutral neck position but also dynamic cord compression during neck flexion and extension. Numerous studies describe the diagnosis of compressive cervical myelopathy using dynamic MRI as well as static MRI to identify impingement of the cervical cord.

Electrophysiological studies have also been conducted to evaluate not only spinal cord compression but combined neurologic conditions such as cervical radiculopathy and peripheral neuropathies. Among these electrophysiological evaluations, motor evoked potential (MEP) recorded by transcranial magnetic stimulation is a key variable to ascertain whether there is a disturbance of central motor conduction along the corticospinal tract. It has been widely reported that central motor conduction time (CMCT) derived from MEP and motor conduction studies are objective and sensitive values to assess central motor conduction disturbances.

### Pulsed radiofrequency adjacent to the cervical dorsal root ganglion in chronic cervical radicular pain: a double blind sham controlled randomized clinical trial [^111DXHby]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radicular pain affects approximately 1 in 1000 adults per year. Although many treatment modalities are described in the literature, the available evidence for efficacy is not sufficient to allow definitive conclusions on the optimal therapy. The effect of pulsed radiofrequency treatment for these patients was evaluated in a prospective audit, which showed satisfactory pain relief for a mean period of 9.2 months, justifying a randomized sham-controlled trial.

In the study, 23 patients out of 256 screened met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either pulsed radiofrequency or sham intervention. The evaluation was conducted by an independent observer. At three months, the pulsed radiofrequency group exhibited a significantly better outcome with regard to the global perceived effect (> 50% improvement) and visual analogue scale (20-point pain reduction). Quality of life scales also showed a positive trend in favor of the pulsed radiofrequency group, though significance was only reached in the SF-36 domain vitality at three months. The need for pain medication was significantly reduced in the pulsed radiofrequency group after six months. No complications were observed during the study period.

These study results are in agreement with the findings of our previous clinical audit that pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the cervical dorsal root ganglion may provide pain relief for a limited number of carefully selected patients with chronic cervical radicular pain, as assessed by clinical and neurological examination.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: A systematic review [^112JjCVH]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a widespread diagnosis that typically presents with symptoms such as neck, shoulder, and upper limb pain, as well as upper limb paraesthesia and weakness. These symptoms are attributed to cervical nerve root irritation. The clinical diagnosis of CR primarily relies on the outcomes of history taking and physical examination. This examination may reveal diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal or myotomal distribution.

Epidemiological data on CR are sparse. A population-based study indicated that CR had an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, with the age-specific annual incidence rate peaking at 202.9 for the age group 50–54 years. Another study reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1,000 people and a peak annual incidence of 2.1 cases per 1,000 people, which increased to a peak at age 50–59 years.

The aetiology in 70–75% of cases is due to foraminal compression of the spinal nerve. This can result from factors such as a reduction in disc height and anterior and posterior degenerative changes of the uncovertebral and zygapophyseal joints. The most common level of nerve root compression is C7, followed by C6; compression of roots C5 and C8 are less frequent. A herniated disc in the cervical spine accounts for only 20–25% of cases of CR. CR as a direct result of cervical trauma or metastases is infrequent. Although CR is a common diagnosis, there is still no consensus on the definition. The differential diagnosis of CR can be extensive and includes various conditions.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115ieCpK]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Ask patients to report any worsening or new symptoms or signs as untreated levels of the cervical spine might further degenerate and cause spinal cord compression.

- **Education into practice**: What features would prompt you to suspect DCM in a patient? How would you explain a diagnosis of DCM to your patient? Are you aware of the appropriate local pathways for arranging an urgent MRI scan for patients with suspected DCM? After reading this article, are there any aspects of imaging or referral that you would approach differently?

- **How patients were involved in the creation of this article**: This article was reviewed and endorsed by individuals experiencing DCM who were part of a committee at Myelopathy.org. The committee was keen to emphasize the possible prevalence of DCM and its long-term effects, even after surgery. More specifically, it was involved in shaping the paragraph "What is DCM?"

Myelopathy.org is the first organization dedicated to raising awareness, providing information, and supporting research for DCM. It provides a forum for individuals to communicate their experiences of DCM and offers peer-to-peer support to patients. Reports of delayed and/or misdiagnosis are common, which result from a lack of awareness among frontline medical specialties, particularly primary care. The committee proposed an educational initiative, which included this article.

### To use or not use intraoperative neuromonitoring: Utilization of neuromonitoring during spine surgeries and associated conflicts of interest, a cross-sectional survey study [^114wrer1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring at the spinal cord level is crucial. In all cervical and thoracic scenarios where somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are used, concurrent motor evoked potentials (conMEPs) are omitted 14% of the time. In cervical radiculopathy scenarios such as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), corpectomy, and laminoforaminotomy, conMEPs are not used 24% of the time when SSEPs are applied. For scenarios involving myelopathy, deformity, cord compression, and neurological symptoms, conMEPs are not used 11% of the time alongside SSEPs.

Concentric electromyography (conEMG) use with SSEPs occurs in 74% of all spinal cord level cases, rising to 87% for radiculopathy cases, and decreasing to 64% for scenarios involving myelopathy, deformity, cord compression, or neurological symptoms.

Limited-use intraoperative neuromonitoring is observed in the data. Only 2% of respondents avoided the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) across all surveyed surgical scenarios (4% of neurosurgeons and none of the orthopedic surgeons). Another 2% restricted the use of IONM solely to deformity cases, and 2% utilized IONM exclusively for lateral lumbar interbody cases. Additionally, 11% of respondents applied IONM only to deformity, myelopathy, trauma cases with cord symptoms, or lateral lumbar fusion scenarios. We observed no significant differences between respondents from states with and without tort reform concerning the absence or limited use of IONM.

	- **Papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure**: Serious events of papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure have been reported. Monitor for symptoms; diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.

	- **Aseptic meningitis**: Serious events of aseptic meningitis have been reported. Monitor for symptoms; diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.

- **Myelitis and/or radiculitis**:

	- Serious adverse reactions of myelitis and radiculitis have been reported in patients treated with Qalsody. Six patients treated with Qalsody experienced myelitis or radiculitis in clinical studies. Two patients discontinued treatment and required symptomatic management with full resolution of symptoms. In the remaining four patients, symptoms resolved without discontinuation of Qalsody. If symptoms consistent with myelitis or radiculitis develop, diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care. Management may require interruption or discontinuation of Qalsody.

- **Papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure**:

	- Serious adverse reactions of papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure have been reported in patients treated with Qalsody. Four patients developed elevated intracranial pressure and/or papilledema.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^111tqt5H]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, especially during the initial assessment, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend using motion limitations in the cervical and upper thoracic regions, the presence of cervicogenic headache, a history of trauma, and referred or radiating pain into an upper extremity for classifying neck pain into the following categories:

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Evaluate for issues in movement range or joint flexibility.

- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments (including whiplash-associated disorder)**: Focus on disorders affecting the coordination of neck movements.

- **Neck pain with headaches (cervicogenic headache)**: Identify headaches that originate from the cervical spine area.

- **Neck pain with radiating pain (radicular)**: Assess pain that extends beyond the neck region, typically down the arms.

### Development and validation of cervical prediction models for patient-reported outcomes at 1 year after cervical spine surgery for radiculopathy and myelopathy [^112z19n1]. Spine (2020). Low credibility.

This retrospective analysis of prospectively collected registry data aims to develop and validate prediction models for 12-month patient-reported outcomes of disability, pain, and myelopathy in patients undergoing elective cervical spine surgery.

Predictive models have the potential to be utilized preoperatively to set expectations, adjust modifiable characteristics, and provide a patient-centered model of care. The study uses data from the cervical module of the Quality Outcomes Database. The outcomes of interest include disability (Neck Disability Index), pain (Numeric Rating Scale), and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for myelopathy. Multivariable proportional odds ordinal regression models were developed for patients with cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. Patient demographics, clinical and surgical covariates, as well as baseline patient-reported outcomes scores, were included in all models. The models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling to estimate likely performance on a new sample of patients.

A total of 4,988 patients underwent surgery for radiculopathy and 2,641 for myelopathy. The baseline Neck Disability Index score was identified as the most important predictor of poor postoperative outcomes at 12 months for patients with radiculopathy, while the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was key for patients with myelopathy. Additionally, factors such as symptom duration, workers' compensation, age, employment, and ambulatory and smoking status, were found to significantly impact outcomes.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cervical myelopathy and lumbar radiculopathy [^117DqyBw]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

There have been few reports describing cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with spinal degenerative disorders. This study investigated whether interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) could be detected in the CSF of patients with cervical myelopathy or lumbar radiculopathy and whether the concentrations of these cytokines correlated with the severity of disease conditions. CSF samples were obtained from 21 patients with cervical myelopathy (Group M), 19 patients with lumbar radiculopathy (Group R), and six volunteers (control). The concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in Groups M and R than in the control group, possibly indicating spinal cord and nerve root damage, respectively. However, TNF-alpha was lower than the detection limit. IL-1β was detected in only five samples from three patients in Group M and two volunteers in the control group. The concentrations of IL-6 did not show any correlation with symptom duration, the scoring system by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association, or the duration of nerve root block. There is a possibility that the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in CSF can indicate certain pathological aspects of cervical myelopathy or lumbar radiculopathy.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy and radiculopathy treated by oblique corpectomies without fusion [^112xKKBH]. Neurosurgical Review (2004). Low credibility.

Oblique corpectomy (OC) is an alternative technique for the resection of spondylotic spurs ventral to the cervical spinal cord, contributing to cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR). To evaluate the efficacy of OC for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy, we reviewed our experience with OC. Twenty-six patients, 18 males and 8 females, were studied, with an average age of 51.3 years (range 30–72). Thirteen had myelopathy, and 13 had radiculopathy. Both magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) were performed preoperatively to define the extent of pathology. The Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to grade the quality of the outcome. Neurologic and radiologic results were assessed.

- **Myelopathy results**: Good and excellent results were observed in 76.9% of the cases with myelopathy.
- **Radiculopathy results**: Improvement of radicular symptoms was noted in 84.6% of the cases with radiculopathy.
- **Neuroimaging results**: Neuroimaging studies confirmed satisfactory anatomical decompression in all patients. Sagittal alignment decreased from 13 degrees to 12 degrees.
- **Implications of age and severity**: The degree of postoperative recovery seemed to be directly related to the age and severity of the preoperative myelopathy.

This surgical technique has shown excellent clinical outcomes with fast recovery and adequate anatomical decompression in patients with CSM and CSR.

### Neck pain with radiculopathy [^1127g5xx]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Non-specific neck pain has a postural or mechanical basis and affects about two-thirds of people at some stage, especially in middle age. Acute neck pain typically resolves within days or weeks but may become chronic in about 10% of individuals. Whiplash injuries, which result from sudden acceleration-deceleration of the neck, such as in traffic or sporting accidents, can lead to prolonged symptoms. Up to 40% of individuals continue to report symptoms 15 years after the incident, although this varies by country.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic overview to address the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? What are the effects of injection treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? What are the effects of drug treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other key databases up to September 2014. Clinical Evidence overviews are periodically updated; please check our website for the most current version of this overview.

- **Results**: In this update, electronic database searches retrieved 368 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 226 records were screened for inclusion. Appraisal of titles and abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 142 studies and the further review of 41 full publications. Of these 41 full articles, four systematic reviews and one RCT were added in this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy of different treatment modalities for neck pain with radiculopathy.

We conducted a cohort study of clinically asymptomatic spondylotic cervical cord compression cases with the primary endpoint of the development of clinical signs of cervical myelopathy.

- **Objectives**: To investigate whether various demographic, clinical, radiologic, and electrophysiological parameters could predict progression from clinically asymptomatic (preclinical) spondylotic cervical cord compression to symptomatic myelopathy.

- **Summary of background data**: The data available on the prediction of the outcome in surgical and conservative treatment of spondylotic cervical myelopathy are controversial. Little is known about the clinical natural history of asymptomatic magnetic resonance image-detected spondylotic cervical cord compression and/or changes of signal intensity.

- **Methods**: A group of 66 patients (32 women, 34 men, median age 50 years) with magnetic resonance signs of spondylotic cervical cord compression but without clear clinical signs of myelopathy was followed prospectively for at least 2 years (range, 2–8 years; median, 4 years). Various demographic, clinical, imaging, and electrophysiological parameters were correlated with clinical outcome.

- **Results**: Clinical signs of myelopathy during the follow-up period were detected in 13 patients (19.7%). The only variables significantly associated with the development of clinically symptomatic spondylotic cervical myelopathy (SCM) were the presence of symptomatic cervical radiculopathy, electromyographic signs of anterior horn lesion, and abnormal somatosensory-evoked potentials.

### Diagnosis and nonoperative management of cervical radiculopathy [^111FnPs7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2000). Low credibility.

The study design involves a qualitative, comprehensive literature review.

- **Objective**: To discuss and summarize the peer-reviewed literature related to the management of patients with cervical radiculopathy.

- **Background**: Cervical radiculopathy is a lesion of the cervical spinal nerve root with a reported prevalence of 3.3 cases per 1000 people; the peak annual incidence is 2.1 cases per 1000 and occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Nerve root injury can potentially produce significant functional limitations and disability.

- **Methods and measures**: A search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for the periods 1966, 1982, and 1996, respectively, to December 1999 was conducted using selected keywords and MeSH headings. The bibliography of all retrieved articles was searched and pertinent articles were obtained. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was also searched. Literature related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cervical radiculopathy was thoroughly reviewed and summarized using a critical appraisal approach.

- **Results**: Although cervical radiculopathy remains largely a clinical diagnosis, the true diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination for cervical radiculopathy is unknown. Imaging and electrophysiologic tests are capable of detecting clinically significant problems in many patients, and each modality has inherent strengths and weaknesses; technical as well as practical factors affect the choice of procedure. The natural course of cervical radiculopathy appears to be generally favorable but no prognostic or risk factors have been definitively identified.

### Results of halter cervical traction for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy: Retrospective review of 81 patients [^1117hDyc]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

The percentage of patients responding to conservative treatment for cervical radiculopathy secondary to nerve root compression is not well quantified. To clarify this question, the authors retrospectively reviewed the records obtained over a four-year period in patients with cervical radiculopathy to determine their response to conservative measures, including cervical collar therapy and halter cervical traction.

Cervical radiculopathy was diagnosed in patients if they suffered from radiating arm pain worsened by neck movement and at least one of the following: reflex loss, dermatomal numbness, and/or myotomal weakness. Patients with neck pain alone or arm pain without neurological deficits were excluded from analysis. Those patients without excruciating pain, severe weakness, or evidence of myelopathy were offered a course of halter traction before surgery was considered. Ninety-six patients met the inclusion criteria; there were 61 males and 35 females, with a mean age of 47 years. Fifty-five patients presented with C-7 radiculopathy, 37 with C-6, two with C-5, and two with C-8.

Eighty-one patients underwent a trial of traction that consisted of wearing a cervical collar and home-based halter cervical traction: 8 to 12 pounds, applied for 15 minutes, three times a day for three to six weeks. The mean duration of symptoms prior to neurosurgical evaluation was 43 days ± 8.3 days (standard deviation). Sixty-three (78%) of 81 patients responded to therapeutic traction, experiencing significant or total pain relief. Three patients could not tolerate the traction.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112bvBZZ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **History and physical examination**: Cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most common clinically implicated in neck pain, while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration. Injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain, particularly in cases of whiplash.

- **Prognostic blocks criteria**: Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥ 4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least 6 weeks, in the absence of focal neurological findings. The targeted facet joints are usually decided on based on patient report and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy. In patients who are postsurgical, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty.

- **Factors decreasing probability**: Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis.

In a study by Cohen et al, historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes included pain radiating to the occiput and a history…

### Degenerative spondylolisthesis of the cervical spine — symptoms and surgical strategies depending on disease progress [^116XLSWd]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis of the cervical spine is rare. Patients exhibit signs of progressive myelopathy, radiculopathy, and pain. Treatment strategies include ventral, dorsal, and combined fusion techniques with or without repositioning and decompression.

- **Methods**: In this study, we present 16 patients with degenerative cervical spondylolisthesis. The leading symptom was severe myelopathy in eight patients, radiculomyelopathy in five patients, and neck pain in three patients. However, neck pain was the initial symptom in all patients and decreased as neurological symptoms became more evident. Radiographic examinations included plain radiography, MRI, CT, myelography, and lateral tomography.

- **Results**: Spondylolisthesis was located five times at levels C3/4, C4/5, and C5/6. In three cases, spondylolisthesis was located at level C7/T1. There were two patients with spondylolisthesis at two levels. Instability was demonstrated by flexion/extension radiography in five cases. Patients were divided into three groups according to a newly introduced classification system. The surgical approach corresponded to this classification. In ten patients, the spondylolisthesis could be corrected by extension and positioning, so discectomy and fusion on one or two levels with a cage, plate, and screws were sufficient. In five cases, corpectomy was necessary due to severe spondylosis. In one case, a combined approach with dorsal decompression and release followed by ventral fusion was applied due to additional dorsal spinal cord compression. The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 52 months. After surgery…

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: A systematic review [^111vxUhM]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical symptoms

Pain

Eleven studies reported pain as a selection criterion. One study specified that pain intensity should be above 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Another study mentioned using the inclusion criteria from a different study. The location of pain — whether in the arm and/or neck — was described in 11 studies. However, two studies did not further explain the terms 'cervicobrachial pain' and 'neck pain'. Two studies reported solely arm pain, with one indicating that arm pain with radiation distal to the elbow, along with provocation of arm pain by neck movements, should be positive as a selection criterion. Six studies included patients with both neck pain and arm pain, with three of these requiring nerve root distribution of the pain for inclusion.

Five studies described the duration of pain as a selection criterion. These included patients with pain duration ranging from 1 month to between 6 months and 2 years.

There was consensus in 11 out of 13 studies (85%) on pain as a selection criterion, but no consensus on the exact location, intensity, or duration of the pain. Only 6 out of 13 studies (46%) required both neck and arm pain to be simultaneously present.

Sensory symptoms

Five studies used sensory symptoms as selection criteria. One study mentioned using reflex disturbances, motor and sensory deficits, along with the distribution of pain.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^115P5mao]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining assessments of impairments of body function during the initial assessment of a patient with neck pain over an episode of care. This approach helps establish baselines, monitor changes over time, and assist in clinical decision-making to rule in or rule out various conditions.

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, and cervical and thoracic segmental mobility tests.

- **Neck pain with headache**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, and upper cervical segmental mobility testing.

- **Neck pain with radiating pain**: Neurodynamic testing, Spurling's test, distraction test, and Valsalva test.

- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments**: Cranial cervical flexion and neck flexor muscle endurance tests.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111vkoEz]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Detecting early degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) can be challenging. A high index of suspicion, alongside a comprehensive neurological examination, is advised. Commonly reported symptoms and examination findings in DCM include:

- **Clinical**: Pain is a common reason to seek treatment. Musculoskeletal pain might be present in the neck, while neuropathic pain can affect upper and lower limbs and occasionally the trunk. Patients often report neck stiffness, at times without pain. A textbook case would describe gait dysfunction and bilateral hand impairment. Frequently, not all symptoms are present. For example, pain might be absent and symptoms can be unilateral and vary in severity, even on a daily basis. Atypical symptoms such as headaches and muscle cramps are also reported.

The more consistent feature of DCM is the evolution of symptoms. Most patients describe symptoms that have been ongoing for months and getting worse. The rate of progression varies; in some individuals, symptoms remain mild over extended periods of time, while in others, disease progression accelerates. Functional decline can be insidious, and patients might mistakenly attribute these symptoms to "getting older". Typical features include loss of dexterity (difficulty doing up buttons, using keys, mobile phones, or writing) or mobility (use of walking aids or frequent falls).

Symptoms might precede objective examination findings. As in focal central nervous system disorders, examination features in DCM have a low sensitivity — that is, a normal finding does not rule out the disease.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: A systematic review [^117T9GvW]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is used to confirm the presence of a clinically suspected cervical radiculopathy (CR). The diagnostic accuracy of imaging is thought to be limited because asymptomatic radiological abnormalities are commonly seen with advanced imaging studies. This also holds true for plain X-ray studies that exhibit degenerative changes increasing with age, which are unrelated to clinical signs and symptoms. Most often, MRI was used, although data concerning the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CR using MRI are sparse and questionable. A more recent study on the interobserver reliability of MRI evaluation in patients with CR has shown it to be substantial for nerve root compression, with or without previous clinical information. In our study, only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a conservative treatment group were included, implying that we selected a group of patients often seen in primary health-care settings. We suppose that diagnostic imaging is much less often used in this setting due to limited access. This is supported by the North American spine surgeons' clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CR from degenerative disorders. They recommended that MRI be suggested only for the confirmation of correlative compressive lesions in cervical spine patients who failed a course of conservative therapy and who may be candidates for interventional or surgical treatment.

### The effect of an anterior cervical operation for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy on associated headaches [^111GgFzC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Headaches related to the cervical spine have been reported by various authors, and treatment modalities are as varied as their speculated causes. The purpose of this study was to determine if anterior cervical reconstructive surgery (cervical arthrodesis and disc arthroplasty) for the treatment of radiculopathy or myelopathy also helps to alleviate associated headaches.

- **Methods**: We conducted a post hoc analysis of study cohorts combined from prospective studies comparing the results of Prestige and Bryan cervical arthroplasty devices and those of anterior cervical arthrodesis with allograft and anterior instrumentation. A total of 1004 patients (51.6% were male) were evaluated using the Neck Disability Index questionnaire preoperatively and at five points postoperatively, with the latest evaluation at twenty-four months, resulting in a follow-up of 803 patients.

- **Results**: At the twenty-four-month follow-up, the improvement from baseline regarding headache was significant in both groups (p < 0.0001), with patients who underwent arthroplasty reporting numerically better pain scores. Most arthroplasty and arthrodesis patients (64% and 58.5%, respectively) had improvement in the pain score of at least one grade. Conversely, the pain scores for 8.4% of those who had an arthroplasty and 13.7% of those who had arthrodesis worsened by at least one grade. For the remainder, the score was unchanged. Overall, the patients who had an arthroplasty had significant improvement more frequently than did the patients who had arthrodesis (p = 0.011).

### Cervical radiculopathy: Nonoperative management of neck pain and radicular symptoms [^112GyuyJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disease process marked by nerve compression from herniated disk material or arthritic bone spurs. This impingement typically produces neck and radiating arm pain or numbness, sensory deficits, or motor dysfunction in the neck and upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic myelography can confirm neurologic compression. The overall prognosis for persons with cervical radiculopathy is favorable, as most patients improve over time with a focused, nonoperative treatment course.

There is little high-quality evidence on the best nonoperative therapy for cervical radiculopathy. Cervical collars may be used for a short period of immobilization, and traction may temporarily decompress nerve impingement. Medications may help alleviate pain and neuropathic symptoms. Physical therapy and manipulation may improve neck discomfort, and selective nerve blocks target nerve root pain. Although the effectiveness of individual treatments is controversial, a multimodal approach may benefit patients with cervical radiculopathy and associated neck pain.

### The cutaneous silent period is preserved in cervical radiculopathy: Significance for the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy [^111B5823]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity from voluntarily contracting hand muscles undergoes transient suppression following nociceptive fingertip stimulation. This suppression is mediated by a spinal inhibitory reflex designated as the cutaneous silent period (CSP). The CSP is abolished or altered in various myelopathic conditions. However, before the CSP can gain acceptance as an aid in diagnosing myelopathy, the contribution of non-myelopathic conditions that can interrupt the afferent pathways responsible for the CSP needs to be considered.

Accordingly, we examined the effect of radiculopathy on the CSP. Nociceptive stimulation was applied to the thumb (C6 dermatome), middle (C7), and little (C8) fingers of 23 patients with cervical radiculopathy. Four or more CSP responses were recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle following digital stimulation. The patients had C6 (n = 10), C7 (n = 7), or C8 (n = 6) radiculopathy documented by EMG. A complete CSP was elicited in 21 of 23 patients, with comparable latencies and durations irrespective of the digit stimulated.

We conclude that the CSP is preserved in radiculopathy, probably because afferent impulses are carried by smaller, slower conducting 'injury-resistant' A-delta fibers. These results provide important missing evidence that ensures the specificity of CSP alterations in the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy. The finding that the CSP is spared in radiculopathy should open the door for investigators and clinicians to adopt this simple spinal inhibitory reflex as a physiological aid in diagnosing spinal cord dysfunction.

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^112TSoxC]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up.

- **Predictors of progression**: Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression.
- **Nonoperative care**: In the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited.
- **Neuroprotective drug research**: Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### A systematic review of definitions for neurological complications and disease progression in patients treated surgically for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111AGu8N]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review aims to:

- **Outline how neurological complications and disease progression are defined in the literature**: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive, degenerative spine disease often treated surgically. Although uncommon, surgical decompression can be associated with neurological complications such as C5 nerve root palsy, perioperative worsening of myelopathy, and longer-term deterioration. Unfortunately, important questions surrounding these complications cannot be fully addressed due to the heterogeneity in definitions used across studies. Given this variability, there is a pressing need to develop guidelines for the reporting of surgical complications to accurately evaluate the safety of surgical procedures.

- **Evaluate the quality of definitions using a novel four-point rating system**: An electronic database search was conducted in MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies that reported on complications related to DCM surgery and included at least 10 surgically treated patients. Data extracted included study design, surgical details, as well as definitions and rates of surgical complications. A four-point rating scale was developed to assess definition quality for each complication. Our search yielded 2673 unique citations, 42 of which met eligibility criteria and were summarized in this review. Defined complications included neurological deterioration and late onset deterioration.

### Functional outcomes assessment for cervical degenerative disease [^116qbmCY]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to identify valid, reliable, and responsive measures of functional outcome after treatment for cervical degenerative disease.

- **Methods**: The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to functional outcomes. Abstracts were reviewed, and studies meeting inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

- **Results**: The Myelopathy Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and gait analysis were found to be valid and reliable measures (Class II) for assessing cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale, the North American Spine Society scale, and the Neck Disability Index were found to be reliable, valid, and responsive (Class II) for assessing radiculopathy for nonoperative therapy. The Cervical Spine Outcomes Questionnaire was a reliable and valid method (Class II) to assess operative therapy for cervical radiculopathy.

- **Conclusions**: Several functional outcome measures are available.
