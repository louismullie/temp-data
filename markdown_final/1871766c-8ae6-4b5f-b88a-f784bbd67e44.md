## Question

Hand pain following shunt placement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage hand pain after arteriovenous access (dialysis "shunt") creation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of pain onset and its qualitative features to separate ischemic from neuropathic and procedural pain. Then, I should organize a focused physical examination to distinguish vascular insufficiency from nerve compression or complex regional pain syndrome. Next, I will plan initial noninvasive tests and classify severity to triage urgency. After that, I need to build a prioritized differential and decide on confirmatory diagnostics tailored to the leading etiology. Finally, I will outline cause-specific interventions that preserve access when possible, embed multidisciplinary decision-making, and set a follow-up reassessment schedule with objective metrics [^11518b6n] [^113i8TbR].

> Let me first confirm the temporal relationship and pain phenotype, because immediate onset within hours to days raises ischemic monomelic neuropathy or technical nerve injury, whereas a delayed course over weeks to months favors progressive steal, nerve compression from access remodeling, or CRPS; ischemic pain is typically cramping and exertional with coolness and relief at rest, neuropathic pain is burning or electric with paresthesias and allodynia, and CRPS pain is disproportionate, persistent, with hyperalgesia and autonomic changes; cannulation pain is sharp, transient, and procedure-linked, so I should not mistake that for baseline ischemia or neuropathy, and wait, let me verify that IMN often presents early and without tissue loss while DHIS progresses with trophic changes, which checks out with the literature [^114AhjZy] [^1124gc1k] [^11518b6n] [^111iT4ob] [^115M17Lf] [^1156nUnX] [^116Vjs2x] [^113g8oWe].

> Next, I should review the targeted physical examination to avoid premature closure; I will assess for pallor, coolness, delayed capillary refill, and digital ulcers to support ischemia, compare pulses and perform an Allen test for collateral flow, and auscultate the access for a high-flow thrill that can predispose to steal, while in parallel mapping sensory and motor deficits along the median and ulnar distributions to localize compression, and I need to check for CRPS trophic and vasomotor asymmetries; a perianastomotic hematoma or markedly dilated conduit can compress nerves, so I should palpate along the course of the vein and at the elbow and wrist, and hold on, I should verify that digital trophic change or ulceration with a cold hand pushes ischemia up the list [^11518b6n] [^11479zvM] [^113H2iih] [^111je3AQ] [^115M17Lf] [^114tuLWo].

> I will now examine initial noninvasive tests to objectify perfusion and nerve involvement; I need to measure digital pressures and the digit–brachial index with the access open and during manual compression, and I should double-check the threshold — initially I thought DBI ≤ 0.5 defined steal, but wait, I should correct that to DBI < 0.6 being consistent with clinically significant steal that improves with compression, and I will add duplex Doppler to quantify access flow and distal arterial waveforms, use pulse oximetry as a supportive marker of hypoperfusion rather than a definitive test, and order nerve conduction studies if focal deficits are present to separate IMN from compressive neuropathy [^114tuLWo] [^11518b6n].

> Based on those data, I should formulate a prioritized differential; access-related hand ischemia (DHIS/steal) is common with brachial inflow and spans from exertional pain to rest pain and tissue loss, ischemic monomelic neuropathy mimics neuropathy early without overt tissue ischemia, nerve compression can arise from dilated veins or graft loops especially near the elbow or axilla, CRPS is rarer but consequential and a diagnosis of exclusion, cannulation-associated pain is frequent yet typically procedural and time-locked, and I must not forget other causes such as carpal tunnel from venous hypertension or amyloid, proximal arterial stenosis feeding the limb, and central venous stenosis leading to venous hypertension and pain, so I need to keep my net broad before I anchor on a single cause [^11518b6n] [^1124gc1k] [^114AhjZy] [^113H2iih] [^115M17Lf] [^116Vjs2x] [^111rYGn5] [^113f7CYa].

> I need to ensure severity is classified because it drives urgency; mild cases have pain limited to dialysis or exertion with normal skin and DBI around 0.6–0.8, moderate cases develop rest pain and early skin changes with DBI 0.4–0.6, and severe cases show continuous pain, ulcers or necrosis, or objective neurologic deficits with DBI < 0.4, and hmm, wait a minute, if the DBI improves substantially with manual access compression, that further supports flow-dependent ischemia amenable to inflow or flow-reduction strategies [^11518b6n] [^114tuLWo].

> Next, I should review selective confirmatory diagnostics; if steal is suspected, I will arrange arteriography to define inflow, outflow, collateralization, and stenotic lesions prior to definitive repair, whereas if nerve compression is more likely, I should confirm with nerve conduction studies and consider MRI to show structural impingement by dilated vessels or grafts, and if CRPS is on the table, I should confirm Budapest clinical criteria and, while ancillary imaging can support, I will use emerging ASIPP guidance for chronic CRPS to structure management, and if I suspect discrete arterial stenosis proximal or distal to the anastomosis, CTA can be an alternative roadmap when catheter angiography is deferred [^11518b6n] [^113hNb1w] [^114tuLWo] [^111ysqiB].

> For access-related hand ischemia in mild cases, I should start conservatively with hand warming and exercise while monitoring perfusion, but I need to check whether symptoms abate promptly; if not, banding to reduce fistula flow by roughly one-third to one-half can relieve symptoms and preserve access, though I should confirm suitability with perfusion testing during temporary compression and be prepared to revise if under- or over-correction occurs, as case-based reports and reviews support this approach as access-sparing, albeit with variable success [^11518b6n] [^112C6jTC].

> For moderate to severe ischemia or tissue threat, I should prioritize definitive revascularization strategies; DRIL remains a workhorse with high rates of symptom resolution and access salvage when executed correctly, and I should also consider PAI, RUDI, or even distalization of the anastomosis depending on anatomy and flow, reserving complete ligation for non-salvageable cases or when ischemia is irreversible, and hold on, I should verify that when a discrete arterial stenosis drives the hypoperfusion, balloon angioplasty can be first-line and often obviates the need for access revision, with growing series suggesting durable symptom relief after revascularization [^113i8TbR] [^116hoNxe] [^11518b6n] [^115N6EVr] [^113hNb1w] [^114hisg3].

> If the pattern fits nerve compression, I should confirm localization and then plan surgical nerve release, often combined with access revision such as vein transposition or graft loop smoothing to remove the offending compression; I should counsel that most patients improve, many completely, though some require staged or repeat procedures, and hold on, I should verify distal perfusion beforehand with DBI and duplex so I don't miss concomitant ischemia masquerading as neuropathy, as emphasized by operative series and diagnostic protocols [^113H2iih] [^111je3AQ] [^115SX4r8] [^114tuLWo].

> For suspected or confirmed CRPS after access creation, I need to ensure early, multimodal therapy; I will coordinate desensitization-focused physical therapy, initiate neuropathic analgesics and consider bisphosphonates where appropriate, escalate to sympathetic blocks or neuromodulation in refractory cases, and integrate psychological support to break fear–pain cycles, and wait, let me verify that while CRPS after AV access is rare, case reports and pain society guidance support this structured approach and emphasize not confusing it with vascular steal [^115M17Lf] [^111ysqiB] [^113N2wgt] [^111iT4ob].

> When cannulation pain is the dominant issue, I should confirm it is procedure-linked and not present at rest, then employ practical measures such as pre-cannulation thermotherapy, topical anesthetics, optimized needle technique, and distraction strategies like VR, and I should not overlook psychosocial contributors and anxiety, which can be addressed with education and, when needed, involvement of pain psychology, and let me reconsider whether FIR helps — data are mixed for maturation but some suggest reduced cannulation pain, so it can be considered adjunctively [^113g8oWe] [^112X1w6W] [^113hGNis] [^116Vjs2x] [^115WKBgU] [^114XdKoG].

> Multidisciplinary, patient-centered planning is essential; I should convene vascular surgery, nephrology, pain medicine, neurology, psychology, and experienced dialysis nursing to align on goals, and I need to ensure access maturity and alternatives are considered before sacrificing a conduit, especially in patients with prior radial artery harvest or limited options, while using structured cannulation assessments and shared decision-making to balance symptom relief against access longevity [^113Hhrmc] [^1161tbZE] [^11518b6n] [^1126mkGz].

> Finally, I should confirm a follow-up and reassessment protocol with objective checkpoints; within 48 hours of any intervention I will reassess symptoms and, for ischemia, repeat digital pressures or DBI, at one month review function and access flow, and by three months obtain duplex to document patency and distal perfusion, then space surveillance to 6–12 months or sooner if symptoms recur, and hold on, I should remember that endovascular procedures can be painful and sometimes require sedoanalgesia protocols, and that recurrent central venous or arterial stenoses should be surveilled proactively to prevent symptom relapse [^114hisg3] [^115SPe1L] [^113f7CYa].

Pain in the hand after shunt placement is most often due to **steal syndrome** (access-related hand ischemia) [^11518b6n] or **ischemic monomelic neuropathy** (IMN) [^114AhjZy], with other causes including nerve compression [^113H2iih], infection, hematoma, or complex regional pain syndrome [^115M17Lf]. Steal syndrome presents with cold, pale or cyanotic fingers, delayed capillary refill, and pain worsened by elevation [^1124gc1k]; IMN causes severe neuropathic pain with sensory loss and weakness without significant ischemic signs [^114AhjZy]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by duplex ultrasound, digital pressures, and nerve studies [^113hNb1w] [^114AhjZy]; **urgent intervention is required** for severe ischemia or IMN [^1124gc1k], with options including DRIL, banding, or access ligation [^112C6jTC] [^113i8TbR], and nerve decompression or ligation for IMN. Early recognition and **multidisciplinary management** are essential to prevent permanent nerve injury or tissue loss [^116hoNxe].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain hand pain after shunt placement:

- **Steal syndrome (access-related hand ischemia)**: The AVF diverts arterial blood from the distal hand [^11518b6n], causing ischemia and pain [^1135VnrC].

- **Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN)**: Ischemic injury to peripheral nerves from reduced perfusion, causing severe neuropathic pain, sensory loss, and weakness [^114AhjZy].

- **Nerve compression or injury**: Direct nerve injury during surgery or compression by dilated vessels or hematoma [^111rYGn5] can cause neuropathic pain [^113H2iih].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: A rare, severe pain syndrome with autonomic and trophic changes after vascular access surgery [^115M17Lf] [^1156nUnX].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

The clinical presentation of hand pain after shunt placement **varies** by underlying cause:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Steal syndrome | - Cold, pale or cyanotic fingers <br/> - Delayed capillary refill [^11518b6n] <br/> - Pain worsened by elevation <br/> - Ulceration or gangrene in severe cases [^1135VnrC] | - Clinical examination <br/> - Duplex ultrasound [^11518b6n] <br/> - Digital pressures <br/> - Arteriography [^113hNb1w] |

## Risk factors

Several risk factors predispose patients to hand pain after shunt placement. Patient-related factors include diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease [^116hoNxe], female sex, advanced age, and pre-existing neuropathy [^11518b6n], and **procedure-related factors** include high-flow AVFs [^1135VnrC], brachial artery-based accesses [^116hoNxe], radial artery harvest [^1161tbZE], and surgical nerve trauma [^11518b6n].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the cause of hand pain:

- **Clinical examination**: Assess for ischemic signs, neuropathic symptoms, and nerve compression [^1124gc1k].

- **Imaging studies**: Duplex ultrasound, digital pressures, and arteriography to evaluate vascular flow and identify steal syndrome [^113hNb1w] [^11518b6n].

- **Nerve conduction studies and electromyography**: To diagnose IMN or nerve compression [^114AhjZy].

- **MRI**: To visualize nerve compression or injury [^113H2iih].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **cause** and symptom severity:

- **Steal syndrome**: Observation for mild cases [^116hoNxe]; surgical interventions such as distal revascularization with interval ligation (DRIL), banding [^112C6jTC], or access ligation for severe cases [^113i8TbR].

- **Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN)**: Immediate access ligation or revision to restore nerve perfusion [^1124gc1k] [^114AhjZy].

- **Nerve compression or injury**: Surgical nerve release or decompression [^111rYGn5], analgesics, and physical therapy [^113H2iih].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Multidisciplinary approach including analgesics, physical therapy, and psychological support [^115M17Lf] [^111ysqiB].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Prognosis and **long-term outcomes** vary by cause and timeliness of intervention. Steal syndrome has a good prognosis with timely treatment [^113i8TbR], whereas delays can lead to tissue loss or amputation [^116hoNxe]. Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) has a poor prognosis if not treated promptly, often resulting in permanent nerve damage [^114AhjZy]. Nerve compression or injury generally has a good prognosis with surgical intervention and rehabilitation [^113H2iih], whereas complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) has a variable prognosis and may improve with early multidisciplinary care [^1156nUnX].

Hand pain after shunt placement is most often due to steal syndrome or ischemic monomelic neuropathy, with other causes including nerve compression, infection, hematoma, or complex regional pain syndrome [^1124gc1k]. Early recognition and **multidisciplinary management** are essential to prevent permanent nerve injury or tissue loss [^111iT4ob].

### Treatment strategies for access-related hand ischemia [^113i8TbR]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Access-related hand ischemia, commonly known as "steal syndrome", is one of the most challenging and worrisome complications for the access surgeon. The construction of an arteriovenous access results in a predictable decrease in the perfusion pressure distal to the anastomosis, which can result in ischemia if the compensatory mechanisms are inadequate.

Several preoperative clinical features have been shown to identify patients at risk. The diagnosis of access-related hand ischemia is largely a clinical one that can be aided in equivocal cases with noninvasive vascular laboratory studies. The treatment goals are to reverse the hand ischemia and to preserve the access.

There are a variety of different remedial treatments, including access ligation, correction of the inflow lesion, limiting the flow through the access, proximalization of arterial inflow, revision using distal inflow, and distal revascularization with interval ligation. The optimal choice is predicated on the timing and severity of symptoms in conjunction with the access type, its anticipated durability, patient comorbidities, distribution of occlusive disease, and availability of venous conduit.

The distal revascularization with interval ligation procedure has emerged as our optimal treatment and reverses the ischemic symptoms and salvages the access in approximately 90% of the cases. It is incumbent on all access surgeons to be familiar with the management of access-related hand ischemia. A review of the underlying pathophysiology and treatment options is provided alongside our treatment algorithm.

### Surgical intervention for upper extremity nerve compression related to arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses [^113H2iih]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic renal failure patients with arteriovenous hemodialysis access may exhibit pain and neurological complaints due to local nerve compression by the access conduit vessels of autogenous arteriovenous fistulas or the prosthesis of arteriovenous grafts. This study examines the results of surgical intervention for vascular access-related nerve compression in the upper extremity.

- **Methods**: A single-center retrospective study was conducted on patients referred for persistent pain and neurological complaints following vascular access surgery for hemodialysis. The study included four brachial-cephalic, three brachial-basilic upper arm arteriovenous fistulas, and three prosthetic arteriovenous grafts. All patients experienced pain and sensory deficits in a distinct nerve territory (median nerve: 6; median + ulnar nerve: 1; medial cutaneous nerve: 1), with two patients presenting additional motor deficits (median nerve).

- **Results**: A total of 10 patients (mean age: 59 years; range: 25–73 years; 2 men; 4 diabetics) underwent treatment through surgical nerve release alone (2 patients) or in combination with access revision (8 patients). The mean follow-up period was 23 months (range: 8–46 months). Direct complete relief of symptoms was achieved in six patients. Three patients reported minor complaints, and one patient required a reoperation, which was successful.

- **Conclusion**: Vascular access-related nerve compression is an uncommon cause of pain and sensory and motor deficits after vascular access surgery. Surgical nerve release and access revision have shown good clinical outcomes, providing relief of symptoms and maintaining function.

### Complex regional pain syndrome following vascular access creation for hemodialysis [^115M17Lf]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Low credibility.

Pain and swelling of a limb following creation of an arterio-venous fistula (AVF) are often attributable to vascular disorders like venous hypertension or limb ischemia. Here, we report the case of a 70-year-old man who developed pain and swelling of the upper limb distal to the AVF during the second post-operative week due to a complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is characterized by pain that is disproportionate to the invoking injury, autonomic dysfunction, trophic changes, and functional impairment of the affected limb. Hyperalgesia and allodynia are pain patterns characteristic of CRPS. CRPS has been reported rarely following AVF creation surgery. Prompt diagnosis of CRPS is important to avoid misdiagnosis of vascular disorders and for the implementation of the right therapeutic strategy.

### Understanding the dialysis access steal syndrome. A review of the etiologies, diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies [^11518b6n]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2008). Low credibility.

Distal hypoperfusion ischemic syndrome (DHIS), commonly referred to as hand ischemia or 'steal' after dialysis access placement, occurs in 5–10% of cases when the brachial artery is used, or at a rate 10 times that of wrist arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) using the radial artery. This condition is typically seen in elderly women with diabetes and may carry severe morbidity, including tissue or limb loss if not recognized and treated.

- **Etiologies**: Three distinct causes include (1) blood flow restriction to the hand from arterial occlusive disease either proximal or distal to the AV access anastomosis; (2) excess blood flow through the AV fistula conduit (true steal); and (3) lack of vascular (arterial) adaptation or collateral flow reserve (i.e. atherosclerosis) to the increased flow demand from the AV conduit. These causes of steal may occur alone or in concert.

- **Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of steal is based on an accurate history and physical examination and confirmed with tests, including an arteriogram and duplex Doppler ultrasound (DDU) evaluation with finger pressures and waveform analysis.

- **Treatment strategies**: Treatment of steal includes observation of developing symptoms in mild cases. Balloon angioplasty is the appropriate intervention for an arterial stenosis. At least three distinct surgical corrective procedures exist to counteract the pathophysiology of steal. The ultimate treatment strategy depends on the severity of symptoms, the extent of patient co-morbidity, and the local dialysis access technical team support and skills available.

### Ischemic monomelic neuropathy: An underappreciated cause of pain and disability following vascular access surgery [^114AhjZy]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

The establishment and maintenance of a functioning arteriovenous access site is essential for the care of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) represents an underappreciated complication and an unrecognized source of short- and long-term disability due to its protean manifestations in the postoperative period. Delayed diagnosis of IMN greatly reduces the chance of avoiding irreversible disability. Prompt diagnosis and early management of IMN can avoid morbidity for the patient, diminish healthcare costs for the system, and prevent medical liability for care providers. A multidisciplinary awareness of the symptoms of IMN is essential to permit prompt diagnosis and management.

### Patients' experiences of cannulation of arteriovenous access for haemodialysis: A qualitative systematic review [^116Vjs2x]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Low credibility.

Cannulation is an unpleasant, abnormal, and unique procedure

Cannulation creates unpleasant feelings and is not a normal procedure for patients to experience regularly: "Cannulation is not normal, sticking a needle in. But my life depends on it. Every time I get the needle ready I hear the music from Jaws". Cannulation for haemodialysis is associated with pain, concern about the abnormal appearance of the arteriovenous access, vulnerability, and dependency. The context of regular haemodialysis makes this a unique procedure that is not similar to other one-off cannulation events.

Pain was regularly associated with cannulation: "Then I would feel the big needles being pushed in. I still feel pain when they [the nurses] hit a nerve, whoa that is painful". Pain was a common theme in studies, but the extent of the pain and how much this affected individual patients varied. For some, the pain was short-lived or minor: "It hurts, but it only hurts when the skin is punctured; after that, it doesn't hurt anymore". Patients often appeared to become less bothered by pain from cannulation over time: "I used to dread coming to dialysis due to the fear of the painful needles but now I am getting better". For others, pain progressed beyond the cannulation procedure or the pain was excessive: "How can these big needles not hurt when they pierce my skin, huh?".

### Influence of arteriovenous fistula on daily living behaviors involving the upper limbs in hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional questionnaire study [^111Vyd5n]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

To ensure an exhaustive list of living behaviors indispensable in daily life, 26 behaviors were selected according to the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, a general upper limb function evaluation tool used in the orthopedic field. As behaviors during non-dialysis, the following items were added:

- **Daily activities**: open a tight or new jar, write, turn a key, prepare a meal, push open a heavy door, place an object on a shelf above your head, do heavy household chores, garden or do yard work, make the bed, carry a shopping bag or briefcase, change a lightbulb overhead, wash or blow dry your hair, wash your back, put on a pullover sweater, use a knife to cut food, do recreational activities which require little effort (e.g. playing cards, knitting, playing Japanese board games)

- **Physical recreational activities**: recreational activities in which you take some force or impact through your arm, shoulder, or hand (e.g. golfing, playing tennis, playing catch ball, using a hammer)

- **Free arm movement recreational activities**: recreational activities in which you move your arm freely (e.g. throwing a flying disc, playing badminton)

- **Other activities**: managing transportation needs, engaging in sexual activities

We also asked about:

- **Pain-related issues**: pain in the arm, shoulder, or hand at rest apparently caused by the AVF, pain while performing any specific activity

- **Sleep disturbances**: difficulty sleeping due to pain in the arm, shoulder, or hand

- **Physical symptoms**: weakness in the arm, shoulder, or hand, stiffness in the arm, shoulder, or hand

- **Psychological impact**: feeling less capable, confident, or…

### Hand ischemia in a patient with an arteriovenous fistula [^112C6jTC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

An ischemic digit causes significant morbidity due to its associated discomfort and potential for tissue necrosis. Historically, when this phenomenon was peripheral to an ipsilateral arteriovenous access in a hemodialysis patient, it was called "steal syndrome" and was usually treated with access ligation, resulting in the loss of the access. We present a dialysis patient with hand pain due to ischemia that was referred for access ligation. Instead, a minimally invasive banding procedure was performed that resulted in access salvage and resolution of symptoms. We present images and a discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of distal hypoperfusion ischemia syndrome in this Imaging Teaching Case.

### Thermotherapy: Improving the vascular access cannulation procedure [^113g8oWe]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2019). Low credibility.

Vascular access is essential for performing adequate hemodialysis, but needle cannulation in vascular access is typically painful. There is limited scientific evidence on the analgesic effect of thermotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of thermotherapy on vascular access cannulation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a two-week, single-center, prospective study, collecting demographic data and vascular access location. The primary outcome was the pain perceived during vascular access cannulation, measured by the visual analog scale. The study consisted of two phases: Phase I utilized the usual cannulation procedure, while in Phase II, we applied local thermotherapy for 15 minutes (hot packs at 60 seconds, 600W). We also recorded main hemodynamic data, local, and vascular access-related complications.

- **Results**: A total of 34 patients participated, with a mean age of 67.3 ± 16.4 years and an average of 49.1 ± 66.3 months on hemodialysis. Main cardiovascular risk factors include hypertension (81.8%) and diabetes mellitus (39.4%). The most common vascular access was the left radiocephalic fistula (45.5%). The mean weekly/patient cannulation rate was 6.03 ± 0.2. The mean visual analog scale score was 3.8 ± 2.4. Thermotherapy significantly decreased the visual analog scale score (3.9 ± 2.4 vs. 2.6 ± 2.0, p = 0.002), without hemodynamic changes pre- and post-intervention, or changes in analgesic or antihypertensive treatment. One patient experienced mild surface erythema. No further complications related to vascular access were observed.

- **Conclusion**: The study concluded that thermotherapy significantly reduces the pain associated with vascular access cannulation without causing hemodynamic changes or requiring alterations in analgesic or antihypertensive treatments.

### Carpal tunnel syndrome in patients with arteriovenous fistula for haemodialysis: A narrative review of the current literature [^111rYGn5]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

It is clear that the tingling hand post-AVF formation presents a common diagnostic conundrum for the vascular access surgeon in the setting of other differentials, such as peripheral neuropathy and vascular steal syndrome. It is apparent that the etiology remains multi-factorial, and the frequency of CTS with AVF varies widely according to the criteria and methods used for the diagnosis. There appear to be two distinct categories of dialysis-related CTS: venous hypertension and dialysis-related amyloidosis, although the latter findings were not reproducible. There is currently very little new evidence and a great deal of heterogeneity within the literature.

Further large-scale, high-quality prospective studies are required to investigate the pathophysiology of AVF-related CTS to help improve the quality of care for HD patients. Clinicians should be aware of the diagnosis and try to make it as early as possible to prevent permanent nerve damage. It is recommended that in the presence of carpal tunnel-like symptoms, early neurophysiology is performed with expedited release of the carpal tunnel if symptoms and nerve tests confirm median nerve compression.

### Intractable arteriovenous access-related pain relieved following a single, pain-free hemodialysis session under selective block of the sensory nerves in the upper limb: A psychosocial factorial case [^115WKBgU]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Low credibility.

Intractable arteriovenous access (AVA)-related pain can not only lead to abandonment of a well-functioning AVA, but can also cause hemodialysis (HD) patients to be unwilling to accept, interrupt, or withdraw from HD. Such pain primarily derives from nociceptive and neuropathic factors caused by mechanical stimulation of needle cannulation; however, this might be related to psychosocial factors making it difficult for patients to accept their dependency on HD. Furthermore, the pain can be complicated by the interaction of biological and psychosocial factors, which hampers appropriate pain management and treatment. However, there have been few investigations pertaining to this matter.

Herein, we describe the case of an HD patient who experienced chronic refractory AVA-related pain during a 32-month period of HD sessions, which occasionally caused treatment interruption. After clinical inquiry, physical evaluation, and ultrasonographic assessment of the blood circulation and cutaneous nerves in the ipsilateral upper limb to the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula in the anatomical snuffbox, we diagnosed the patient with primarily psychosocially driven pain in consultation with an experienced pain clinician. A single, pain-free HD session under ultrasound-guided sensory nerve blocks in the upper limb markedly relieved her pain, followed by HD sessions with subtle but acceptable pain. This report provides insights into the mechanism underlying the vicious cycle of AVA-related pain, including the psychosocial aspects that might trigger such pain, as well as into the importance of addressing these factors in management strategies.

### Distalization of the anastomosis: An effective treatment for dialysis access-associated steal syndrome [^115N6EVr]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Steal syndrome after arteriovenous fistula formation for dialysis access can cause ischemic pain and tissue loss. This is an indication for surgical revision, usually either banding or the distal revascularization and interval ligation procedure. However, banding is inexact, and distal revascularization and interval ligation can further compromise the arterial supply to the arm. We report three cases in which an alternative approach of moving the arteriovenous anastomosis distally was used, thereby protecting arterial inflow to the hand. In all three cases, the steal syndrome resolved and the fistula remained patent.

### Surgical intervention for upper extremity nerve compression related to arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses [^111je3AQ]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

From 1 January 2012 to 1 April 2018, ten CRF patients with an arteriovenous hemodialysis access and symptoms of pain and nerve impairment in the ipsilateral upper extremity were referred to a tertiary vascular access center. There were three male and seven female patients with a mean age of 59 years (range: 25–73 years). Five patients had diabetes, and two patients had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Three patients had a prosthetic AVG in a looped configuration in the upper arm, with anastomoses to the axillary artery and vein. Seven patients had either an autogenous brachial-cephalic (4) or brachial-basilic upper arm AVF, with a transposed (2) or elevated (1) basilic vein. The majority of patients complained of persistent pain and sensory loss in a distinct nerve territory of the arm (median nerve: 6; median + ulnar nerve: 1; medial cutaneous nerve: 1). Two patients had sensory as well as motor deficits, with numbness and loss of muscle strength in the hand.

### Influence of arteriovenous fistula on daily living behaviors involving the upper limbs in hemodialysis patients: A cross-sectional questionnaire study [^1144Fgyd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional questionnaire study aimed to explore how arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) affect daily living behaviors involving the upper limbs in hemodialysis patients.

- **Study patients**: Forty-two Japanese patients over the age of 20 undergoing outpatient maintenance hemodialysis at either the Kanno Dialysis and Vascular Access Clinic or the Jishukai Ueda Kidney Clinic were approached. The inclusion criteria were: 1) currently receiving hemodialysis via an AVF, 2) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, and 3) having received at least 1 month of regular dialysis. The exclusion criteria included: 1) receiving hemodialysis via a non-AVF site such as an arteriovenous graft, subcutaneously fixed superficial artery, or permanent vascular catheter, 2) having functional AVFs on both arms, 3) impaired upper limb function due to issues other than AVF, such as hemiplegia, carpal-tunnel syndrome, or traumatic injury, 4) difficulty completing the questionnaire due to dementia or a psychiatric disorder, and 5) ambidexterity. Twelve patients who did not provide consent to participate were excluded, resulting in 30 subjects being enrolled for the study.

- **Analysis**: The subjects were analyzed for age, dialysis duration, gender, PS, dominant arm, number of AVF creations, occupation, cause of kidney disease, anastomotic site, AVF vessel size category (0, obscure; 1, thinner than the digitus minimus; 2, thicker than the digitus minimus but thinner than the thumb; 3, thicker than the thumb), and AVF after-effects such as steal syndrome and/or sore finger syndrome.

### Upper limb ischemia after vascular access surgery: Differential diagnosis and management [^1124gc1k]. Seminars in Dialysis (2000). Low credibility.

Hand ischemia following the placement of upper limb arteriovenous accesses for dialysis may result in debilitating complications that contribute to morbidity and mortality during dialysis. Two distinct clinical variants of hand ischemia are recognized:

- **Vascular steal syndrome**: A spectrum of severity of ischemic changes affects all tissues of the hand.
- **Ischemic monomelic neuropathy**: Ischemia is confined to the nerves of the hand.

Early diagnosis and treatment of these complications, often including the closure of the access, are imperative to prevent hand paralysis and digital or hand amputation.

### Investigating risk factors and outcomes in rare disease of angiosarcomas in arteriovenous fistulas: A case report with review of literature [^113QmCuW]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Low credibility.

Angiosarcomas are rare, aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis. Early detection is essential, as surgically removing localized tumors gives the best chance for a cure. While angiosarcomas predominantly occur in the head and neck region, they can arise from endothelial cells lining blood or lymphatic vessels throughout the body.

This case study highlights a rare instance of angiosarcoma developing in a non-functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF) many years post-renal transplantation. A 50-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), initially treated with hemodialysis through a left brachiocephalic AVF, underwent a deceased donor kidney transplant in 2016.

In March 2023, the patient developed pain and numbness in his left hand, revealing a thrombosed AVF and chronic arterial occlusions. Surgical interventions included a left brachial-brachial artery bypass and ulnar endarterectomy, but his condition deteriorated, leading to the identification of a 4.9 × 3.1 × 2.4 cm mass in the proximal ulnar shaft in January 2024. Biopsy results confirmed epithelioid angiosarcoma, which was subsequently treated with left upper extremity amputation and tumor resection. Metastatic disease was detected in the right lung, necessitating further surgical interventions.

This case underscores the necessity for vigilance in monitoring AVFs in transplant patients. We further completed a comprehensive literature review, using PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, from 2000 to 2024, focused on angiosarcoma arising from AVFs to provide further insights into the rare association between AVFs and angiosarcomas.

### A survey of chronic pain due to spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae [^116ztJm8]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic pain due to spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae (SDAVF) during follow-up is a serious issue because it can affect patients' quality of life. The severity of posttreatment chronic leg pain in patients with SDAVF is unclear.

- **Objective**: To investigate the prevalence, severity, and characteristics of chronic leg pain in patients with SDAVF and to examine the clinical factors associated with chronic pain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a survey of chronic posttreatment leg pain in 49 SDAVF patients. The survey consisted of a numeric rating scale and a neuropathic pain symptom inventory (NPSI). Of the 49 patients, 32 (65.3%) completed the questionnaire. There were 24 males and 8 females, with a mean age of 69.1 years. The mean follow-up period was 86.3 months.

- **Results**: Chronic leg pain was reported by 26 (81.3%) of 32 patients; 14 experienced pain before treatment, and 12 had new-onset posttreatment pain. The pain was reported as moderate to severe by 21 (80.8%) of 26 patients; the mean numeric rating scale and NPSI scores were 6.0 ± 2.3 and 17.4 ± 10.3, respectively. The NPSI subscores were significantly higher for spontaneous pain and paresthesia/dysesthesia than for paroxysmal pain. We found no significant clinical factors related to chronic posttreatment pain; on magnetic resonance imaging scans, we identified spinal cord atrophy in 8 patients with chronic pain.

- **Conclusion**: Most of our SDAVF patients reported moderate to severe chronic leg pain characterized by spontaneous pain and paresthesia/dysesthesia. Spinal cord atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging scans was observed in patients with chronic pain.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of preoperative interventions to support the maturation of arteriovenous fistulae in patients with advanced kidney disease [^113Hhrmc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The risk of bias was assessed by the above-mentioned tools, and the results are summarized in Table 3. Of the four RCTs, one had a high risk of bias, two had some concerns, and only one had a low risk of bias. All four non-RCTs had a serious risk of bias due to the small number of participants or the split-body trial design, as the systemic effect of exercise is likely to affect vessel parameters in both upper limbs.

Table 3: Comparison of effect size of various preoperative interventions on AVF outcomes and some salient outcome measures tested by these interventions.

Primary and secondary outcomes were predominantly related to a change in vessel calibre or flow by the end of the exercise period. Only the RCT by Aragoncillo Sauco et al. followed patients beyond AVF creation until 12 weeks post-surgery to look at more hard outcomes, such as percentage primary failure at 12 weeks as the primary outcome. The cholecalciferol study by Wasse et al. was another RCT that examined the percentage or proportion of AVF maturation at 6 months after AVF creation using a standard definition of AVF maturation. Neither hand exercise nor cholecalciferol was found to improve the rate of AVF maturation or primary failure.

As summarized in Table 2, hand exercise was generally found to have a positive effect on vein calibre, with most studies demonstrating a significant increase compared to no intervention. The effect size was lower in studies that used the opposite limb of the same patients as a control.

### Arterialization of the venous system for treatment of chronic ischemia in the hand [^112K1JpQ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Symptomatic chronic ischemia of the upper extremity is a challenging condition to treat. At a critical level of ischemia, patients experience intractable pain, nonhealing ulcerations, and potential necrosis. When no distal vessels are available for vascular reconstruction, arterialization of the venous system may be considered as a salvage procedure. This article details a surgical technique for venous arterialization aimed at improving the vascular supply to the ischemic hand. This can lead to decreased pain, enhanced wound healing, improved patient function, and limb salvage.

### Arterial revascularization in patients with hand pain dialyzing with upper arm arteriovenous (AV) fistulas: A single center experience [^114hisg3]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Low credibility.

Distal hand ischemia syndrome (DHIS) is a well-reported adverse outcome in patients with upper arm AV access. Of these patients, 25%–40% have been reported to be due to primary arterial disease complicated with significant arterial calcification. The effectiveness of revascularization of the distal arterial circulation on symptom resolution has not been reported yet.

- **Methods**: A retrospective single-center analysis of patients evaluated for hand/forearm pain in patients with upper arm AV access who had arterial revascularization between 01/2016 and 12/2020 were included for the analysis. Fifty-one patients met the inclusion criteria. Stenotic lesions greater than 70% in the subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, or ulnar artery were treated with balloon angioplasty. Institutional approval was obtained to review charts.

- **Outcomes**: Successful revascularization and improvement in pain were assessed at 48 hours, 1 month, and 3 months.

- **Results**: Seventy-six percent of patients had an upper arm arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and 24% of patients had an upper arm arteriovenous graft (AVG). Mean access flow was 1210 (556) ml/min. Fifty-five percent of patients had radial or ulnar arterial stenosis, while 45% had brachial/axillary or subclavian artery stenosis. In 45% of patients, lesions were present in both radial and ulnar arteries. Successful revascularization was achieved in 88% of patients. Seventy-six percent (18) of patients had improvement in symptoms within 48 hours, and 68% remained symptom-free at 3 months. The mean DHIS stage improved from 3.1 before intervention to 1.1 post-intervention (p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction with their AV access improved from 34% to 72%.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of preoperative interventions to support the maturation of arteriovenous fistulae in patients with advanced kidney disease [^116DNUmN]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

A meta-analysis of the effects in four hand exercise studies was undertaken, and the results are summarized in Figure 2. Two studies were not included due to the lack of a comparative arm or the addition of a co-intervention such as blood flow restriction to hand exercise. The overall effect size of hand exercise on distal cephalic vein calibre without a tourniquet is approximately 0.24 mm (95% CI 0.03–0.45). The heterogeneity is minimal, at approximately 16%. As can be seen in the forest plot in Figure 3, the effect size from the RCTs was significantly higher with narrow confidence intervals as compared to non-RCTs. This difference may be due to the non-RCTs using the non-exercise arm of the same patients as a control, which might have underestimated the effect size of hand exercise on the cephalic vein in the exercise arm.

Figure 2: Forest plot of the effect of hand exercise on end-of-follow-up distal cephalic vein calibre (in mm) without a tourniquet.

Figure 3: Forest plot of the effect of hand exercise on end-of-follow-up distal cephalic vein calibre (in mm) without a tourniquet, categorized according to study design.

The study by Rus et al. also examined the effect of hand exercise on endothelium-dependent vasodilation but found no significant effect.

The only single-arm prospective cohort study on intermittent pneumatic compression using a Fist Assist device found a significant improvement in baseline cephalic vein diameter at fixed landmarks of the forearm and upper arm, with or without blood pressure cuff application. This also increased the proportion of cephalic veins.

### Upper extremity ischemia and hemodialysis vascular access [^1135VnrC]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Digital ischemia in dialysis patients due to arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) is a rare condition, occurring in 4% of patients. The etiology differs from lower limb ischemia. Blood shunting through the AVF may cause the stealing of blood and hypoperfusion in distal tissues, leading to pain, discoloration, and ulcers. High-flow AVFs carry a greater risk of ischemia than normal-flow AVFs; however, when combined with peripheral arteriosclerotic disease, the latter may also lead to ischemia.

A non-invasive and angiographic diagnosis is important to determine treatment options. Augmentation of arterial inflow by interventional techniques and/or AVF blood flow-reducing surgical procedures may eliminate pain and heal ulcers. The best results are obtained by bypassing the arteriovenous anastomotic site and interrupting the steal phenomenon through ligation of the artery distal to the AV anastomosis.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline on vascular access for haemodialysis [^1126mkGz]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Cannulation should begin with an assessment of the access: a 'look, feel, and listen' assessment is easy to complete prior to each cannulation to ascertain if the access is healthy or if there is cause for concern. Utility evidence is lacking, but healthcare professionals believe that prior assessment facilitates successful cannulation, as information gained may modify the procedure. This assessment is important to detect problems with the access and facilitate accurate cannulation, whether it is a healthcare professional, carer, or patient who cannulates the access. Carers and patients who cannulate should be taught how to assess the access using the 'look, listen, and feel' approach. Some patients or carers may struggle with this assessment if they have reduced sensation in their hands, which limits the feel assessment, or if they cannot hear through a stethoscope. This should not create a barrier to self-cannulation, but if patients or carers who cannulate struggle with these elements of the assessment, then they may need to be performed by a healthcare professional on a less frequent basis.

As discussed, it is worth remembering that fistulas and grafts are formed for the sole purpose of cannulation to enable haemodialysis. In achieving this, cannulation itself has two key goals, which may sometimes compete: the first is cannulation success at dialysis (achieving each day's dialysis with minimal symptoms, first-time success, and no complications, i.e. avoiding miscannulation and infection) and the second is maintaining long-term fistula health (preventing the development).

### Effect of virtual reality (VR) therapy on pain sensation in patients undergoing hand surgery under ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia: a randomized controlled trial [^113hGNis]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

During ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia and surgery, patients receive sensory input, which, combined with stress and anxiety, can exacerbate or cause pain. Virtual reality therapy could provide digital sedation. Our aim is to assess the effect of virtual reality therapy on pain levels during the placement of regional anesthesia and surgery.

This prospective randomized controlled superiority trial enrolled 120 patients undergoing elective hand surgery to investigate the effect of perioperative virtual reality therapy, consisting of a visual and audible three-dimensional, passive program. Patients were randomized to virtual reality therapy (n = 60) or no virtual reality therapy (n = 60) during regional anesthesia block placement and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the mean pain score (11-point numerical rating scale) during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia placement. Secondary outcomes included the mean pain score during surgery, heart rate variation during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia placement and surgery, perioperative opioid use, anxiety (11-point numerical rating scale where 0 = no anxiety at all and 10 = extremely anxious), virtual reality immersion and presence (Igroup Presence Questionnaire), adverse events, and patient satisfaction (11-point numerical rating scale where 0 = not satisfied at all and 10 = extremely satisfied).

Mean pain scores during ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia placement were 3.9 ± 2.4 in the control group and 3.6 ± 2.4 in the virtual reality group, with a mean difference of -0.3 (95% CI -1.2 to…).

### Is there an association between serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels and syndrome severity in persistent complex regional pain syndrome [^114mViae]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A total of 66 patients were approached to participate in this study. Twelve patients were excluded from the study: five patients declined to participate, one patient had multiple extremities affected by CRPS, one patient used prednisone, five did not meet the IASP criteria for CRPS anymore, and one patient did not show up for their outpatient clinic appointment. A total of 53 patients were included for analysis.

- **Patient demographics**: The majority of included patients were female (92.5%) and had a mean age of 44 years (SD ± 14.9). The median pain score was 7 (Q3 − Q1: 8 − 6). The median serum sIL-2R was 330 U/mL (Q3 − Q1: 451 − 255 U/mL).

### Effect of far infrared therapy on arteriovenous fistula maturation, survival and stenosis in hemodialysis patients, a randomized, controlled clinical trial: The FAITH on fistula trial [^114XdKoG]. BMC Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

A study by Choi et al. designed to examine the effect of FIR on cannulation pain and access flow found no difference in the AVF survival in the FIR treatment group compared to a control group during 12 months of intervention. However, the study was not powered to address this issue. Interestingly, the study showed a significant decrease in the cannulation pain. In conclusion, FIR appears as a promising treatment for AVF maturation and perhaps AVF survival, but the data is inconsistent. There is an urgent need for further investigations of the possible effects of FIR.

The present paper describes the design and rationale of a randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial of the effect of FIR on AVF maturation and on the number of AVFs without intervention still functioning after 1 year. Changes in anti-inflammatory and vasodilating factors during FIR treatment will be explored, and arterial stiffness as a marker of AVF maturation and survival will be examined.

### Placing a primary arteriovenous fistula that works — more or less known aspects, new ideas [^112gRcT5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Despite the pre-operative availability of well-defined criteria to create a primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF), a high rate of early failure or missing maturation is reported worldwide. Based on new results from basic research using numerical techniques, the authors aim to draw attention to a widely neglected area in the published data: the unremarkable, small, yet essential surgical details in creating a successful AVF. The objective is to describe their significance and give them a place in a cross-border context.

### Diagnostic guidance for chronic complex regional pain syndrome type I and type II from the American Society of Interventional Physicians (ASIPP) [^111ysqiB]. Pain Physician (2025). High credibility.

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a challenging and often disabling condition marked by persistent pain, most commonly in a limb following injury or surgery. It presents with a wide array of symptoms, including intense pain, swelling, alterations in skin color and temperature, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes such as skin and tissue atrophy. While the precise cause of CRPS is not fully understood, it is thought to stem from abnormal nervous system activity, leading to heightened pain sensitivity and inflammatory responses. A thorough understanding of CRPS is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and enhancing patients' quality of life. Although attempts have been made to distinguish between acute and chronic CRPS, there are currently no established diagnostic criteria specific to chronic CRPS in medical literature.

- **Objective**: This ASIPP guidance document offers updated, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), with a primary focus on introducing novel, time-based diagnostic criteria specific to the chronic phase. These proposed criteria address significant gaps in the literature, where existing standards, such as the Budapest Criteria, do not sufficiently differentiate between the acute and chronic stages of the condition.

- **Methods**: An expert panel convened by the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) conducted a comprehensive literature review and employed a structured consensus process to develop recommendations. Acknowledging that.

### Evaluating patient perspectives of endovascular created arteriovenous fistulas for dialysis access (EndoAVF) [^111KT2FA]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first evaluation of endovascular created fistulas from the patient perspective utilizing the Vascular Access Questionnaire. Although the sample size is small, reflecting the recent introduction and early use of fistulas created with this technique, they provide an extremely useful initial insight into the perspectives of patients who have undergone the procedure and their experiences of functional use.

Within our unit, initial concerns raised in the Dialysis Vascular Access community about difficulties with cannulation or achieving stable functional maturation of the EndoAVF have not necessarily been proven in the medium term. Patients reported that once cannulation was established, their EndoAVFs were easy to use. Overall, the EndoAVFs received very high satisfaction scores, with none of the patients dissatisfied with their access. All patients would recommend it, suggesting non-inferiority to other surgically created AVFs. A longitudinal comparative study during early use may be better suited to capture challenges during the initiation of cannulation.

Upon analysis between the two groups, the components of the VAQ were very similar. This similarity may be due to the small sample size within the EndoAVF group, leading to difficulty in reaching statistical significance. Future studies with larger cohorts and adequate sample sizes may allow for the exploration of inherent and possible heterogeneities across cohorts. One of the differences that was significant between the groups must be further explored in future studies.

### Vessel health and preservation (part 1): A new evidence-based approach to vascular access selection and management [^116qPhFb]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2012). Low credibility.

Vascular access for the infusion of medications and solutions requires timely assessment, planning, insertion, and reassessment. Traditional vascular access practices are reactive, painful, and ineffective, often resulting in the exhaustion of peripheral veins before considering other access options. Evidence suggests that clinical pathways improve outcomes by reducing variations and establishing processes to assess and coordinate care, minimizing fragmentation and cost.

Implementation of a vascular access clinical pathway facilitates the intentional selection of the best vascular access device tailored to the patient's specific diagnosis, treatment plan, medical condition, and vessel health. The Vessel Health and Preservation (VHP) program incorporates evidence-based practices focused on timely, intentional, proactive device selection implemented within 24 hours of admission to any acute care facility. VHP is a comprehensive clinical pathway, guiding clinicians from device selection through patient discharge, including daily assessments.

Initiating the VHP program within a facility provides a systematic approach to improve vascular access selection and patient care, reducing variations and obstacles in care while increasing positive patient outcomes and satisfaction. Patient safety and preservation of vessel health are the ultimate goals.

### Radial artery harvest: A potential cause of arteriovenous access-associated hand ischemia [^1161tbZE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Hand ischemia has multiple causes. In this article, we report an additional factor that can induce hand ischemia in hemodialysis patients. A 64-year-old white man with coronary artery disease underwent a coronary artery bypass graft procedure using the left radial artery as the bypass graft. Several months later, a left extremity Gracz fistula was created for arteriovenous access. Ever since dialysis was performed via the fistula, the patient has experienced a cold hand and pain during dialysis; this was somewhat relieved by wearing a woolen glove while on dialysis.

Absence of the radial artery in the context of an ipsilateral arteriovenous access was highlighted as a possible etiology. A complete arteriography to determine the presence of stenoses, distal arteriopathy, and true steal was recommended, but the patient refused to undergo any investigation or procedure and instead decided to continue wearing the glove during the treatment. A plan for close follow-up and possible interventions in the event of worsening pain or ulceration was agreed upon.

Radial artery harvest can result in hand ischemia if an ipsilateral arteriovenous access is created. We suggest that the contralateral extremity should be considered if an arteriovenous access is required, to minimize the risk of this phenomenon.

### Multidisciplinary approach to hand arteriovenous malformations: Treatment strategies and clinical outcomes - insights from a 25-year experience at a single vascular anomalies center [^117V5gvL]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Type of research**: Single-center retrospective study
- **Key findings**: A total of 150 patients with hand arteriovenous malformations were included in the study. Sclerotherapy was performed on 101 patients (67%) across 320 sessions. Among these patients, 15 (15%) eventually required amputation surgery. Additionally, 13 patients underwent primary surgical amputation. Sclerotherapy-related adverse events occurred in 123 of 320 sessions (39%).
- **Take home message**: Despite achieving favorable outcomes with sclerotherapy, the higher incidence of sclerotherapy-related adverse events compared with other arteriovenous malformation locations necessitates cautious deliberation when selecting treatment options.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular anomalies characterized by direct connections between arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary bed. This results in low-resistance, high-flow arteriovenous shunts that impose abnormal shear forces on venous endothelial cells, leading to venous dilatation and arterialization. AVMs can present with various clinical symptoms and complications, including pain, pulsatile masses, tissue necrosis, and high-output heart failure.

Treatment options for AVMs include surgical interventions and endovascular therapies. However, selecting the appropriate treatment is crucial, as improper methods can exacerbate symptoms and necessitate extensive further interventions. Hand AVMs pose a particular challenge due to their functional complexity, cosmetic considerations, and the dense neurovascular network of the hand.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111iT4ob]. Pain Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The methods highlight all guidelines focused on the assessment of neuropathic pain, emphasizing the use of a comprehensive history and examination. Clinical judgment is essential in interpreting screening tools and investigations.

Neuropathic pain stems from a wide variety of causes that can be broadly organized into two basic categories: peripheral and central etiologies. However, presentation may be variable both between peripheral and central etiologies and within individuals with the same etiology. Common peripheral neuropathic conditions include diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, radicular pain (RP), and postsurgical chronic neuropathic pain (PSCP). Central conditions include multiple sclerosis, poststroke pain, spinal cord injury–related pain, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and trigeminal neuralgia (TN).

- **Clinical presentation**: Neuropathic pain commonly includes descriptions of burning, pins and needles (paresthesia), tingling, numbness, electric shocks or shooting, crawling (formication), itching, and intolerance to temperature. In more advanced cases, patients may describe pain arising from stimuli that are not usually painful (i.e. allodynia) or pain from normally painful stimuli that is out of proportion to what would be expected (i.e. hyperalgesia).

Use of validated questionnaires is a simple means of identifying the presence of neuropathic pain and quantifying its impact on the patient. Examples include PainDetect, Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4), and the Leeds Assessment.

### Arteriovenous fistula cannulation in hemodialysis: A vascular access clinical practice guidelines narrative review [^115EvrAt]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Low credibility.

The cannulation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) by the hemodialysis (HD) nurse is challenging. Despite being the focus of extensive research, AVF cannulation remains one of the major causes of access damage, making it prone to failure. A considerable number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of vascular access (VA) have been published worldwide over the past two decades. This review aimed to assess all available information in the selected CPGs regarding AVF cannulation for HD, providing a comprehensive analysis to interpret possible future cannulation approaches.

A total of seven CPGs were described in a coding table separated into seven subthemes: initiation of cannulation, preparation, technique, needle selection, surveillance, pain, and education. Our analysis outlines CPGs for HD VA cannulation, revealing a lack of strong evidence supporting the majority of the recommendations. This highlights an urgent need for international collaboration and coordination to ensure the development of relevant and high-quality evidence. Future CPGs must consider recommendations with better evidence grading, aiming for patient-centered care and nurse decision models that can potentially improve AVF cannulation outcomes.

### Surgical intervention for upper extremity nerve compression related to arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses [^115SX4r8]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Vascular access surgery involving the axillary region is more prone to nerve complications. The axillary artery is usually located behind the venous and nervous structures, making dissection more difficult and increasing the risk of vein or nerve damage. Additionally, implantation of a rigid vascular access graft might compress the nerves if it travels from the depth (arterial anastomosis) to the superficial subcutaneous region, particularly in the case of an upper arm looped prosthetic AVG with anastomoses to the axillary vessels. These patients will exhibit an acute onset of pain and neurological complaints, hindering the successful use of the newly created vascular access.

Exploration of the arterial anastomosis in the axilla and creation of a smooth loop with a stretch ePTFE interposition graft can relieve the pressure on the nerve, subsequently leading to the disappearance of symptoms. In the three patients with axillary exploration in this study, no nerve injury at the access creation was found; only local nerve compression was noticed. It is of utmost importance to differentiate nerve problems from symptoms due to peripheral ischemia. Abnormal digital pressure measurements and determination of the DBI may reveal ischemia, while nerve conduction and MRI studies are indispensable for diagnosing local nerve entrapment and compression.

Prevention of vascular access–related nerve compression is challenging to accomplish. In particular, in the elbow region, several structures are closely related to each other, making it possible for either arterial or venous dilation to compress the median nerve.

When analyzing factors for treatment failure, 90% occurred in one patient (5.26%), 50% to 90% in six patients (31.5%), < 50% in four patients (21%), and aggravation was noted in five patients (26.3%). Among the 16 patients who underwent amputation surgery, nine initially received several sclerotherapy sessions but eventually required amputation surgery without further sclerotherapy (Fig 5). Five patients received additional endovascular treatments to alleviate pain following amputation surgery. The remaining two patients experienced aggravated skin necrosis and pain despite additional endovascular treatment after amputation.

### Relationships between clinical processes and arteriovenous fistula cannulation and maturation: A multicenter prospective cohort study [^113oaaZh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Half of surgically created arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) require additional intervention to effectively support hemodialysis. Postoperative care and complications may affect clinical maturation.

- **Study design**: Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation (HFM) Study, a 7-center prospective cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: 491 patients with single-stage AVFs who had neither thrombosis nor AVF intervention before a 6-week postoperative ultrasonographic examination and who required maintenance hemodialysis.

- **Predictors**: Postoperative care processes and complications.

- **Outcomes**: Attempted cannulation, successful cannulation, and unassisted and overall clinical maturation as defined by the HFM Study criteria.

- **Results**: AVF cannulation was attempted in 443 of 491 (90.2%) participants and was eventually successful in 430 of these 443 (97.1%) participants. Of these, 263 (61.2%) reached unassisted and 118 (27.4%) reached assisted AVF maturation (overall maturation, 381/430 [88.6%]). Attempted cannulation was less likely in patients of surgeons with policies for routine 2-week versus later-than-2-week first postoperative visits (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.70), routine second postoperative follow-up visits (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15–0.97), and a routine clinical postoperative ultrasound (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Attempted cannulation was also less likely among patients undergoing procedures to assist maturation (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27–0.98). Unassisted maturation was more likely for patients treated in facilities with access coordinators (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17–3.12), but less likely for other factors not provided in the excerpt.

### Arterial angioplasty to treat hand ischemia in a radial-cephalic fistula [^113hNb1w]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). High credibility.

A chronic hemodialysis patient was referred to interventional nephrology for evaluation of left hand pain. The patient had been receiving hemodialysis through a left radial-cephalic arteriovenous fistula and reported hand pain during dialysis. Physical examination demonstrated a cold hand and reduced capillary refill compared with the right hand.

Clinical features, differential diagnosis, and physical examination findings were consistent with the diagnosis of hand ischemia due to dialysis access. Arteriography revealed more than 80% stenosis of the distal ulnar artery. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty successfully dilated the lesion with resolution of symptoms. Although uncommon, patients with a forearm fistula can also experience symptoms of hand ischemia.

This case demonstrates that in addition to the history, clinical features, differential diagnosis, and physical examination, arteriography is a vital step in the management of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of hand ischemia. Further, employment of a basic procedure, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, can successfully resolve the condition and maintain the dialysis access.

### Influence of arteriovenous fistula on daily living behaviors involving the upper limbs in hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional questionnaire study [^111i8eUE]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The number of chronic kidney disease patients has been increasing due to lifestyle diseases and an aging population, with those reaching end-stage renal disease requiring the induction of hemodialysis. At that time, many patients require the creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) on either forearm.

Once an AVF is made, many patients experience difficulties in using their upper limbs and suffer a decline in quality of life. Firstly, they must constantly protect the AVF even during non-dialysis. Secondly, there is decreased cosmesis due to vasodilation. Thirdly, the range of upper-limb motion may become limited from the dilated blood vessel and modification of blood flow. Fourthly, moving the arm during dialysis becomes impaired by connection to the dialysis machine. The above issues represent a severe problem for many individuals, who understandably feel uneasy at pre-AVF consultation.

However, there are currently no studies investigating precisely how an AVF affects living behaviors. For that reason, many medical providers are unable to give detailed explanations on the influence of AVFs on lifestyle, particularly during non-dialysis, because they cannot observe them. This may fuel patient anxiety when deciding on AVF creation. Qin et al. described that professional strategies of internal fistulae could prolong service time, decrease complications, and increase quality of life. We therefore devised a comprehensive questionnaire to identify which living behaviors were affected most by AVFs in hemodialysis patients.

### Clinical features and pathophysiology of complex regional pain syndrome [^1156nUnX]. The Lancet Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

A complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) — characterized by multiple system dysfunction, severe and often chronic pain, and disability — can be triggered by a minor injury, a fact that has fascinated scientists and perplexed clinicians for decades. However, substantial advances across several medical disciplines have recently improved our understanding of CRPS. Compelling evidence implicates biological pathways that underlie aberrant inflammation, vasomotor dysfunction, and maladaptive neuroplasticity in the clinical features of CRPS. Collectively, the evidence points to CRPS being a multifactorial disorder that is associated with an aberrant host response to tissue injury. Variation in susceptibility to perturbed regulation of any of the underlying biological pathways probably accounts for the clinical heterogeneity of CRPS.

### Referred shoulder pain from ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Report of three cases [^111yLeZ1]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The authors report on three pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts who presented with chronic right shoulder pain. Imaging revealed that the distal peritoneal catheter was positioned between the right hemidiaphragm and liver. Following surgical repositioning of the distal tubing, all patients experienced resolution of their shoulder pain, which has not recurred. Although seemingly rare, referred shoulder pain from a VP shunt should be added to the list of complications seen with this method of cerebrospinal fluid diversion. The clinician who cares for patients with VP shunts may wish to evaluate cases of shoulder pain without obvious neural or musculoskeletal cause by performing imaging of the distal shunt tubing.

### Patients' experiences of cannulation of arteriovenous access for haemodialysis: A qualitative systematic review [^113hcJ1V]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Low credibility.

This review aims to explore patients' experiences of cannulation for haemodialysis, developing an in-depth description of this experience. Synthesizing findings from multiple studies broadens what we already know from studies into one cohesive description. Using qualitative findings to do this maintains the focus on what patients feel and experience, rather than imposing healthcare professionals' assumptions and preconceptions. If we can develop a greater understanding of this phenomenon, this will focus improvements in cannulation.

Our findings start to illuminate how patients feel about cannulation for haemodialysis. It is an unpleasant, abnormal, and unique procedure that is difficult to face. However, despite its unpleasantness, the necessity of successful cannulation for haemodialysis introduces extra emphasis on the procedure, creating worry about the success of the cannulation and whether multiple needle attempts will be needed. This necessity also drives a need to survive this unpleasant, repetitive procedure. Patients learn to tolerate the needle insertion and attempt to exert control over the procedure as a means to survive this. Feeling safe makes the cannulation easier to tolerate. Despite this, the procedure often remains unpleasant, which can lead to patients avoiding needle insertions. Whilst we previously knew that cannulation was associated with challenges, this aggregation of findings starts to fully describe the trauma cannulation causes to patients and how the link to a life-sustaining treatment exacerbates this and how patients survive.

### Surgical intervention for upper extremity nerve compression related to arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses [^114tuLWo]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

Physical examination exhibited sensory loss in the medial forearm (medial cutaneous nerve), digits (median and ulnar nerve), and loss of muscle strength in index and long digits lumbricals (median nerve). There was no discoloration, coldness, or paresis of the hand, which might indicate low perfusion or monomelic neuropathy. Vascular access ultrasonography showed dilated and elongated inflow arteries as well as fistula outflow veins in the patients with either brachial-cephalic arteriovenous fistulas (BCAVF) or brachial-basilic arteriovenous fistulas (BBAVF). In addition, access flow and digital blood pressure measurements, with and without access compression, were performed to rule out high-flow access and/or low distal perfusion, which would indicate hand ischemia. The patients had a mean digital pressure (DP) measurement with open access of 118 mm Hg (range: 75–160 mm Hg) and a mean digit/brachial index (DBI) of 0.84 (range: 0.66–1.0), indicating sufficient distal perfusion. Access compression raised DP and DBI to a mean of 145 mm Hg and 0.95, respectively.

The mean preoperative (10 patients) and postoperative (7 patients) access flows were 1704 and 1384 mL/min, respectively; 3 patients had a ligated access with a central vein catheter (CVC). Nerve conduction studies were performed in eight patients (normal in five and median nerve injury in three patients). Nerve conduction studies could not be performed in two patients due to technical reasons (upper loop AVG with axillary anastomoses). Five patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of t

### Post-traumatic AV fistula of the hand successfully treated with percutaneous endovascular laser ablation: Report of a case [^114vGU45]. Hand (2024). Low credibility.

Acquired arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the hand can occur after trauma, fracture, or surgery. It is a rare condition, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. Clinically, they appear as palpable or painful lesions that persist long after the local hematoma has resolved. We report a case of a young patient presenting with long-standing and invalidating pain of the hand caused by a post-traumatic AVF, treated with percutaneous endovascular laser ablation.

### Sedoanalgesia with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl for angioplasty of dysfunctional arteriovenous access: a retrospective single-center analysis [^115SPe1L]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Low credibility.

Endovascular therapy, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), stenting, or embolization, is a well-established form of treatment to prolong the lifespan of arteriovenous access. These procedures, especially PTA, can be accompanied by severe pain. We reviewed and analyzed the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of sedoanalgesia using intravenous midazolam and fentanyl for pain relief during these procedures.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and two consecutive patients with dysfunctional dialysis access who underwent endovascular procedures in our institute between July and November 2017 were included in this study. Dialysis access profiles, procedure complications, and a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were collected. One-year clinical follow-up records were also collected to evaluate arteriovenous access patency and long-term complications.

- **Results**: Among the 202 patients, the mean age was 67.0 ± 12.08 years. The dialysis access profiles of these patients were 119 (58.9%) native arteriovenous fistula and 162 (74.2%) forearm access. The number of lesions treated was 1.63 ± 0.802. Immediate complications included 11 (5.44%) nausea/vomiting, 24 (11.88%) desaturation (SpO2 < 90%, resolved after pillow removal or jaw thrust), and 16 (7.9%) hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg, resolved without inotropic agents). There was a low average pain score (1.16 ± 1.594) during the procedure, with 136 (67.3%) experiencing no pain (VAS 0–1) and 56 (27.7%) experiencing mild pain (VAS 2–4). Higher VAS scores correlated with overweight patients, longer PTA times, and pain after the procedure.

### A dialysis patient with subungual hyperkeratosis and ulceration of the fingertips [^11479zvM]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 3: What is the next best step in management?**

	- A. Surgical debridement
	- B. Referral to pain management
	- C. Referral to vascular surgery
	- D. Oral nifedipine
	- E. Compression and elevation of the affected limb

- **Answers**:

	- A. Surgical debridement – Incorrect. Although the debridement of the hyperkeratotic material at the fingertips may be needed in the future, without an intervention to restore adequate blood flow, the ischemia is likely to progress, and the ulcers will recur.

	- B. Referral to pain management – Incorrect. Managing this patient's pain without correcting the underlying cause is not the optimal treatment.

	- C. Referral to vascular surgery – Correct. Several percutaneous and surgical treatment options exist for dialysis-associated steal syndrome (DASS), with varying degrees of evidence for each method. Catheter angiography can be performed, with angioplasty of distal atherosclerotic disease or the insertion of a coil to decrease flow rates. Surgical options include plication, banding, and clipping of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to decrease shunting and restore distal flow in high-flow lesions. Recently, distal revascularization with interval ligation has become the preferred procedure for most cases of DASS. Most vascular surgeons are able to perform both percutaneous and open surgical procedures for DASS. The patient underwent banding of the fistula, with improvement in distal angiographic flow.

	- D. Oral nifedipine – Incorrect. Nifedipine is sometimes used to treat Raynaud syndrome, as it causes vasodilation and may prevent attacks. Decreasing arterial pressure in this case may worsen the patient's symptoms.

### Factors associated with pain during vascular access intervention therapy [^116ThqKX]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate and compare factors associated with pain during vascular access intervention therapy.

Fifty patients provided informed consent to participate in a survey of pain by questionnaire after receiving dialysis treatment at our hospital. Balloons for use during the procedure were chosen at random in this prospective randomized control study. A numeric rating scale (NRS) was used for pain assessment.

A semi-compliant balloon caused significantly worse pain compared with the other types of balloons (NRS, 7.67 ± 1.57 vs. 6.02 ± 1.89; p&lt;0.05). There was no correlation between maximum inflation pressure and pain, or between age and pain, and no difference between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. A comparison among vascular dilation locations, as well as a comparison of AVF with AVG also revealed no significant differences.

The reason for severe pain with the use of the semi-compliant balloon compared to the other types might have been due to its characteristics during inflation, as increased diameter leads to an increase in pressure. Mismatching of balloon diameter to vascular diameter may also increase pain.

### Access-related hand ischemia and the hemodialysis fistula maturation study [^116hoNxe]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Access-related hand ischemia (ARHI) is a major complication after hemodialysis access construction. This study was designed to prospectively describe its incidence, predictors, interventions, and associated access maturation.

- **Methods**: The Hemodialysis Fistula Maturation Study is a multicenter prospective cohort study designed to identify predictors of autogenous arteriovenous access (arteriovenous fistula [AVF]) maturation. Symptoms and interventions for ARHI were documented, and participants who received interventions for ARHI were compared with other participants using a nested case-control design. Associations of ARHI with clinical, ultrasound, vascular function, and vein histologic variables were each individually evaluated using conditional logistic regression; the association with maturation was assessed by relative risk, Pearson χ(2) test, and multiple logistic regression.

- **Results**: The study cohort included 602 participants with a median follow-up of 2.1 years (10th-90th percentiles, 0.7–3.5 years). Mean age was 55.1 ± 13.4 (standard deviation) years; the majority were male (70%), white (47%), diabetic (59%), smokers (55%), and on dialysis (64%) and underwent an upper arm AVF (76%). Symptoms of ARHI occurred in 45 (7%) participants, and intervention was required in 26 (4%). Interventions included distal revascularization with interval ligation (13), ligation (7), banding (4), revision using distal inflow (1), and proximalization of arterial inflow (1). Interventions were performed ≤ 7 days after AVF creation in 4 participants (15%), between 8 and 30 days.

### Central venous interventions [^113f7CYa]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Central venous stenosis or occlusion is a common and vexing problem in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Typical presenting symptoms include arm swelling and prolonged bleeding after hemodialysis. Despite multiple treatment approaches, these stenoses tend to recur and progress over time. A thorough pre-procedure evaluation, methodical procedural approach, and awareness of potential complications are all essential to try to preserve vascular access and improve patients' quality of life.

### Revascularization of the ischemic hand with arterialization of the venous system [^1141MwwC]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic ischemia in the upper extremity is a challenging condition for both patients and surgeons. When ischemia reaches a critical level, tissue loss ensues, resulting in necrosis of fingers at various levels. Amputation of necrotic digits, without addressing the etiology of the necrosis, often leads to wound-healing problems and more proximal amputations. The purpose of this report was to describe a surgical technique that improves vascular supply to the hand and allows for healing of the amputation sites and relief of pain through arterialization of the venous system.

### Utilization of the autologous vein on the ulnar side of the dorsal hand for arteriovenous fistula creation [^111tveny]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2022). Low credibility.

We previously described the success and usefulness of two operative techniques for creating a radial artery-first or second dorsal metacarpal vein arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in the first interdigital space of the dorsal hand using the most distal site and autologous veins in the upper limb. These techniques utilize the dorsal metacarpal veins on the radial side of the dorsal hand.

Developing these ideas, we devised a novel operative technique for creating a transposed radial artery-third metacarpal vein AVF in the first interdigital space of the dorsal hand using the most distal vein on the ulnar side of the upper limb and the most distal site in the upper limb. The distinctive advantage of this technique is that it can be applied to patients whose cephalic vein in the forearm and the dorsal metacarpal veins on the radial side of the dorsal hand are of poor quality.

We herein report the steps of this technique and describe its successful performance in a patient who has been on hemodialysis for 14 months without any additional vascular access interventions or postoperative complications. We consider this technique to be a valuable option in select patients who meet the applicable conditions. The creation of the first AVF as distally as possible is ideal, and it offers a further viable option of distal native vascular access that may be overlooked.

### Rare occurrence of upper-limb ischaemia necessitating transhumeral amputation following axillary arterial line placement [^117FCNQM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The left axillary arterial line was removed on postoperative day 9, six days after placement. On the same day, the patient complained of tingling and numbness in the left hand. Cyanosis of the hand and fingers was noted. Vascular surgery was consulted and identified occlusion of the patient's left axillary, brachial, and radial arteries. Emergent embolectomy of the involved vessels was performed without complications. A postprocedural angiogram confirmed patency of all vessels, with no residual thromboses. The patient was started on a heparin drip for treatment.

Two days later, on postoperative day 11, the patient again developed pain and numbness in the left hand, initially thought to be due to carpal tunnel syndrome and fluid accumulation post-embolectomy. The following day (postoperative day 12), cyanosis was noted in the fingers of the left hand. Ultrasound revealed thrombosis of the left radial artery. The patient underwent left axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar artery thromboembolectomy on day 14. The following day, a left upper extremity angiogram demonstrated an abrupt cut-off of flow past the level of the wrist, including both the radial and ulnar arteries.

- **Fasciotomy and subsequent procedures**: Tissue plasminogen activator infusion and argatroban were instilled into the arteries. A forearm fasciotomy with carpal tunnel release was performed to alleviate pressure and improve blood flow. Fasciotomy closure was accomplished on postoperative day 18.

Figures illustrating the surgical interventions:

- **Figure 1**: Fasciotomy of the left arm.

### Pain on arteriovenous fistula cannulation: A narrative review [^112X1w6W]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Low credibility.

Pain on arteriovenous fistula (AVF) cannulation is a persistent problem in daily hemodialysis practice. Its prevalence varies from 12% to 80% depending on the definition and the pain-assessment tools, and it affects the quality of life of hemodialysis patients. It is associated with fear of the cannulation process, the decision for hemodialysis from an AVF, and sometimes the hemodialysis itself. In this narrative review, we explore the extent of the problem and present the available published solutions.

The literature suggests a wide range of methods, including local anesthetic creams, application of cold or heat directly on the cannulation sites or on the contralateral arm, cannulation techniques and AVF localization, distraction methods, and alternative treatments. All have shown relative success. There is a serious lack of large multicenter randomized trials and a gap in work groups and guidelines or recommendations from national or international societies on this matter. Complementary training, starting from the predialysis patient education programs, may be useful. Alternative prophylactic measures, including counseling, hypnosis, or other physicochemical interventions, could also enhance our understanding of treating this uncomfortable condition.

### Role of biphosphonates and lymphatic drainage type Leduc in the complex regional pain syndrome (shoulder-hand syndrome) [^113N2wgt]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a clinical entity that has been termed in numerous ways in recent years. Clinically, CRPS describes an array of painful conditions characterized by a continuing (spontaneous and/or evoked) regional pain that is seemingly disproportionate in time or degree to the usual course of any known trauma or other lesion. The pain is regional and usually has a distal predominance of abnormal sensory, motor, sudomotor, vasomotor, and/or trophic findings.

- **Design**: Case report.

- **Setting**: University Medical Center.

- **Patients**: In this report, we described the case of a 68-year-old hemiplegic female affected by a cerebrovascular accident who presented a clinical case of CRPS shoulder-hand syndrome (CRPS-SHS) at the right hand following a hemorrhagic stroke.

- **Interventions**: This report evaluated the effects of biphosphonates and lymphatic drainage type Leduc in CRPS-SHS.

- **Outcome measures**: The pain level of the patients was measured with the visual analog scale. A scoring system for the clinical severity of CRPS-SHS, laboratory tests, and X-ray films were also performed.

- **Results**: We reported in this patient a great improvement of pain and edema of the right hand, with a significant reduction of bone demineralization.

- **Conclusions**: This combined treatment may be a viable alternative for this syndrome; however, further investigation is needed to determine its reproducibility in large case series.

### Surgical intervention for upper extremity nerve compression related to arteriovenous hemodialysis accesses [^1127XqS6]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Low credibility.

- **Operative technique**: An S-shaped incision was made at the level of the elbow or a longitudinal incision dorsally of the biceps muscle in the upper arm. The upper arm BCAVF and BBAVF arteriovenous anastomoses and/or artery were dissected free from the surrounding tissues, and subsequently, the median nerve was released by incising the medial intermuscular septum and bicipital aponeurosis over a distance of 5–10 cm. In the patient with ulnar nerve entrapment, the fascia over the nerve was incised over a distance of 5 cm at the level of the medial epicondyle of the elbow. Cutaneous nerve compression was relieved by dissecting the nerve away from the elevated basilic vein with transection of a single nerve branch for the purpose of adequate nerve mobilization. In this patient, a second-stage operation was needed because of the return of pain, and the vein was transected 1 cm proximal from the anastomosis, pulled away from the nerve, and reanastomosed to the vein stump. Axillary vessel exploration was performed with dissection of the artery-to-graft anastomosis and proximal prosthesis. Subsequently, an end-to-end interposition was performed with a 5-cm segment of a 6-mm stretch expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE; Gore-Tex).
