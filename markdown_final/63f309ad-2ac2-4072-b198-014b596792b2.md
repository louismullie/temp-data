## Question

captopril use in renal artery stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use captopril in renal artery stenosis — its therapeutic role, safety, and practical implementation, including when to use it, how to monitor for harm, and how it fits with revascularization strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of unilateral versus bilateral renal artery stenosis and how ACE inhibition alters glomerular hemodynamics. Then, I should verify efficacy data for blood pressure control and renal effects with captopril. Next, I will examine safety risks, especially rises in creatinine and hyperkalemia, and outline monitoring. After that, I need to review guideline recommendations and the role of revascularization versus medical therapy. Finally, I will build a practical algorithm for initiation, titration, and complication management, and address special scenarios and contraindications [^111P3iAu] [^111hggif].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. In renovascular hypertension, reduced renal perfusion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with angiotensin II maintaining glomerular filtration by constricting the efferent arteriole; ACE inhibition with captopril lowers systemic and intraglomerular pressure by blocking angiotensin II formation, which can be beneficial for blood pressure but may unmask dependence on efferent tone, especially in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney, whereas in unilateral disease the contralateral kidney often compensates via pressure natriuresis [^111P3iAu] [^111hggif].

> I will now examine antihypertensive efficacy. Captopril reduces peripheral resistance, increases renal blood flow, and typically reaches peak blood pressure effect within 60–90 minutes, with additive effects when combined with thiazide diuretics; these pharmacodynamic features make it effective for renovascular hypertension and suitable for titration as part of guideline-directed medical therapy [^111hggif].

> Hold on, I should verify renal functional effects and the frequency of creatinine rises. Regulatory data indicate that some patients with renal disease, particularly with severe renal artery stenosis, develop increases in BUN/creatinine after blood pressure reduction with captopril, with about 20% showing stable BUN/creatinine elevations > 20% over baseline during long-term therapy; importantly, such changes are often reversible with dose adjustment or discontinuation, a pattern similarly observed with other ACE inhibitors where creatinine rises occurred in approximately 20% of patients with unilateral or bilateral RAS and were almost always reversible on stopping the ACE inhibitor or diuretic [^114TpzFh] [^111zC1CW] [^115w44EG].

> Next, I should review key safety risks. I need to ensure close monitoring for hyperkalemia due to reduced aldosterone, with higher risk in chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or when combined with potassium-sparing agents or supplements, and I should watch for first-dose hypotension especially in salt/volume-depleted patients or those on diuretics; neutropenia, liver enzyme elevations, and rare angioedema are additional considerations that warrant vigilance and patient education [^113CnKZv] [^115GuUkj] [^114TpzFh].

> Let me consider diagnostic utility for a moment. Captopril renography has historically been used to identify hemodynamically significant, renin-dependent hypertension and can be positive in patients who subsequently improve with revascularization or ACE inhibition, suggesting pathophysiologic dependence on RAAS activation and potential responsiveness to RAAS blockade or intervention [^113peEe4].

> Wait, let me verify the limits of that test so I do not overstate it. Interobserver variability, reduced accuracy in bilateral disease or underlying renal impairment, and interference from concurrent antihypertensives can complicate interpretation; cases of false positives, including renin-secreting or renin-driven tumors mimicking RAS, reinforce that renography should be contextualized with anatomic imaging and clinical phenotype rather than used in isolation [^116bSPBm] [^115fBDRo] [^114EahZA].

> I need to check contemporary guidance on medical therapy versus revascularization. For unilateral atherosclerotic RAS with hypertension, initiating a RAS inhibitor such as an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended first-line, with calcium channel blockers or thiazides added as needed; in bilateral severe RAS or a solitary functioning kidney, RAS blockade can be considered but only with close supervision and frequent monitoring, recognizing that some societies frame this as cautious use or a relative contraindication when stenosis is hemodynamically critical [^113u6WRa] [^111qvRAE].

> Next, I should review when revascularization is prioritized. ESC 2024 recommends angioplasty and stenting for hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS in the presence of resistant hypertension, recurrent flash pulmonary edema, refractory heart failure or unstable angina despite optimal medical therapy, or progressive kidney dysfunction attributed to RAS, aligning with a selective rather than routine revascularization strategy [^1147DVZn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stenting for everyone. Large randomized trials such as ASTRAL and CORAL did not show overall cardiovascular or renal outcome benefit of routine stenting over optimized medical therapy in broad ARVD populations, likely due to inclusion of many patients with mild, asymptomatic, or non-hemodynamically significant lesions; high-risk phenotypes and severe stenoses were often underrepresented, so medical therapy remains the default, with revascularization reserved for specific high-risk indications or rapid ACE inhibitor–associated renal decline in suspected critical stenosis [^111P3iAu] [^114inwQB].

> But wait, what if the patient has high-risk presentations. Prospective cohorts of carefully selected patients with severe, hemodynamically significant RAS and high-risk features have shown improved ambulatory blood pressure, fewer antihypertensives required, stabilization or improvement in eGFR, and fewer heart failure or pulmonary edema admissions after stenting, supporting a tailored approach that integrates clinical severity, lesion severity, and hemodynamic relevance [^1159GfQX] [^116FU1DM].

> Let me think about a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm before prescribing. Pre-treatment, I should confirm the diagnosis and hemodynamic significance with duplex ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging as noninvasive first-line tests, reserving invasive angiography for definitive assessment when indicated; I should obtain baseline serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium, review volume status and diuretic use, and avoid or stop NSAIDs that can blunt antihypertensive effect and worsen renal perfusion in this setting [^112AXS77] [^112BFXy4].

> I should double-check the initial dosing and administration. Captopril is taken one hour before meals, and a typical starting regimen for hypertension is 25 mg twice or three times daily with titration after 1–2 weeks; in frail, volume-depleted, or high-risk patients, a lower test dose may be prudent with close observation for hypotension, especially if on diuretics, consistent with ACE inhibitor precautions in patients predisposed to first-dose effects [^111nbAgY] [^1151N67s].

> Next, I should review titration strategy and targets. Dose increases can proceed every 1–2 weeks toward 50 mg then 100–150 mg twice or three times daily as needed, not exceeding 450 mg/day, adding a thiazide or calcium channel blocker if blood pressure remains uncontrolled; blood pressure targets should align with age-specific goals suggested by vascular guidelines, while individual tolerance and orthostatic symptoms guide final targets [^115s7Bbd] [^113u6WRa] [^114ZXQyV].

> I will now examine monitoring cadence and actionable thresholds. I need to check serum creatinine and potassium within 1–2 weeks after initiation and after each dose escalation, recognizing that modest, early increases may be acceptable, but a substantial rise, approximately one-third above baseline, should prompt reassessment of volume status, diuretic dosing, and consideration of dose reduction or temporary discontinuation; hyperkalemia should be addressed by stopping potassium-sparing agents or supplements, dietary counseling, and dose adjustment, and hypotension warrants volume optimization and dose modification [^114TpzFh] [^113CnKZv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, drug–drug interactions can derail this plan if I overlook them. Dual RAS blockade with an ARB, ACE inhibitor, or aliskiren increases risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal failure without added benefit and should generally be avoided; in patients with diabetes, aliskiren with captopril is contraindicated, and captopril must not be coadministered within 36 hours of sacubitril/valsartan to avoid angioedema risk [^112BFXy4] [^111ovEzw].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios. In diabetes, ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and delay nephropathy progression beyond blood pressure effects, which supports their use with careful potassium monitoring; in heart failure complicated by bilateral RAS, ACE inhibitors improve outcomes but may precipitate renal dysfunction, and bilateral revascularization has enabled safe reintroduction of RAAS blockers in select cases; ACE inhibitors are teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy, so alternatives must be used in women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy [^112k4N1g] [^112r3hLX] [^111ovEzw].

> Hold on, I should verify how to integrate ACE inhibition with revascularization decisions. If captopril initiation leads to a rapid, marked rise in creatinine in a patient with suspected bilateral critical RAS or a solitary kidney, I should pause therapy and expedite evaluation for revascularization per ESC indications; conversely, in unilateral RAS with preserved contralateral function, continuing ACE inhibition with careful monitoring is generally recommended as first-line therapy [^1147DVZn] [^113u6WRa].

> Let me summarize the clinical pearls to ensure nothing is missed. Captopril is effective first-line therapy for unilateral renovascular hypertension and can be used cautiously with close monitoring in bilateral or solitary-kidney RAS; renal function and potassium must be checked 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes; rises in creatinine associated with ACE inhibition in RAS are frequently reversible with adjustment; dual RAS blockade should be avoided; and revascularization is reserved for selected high-risk scenarios where it improves cardiorenal outcomes beyond optimized medical therapy [^111hggif] [^114TpzFh] [^112BFXy4] [^1147DVZn] [^111P3iAu].

Captopril is effective for blood pressure control in unilateral renal artery stenosis [^113u6WRa], but in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney [^111qvRAE], it can cause **acute renal failure and hyperkalemia** [^114TpzFh] due to loss of efferent arteriolar tone [^111zC1CW]. Use captopril cautiously in bilateral stenosis or a solitary kidney, with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes [^111qvRAE]; **discontinue if creatinine rises > 30%** or hyperkalemia develops. Captopril is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors [^111ovEzw], and dual RAS blockade should be avoided [^112BFXy4] [^116NJemk]. Revascularization is reserved for resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema [^1147DVZn] despite optimal medical therapy [^116FU1DM].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for captopril use in RAS

ACE inhibition by captopril **reduces angiotensin II and aldosterone** [^111hggif], thereby lowering systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure [^1141u3Yn]. In unilateral RAS, it lowers blood pressure [^111hggif] and may improve renal perfusion in the unaffected kidney. In bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney, captopril reduces efferent arteriolar tone, decreases GFR [^111zC1CW], and can precipitate **acute renal failure** [^114TpzFh].

---

## Clinical benefits of captopril in RAS

Key clinical benefits in RAS include **blood pressure control** — effective in unilateral disease via reduced systemic vascular resistance [^111hggif] — and **renal protection**, which may slow progression of renal dysfunction in unilateral RAS by lowering intraglomerular pressure and proteinuria [^111hggif] [^112k4N1g].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of captopril in RAS

- **Acute renal failure**: In bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney, captopril can cause acute renal failure [^114TpzFh] by reducing efferent arteriolar tone and GFR [^111zC1CW].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Reduced aldosterone can cause hyperkalemia [^114TpzFh], especially in bilateral RAS or a solitary kidney [^113CnKZv].

- **Hypotension**: Excessive hypotension may occur [^1151N67s], particularly in volume-depleted patients.

- **Proteinuria**: Proteinuria [^1151N67s] may occur, especially at higher doses or with pre-existing renal disease.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Unilateral RAS**: ACE inhibitors, including captopril [^113u6WRa], are first-line therapy for unilateral RAS with hypertension [^114inwQB].

- **Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney**: ACE inhibitors may be considered [^111qvRAE] with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes.

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to ACE inhibitors [^111ovEzw], history of angioedema, or dual RAS blockade [^112BFXy4].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium before starting captopril [^114TpzFh].

- **Initial monitoring**: Recheck renal function and electrolytes within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose escalation [^111qvRAE].

- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function and electrolytes during therapy.

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose or discontinue if creatinine rises > 30% from baseline or if hyperkalemia develops.

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

Alternative options include angiotensin receptor blockers [^1152pM9Y] when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated; calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics as first-line adjuncts for blood pressure control in RAS [^113u6WRa]; and **revascularization** for resistant hypertension, progressive renal dysfunction, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema [^1147DVZn] despite optimal medical therapy [^1159GfQX].

## Summary of captopril use in RAS

| **Clinical scenario** | **Captopril use** | **Monitoring** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Unilateral RAS | First-line therapy | Routine monitoring | Low risk |
| Bilateral RAS or solitary kidney | Cautious use | Close monitoring | High risk |
| Resistant hypertension or progressive renal dysfunction | Consider revascularization | N/A | N/A |

---

Captopril is effective for unilateral RAS [^113u6WRa] but **requires caution in bilateral disease or a solitary kidney** due to risks of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia [^114TpzFh]. Use is guided by clinical context, with close monitoring and consideration of alternatives or revascularization when indicated [^1147DVZn].

### Captopril [^114TpzFh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Some patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed increases in BUN and serum creatinine after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. A dosage reduction or discontinuation of diuretics may be required. For some patients, it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure while maintaining adequate renal perfusion.

About 20 percent of patients develop stable elevations of BUN and serum creatinine greater than 20 percent above normal or baseline upon long-term treatment with captopril. Less than 5 percent of patients, typically those with severe preexisting renal disease, required discontinuation of treatment due to progressively increasing creatinine. Subsequent improvement probably depends upon the severity of the underlying renal disease.

Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. Patients at risk for the development of hyperkalemia include those with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and those using concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium. In a trial of type I diabetic patients with proteinuria, the incidence of withdrawal of treatment with captopril for hyperkalemia was 2% (4/207).

When considering therapeutic procedures for renal artery stenosis, specifically regarding renal artery angioplasty, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend performing renal artery angioplasty and stenting in patients with hemodynamically significant, atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (stenosis of 70–99%, or 50–69% with post-stenotic dilatation and/or significant trans-stenotic pressure gradient) under the following conditions:

- **Refractory heart failure, unstable angina, or sudden onset flash pulmonary edema**: Occurring despite maximally tolerated medical therapy.

- **Resistant hypertension**: When hypertension does not respond adequately to standard treatments.

- **Hypertension with unexplained unilaterally small kidney or chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Indicative of underlying renal complications.

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary viable kidney**: Conditions warranting intervention to prevent deterioration.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2025 clinical practice guidelines on the management of diseases of the mesenteric and renal arteries and veins [^111qvRAE]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of renal artery stenosis, particularly in relation to antihypertensive therapy, the ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with bilateral severe renal artery stenosis, or in those with renal artery stenosis in a single functioning kidney, provided the treatment is free from side effects and includes regular follow-up of renal function and blood pressure.

---

### Captopril [^112BFXy4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors.

	- Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on captopril tablets and other agents that block the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

	- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors such as captopril may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving captopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

### Renal artery stenosis [^111AgBiw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is the most common secondary cause of hypertension and is predominantly caused by atherosclerosis. In suspected patients, a non-invasive diagnosis with ultrasound is preferred. Asymptomatic, incidentally found renal artery stenosis does not require revascularization. In symptomatic patients requiring revascularization, renal artery stenting is the preferred therapy. Selecting appropriate patients for revascularization requires careful consideration of lesion severity and is optimized with a multidisciplinary team. All patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis should be treated with guideline-directed medical therapy, including hypertension control, diabetes control, statins, antiplatelet therapy, smoking cessation, and encouraging activity.

### Renal artery stenting in consecutive high-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A prospective 2-center cohort study [^1159GfQX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In this prospective cohort study of patients with severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and well-defined high-risk clinical presentations, we observed a reduction in blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive medication, an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and a decrease in new hospital admissions due to heart failure or sudden pulmonary edema after renal artery stenting. Three months after revascularization, mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP after witnessed drug intake was reduced by approximately 20 mm Hg. Additionally, 60 of 97 successfully treated patients experienced a meaningful decrease in 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP of at least 10 mm Hg (including 29 patients with a decrease of ≥ 30 mm Hg), notwithstanding the reduction in the mean number of antihypertensive medications.

In the CORAL trial, mean systolic BP declined in the stent group by 16.6 mm Hg and in the medical therapy-only group by 15.6 mm Hg. However, in that trial, the number of antihypertensive medications was increased equally in both groups. Patients with severe renovascular hypertension generally respond poorly to antihypertensive treatments. To evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the baseline ambulatory BP measurements, we included prestudy 24-hour ambulatory BP results available for 55 patients and found no significant difference between prestudy and baseline results.

Taken together, renal artery stenting in this selected patient population was associated with improved BP control and tolerance to blockage of the renin-angiotensin system. A similar effect of renal artery stenting on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in patients with true resistant hypertension has recently been noted.

### Captopril [^113CnKZv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Altered laboratory findings

- **Serum electrolytes**:
	- **Hyperkalemia**: Small increases in serum potassium, especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).
	- **Hyponatremia**: This is particularly found in patients receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics.

- **BUN/Serum creatinine**: Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine, especially in volume or salt-depleted patients or those with renovascular hypertension, may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, which, in turn, may lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine.

- **Hematologic**: A positive ANA has been reported.

- **Liver function tests**: Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred.

### Chronic total occlusion of renal artery in symptomatic young patient with resistant hypertension: Is a revascularization necessary or redundant [^112FTHYg]? Journal of Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Dilemmas related to indications for invasive treatment were reflected in the case of a 19-year-old patient with arterial hypertension for several years, currently on therapy with four antihypertensive drugs in full doses, including a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone), meeting the criteria for resistant hypertension. The patient, with left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed in echocardiography and stenosis of the proximal segment of the right renal artery found in duplex Doppler examination, which was subsequently confirmed in angio-CT, was admitted for arteriography and assessment of the indications for revascularization. The length of both kidneys was equal and measured 10.5 cm.

In an invasive examination (DSA), which the patient underwent 12 months after angio-CT imaging, complete arterial occlusion with angiographic features of chronic total occlusion (CTO) was found (Figure 1). In the parenchymal phase, delayed contrasting of the right kidney by the collateral circulation from the adrenal arteries was revealed, with clearly worse visualization of the lower pole of the kidney (Figure 2). Since BOLD MRI was available only in a few centers and the information obtained from DUS and CT was satisfactory, MRI was not performed in this patient.

- **Figure 1**: Complete arterial occlusion with angiographic features of chronic total occlusion.
- **Figure 2**: Delayed contrasting with worse visualization of the lower pole of the kidney.

The laboratory tests showed a creatinine level of 2.68 mg/dl, with an estimated eGFR of 32.9 ml/min/1.73 m², which was the patient's first abnormal test result.

### Bilateral renal artery revascularisation in heart failure [^112r3hLX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis can complicate the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, as it is a conventional contraindication to the use of ACE inhibitors. We report a case in which bilateral renal artery revascularisation allowed the safe reintroduction of enalapril (and subsequently sacubitril valsartan) in a patient with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. There is a role for renal artery angioplasty in selected patients to allow optimal medical therapy for patients with heart failure due to impaired systolic function.

### A case report of successfully treated nephrotic syndrome after renal angioplasty [^113Ro7pF]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of renovascular hypertension accompanying renal artery stenosis (RAS) consists of angioplasty and administration of antihypertensive medication. Although nephrotic syndrome (NS) has been reported to be associated with RAS, the development of NS after revascularization of RAS is extremely rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 48-year-old man presented with uncontrolled hypertension and azotemia. The right kidney was atrophic, and RAS of the left kidney was suspected based on a post-captopril DTPA scan. His blood pressure stabilized after renal angioplasty; however, he complained of edema after one week. NS developed and was diagnosed as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) based on renal biopsy. He received an angiotensin receptor blocker, and proteinuria resolved after one year.

- **Conclusions**: FSGS rarely develops after angioplasty of renal artery stenosis. This is the first report of successful treatment of this condition using an angiotensin receptor blocker during a one-year follow-up.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^1179vn3k]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Circulatory and tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) play a central role in cardiovascular (CV) and renal pathophysiology, making RAS inhibition a logical therapeutic approach in the prevention of CV and renal disease in patients with hypertension. The cardio- and renoprotective effects observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) monotherapy, together with the availability of a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), led to the investigation of the potential benefits of dual RAS inhibition.

In small studies, combinations of ARBs and ACE inhibitors were shown to be beneficial in patients with CV or renal disease, with improvement in surrogate markers. However, larger outcome trials involving combinations of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or DRIs did not demonstrate a reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, or after myocardial infarction. In fact, these combinations were associated with increased harm.

A recent meta-analysis of all major trials conducted over the past 22 years involving dual RAS inhibition has clearly shown that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual RAS inhibition. Hence, the recent evidence clearly advocates against the use of dual RAS inhibition, and single RAS inhibition appears to be the most suitable approach to controlling blood pressure and improving patient outcomes.

Regarding the medical management for renal artery stenosis, specifically with respect to antihypertensive therapy, the ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, such as ACE inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), as first-line therapy in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis and hypertension. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics should be initiated as first-line additional therapies.

### Segmental renal artery stenosis diagnosed with captopril renography in a child [^117Sz8u3]. Pediatric Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

A 9-year-old girl with clinical suspicion of renovascular hypertension was referred for captopril renography. This evaluation revealed a segmental abnormality when the left kidney was analyzed as two separate cortical regions of interest. Subsequent angiography confirmed stenosis in the distal mid and lower pole branches of the left renal artery.

### A case report of successfully treated nephrotic syndrome after renal angioplasty [^113sWL33]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The standard treatment for renovascular hypertension accompanying renal artery stenosis (RAS) includes angioplasty and the administration of antihypertensive medication. Although nephrotic syndrome (NS) has been reported in association with RAS, the development of NS following revascularization of RAS is exceedingly rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 48-year-old man presented with uncontrolled hypertension and azotemia. The right kidney was atrophic, and RAS of the left kidney was suspected based on a post-captopril DTPA scan. His blood pressure stabilized after renal angioplasty; however, he complained of edema after one week. NS developed and was diagnosed as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) based on renal biopsy. He received an angiotensin receptor blocker. Proteinuria resolved after one year.

- **Conclusions**: FSGS rarely develops after angioplasty of renal artery stenosis. This is the first report of successful treatment of this condition using an angiotensin receptor blocker during one-year follow-up.

### Positive captopril renography without renal artery stenosis but a renal cell carcinoma [^114EahZA]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

A positive captopril renography indicates that a patient's hypertension is renin-dependent, most commonly caused by renal artery stenosis. The authors reported a case of positive captopril renography; however, CT demonstrated that the renal arteries were intact, but there was a large chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Renin-dependent hypertension was relieved soon after nephrectomy. It is an uncommon cause of positive captopril renography.

### Enalaprilat [^111zC1CW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **General**: As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be administered with caution to patients with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle.

- **Impaired renal function**: Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by enalapril can lead to changes in renal function in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of this system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril or enalaprilat, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death.

	- In clinical studies involving hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of those receiving enalapril. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril or enalaprilat and/or diuretic therapy. Renal function should be monitored during the first weeks of therapy in such patients.

	- Some hypertensive patients without pre-existing renal vascular disease have shown minor and transient increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, particularly when enalaprilat is administered concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. A dosage reduction of enalaprilat and/or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required.

### Unilateral renal artery stenosis presented with hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome - case report and literature review [^117FW5Mi]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment for renal artery stenosis-associated hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome (HHS) lies in the restoration of intravascular volume, prevention of acute insult from hypertensive crisis, and correction of underlying renal arterial stenosis. Volume depletion needs to be corrected first to improve systemic blood flow and prevent further injury resulting from renal ischemia. After volume repletion, a prompt decline in blood pressure can be achieved by intravenous calcium channel blocker administration, which has been suggested as the first-line drug for severe hypertension with acute kidney injury.

For cases with HHS, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker should be introduced to mitigate the over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system. However, the use of diuretics is not recommended due to the potential deleterious effects of fluid and sodium wasting, which could further activate the RAA system. Lastly, correction of renal artery stenosis can be achieved surgically through percutaneous renal angioplasty, renal artery reconstruction, or nephrectomy.

All patients received anti-hypertensive agents as the first-line therapy. Eleven and three cases underwent angioplasty and unilateral nephrectomy, respectively.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1164MacD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of blood pressure (BP) rise in renal artery stenosis (RAS) was first described 90 years ago. It is widely accepted that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) with lumen stenosis greater than 70% will cause a reduction of renal blood flow and hypoperfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, which in turn stimulates the release of renin followed by increased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Stenoses of lesser degrees are suggested to have minimal hemodynamic effects due to the compensatory mechanisms of renal autoregulation. However, renal autoregulation may be compromised in several groups of individuals, including the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus or heart failure (HF). Thus, it cannot be excluded that renal blood flow in such patient groups could be compromised in stenoses of lesser degrees.

Furthermore, ischemia of even a few nephrons can cause the full syndrome of renovascular hypertension, as shown in numerous cases of segmental RAS with excess unilateral renin release, striking hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of affected glomeruli, and reversal of hypertension by partial nephrectomy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. In unilateral RAS, the contralateral healthy kidney is expected to at least partly compensate for the above adverse effects of renin-dependent hypertension through pressure natriuresis. However, in the increasingly common cases of bilateral RAS, this compensation cannot be present, causing sodium/volume retention and leading to a volume-dependent hypertension phenotype and higher risk of 'flash' pulmonary edema.

### Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers to halt progression of chronic renal disease: Pathophysiology and indications [^1171g23G]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

It is no secret that we are confronted by an alarmingly increasing number of patients with progressive renal disease. There is ample evidence for the notion that angiotensin II (Ang II) is a major culprit in progression. The vasopeptide Ang II has multiple nonhemodynamic pathophysiological actions on the kidney, including proinflammatory and profibrogenic effects. Diverse complex Ang II-generating systems have been identified, including specifically local tissue-specific renin-angiotensin systems (RAS). For example, proximal tubular cells have all components required for a functional RAS capable of synthesizing Ang II.

Ang II is not the only effector of the RAS; other peptides generated by the RAS influence renal function and structure as well. Moreover, the discovery that Ang II can be generated by enzymes other than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and that Ang II and other RAS-derived peptides bind to various receptors with different functional consequences, further adds to the complexity of this system.

Several major clinical trials have clearly shown that ACE inhibitor treatment slows the progression of renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. Well-controlled studies demonstrated that this effect is in part independent of blood pressure control. More recently, with Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists, a similarly protective effect on renal function was seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. Neither ACE inhibitor treatment nor AT1 receptor blockade completely abrogates progression of renal disease.

### Management of renovascular hypertension [^1125zXuX]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Renal artery stenosis is a potentially reversible cause of hypertension, and transcatheter techniques are essential to its treatment. Angioplasty remains a first-line treatment for stenosis secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia. Renal artery stenting is commonly used in atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, although recent trials have cast doubts upon its efficacy. Renal denervation is a promising procedure for the treatment of resistant hypertension, and in the future, its indications may expand.

### Diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis [^1141u3Yn]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

A reduction in the diameter of the renal arteries can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction, and/or pulmonary edema. About 90% of patients with renal artery stenosis have atherosclerosis, and 10% have fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is a common condition that typically occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with coexistent vascular disease at nonrenal sites. Patients who undergo revascularization to treat hypertension associated with atherosclerotic stenosis need to continue medication with statins, antiplatelet agents, and renin-angiotensin antagonists after the procedure to prevent renal and cardiovascular events.

Two recent trials compared renal outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic stenosis who were treated with antihypertensive medication plus stenting with those in patients who were treated with medication alone. Available results favor a conservative approach (medication only) for most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. These results, however, concern patients with stable clinical conditions and, in many cases, only moderate renal artery lesions. Blood pressure outcome after angioplasty is more favorable in patients with fibromuscular renal artery disease, who usually do not have renal failure, than in those with atherosclerosis.

### Renal artery stenting in consecutive high-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A prospective 2-center cohort study [^116FU1DM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In up to 12% of patients with kidney failure, the attributable cause may be progressive ischemic nephropathy caused by atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. Our study included data on kidney function from 24 months before renal artery stenting, and our observations suggest that revascularization may change the natural course of ischemic kidney injury in patients with severe renal artery stenosis. Thus, in 85% of successfully treated patients with rapidly declining kidney function at baseline, the estimated GFR was unchanged or had improved at last follow-up compared with baseline.

Furthermore, captopril renography 24 months after renal artery stenting showed a significant improvement of the kidney function on the treated side. We also observed a significant decrease in albuminuria after renal artery stenting. Taken together, our observations suggest that renal artery stenting can stabilize and even increase estimated GFR in patients with rapidly declining kidney function. This conclusion concurs with a recently published retrospective study of the effect of renal artery stenting in patients with rapidly deteriorating kidney function.

- **Baseline predictors for favorable response**: Predictors included the severity of clinical presentation at baseline (increasing systolic BP, rapidly declining kidney function, and heart failure/sudden pulmonary edema) and angiographic stenosis ≥ 90%.

- **Unfavorable response in estimated GFR**: Of interest, a resistance index ≥ 0.8 was associated with an unfavorable response in estimated GFR after PTRA, which is in agreement with previous studies.

### Captopril [^115s7Bbd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If further blood pressure reduction is required, the dose of captopril tablets may be increased to 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and then, if necessary, to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., while continuing the diuretic. The usual dose range is 25 to 150 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. A maximum daily dose of 450 mg captopril tablets should not be exceeded.

For patients with severe hypertension, such as accelerated or malignant hypertension, when temporary discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy is not practical or desirable, or when prompt titration to more normotensive blood pressure levels is indicated, diuretics should be continued. Other antihypertensive medications should be stopped, and captopril tablets dosage should be promptly initiated at 25 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d., under close medical supervision.

When necessitated by the patient's clinical condition, the daily dose of captopril tablets may be increased every 24 hours or less under continuous medical supervision, until a satisfactory blood pressure response is obtained or the maximum dose of captopril tablets is reached. In this regimen, the addition of a more potent diuretic, such as furosemide, may also be indicated.

Beta-blockers may also be used in conjunction with captopril tablets therapy; however, the effects of the two drugs are less than additive (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### SPL drug information for captopril [^115GuUkj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of captopril PO (also known as Capoten):

- **ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema**: Use caution in patients taking mTOR inhibitors.
- **Anaphylactoid reactions**: Use caution in patients on hemodialysis with high-flux membranes, desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom, or LDL apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption.
- **Decreased blood neutrophil count, agranulocytosis**: Use caution in patients with connective tissue disease (such as SLE or systemic sclerosis) or impaired renal function.
- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with HF or volume or salt depletion, such as those receiving diuretics or undergoing dialysis.
- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia, including renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, or those taking medications causing hyperkalemia or potassium supplements.
- **Increased urine protein, jaundice, ALF**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as captopril has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Discontinue in case of jaundice or a marked increase in liver enzymes.

### Endovascular therapy of renal artery stenosis: Where do we stand today [^111p4iB1]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Angioplasty and stent therapy for stenoses of the renal artery have long been part of the everyday life of interventional radiologists. Newer studies, however, challenge the clinical significance of the method. A decisive advantage of endovascular techniques for the treatment of arterial hypertension, as opposed to therapy with modern antihypertensives, could not be proven in individual randomized studies, even though blood pressure control was observed to be facilitated by PTA (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty). Renal function often did not show any sustainable improvement following the elimination of the renal artery stenosis; however, progression of kidney insufficiency could be slowed down. There is still no general justification from the existing data for the treatment of incidental stenoses.

Many questions remain open regarding the technique. Whereas fibromuscular dysplasia can generally be treated by balloon angioplasty, a metallic endoprosthesis must often be used for atherosclerotic stenoses. The outstanding morphologic results of stent therapy in the short and medium-term course are often simply used to justify primary stent implantation in ostial stenoses.

### Is duplex scanning the best screening test for renal artery stenosis [^112AXS77]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Screening for renal artery stenosis is indicated in patients with suspected renovascular hypertension or ischemic nephropathy to identify those who could benefit from renal artery interventions. The critical requirements for a clinically useful screening test include safety, low cost, and a high sensitivity or low false-negative rate. Arteriography remains the "gold standard" for the anatomic diagnosis of renal artery disease, but it is unsuitable for screening because of its high cost and invasive nature.

Although renal duplex scanning is technically difficult, experienced laboratories have been able to achieve sensitivities and specificities in the range of 93% to 98% for the identification of stenoses in the main renal arteries. Renal duplex scanning also provides a method for assessing the renal parenchyma and predicting the clinical outcome of renal revascularization. The principal limitation of renal duplex scanning is failure to identify accessory renal arteries. The finding of one or more widely patent main renal arteries makes ischemic nephropathy unlikely, because this condition results from "total" renal ischemia. However, renovascular hypertension can be present with normal main renal arteries when there are isolated stenoses involving accessory renal arteries, so further testing may be indicated in selected hypertensive patients with normal main renal arteries by duplex scanning.

Currently, duplex scanning in a qualified vascular laboratory arguably is the best screening test for renal artery stenosis.

### Captopril [^111hggif]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The administration of captopril tablets results in a reduction of peripheral arterial resistance in hypertensive patients, with either no change or an increase in cardiac output. There is an increase in renal blood flow following the administration of captopril tablets, while the glomerular filtration rate usually remains unchanged.

Reductions in blood pressure are typically maximal 60 to 90 minutes after the oral administration of an individual dose of captopril tablets. The duration of effect is dose-related. The reduction in blood pressure may be progressive; therefore, several weeks of therapy may be required to achieve maximal therapeutic effects. The blood pressure-lowering effects of captopril and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and beta-blockers have a less than additive effect.

Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine positions. Orthostatic effects and tachycardia are infrequent but may occur in volume-depleted patients. Abrupt withdrawal of captopril tablets has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.

In patients with heart failure, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance and blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload), and pulmonary vascular resistance, as well as increased cardiac output and exercise tolerance time (ETT), have been demonstrated. These hemodynamic and clinical effects occur after the first dose and appear to persist for the duration of therapy.

### Interobserver agreement on captopril renography for assessing renal vascular disease [^116bSPBm]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Captopril-stimulated renography is widely used to screen selected groups of hypertensive patients for renal vascular disease. Evaluation of the test is a complex task, and lack of interobserver agreement on the assessment and interpretation of renographic parameters may contribute to differences in sensitivity and specificity between studies.

- **Methods**: Three experienced nuclear medicine physicians evaluated 658 renograms of 503 hypertensive patients suspected of having renal vascular disease from a large Dutch multicenter study (the Dutch Renal Artery Stenosis Intervention Cooperative [DRASTIC] study). Interobserver agreement on several renographic parameters was assessed by the kappa statistic and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

- **Results**: The interobserver agreement on the time to excretion was high: The pooled ICC was 0.90. The pooled kappa was ≥ 0.65 for the pattern of the time — activity curves, the visual aspect of the scintigraphic images (visible uptake and kidney size), and the judgment on the presence of renal artery stenosis. However, the interobserver agreement on cortical retention and pelvic retention by visual inspection of the images was rather low (pooled kappa = 0.46 and 0.52, respectively). Pelvic retention was found to complicate the interpretation of renography.

- **Conclusion**: Interobserver agreement on most of the renographic parameters was satisfactory, but the assessment of cortical retention was more difficult, particularly in the presence of pelvic retention. Captopril renography should be interpreted with caution if pelvic retention is present.

### Reliability of captopril renography in patients under chronic therapy with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists [^115fBDRo]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Captopril renography is a reliable, widely used test for the functional diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. Well-recognized drawbacks of the procedure include reduced accuracy in patients with bilateral disease or renal impairment, as well as the possible interference from antihypertensive medication, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Currently, no data exist regarding the reliability of captopril renography in patients with renovascular hypertension evaluated while they are under chronic treatment with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists (Sartans). Moreover, the renographic response of the kidney with renal artery stenosis to prolonged therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has not yet been evaluated.

- **Methods**: We investigated the diagnostic effectiveness of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine captopril renography performed after an acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to the daily dose of an AT1 receptor antagonist in 13 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis and subsequent evidence of renovascular hypertension, based on short-term (3 months) blood pressure outcomes after revascularization. The renographic evaluation was first performed after ingestion of the daily therapy of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist alone (Sartan renography) and was repeated within 7 days after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to chronic treatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (captopril-Sartan renography). A cohort of 13 patients with a final diagnosis of essential hypertension was c…

Captopril can be removed from the adult circulation via hemodialysis. However, there is insufficient data regarding the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing captopril from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is ineffective for removing captopril, and there is no information available on the use of exchange transfusion for its removal from the general circulation.

### What is critical renal artery stenosis? Implications for treatment [^114qt9tt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease due to progressive atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the elderly. It is unclear at what degree of renal artery stenosis intervention should be recommended. To answer this question, the unilateral or bilateral activation of the renin-angiotensin system or its absence was detected by captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in 49 hypertensive patients, aged 63 years, with normal or near-normal renal function (serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). This information was matched against radiographic measurements of the extent of renal artery stenosis.

With few exceptions, unilateral or bilateral hypersecretion of renin was associated with an 80% or greater reduction in renal artery lumen diameter. In contrast, normal secretion or suppression of renin production in a kidney contralateral to an ischemic one was associated with either a normal caliber renal artery or renal artery stenosis less than 80%. These findings suggest that renal artery stenosis less than 80% should be monitored rather than treated because improvement of renal function and amelioration of hypertension are not expected unless the renin-angiotensin system has been activated in the affected kidney. Renoprotection by early intervention is uncertain because the progression of renal artery stenosis is unpredictable. Normal captopril-stimulated renal vein renin measurements in hypertensive patients obviate the need for further work-up or interventional therapy of renovascular disease.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis: Epidemiology, cardiovascular outcomes, and clinical prediction rules [^1161priA]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common primary disease of the renal arteries, and it is associated with two major clinical syndromes: ischemic renal disease and hypertension. The prevalence of this disease in the population is undefined because there is no simple and reliable test applicable on a large scale. Renal artery involvement in patients with coronary heart disease and/or heart failure is frequent; it may influence cardiovascular outcomes and survival in these patients.

- **Pulmonary edema episodes**: Suspecting renal arterial stenosis is justified, as observations show that about one-third of elderly patients with heart failure display atherosclerotic renal disease. Whether interventions aimed at restoring arterial patency may reduce high mortality in patients with heart failure is still unclear because, at the time of writing, no prospective study has been carried out in these patients.

- **Cost containment and clinical cues**: Increased awareness of the need for cost containment has renewed interest in clinical cues for suspecting renovascular hypertension. In this regard, the DRASTIC study constitutes an important attempt at validating clinical prediction rules. In this study, a clinical rule was derived that predicted renal artery stenosis as efficiently as renal scintigraphy (sensitivity: clinical rule, 65% versus scintigraphy, 72%; specificity: 87% versus 92%).

When tested in a systematic and quantitative manner, clinical findings can perform as accurately as more complex tests in detecting renal artery stenosis.

### Vasotec [^115w44EG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle, such as those with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- **Impaired renal function**: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including Vasotec, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death (see precautions, drug interactions).

In clinical studies in hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of patients. These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients, renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.

Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially when Vasotec has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or Vasotec may be required.

Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include an assessment of renal function to guide appropriate management.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

In the Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RASCAD) trial, 84 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for ischemic heart disease and who had renal artery stenosis > 50% but ≤ 80% were randomized to revascularization plus standard medical therapy versus medical therapy alone. After 1 year, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups, i.e. change in echocardiographic left ventricular mass index. The study had no inclusion criterion relevant to hypertension or other ARVD phenotypes, had slow enrollment rates, and a final population that was half of that planned.

The multicenter Cardiovascular Outcomes with Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL) study originally aimed to enroll 947 patients with ARVD and either uncontrolled systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or CKD and RAS > 80% but < 60% but 20 mmHg. The primary endpoint was a composite of death from CV or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for CHF, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal replacement therapy. The CORAL study replicated the findings of the STAR and ASTRAL trials and also showed no additional benefit in the composite primary endpoint when compared with medical therapy alone. However, several methodological issues appeared. Similar to the other clinical trials, patients with a presentation suggestive of critical RAS (flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function after ACEI/ARB use) were often excluded from the studies.

### Approach to the patient: Reninoma [^114gG5Qa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Renovascular hypertension

RVH is an important cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for 1% to 5% of hypertension cases and 5.4% in young adults. RVH is generally due to renal artery stenosis (RAS), typically from atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) in a 9:1 ratio. In both pathological processes, reduced renal perfusion and consequent altered flow dynamics at the distal tubular macula densa and the proximal tubule stretch receptors lead to renin release from juxtaglomerular cells.

Atherosclerotic RAS typically affects older patients with atherosclerotic disease at other sites. The treatment of choice is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) or ACE inhibitor (ACEi) to inhibit the RAAS pathway, combined with statin therapy aimed at reducing the atherosclerotic burden, in addition to the modification of vascular risk factors such as smoking cessation, diet and lifestyle changes, and diabetes control. Angioplasty and stenting of stenosed arteries are of limited benefit, and recurrence of stenosis in previously treated lesions ranges from 10% to 50%.

Renal FMD is classified into focal or multifocal based on imaging appearance. Focal renal FMD tends to present in patients younger than 30 years with more severe hypertension. Cases may be familial, occasionally with Mendelian pattern inheritance; specific genetic mutations have been described in a minority of cases. Multifocal renal FMD tends to occur later in life and is more prevalent in women. Concomitant involvement of other arterial vascular beds may occur, and particularly cerebral FMD should be considered.

Investigation of renovascular hypertension

Computed tomography (CT) and other imaging techniques are employed in the investigation of RVH.

### Renal arterial intervention and angiotensin blockade in atherosclerotic nephropathy [^117C9Vmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal arterial disease (ARAD) is becoming a more important cause of end-stage renal failure. Diagnosis is more easily achieved because of greater clinical suspicion and more refined screening tools. However, the medical and interventional management of patients with ARAD is not well defined in the literature because there have been few randomized trials.

Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and more recently angiotensin-antagonists, has become much more widespread. It is inevitable that, knowingly or not, we administer these drugs to patients with ARAD. We describe two case studies in which the angiotensin-antagonist irbesartan was given to patients with effectively single-functional kidneys after successful renal arterial radiologic intervention.

- **Rationale for the use of irbesartan**: The primary goal was to control blood pressure (BP), which had not responded to the initial arterial intervention. This intervention took place in patients both refractory to and intolerant of many other antihypertensive drugs. Irbesartan successfully and safely reduced systemic BP, measured through ambulatory BP, without prejudicing renal function, which was assessed by individual kidney function GFR.

### ACE inhibition is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade for renography in renal artery stenosis [^116iTnhA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as well as angiotensin II receptor antagonists, can prevent the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin II on the efferent renal vessels, which is believed to play an important role in renovascular hypertension. This effect is assumed to be essential for demonstrating renovascular hypertension through captopril renography.

In this study, renographic changes induced by captopril and the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan were compared in patients with a high probability of renovascular hypertension. Twenty-five patients with 33 stenosed renal arteries (grade of stenosis > 50%) and hypertension were studied. Captopril, valsartan, and baseline renography were performed within 48 hours using technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine.

Blood pressure was monitored, plasma renin concentration before and after intervention was determined, and urinary flow was estimated from the urinary output of the hydrated patients. Alterations in renographic curves after intervention were evaluated according to the Santa Fe consensus on ACE inhibitor renography. Captopril renography was positive, indicating renovascular hypertension, in 25 of the 33 stenosed vessels, whereas valsartan renography was positive in only ten.

Blood pressure during captopril and valsartan renography was not different; the reduction in blood pressure was the same after valsartan and captopril. Plasma renin concentration was comparable for valsartan and captopril studies, showing suppressed values after intervention in as many as 12 of the 25 patients.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

The major limitations of RCTs in the field and the evolution of treatment practices are important to consider. The aforementioned RCTs attempted to properly examine whether revascularization of the renal artery is superior to medical treatment alone in ARVD. An objective reader should note that investigators of more recent trials tried to avoid the limitations of early RCTs. This is exemplified in the original design of the CORAL trial, which included a large population, a clinically relevant cardiorenal primary endpoint, and required both resistant hypertension and angiographically documented severe RAS. However, the complexity of the disease under study led to very slow recruitment and protocol amendments that introduced bias.

Overall, a set of major limitations are common for these RCTs. All of them had non-standardized inclusion criteria, resulting in the enrolment of large numbers of patients with mild/asymptomatic RAS, mild hypertension, or advanced CKD with small kidneys, i.e. individuals with almost certain absence of benefit from RAS revascularization. The presence of systematic biases in radiological assessment of RAS and poor laboratory proof of critical RAS is also highly possible, as there was considerable variability not only between, but also within study protocols in imaging techniques used for RAS diagnosis and evaluation, often resulting in an overestimation of the degree of stenosis. Additional methodological limitations include a large number of patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria who were not randomized based on investigators' judgment without specific justification.

### The utility of renal venous renin studies in selection of patients with renal artery stenosis for angioplasty: a retrospective study [^115rKCG7]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Recent studies of renal artery stenosis (RAS) failed to demonstrate greater benefit from angioplasty in terms of blood pressure (BP) lowering than medical treatment. Not all RAS cases are hemodynamically significant, and identifying patients likely to benefit from angioplasty remains essential.

We examined whether performing renal venous renin studies under stringent conditions might predict BP improvement. Patients with at least 60% RAS who underwent renal venous renin measurements from 2008 to 2013 were identified. Renal venous renin lateralization ratios (RVRRs) were calculated by dividing venous renin from the stenotic kidney by contralateral levels before and after stimulation with enalaprilat or captopril. Benefit was defined as BP less than 140/90 mmHg without medication, a 10% decreased mean BP without increased daily defined doses (DDDs), or decreased DDD without a significant increase in mean BP.

Twenty-eight patients were treated medically, and 42 with angioplasty (median age 60.1 years, 41% male, 29% chronic kidney disease, 50% resistant hypertension). At 11.4 ± 3.3 months, 69% of patients treated with angioplasty had BP benefit compared with 25% with medical treatment (P < 0.001). Logistic regression identified resistant hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–0.82, P = 0.03) and baseline DDD (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98, P = 0.04) as being negatively associated, and positive stimulated RVRR (OR 21.6, 95% CI 3.50–133.3, P = 0.001) positively associated with benefit from angioplasty.

Regarding medical management for renal artery stenosis, specifically concerning antihypertensive therapy, CHEP 2018 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy in patients with hypertension attributable to atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. It is important to recognize that these patients do not benefit from renal angioplasty and stenting over optimal pharmacotherapy alone.

### Incidental atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients undergoing elective coronary angiography: Are these lesions significant [^114DWr4m]? American Journal of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiologists often identify atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) during cardiac angiography. The significance of such 'incidental' ARAS (iARAS) is not well understood. The present study aimed to describe renal perfusion using non-captopril (baseline) nuclear renograms in patients with iARAS and to determine the characteristics associated with a positive captopril renogram.

- **Methods**: Patients presenting for non-emergent coronary angiography between June 2001 and February 2006 were angiographically screened for iARAS. Those with > 50% stenosis of one or both renal arteries were referred to nephrology and underwent nuclear renography.

- **Results**: A total of 131 patients had renograms. The mean age was 73.2 ± 8.1 years, and the median eGFR was 51.2 (40.0, 66.6) ml/min/1.73 m². Of these, 51% had evidence of reduced perfusion to one kidney, with 13% being discordant with the angiographic lesion. Additionally, 9% had positive captopril renograms. Captopril renogram positivity was associated with severe unilateral stenosis (p = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: In cardiac patients diagnosed with iARAS, the presence of known anatomic lesions did not correlate with captopril renogram positivity. There is uncertainty regarding whether nuclear renography is a poor functional test in this population or if the lesions are not functionally significant. These results lead us to question both the significance of such lesions and the utility of conducting renograms in this population.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor initiation and dose uptitration in children with cardiovascular disease: A retrospective review of standard clinical practice and a prospective randomized clinical trial [^111AdP6b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

During the captopril uptitration, the serum electrolyte levels of all study subjects were measured at baseline and once again during treatment. For the rapid uptitration protocol, electrolytes were repeated at a mean of 3.4 ± 1.0 days after the initial captopril dose, whereas for the prolonged protocol, repeated measurements were made at a mean of 5.1 ± 3.4 days after starting captopril (P = 0.04). There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage change (baseline to repeat measurement) of any variable between the rapid and prolonged protocols. Protocol variances related to renal function did not differ between the groups.

- **Acei use postdischarge**: Follow-up data were available in 26 of 46 study subjects who were discharged from the hospital and seen again as outpatients in our center between 4 and 12 weeks postdischarge. Follow-up data were unavailable in 20 of 46 study subjects. Of these, 2 died after discharge from the hospital, 3 received a transplant during their hospital admission and had ACEIs discontinued at the time of transplantation, 1 was not followed by our center postdischarge, and 14 did not have a follow-up outpatient visit between 4 and 12 weeks postdischarge.

For those in whom data were available, the median (IQR) duration from discharge at the time of the follow-up data collection was 7.6 (5.1–9.6) weeks. At the time of their follow-up visit, 15 of 26 patients continued to take captopril, 3 had been switched to enalapril.

### Scai expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^113kPmhb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) includes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, resulting in renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenting has emerged as the primary revascularization strategy in most patients with hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic RAS. Despite the frequency of observed hemodynamically significant RAS and the high rates of technical success with renal artery stenting, there remains considerable debate among experts regarding the role of medical therapy versus revascularization for renovascular hypertension.

Modern, prospective, multicenter registries continue to demonstrate improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excellent safety profiles in patients with RAS. Modern randomized controlled clinical trials comparing optimal medical therapy versus renal stenting — particularly those designed to demonstrate preservation in renal function after renal artery stenting — have shown limited benefit. However, these trials frequently excluded patients who might benefit from renal artery stenting.

This document was developed to guide physicians in the modern practical application of renal stenting, to highlight the limitations in the peer-reviewed literature, to suggest best practices in the performance of renal stenting, and to identify opportunities to advance the field.

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^116NJemk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Circulatory and tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) play a central role in cardiovascular (CV) and renal pathophysiology, making RAS inhibition a logical therapeutic approach in the prevention of CV and renal disease in patients with hypertension. The cardio- and renoprotective effects observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) monotherapy, together with the availability of a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), led to the investigation of the potential benefits of dual RAS inhibition.

In small studies, ARB and ACE inhibitor combinations were shown to be beneficial in patients with CV or renal disease, with improvement in surrogate markers. However, in larger outcome trials involving combinations of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or DRIs, dual RAS inhibition did not show a reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, or after myocardial infarction. It was, in fact, associated with increased harm.

A recent meta-analysis of all major trials conducted over the past 22 years involving dual RAS inhibition has clearly shown that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual RAS inhibition. Hence, the recent evidence clearly advocates against the use of dual RAS inhibition, and single RAS inhibition appears to be the most suitable approach to controlling blood pressure and improving patient outcomes.

### Ischemic nephropathy: Where are we now [^115QW5M5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Identification and reversing the loss of kidney function beyond occlusive disease of the renal arteries poses a major clinical challenge. Recent studies indicate that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis develops as a function of age and is commonly associated with other microvascular diseases, including nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. The risks of renal artery stenosis are related both to declining kidney function and to accelerated cardiovascular disease, with increased morbidity and mortality.

Newer drugs, including agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, have improved the level of blood pressure control for renovascular hypertension. Progressive renovascular disease during medical therapy can produce refractory hypertension, congestive heart failure, and renal failure with tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Recent studies indicate a complex interplay of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of fibrogenic cytokines as a result of experimental atherosclerosis and renal hypoperfusion.

Advances in imaging and interventional devices offer major new opportunities to prevent progressive loss of kidney function. Recent series indicate that although 25 to 30% of patients with impaired renal function can recover glomerular filtration after revascularization, many have no apparent change in kidney function, and 19 to 25% experience a significant loss of kidney function, in some cases as a result of atheroemboli. To select patients who are most likely to benefit from vascular intervention, clinicians should understand the pathophysiology of developing ischemic nephropathy.

### Captopril [^111nbAgY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Captopril tablets should be taken one hour before meals, and dosage must be individualized.

- **Dosage and administration**:
	- For hypertension, the initiation of therapy requires consideration of recent antihypertensive drug treatment, the extent of blood pressure elevation, salt restriction, and other clinical circumstances. If possible, discontinue the patient's previous antihypertensive drug regimen for one week before starting captopril tablets.
	- The initial dose of captopril tablets is 25 mg b.i.d. (twice daily) or t.i.d. (three times daily). If satisfactory reduction of blood pressure has not been achieved after one or two weeks, the dose may be increased to 50 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Concomitant sodium restriction may be beneficial when captopril tablets are used alone.
	- The dose of captopril tablets in hypertension usually does not exceed 50 mg t.i.d. Therefore, if the blood pressure has not been satisfactorily controlled after one to two weeks at this dose (and the patient is not already receiving a diuretic), a modest dose of a thiazide-type diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily) should be added. The diuretic dose may be increased at one to two-week intervals until its highest usual antihypertensive dose is reached.
	- If captopril tablets are being started in a patient already receiving a diuretic, captopril tablets therapy should be initiated under close medical supervision (see warnings and precautions regarding drug interactions and hypotension), with dosage and titration of captopril tablets as noted above.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^1152pM9Y]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Owing to the cardiovascular (CV) and renal protective effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, dual RAS blockade is currently under investigation, i.e. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) combinations. However, studies of double RAS blockade in high-risk patients have provided mixed results, and evidence, therefore, does not support this therapeutic approach.

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing an ARB may be preferred over those containing ACE inhibitors, due to their superior tolerability. ACE inhibitors inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, leading to adverse effects such as dry cough and angioedema. Several studies have shown that treatment with ARBs is associated with significantly lower rates of cough and angioedema compared to ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, ARBs, particularly telmisartan, are well tolerated in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Due to their superior tolerability, ARBs may be associated with a higher rate of adherence than ACE inhibitors. In a large cohort of patients in Italy, the rate of discontinuation of the initial single antihypertensive drug treatment was lower for ARBs compared with ACE inhibitors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–0.94).

In addition to increasing the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of thiazides and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), adding a RAS inhibitor may help to attenuate the unfavorable metabolic side effects of thiazide monotherapy and CCB-induced peripheral edema. CCB-induced peripheral edema, which is most likely to occur with dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, is caused by increased capillary pressure and flow.

### Renal artery stenting in consecutive high-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A prospective 2-center cohort study [^113peEe4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Renography was performed with 99m technetium‐mercapto‐acetyl‐triglycine or 99m technetium‐diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Captopril renography was carried out 60 minutes after 25 mg of captopril had been administered orally. Baseline renography was carried out after the patients had discontinued treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin‐receptor blocker (ARB) for 5 to 10 days, according to local guidelines. Renograms were classified according to the consensus report on ACEi renography in low or intermediate/high probability for renovascular hypertension. The following was classified as intermediate/high probability for renovascular hypertension: relative function of one kidney ≤ 30% or increased excretion time ≥ 11 minutes (≥ grade 2 renogram) with no change between baseline and captopril renography, or an improvement in split kidney function of ≥ 5%, or a decrease in time to peak activity of at least 5 minutes (change ≥ 1 renogram grades) on the affected side on baseline renography compared with captopril renography.

- **Description of stenoses**: All noninvasive imaging and invasive angiographic findings were evaluated and described independently by two experienced radiologists, and stenoses were classified as < 70%, 70% to 79%, 80% to 89%, ≥ 90%, or occlusion.

- **Renal artery stenting**: PTRA with stent placement was performed via retrograde femoral or brachial approach with the use of different sheaths, guidewires, and balloon-expandable stents according to local team policy.

### Usefulness of captopril renography to predict the benefits of renal artery revascularization or captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy [^117NPUJv]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2002). Low credibility.

This retrospective study aimed to use captopril renography (CR) for predicting the benefits of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy. CR was utilized in 60 hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy for detecting the probability of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and predicting the benefits of renal artery revascularization or captopril treatment.

Ten of the 60 patients showed a high probability of RVH with marked changes in the renogram curve after an oral intake of 50-mg captopril compared to baseline findings. All of the 10 patients confirmed significant main renal artery stenosis, bilaterally in four patients and unilaterally in the remaining six, as determined by renal angiographic findings. After successful revascularization, blood pressure was well controlled and renal function was preserved in all of the 10 patients.

The other 50 patients displayed a low or intermediate probability of RVH with normal or unchanged findings on CR after 50-mg captopril. Subsequently, captopril alone or in combination treatment was started and continued for these 50 patients. After monitoring for at least 6 months, blood pressure was well controlled and renal function was preserved in all 50 patients on captopril treatment.

We conclude that CR should be considered as the standard diagnostic criteria for RVH and may be helpful in predicting the beneficial impact of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy.

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis prevalence and correlations in acute myocardial infarction patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary interventions: Data from nonrandomized single-center study (REN-ACS) — A single center, prospective, observational study [^114hHrtV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We are the first to evaluate the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention from a single tertiary center. As a novelty, we assessed hydration and metabolic status and measured arterial stiffness. We elaborated a predicting model for this condition.

- **Methods and results**: One hundred and eighty-one patients underwent concomitantly primary percutaneous coronary intervention and renal angiography. We obtained data on demographics, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, echocardiography, Killip class, and blood tests. In the first 24 hours post-primary percutaneous coronary intervention, we assessed bioimpedance through Body Composition Monitoring® and arterial stiffness through pulsed-wave velocity, SphygmoCor®. Significant stenosis (> 50% lumen narrowing) was present in 16.6% of patients. In the stenotic group, we recorded significantly higher arterial stiffness and dehydration, and a higher prevalence of women with multivascular coronary artery disease and heart failure. In our multivariate models, variables independently associated with stenosis were previous percutaneous coronary intervention, low estimated glomerular filtration rate, multivascular coronary artery disease, and total/extracellular body water. These models had good specificity and low sensitivity.

- **Conclusions**: We observed that patients with stenosis have a particular hydration, metabolic, and endothelial profile that could generate more future major adverse cardiac events. Hence, renal angiography should be considered in specific scenarios to better predict and manage potential complications.

### Captopril [^112k4N1g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The captopril tablets group had a 51% reduction in the risk of doubling of serum creatinine (P < 0.01) and a 51% reduction in risk for the combined endpoint of end-stage renal disease (dialysis or transplantation) or death (P < 0.01). Captopril tablets treatment resulted in a 30% reduction in urine protein excretion within the first 3 months (P < 0.05), which was maintained throughout the trial. The captopril tablets group had somewhat better blood pressure control than the placebo group, but the effects of captopril tablets on renal function were greater than would be expected from the group differences in blood pressure reduction alone. Captopril tablets were well tolerated in this patient population.

In two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, a total of 235 normotensive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, retinopathy, and microalbuminuria (20 to 200 mcg/min) were randomized to placebo or captopril tablets (50 mg b.i.d.) and followed for up to 2 years. Captopril tablets delayed the progression to overt nephropathy (proteinuria ≥ 500 mg/day) in both studies (risk reduction 67% to 76%; P < 0.05). Captopril tablets also reduced the albumin excretion rate. However, the long-term clinical benefit of reducing the progression from microalbuminuria to proteinuria has not been established.

Studies in rats and cats indicate that captopril tablets do not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent.

### Renin-dependent hypertension caused by nonfocal stenotic aberrant renal arteries: Proof of a new syndrome [^111cNU32]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

We have identified two relatively young patients with significant hypertension, an elongated single aberrant renal artery supplying blood to a renal segment, and evidence for localization of the elevated plasma renin activity to the side and vein draining the affected kidney. Furosemide-induced diuresis and acute oral captopril stimulated the renal vein/contralateral renin ratios to 4.3:1 and 6.5:1 in patients 1 and 2, respectively. These renal vein ratios are significantly higher than normal (> 3:1 under similar conditions).

Partial resection of the portion of the kidney affected by the aberrant tortuous artery led to a marked reduction in blood pressure in patient 1. Patient 2, not an operative candidate, responded satisfactorily to the use of a converting enzyme inhibitor, which helped to confirm the dependency of the blood pressure on the abnormal flow relationship existing within that aberrant artery and the kidney.

We believe these two patients are representative of a small but distinct subgroup within the larger number of patients with elongated single or multiple renal aberrant arteries. Each aberrant artery had no focal stenosis, although a decrease in flow relative to the tissue perfusion demands was apparent from the marked activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the venous system draining that artery. The increased length of such vessels may contribute to their decreased flow, although their average diameter may reside just above such a critical value for a normal length vessel. This new syndrome involves more than one component of the flow/resistance relationship.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^112qMyRs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

The figure shows the suspected mechanisms of blood pressure (BP) elevation in renal artery stenosis and recommendations for the management of renovascular hypertension. Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis induces excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing both sympathetic nervous system activation and fluid retention. This may lead to an elevated BP level at bedtime and/or an abnormal nocturnal BP dipping pattern.

- **Mechanisms and management of renovascular hypertension**: Renal artery stenosis leads to renal hypoperfusion, which induces excessive activation of the RAAS, the sympathetic nervous system, and fluid retention caused by the decrease in pressure natriuresis. These abnormalities cause elevation of BP levels and flash pulmonary edema. We speculate that an increase in nighttime BP levels and abnormal nocturnal BP dipping may occur in patients with resistant hypertension due to renovascular disease. Nighttime BP is an important target to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, especially in resistant hypertension. In the management of renovascular hypertension, interventional renal angioplasty, including percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), should be considered in patients with poor BP control despite adequate use of multiple antihypertensive medications. This is contraindicated in bilateral stenosis and requires careful management of renal dysfunction. Abbreviations used: ACEI (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors), ARB (angiotensin receptor antagonist), BMI (body mass index), BP (blood pressure), CHF (congestive heart failure), CKD (chronic kidney disease), CVD (cardiovascular disease).

### Captopril [^1151N67s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Proteinuria was observed in about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril, with total urinary proteins exceeding 1 g per day. Approximately 90 percent of these affected patients either showed evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (exceeding 150 mg/day), or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months, regardless of whether captopril was continued. Parameters of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in patients with proteinuria.

Excessive hypotension was rarely observed in hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of captopril use in salt/volume-depleted individuals, such as those treated vigorously with diuretics, patients with heart failure, or those undergoing renal dialysis (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions). In patients with heart failure, where blood pressure was either normal or low, transient decreases in mean blood pressure greater than 20 percent were recorded in about half of the patients. This transient hypotension is more likely to occur after any of the first several doses and is usually well-tolerated, producing either no symptoms or brief mild light-headedness. In rare instances, it has been associated with arrhythmia or conduction defects. Hypotension was the reason for discontinuation of the drug in 3.6 percent of patients with heart failure.

Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. A starting dose of 6.25
