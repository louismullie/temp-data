## Question

Diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical presentation and epidemiology to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria evolution and how to apply the 2010/2011 ACR criteria in practice. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and the minimal, judicious workup to exclude mimics. After that, I need to outline a multimodal management strategy, starting with nonpharmacologic foundations and then layering pharmacologic options tailored to symptoms. Finally, I should consider special populations, follow-up and monitoring, and synthesize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making at its core.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Fibromyalgia presents with chronic widespread pain, fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive complaints, and often mood disturbance; prevalence is roughly 2–8% globally, with a female predominance, and symptoms are best understood as reflecting central pain amplification rather than peripheral tissue disease, which explains why anti-inflammatories are typically ineffective [^a708fb08] [^f2401572] [^cdb8a7c4].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria evolution because I initially thought tender points were still required; that would be outdated. The 1990 ACR classification relied on tender points, but the 2010/2011 ACR diagnostic criteria moved away from tender points and instead use the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) to quantify pain distribution and symptom burden, with symptoms present for at least 3 months and no other disorder explaining the pain; a 2016 modification retained the same framework with minor adjustments, and these criteria are widely adopted in primary care and specialty settings [^28a2be57] [^4d0b3687] [^f2401572].

> I should double-check how to operationalize the 2010/2011 criteria at the bedside. Diagnosis is met if either WPI ≥ 7 and SSS ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9, with symptoms stable for ≥ 3 months and no better explanatory diagnosis; I need to ensure I document the pain map and symptom severity clearly and avoid overcalling fibromyalgia in the presence of red flags or focal findings that suggest an alternative process [^28a2be57] [^24fd937c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "ruling out everything". Fibromyalgia is a positive clinical diagnosis, but I should confirm that a limited, targeted workup is still prudent to exclude common mimics. Recommended initial labs include CBC, ESR/CRP, TSH, and CK; additional testing is guided by history and exam, and I should avoid reflexive imaging or extensive panels unless new symptoms emerge, because unnecessary testing can delay care and increase anxiety without changing management [^ffd1a966] [^5ebea944] [^24fd937c].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and key mimics so I don't miss treatable disease. Inflammatory arthritis, hypothyroidism, polymyalgia rheumatica, vitamin D deficiency, hepatitis C, and mood or anxiety disorders can present with widespread pain or fatigue; careful history, exam, and selective testing help distinguish these, and I need to remember that fibromyalgia can coexist with other conditions, which complicates interpretation of disease activity metrics in inflammatory diseases [^ba0c8212] [^383ad52c] [^6b291118].

> I will now examine the foundation of management, because nonpharmacologic care is first-line and often yields the most durable benefits. Patient education that explains fibromyalgia as a real, neurobiological pain amplification syndrome improves engagement and outcomes; aerobic exercise (land or aquatic) and strength training improve pain, function, and quality of life; cognitive behavioral therapy addresses pain catastrophizing, sleep, and mood; and sleep hygiene with possible CBT-I is important given the centrality of sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia [^64ad4357] [^a708fb08] [^077a3d08] [^7671c059].

> Let me think about pharmacotherapy as symptom-targeted adjuncts, not cures. I should confirm that duloxetine and milnacipran (SNRIs) have the strongest evidence for pain, fatigue, and function; pregabalin helps pain and sleep; low-dose tricyclics such as amitriptyline or cyclobenzaprine can improve pain and sleep; tramadol may be considered cautiously for refractory pain, but I need to ensure risk mitigation and close monitoring if used; NSAIDs are not effective for fibromyalgia pain and should be avoided routinely; and opioids should generally be avoided given lack of benefit and substantial harms, with any exception requiring a clear exit strategy and shared decision-making [^3d32367e] [^b0bd1934] [^c22111ab] [^6b327f9d] [^8c8d77a5] [^9a0e7f50] [^4ed74a62].

> But wait, what if symptoms are refractory despite guideline-concordant care? I should confirm that a stepped, multidisciplinary approach is reasonable: start with education and exercise, add one medication at a time targeting the most bothersome symptom, reassess in 4–6 weeks, and escalate to combined modalities or referral to pain management, rheumatology, or mental health as indicated; I need to ensure we avoid polypharmacy without clear benefit and keep revisiting goals and function at each visit [^0bc6acc6] [^358b5f11] [^90b20995].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In older adults, I should avoid tricyclics with anticholinergic burden and favor duloxetine or pregabalin with careful dosing; in patients with prominent mood symptoms, SNRIs or combined treatment with CBT may be synergistic; in those with severe sleep disturbance, prioritize sleep-focused strategies including CBT-I and consider medications with sleep benefits; and in veterans or those with chronic multisymptom illness, exercise and education remain foundational, with pharmacotherapy tailored to comorbidities and patient preferences [^4ed74a62] [^7671c059] [^077a3d08].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring so I don't lose track of progress. I will track pain, fatigue, sleep, mood, function, and patient-defined goals using simple tools like the Brief Pain Inventory and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, aiming for at least a 30% improvement in pain or function as clinically meaningful; I should reassess diagnosis if new red flags arise, minimize unnecessary testing, and reinforce self-management at every visit to sustain gains [^23ef486a] [^90b20995] [^5ebea944].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines. Suspect fibromyalgia in diffuse pain ≥ 3 months with fatigue, sleep, or cognitive symptoms; apply ACR 2010/2011 criteria to confirm; perform a focused exam and limited labs to exclude mimics; initiate education and exercise within 2–4 weeks; layer pharmacotherapy based on the most bothersome symptom; reassess in 4–6 weeks and adjust; and maintain a multidisciplinary, stepped approach with shared decision-making and periodic goal review, reserving specialty referral for diagnostic uncertainty or refractory disease [^24fd937c] [^358b5f11] [^25c16c39].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways so the plan is actionable. Fibromyalgia is a positive clinical diagnosis of central pain amplification; nonpharmacologic care is foundational and often sufficient; pharmacotherapy should be symptom-targeted, started low, and titrated carefully; and a stepped, patient-centered approach with realistic goals yields the best outcomes while avoiding iatrogenic harm from overtesting or inappropriate medications [^a708fb08] [^64ad4357] [^3d32367e].

---

Fibromyalgia is diagnosed clinically by **chronic widespread pain** for at least 3 months [^28a2be57], with associated fatigue, sleep, cognitive, and mood symptoms, and no better explanatory disorder [^f2401572]. The ACR 2010/2011 criteria use the Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Scale to standardize diagnosis [^28a2be57] [^4d0b3687]. Management is **multimodal**, prioritizing patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy [^64ad4357] [^a708fb08], with pharmacologic options (duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, low-dose tricyclics) for symptom control [^b0bd1934] [^c22111ab]. NSAIDs and opioids are not recommended for fibromyalgia pain [^f7055a7e] [^4ed74a62]. Prognosis varies: symptoms often persist, but early diagnosis and active self-management improve function and quality of life [^cdb8a7c4] [^28467b51].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria

Fibromyalgia presents with **chronic widespread pain** — defined as pain in at least four of five regions (axial, left upper, right upper, left lower, right lower) — lasting at least 3 months [^28a2be57] [^f2401572]. Associated symptoms include fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties ("fibro fog"), and mood disturbances such as anxiety and depression [^a708fb08] [^f2401572]. The ACR 2010/2011 diagnostic criteria require a Widespread Pain Index (WPI) ≥ 7 and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) ≥ 5, or WPI 3–6 and SSS ≥ 9, with symptoms present for at least 3 months and no other disorder explaining the pain [^28a2be57] [^4d0b3687]. The 2016 revision added a generalized pain criterion (pain in at least four of five regions) to improve specificity [^f94e2727].

---

## Diagnostic process and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on history, physical examination, and exclusion of other conditions [^8f162cf1]. Routine laboratory tests are not required but may be used to exclude other conditions when clinically indicated (e.g. CBC, ESR, CRP, TSH) [^ffd1a966] [^7a5350c1]. The differential diagnosis includes:

- Inflammatory rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) [^ba0c8212]
- Endocrine disorders (e.g. hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency) [^472c08e2]
- Neurological disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy) [^472c08e2]
- Chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and other functional somatic syndromes [^ba0c8212]

---

## Pathophysiology

Fibromyalgia is characterized by **central sensitization**, with amplified pain processing in the central nervous system [^a708fb08] [^cdb8a7c4]. Abnormalities in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine contribute to pain amplification, mood disturbances, and sleep abnormalities [^a093e5e8]. Genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and psychosocial stressors are implicated in its pathogenesis [^cdb8a7c4].

---

## Management strategies

Management of fibromyalgia requires a **multimodal approach**, combining nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions tailored to patient symptoms and preferences [^358b5f11] [^a708fb08].

---

### Nonpharmacological interventions

Nonpharmacological interventions are **first-line** and include:

- **Patient education**: Essential to improve understanding, self-management, and adherence to treatment [^64ad4357] [^28467b51].
- **Aerobic exercise**: Regular aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, swimming, cycling) improves pain, fatigue, sleep, and quality of life [^077a3d08] [^a708fb08].
- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective in reducing pain, fatigue, and psychological distress [^a708fb08] [^4ed74a62].
- **Sleep hygiene and CBT for insomnia**: Address sleep disturbances, a core symptom of fibromyalgia [^7671c059] [^51865282].

---

### Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments are used to manage specific symptoms and are **individualized** based on patient response and tolerability:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) | - Duloxetine <br/> - Milnacipran | Pain, fatigue, mood disturbances [^b0bd1934] [^3d32367e] |
| Gabapentinoids | - Pregabalin <br/> - Gabapentin | Pain, sleep disturbances [^c22111ab] [^d3c5ea2c] |
| Tricyclic antidepressants | - Amitriptyline <br/> - Cyclobenzaprine | Pain, sleep disturbances [^b0bd1934] [^6b327f9d] |
| Opioids | - Tramadol (only if absolutely necessary) | Refractory pain (short-term use only) [^8c8d77a5] [^4ed74a62] |

---

NSAIDs and opioids are **not recommended** for fibromyalgia pain due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^f7055a7e] [^4ed74a62].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Fibromyalgia is a **chronic condition** with fluctuating symptoms [^f2401572]. Prognosis varies: some patients experience significant improvement with treatment, while others have persistent symptoms [^0bf57ea8]. Early diagnosis, patient education, and active self-management are associated with better outcomes and improved quality of life [^28467b51] [^5ebea944].

---

## Conclusion

Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive and mood symptoms. Diagnosis is **clinical**, based on ACR criteria, and management is multimodal, emphasizing nonpharmacological interventions and individualized pharmacotherapy. Early diagnosis and comprehensive care improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Canadian Pain Society and Canadian Rheumatology Association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: a summary report [^8f162cf1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), taking into account advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options.

Methods

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient followup were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and following review were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

Results

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with a pivotal symptom of body pain. FM is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and not requiring specialist confirmation. There are no confirmatory laboratory tests, although some investigation may be indicated to exclude other conditions. Ideal care is in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objective should be reduction of symptoms, but also improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control are imperative. Medications afford only modest relief, with doses often lower than suggested, and drug combinations used according to clinical judgment. There is a need for continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment. Outcome should be aimed toward functioning within a normal life pattern and any culture of disablement should be discouraged.

Conclusion

These guidelines should provide the health community with reassurance for the global care of patients with FM with the aim of improving patient outcome by reducing symptoms and maintaining function.

### What can rehabilitation interventions achieve in patients with primary fibromyalgia? [^af356f32]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Symptoms of primary fibromyalgia (FM) persist for years, independent of applied therapy. That is the sad reality we have to deal with. But is that really true? The following review is a scan of literature from September 1, 2001 to August 31, 2002, concerning rehabilitation interventions for patients with FM, to find progress in this field and to ascertain state-of-the-art treatment strategies for the disease. The main problem when treating patients with FM successfully is the heterogeneity of the patients' group. Several investigators determined subgroups within FM patients diagnosed by the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria of FM. Therefore, uniform recommendations for treatment cannot be given. Current treatment recommendations for FM include reassurance and explanation of the nature of the illness, evaluation and eradication of mechanical stressors as far as possible, symptomatic analgesic drug treatment, moderate individually adapted physical exercises, and adjuvant psychotherapeutic support in an interdisciplinary setting. Individually adapted measures are highly emphasized to differentially treat FM subgroups, as far as identified. This review will focus on these points on the one hand, and provide an overview about the current symptomatically-oriented therapy on the other hand. This all occurs against the background of an unknown etiology of the disease so far. Experimental approaches will be noted as well. The demonstration of a long-term effective intervention for managing the symptoms associated with FM is needed.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^11aafc7c]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for Fibromyalgia 18 years ago, there have been an ever-increasing number of research articles and reviews. From the National Library of Medicine alone there are more than 10,000 articles related to fibromyalgia. The major clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia have not changed, but their prevalence, associations, relative importance to the patient, and scientific underpinnings are increasingly better understood. This article provides an update on fibromyalgia symptomatology and looks at issues that need to be considered in the development of updated diagnostic guidelines. There is still no gold standard for making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but there is an increasing consensus for the development of new guidelines for diagnosis that modifies the currently proscribed tender point evaluation.

### Are the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia better than the 1990 criteria? [^4d0b3687]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is difficult to diagnose and manage chronic pain condition whose symptoms have no clear pathophysiological cause, although it is thought that patient hypersensitivity to a range of stimuli may give rise to mechanical hyperalgesia as a result of altered central nociceptive processing. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, which have been widely used in clinical practice, require the existence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) for > 3months, and the presence of at least 11 out of 18 specified tender points upon digital palpation, although this latter criterion has long been criticised. The newer 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria state that FM can be defined as CWP associated with somatic symptoms, and recommend the use of a widespread pain index and a scale to rate symptom severity. A modified version of the 2010 criteria removed the physician assessment of the extent of somatic symptoms and replaced it by a summary score of three self-reported symptoms, thus making it easier to use while maintaining its sensitivity. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of all of these criteria.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management for the primary healthcare provider [^0136f7bf]. Journal of Women's Health (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a disorder of chronic generalized musculoskeletal pain affecting 2% of the general population, with an increased frequency in women. Clinical diagnosis relies on history and research-supported tender point criteria. As in other chronic pain syndromes, a multidimensional approach optimizes treatment response. Empirical data and consensus support the use of nonpharmacological modalities, such as education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy, in the management of fibromyalgia. Evidence-supported pharmacological interventions include tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, alpha-2-delta ligands, and other serotonergic-noradrenergic analgesic agents, such as tramadol. This paper offers the primary healthcare provider a systematic approach to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia and management strategies based on available evidence, consensus, and empirical data.

### Fibromyalgia: a clinical review [^a708fb08]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Fibromyalgia is present in as much as 2% to 8% of the population, is characterized by widespread pain, and is often accompanied by fatigue, memory problems, and sleep disturbances.

Objective

To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia.

Evidence Review

The medical literature on fibromyalgia was reviewed from 1955 to March 2014 via MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, with an emphasis on meta-analyses and contemporary evidence-based treatment guidelines. Treatment recommendations are based on the most recent evidence-based guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society and graded from 1 to 5 based on the level of available evidence.

Findings

Numerous treatments are available for managing fibromyalgia that are supported by high-quality evidence. These include nonpharmacological therapies (education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological therapies (tricyclics, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids).

Conclusions and Relevance

Fibromyalgia and other "centralized" pain states are much better understood now than ever before. Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances. Effective treatment for fibromyalgia is now possible.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^51865282]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fibromyalgia is a complex, heterogeneous conditionthat affects 2% to 3% of the global population. In the absence of a cure, a range of treatments are offered to alleviate symptoms. Most people with fibromyalgia complain about sleep problems. Fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems are poorly managed, and after an initial diagnosis, people continue to seek help to improve their sleep for many years.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

This systematic review and network meta‐analysis provides a comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis of randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems.
A wide range of interventions, especially nonpharmacologic interventions, have been tested in fibromyalgia trials with very low‐to‐moderate certainty regarding effectiveness.
Our results indicate that engaging in some forms of exercise — such as land‐based aerobic exercise training in combination with flexibility training and aquatic‐based aerobic exercise training — may improve sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia.
Certain pharmacologic interventions may also be effective in improving sleep but not without side effects.

The 2015 European guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia considered sleep as a key outcome of interest. Although general recommendations were made for interventions to manage sleep, these were graded as "weak" due to a paucity of published evidence at that time. Additionally, sleep was not the primary focus of the guidelines. Previously published evidence reviews informed the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) draft guidelines for the management of chronic pain; however, these cluster a wide range of conditions (including osteoarthritis, mechanical back pain, and fibromyalgia) and do not have a specific focus on sleep. Given the number of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field since 2015, the objective of this study was to undertake a comprehensive evidence synthesis and network meta‐analysis (NMA) to assess the clinical effectiveness and adverse events of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for the management of fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems.

### A symptom-based approach to pharmacologic management of fibromyalgia [^1b500e9a]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a prevalent disorder that is characterized by widespread pain along with numerous other symptoms, including fatigue, poor sleep, mood disorders, and stiffness. Previous guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia recommended an approach that integrates pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies selected according to the symptoms experienced by individual patients. However, they offered no recommendations for a system of patient assessment that would provide a basis for individualized treatment selection. We present a simple, rapid and easily remembered system for symptom quantitation and pharmacologic management of fibromyalgia that combines visual analogue scale symptom scores from a modified form of the disease-neutral Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, with a review of medications that can be used to treat the individual symptoms. This symptom-based approach is amenable to caring for patients with fibromyalgia in a busy clinical practice.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^dc2227b9]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Further guidance on the diagnostic issues in D2T RA, including the clinical implications of the results, will be provided by the EULAR Task Force on D2T RA in their recommendations for the management of D2T RA, which will be published soon. Additionally, a research agenda will be provided including topics that should be addressed in future studies.

In conclusion, this SLR highlights the scarcity of evidence on the optimal confirmation or ruling out of a diagnosis of RA and relevant differential diagnoses in D2T RA patients. Therefore, textbook knowledge on potential alternative and/or coexisting mimicking diseases remains highly relevant. When currently used clinical measures may not be trusted as in D2T RA patients, US may have some additional value to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in these patients as well as in those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia. However, more high-quality studies addressing D2T RA patients in whom there is reasonable doubt about the diagnosis and about the presence of inflammatory activity are required.

### The pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia [^13deb735]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Research in fibromyalgia has increased understanding of the possible genetic and environmental factors that could be involved in the etiology of fibromyalgia. There is now substantial evidence for augmentation of central pain processing in fibromyalgia. Because the clinical presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, treatment recommendations must be individualized for each patient. The rapid growth of trials in fibromyalgia in recent years has resulted in new evidence-based approaches to pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^f2334751]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Ascertaining the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the inflammatory origin of the complaints are important in the management of difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA.
This systematic literature review, conducted to inform the EULAR recommendations for the management of D2T RA, provides an extensive overview of the current literature regarding diagnostic issues in D2T RA.
The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) study population could not be considered as having D2T RA; (2) typically no appropriate diagnostic association measures were reported; (3) heterogeneous and suboptimal reference standards were used and (4) most studies (thus) had a moderate to high risk of bias.
No diagnostic tests with sufficient validity and accuracy were found to confirm nor exclude the diagnosis of RA nor its mimicking diseases in D2T RA patients.
Despite the lack of high-quality direct evidence, ultrasonography may have an additional value to traditional clinical assessment to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients, including those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia.

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^da57b47c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach should be individualized for each patient, depending on the severity of the patient's pain, the presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and the degree of functional impairment. The management of fibromyalgia includes the identification and treatment of all pain sources that may be present in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g., comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g., comorbid irritable bowel syndrome). It is also important to address other symptoms or disorders that commonly occur in patients with fibromyalgia, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, the treatment should strive to improve the patient's function and global health status. In most cases, the management of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized, controlled trials for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^127d2f83]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is estimated to affect one in five adults worldwide. It is associated with considerable disability and a significant impact on daily activities and quality of life. Fibromyalgia, a primary chronic pain disorder, is diagnosed on the basis of a history of widespread pain and severity of somatic symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, cognitive symptoms, headaches, depression and pain or cramps in the lower abdomen. The prevalence of fibromyalgia has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5.0%, with females being nine times more likely to develop the syndrome than males.

Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, and has been estimated to be associated with $7.2 billion in annual direct costs in Canada. Fibromyalgia also has a substantial economic impact, accounting for $C2298–$C3804 per patient in annual direct costs and weeks worth of annual employment and household productivity losses. The annual healthcare costs of patients with fibromyalgia have been estimated to be $C493 higher than age, sex and geographically matched controls.

The most recent 2012 Canadian Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Fibromyalgia Syndrome recommend that the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia be concentrated in the primary care setting. Although a majority of primary care providers (PCPs) (63%) manage patients with fibromyalgia after diagnosis, 37% of PCPs refer patients with fibromyalgia to a specialist, typically a rheumatologist, for diagnosis.

Rheumatologists are central to the treatment and management of inflammatory arthritis and other autoimmune conditions. However, the number of patients with inflammatory arthritis has doubled between 1996 and 2010, and is expected to double again over the next 30 years, with no proportional increase in the number of practising rheumatologists. In addition, delayed access to rheumatologists has been extensively recognised as a barrier to providing adequate care for rheumatological diseases, particularly with inflammatory arthritis in which early intervention improves clinical outcomes. With the rising population-based disease burden, identified shortage of rheumatologists in Canada and wait times exceeding target benchmarks, there is an urgent need for a strategic approach to the planning and delivery of rheumatology care.

### Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia [^53eaf564]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^7a5350c1]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms are chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia have muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems concentrating, and significant functional limitations. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer depend on tender point examination; laboratory testing may rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders. Management of fibromyalgia should include patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### A roadmap for the management of fibromyalgia [^ea56218b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The patient is at the center of the treatment roadmap for fibromyalgia, which extends beyond the primary care physician to include multidisciplinary experts and community resources. The physician must create a framework in which a full treatment strategy can be articulated with the input of the patient. Physicians need to help patients with fibromyalgia educate themselves about their illness and its treatment and understand that treatment success depends on patients' engagement with all components of the treatment roadmap.

### Fibromyalgia position paper [^67922361]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome is one of the most common causes of chronic widespread pain, but pain accompanies a wide range of ancillary symptoms. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains elusive, and diagnosis is exquisitely clinical, due to the lack of biomarkers or specific laboratory alterations in fibromyalgia patients. This position paper has the purpose to summarise the current scientific knowledge and expert opinions about the main controversies regarding fibromyalgia syndrome, namely: (i) fibromyalgia definition and why it is still not recognised in many countries as a distinct clinical entity; (ii) fibromyalgia severity and how to evaluate treatment outcome; (iii) how to treat fibromyalgia and which is a correct approach to fibromyalgia patients.

### Fibromyalgia: an update on clinical characteristics, aetiopathogenesis and treatment [^cdb8a7c4]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances and functional symptoms. The etiopathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and classification criteria of fibromyalgia are still debated and, consequently, so are the strategies for treating this condition. Fibromyalgia is the third most frequent musculoskeletal condition, and its prevalence increases with age. However, although diagnosis has improved with the evolution of more accurate diagnostic criteria, a considerable proportion of physicians still fail to recognize the syndrome. Many factors contribute to the development of fibromyalgia in a unique manner: genetic predisposition, personal experiences, emotional-cognitive factors, the mind-body relationship and a biopsychological ability to cope with stress. The multiple components of the pathogenesis and maintenance of the condition necessitate a multi-modal treatment approach. Individually tailored treatment is an important consideration, with the increasing recognition that different fibromyalgia subgroups exist with different clinical characteristics. Consequently, although an evidence-based approach to fibromyalgia management is always desirable, the approach of physicians is inevitably empirical, and must have the aim of creating a strong alliance with the patient and formulating shared, realistic treatment goals.

Subsequent PtC focus on pharmacological management. A limited evidence base was available for the EULAR defined D2T-RA population specifically. Nevertheless, where third/fourth line targeted disease modifying pharmacotherapy is indicated, tocilizumab and emergent data on Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) have been shown to be more effective than placebo. This contrasts with other bDMARDs (TNFi, abatacept and rituximab) that lack such evidence. A specific PtC also advises on the benefits of selecting higher dose drug (where such dose choice is an option and not precluded by comorbidity and safety concerns). This applies currently only to intravenous tocilizumab and baricitinib (with higher dose tofacitinib not an approved dose).

The other key factor that influences treatment decision in RA generally and this group in particular, is co-morbidity and specific safety concerns around certain therapeutics. While the PtC emphasise the limited evidence base, they highlight clinical scenarios where we have existing guidelines to inform drug selection — such as hepatitis B and C, and pregnancy. In line with the EULAR RA management guidelines, caution of tsDMARD JAKi use and risk of VTE was emphasised. The draft 2022 update of the EULAR Recommendations on the management of Rheumatoid Arthritis advise evaluation of pertinent risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease when conisdering JAKi in individual treatment decision.

Finally, non-pharmacological management strategies are included, particularly for patients where an absence of inflammation, residual pain and secondary fibromyalgia are key drivers. Education, self-management and psychological interventions are advised to enable (1) better shared decision making between the patient and rheumatologist on the appropriate target of treatment, thus minimising risk of 'mismatch' in expectations (2) improved patient symptom profile and (3) effective coping strategies.

The PtC, therefore, advise a systematic approach to diagnose and assess D2T-RA more accurately before cycling and intensifying DMARD.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: practical strategies for improving diagnosis and patient outcomes [^a093e5e8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia must be applied in clinical practice to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Current evidence indicates that fibromyalgia is a hyperalgesic state, resulting from a generalized problem with augmented pain processing that likely results from the way the spinal cord and the brain process pain and other sensory information. The descending pain pathway involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as opposed to the descending opioid pain pathway, appears to be selectively attenuated. Newer treatment options targeted at the pain mechanisms include the alpha(2)-delta pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons, and the serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise, and strength and flexibility training are important components of care. An individualized treatment plan should be developed with consideration of each patient's unique combination of fibromyalgia symptoms, functional level, and the presence of the comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions that are common in patients with fibromyalgia. This educational activity provides clinicians with the tools necessary to differentiate fibromyalgia syndrome from other chronic pain conditions through a review of recent clinical data and an application of an advanced understanding of pain pathways. Strategies to manage patients with comorbid conditions are explored, with an emphasis on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

### Multidisciplinary care and stepwise treatment for fibromyalgia [^fa2d7977]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, sleep abnormalities, and common comorbidity with psychiatric and medical disorders. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms. The development of a comprehensive, multidisciplinary disease management strategy is a difficult but essential challenge facing clinicians treating patients with fibromyalgia.

### Diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis [^c95f18d6]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarise the evidence on diagnostic issues in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) informing the EULAR recommendations for the management of D2T RA.

Methods

A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed regarding the optimal confirmation of a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and of mimicking diseases and the assessment of inflammatory disease activity. PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to December 2019. Relevant papers were selected and appraised.

Results

Eighty-two papers were selected for detailed assessment. The identified evidence had several limitations: (1) no studies were found including D2T RA patients specifically, and only the minority of studies included RA patients in whom there was explicit doubt about the diagnosis of RA or presence of inflammatory activity; (2) mostly only correlations were reported, not directly useful to evaluate the accuracy of detecting inflammatory activity in clinical practice; (3) heterogeneous, and often suboptimal, reference standards were used and (4) (thus) only very few studies had a low risk of bias.

To ascertain a diagnosis of RA or relevant mimicking disease, no diagnostic test with sufficient validity and accuracy was identified. To ascertain inflammatory activity in patients with RA in general and in those with obesity and fibromyalgia, ultrasonography (US) was studied most extensively and was found to be the most promising diagnostic test.

Conclusions

This SLR highlights the scarcity of high-quality studies regarding diagnostic issues in D2T RA. No diagnostic tests with sufficient validity and accuracy were found to confirm nor exclude the diagnosis of RA nor its mimicking diseases in D2T RA patients. Despite the lack of high-quality direct evidence, US may have an additional value to assess the presence of inflammatory activity in D2T RA patients, including those with concomitant obesity or fibromyalgia.

### Fibromyalgia: diagnosis and management [^f7055a7e]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic, centralized pain syndrome characterized by disordered processing of painful stimuli. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more frequently in women and occurs globally, affecting 2% of people in the United States. Patients with fibromyalgia have diffuse chronic pain, poor sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and mood disturbances. Comorbid conditions, such as functional somatic syndromes, psychiatric diagnoses, and rheumatologic conditions may be present. The Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool is a helpful screening method for patients with diffuse chronic pain. The American College of Rheumatology criteria or the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations Opportunities and Networks-American Pain Society Pain Taxonomy diagnostic criteria can diagnose fibromyalgia. Establishing the diagnosis and providing education can reassure patients and decrease unnecessary testing. A multidisciplinary approach that incorporates nonpharmacologic therapies and medications to address problematic symptoms is most effective. Patient education, exercise, and cognitive behavior therapy can improve pain and function. Duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, and amitriptyline are potentially effective medications for fibromyalgia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids have not demonstrated benefits for fibromyalgia and have significant limitations.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

### Fibromyalgia treatment update [^191e931c]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistently effective treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature from April 2005 through September 2006 involving treatment options.

Recent Findings

Prior evidence suggests that medication and self-management approaches to care can improve symptoms, function and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors — duloxetine and milnacipran — and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential component of any treatment plan for the patient with fibromyalgia. Three studies added to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added to the knowledge needed for clinicians to have substantive conversations with patients.

Summary

Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal approach to treatment involving individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include the improvement of symptoms, primarily pain and sleep, and the promotion of positive health behaviors with the aim of improving physical function and emotional well-being.

For the current guideline, the panel used a systematic review of noninvasive nonpharmacological treatments for chronic noncancer pain, then, after reviewing public comments and identified systematic reviews, it decided to exclude headaches and also excluded fibromyalgia as outside the scope of the guideline. Due to gaps in comparisons, approaches, and outcomes in the first review, two more reviews were identified and used, and the panel followed best practices of using reviews current within the past 5 years.

Although a primary care provider will likely take the lead in caring for patients with fibromyalgia, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may play a role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of fibromyalgia. Psychiatrists' familiarity with many of the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments that are currently being used for fibromyalgia make them valuable partners in the multidisciplinary team of clinicians addressing fibromyalgia and its comorbidities. In this activity, experts on fibromyalgia discuss the nature of the syndrome and its diagnosis and evaluation.

### 'Difficult to treat' rheumatoid arthritis: current position and considerations for next steps [^6b291118]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of D2T RA

The EULAR definition of D2T-RA provided an effective framework to develop the EULAR points to consider (PtC) in the management of D2T-RA. Indeed, while the definition lends itself towards including a heterogeneous patient group, the PtC advise DMARD strategies based on clear demonstration of persistent active inflammatory pathology, an overarching principle being 'The presence or absence of inflammation should be established to guide pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions'. This clarity is crucial in the management of D2T RA to mitigate unnecessary cycling of further DMARD therapies. One of the specific PtC highlights that musculoskeletal ultrasound may be an effective tool where evaluation of inflammation proves challenging. This may serve to reassure the rheumatologist and the patient if a decision is made not to change DMARD despite ongoing symptoms and measured disease activity. In this regard, acceptance of a low disease activity state as stated in the treat to target recommendations may be more appropriate.

This overarching principle also supports consideration of other factors that may complicate accurate assessment of disease activity state. Obesity and fibromyalgia are highlighted as two prevalent conditions in people with RA that should be accommodated when evaluating disease activity and progression to D2T-RA. Secondary fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis may overestimate patient global health scores and tender joint count assessments. Obesity may make accurate detection of swollen joint count challenging and/or overestimate acute phase reactants and contribute to an excess inflammatory drive and phenotype. A reappraisal of the diagnosis and the need to identify coexistent disease and/or mimics that may interfere with the assessment of disease activity were also recommended. Modern RA paradigms encourage us to seek out new and early diagnoses of RA, risking misdiagnosis at the earliest stages of diseases when often still evolving. The hazards of mimics and coexistent pathology is relevant across a patient's disease course including in the older demographic when conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica and/or osteoarthritis may complicate the clinical assessment.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^23ef486a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Perform a biopsychosocial assessment and address expectations

Where there is an identifiable cause of chronic pain (eg, diabetes, fibromyalgia), management should proceed as per the current available treatment guidelines with appropriate monitoring and follow-up. However, after appropriate investigations, in patients in whom the cause of chronic pain cannot be determined, repeated radiological and other special investigations are rarely helpful and should be avoided.

Management is guided by careful assessment for the presence of risk factors for chronic pain, psychosocial history, assessment of pain severity and the degree of functional impairment. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is recommended as a simple tool to measure pain intensity and physical and psychosocial components of pain.

Psychosocial and behavioral factors (Box 2) may complicate diagnosis, management and the course of chronic pain, and it is necessary to conduct a careful assessment for these using simple questions (Box 4) and/or self-rating scales (eg, Beck's Depression Inventory). Detailed assessment tools are time-consuming and usually unnecessary. It is important to point out that many of these psychosocial factors are normal psychological processes and/or responses to adversity. However, in some patients they can influence the subjective experience of pain and directly modulate pain pathways leading to maladaptive coping and persistent pain that is apparently non-responsive to treatment. Management in the primary care setting is often sufficient, but if necessary patients should be referred to an appropriate mental health professional.

Box 4
Helpful brief screening questions to identify risk factors for chronic pain, disability and delayed return to work

It is important to explain to patients and their family/caregivers that chronic pain is multifactorial and does not necessarily indicate harm, and also to set realistic expectations in terms of goals of treatment. In chronic pain, complete pain relief is rarely achieved and aims of therapy are to reduce pain, improve function and return to work and physical activity. A clinically meaningful improvement is at least a 30% reduction in pain (or ≥ 2 points on a 0–10 numerical rating scale) and/or 30% improvement in function. Other important outcomes include improvement in sleep and mood, reduced analgesic consumption and reduced health care consultations.

Work absenteeism is associated with low self-esteem, depression, loss of skills, delayed recovery, and in some patients, personal re-identification as a "disabled person". Because the likelihood of returning to work diminishes with increasing duration of absence, it is important to encourage patients who are still working to continue to do so. Those who are off work should be encouraged to return to work as soon as possible.

Discussion

Facets of FMS

This category includes recommendations about aspects of fibromyalgia features and associated symptoms that should be considered in all future Aab research.

There was high stakeholder agreement on the necessity to clearly outline diagnostic and phenotyping criteria in any research going forward as, for example, patient populations markedly differ between diagnostic categories such as ACR 2010, ACR 2016.
Stakeholders considered that research should attempt to classify FMS subtypes. FMS appears clinically heterogeneous. Antibody prevalence and specificity, along with familiar prevalence, genetic variants, clinical presentations, and treatment responses may support the definition of FMS sub-phenotypes, with implications for clinical management.
Antibody research should be broadened:
Research should investigate Aab contribution to polysensory hyper-responsiveness and other FMS features including fatigue and cognitive problems, including in the recent rodent 'transfer' models where IgG taken from FMS patients is injected to rodents causing abnormalities resembling FMS in these animals.
The contribution of Aab to chronic pain conditions associated with " fibromyalgianess", below the ACR 2016 score threshold for the diagnosis of FMS, and in chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) should be investigated. Fibromyalgianess is an emerging concept; it describes a symptom complex variably comprised of fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive symptoms, poly-sensory hyper-responsiveness, and psychological co-morbidities. Risk factors for this phenotype include female sex, regional or widespread pains and exposure to stressors, but it seems independent of both known peripheral triggers or individual psychopathology. COPCs include conditions such as chronic pelvic pain, painful bladder syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, burning mouth syndrome, post-traumatic chronic pain, chronic fatigue, and others. It is more rule than exception that people with FMS have suffered or are suffering from COPCs, and how antibodies contribute to these pain phenotypes (both with and without presence of FMS) would be important to investigate.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^1c30d85c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

### Quality of rheumatology care for patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndromes [^26b6c795]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Chronic pain and fibromyalgia are associated with significant patient disability. This study found that no patients referred to rheumatology care for fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome had evidence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease. Rheumatology consultations for patients referred for fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome incurred health system costs and resource utilisation. Wait times were lengthy, an average of approximately 6 months, and patient experiences were not universally positive.

Diagnostic accuracy

Fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes carry a wide differential diagnosis. It is not an inflammatory disorder but a chronic pain syndrome. It may present like a rheumatological disease, but the pattern of pain is often distinct. For example, patients with fibromyalgia may present with musculoskeletal pain and possibly morning stiffness, but the pain is often described as diffuse and not typically isolated from joints or muscles. In addition, fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion, and referral to rheumatology is often done in order to rule out an inflammatory arthritis or connective disease. A previous study found that almost 60% of patients referred for fibromyalgia were found to be misdiagnosed, and instead had a primary rheumatological condition to account for their symptoms, with inflammatory arthritis making up 40% of these misdiagnoses. This delay has been shown to alter disease progression, where timely referral to a rheumatologist for the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis significantly increases early initiation of treatment, improves patient outcomes, reduces disability, reduces the need for costly surgical interventions and decreases global disease burden. As such, diagnostic accuracy is of increased importance.

This present study found that no patients referred for fibromyalgia or chronic pain had evidence of an inflammatory arthritis or connective tissue disease after their rheumatologist consultation at that time. This is different from previous studies noted above. The findings in our study can be associated with the use of a well-developed centralised triage algorithm for potential inflammatory arthritis, connective tissue disease and chronic diffuse pain referrals. In this powered study, the sensitivity and specificity of a P3 diagnosis at triage were calculated to be 82% and 94%, respectively; sensitivity and specificity of a P1 diagnosis at triage were calculated to be 92% and 81%, respectively. Patients in this study were discharged back to their referring provider as current guidelines recommend that the diagnosis and management be followed in the primary care setting and that specialist consultation be reserved for patients with atypical symptoms that suggest an alternate diagnosis. This study offers new evidence in the diagnostic accuracy by the referring provider. Although this was a quality study and not powered, it also reaffirms the accuracy of the centralised triage model in identifying P3 versus P1 patients.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^5c989000]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

Scope of this Guideline — evidence base and applicability — states that this CPG is based on published clinical evidence and related information available through April 7, 2020, and is not intended to serve as a standard of care (SOC). In developing this CPG, the Work Group reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), meta-analyses, and systematic reviews (SRs). Given the limited number of studies on CMI alone, the Work Group considered evidence-based treatments for CMI and CMI-like conditions (fibromyalgia (FMS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS]); effective treatments for CMI-like conditions may help some patients with CMI; however, the extent to which treatments for CMI-like conditions are generalizable to CMI remains unclear. The guideline may have some relevance to conditions with multiple chronic symptoms and functional limitations, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the recommendations may apply to such patients and are likely to be a helpful adjunct to current guidelines for the management of mTBI, PTSD, and major depressive disorder (MDD), especially when patients report multiple chronic symptoms not readily explained by these or other health conditions.

### Impact of water therapy on pain management in patients with fibromyalgia: current perspectives [^9997f58d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Exercise-related interventions have been recommended as one of the main components in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Water therapy, which combines water's physical properties and exercise benefits, has proven effective in improving the clinical symptoms of FMS, especially pain, considered the hallmark of this syndrome. However, to our knowledge, the mechanisms underlying water therapy effects on pain are still scarcely explored in the literature. Therefore, this narrative review aimed to present the current perspectives on water therapy and the physiological basis for the mechanisms supporting its use for pain management in patients with FMS. Furthermore, the effects of water therapy on the musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, and neuroendocrine systems and inflammation are also addressed. Taking into account the aspects reviewed herein, water therapy is recommended as a nonpharmacologic therapeutic approach in the management of FMS patients, improving pain, fatigue, and quality of life. Future studies should focus on clarifying whether mechanisms and long-lasting effects are superior to other types of nonpharmacological interventions, as well as the economic and societal impacts that this intervention may present.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. Individuals with fibromyalgia often have comorbid anxiety, depression, and/or other pain syndromes. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown to be effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms.

Supporting Rationale

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis. Detailed recommendations on diagnosis are provided in other guidelines. Evaluation should include a focused history, including history and characteristics of pain and potential contributing factors (e.g. function, work history and current work demands, psychosocial stressors, and sleep), and physical examination, with imaging or other diagnostic testing only if indicated (e.g. if severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or if serious underlying conditions are suspected). For complex pain syndromes, consultation with a pain specialist can be considered to assist with diagnosis and management.

Diagnosis can help identify disease-specific interventions to reverse, ameliorate, or prevent worsening of pain and improve function (e.g. improving glucose control to prevent progression of diabetic neuropathy; immune-modulating agents for rheumatoid arthritis; physical or occupational therapy to address posture, muscle weakness, or repetitive occupational motions that contribute to musculoskeletal pain; or surgical intervention to relieve severe mechanical or compressive pain). The underlying mechanism for most pain syndromes has traditionally been categorized as neuropathic (e.g. diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia) or nociceptive (e.g. osteoarthritis and muscular back pain). More recently, nociplastic pain has been suggested as a third, distinct category of pain with augmented central nervous system pain and sensory processing and altered pain modulation as experienced in conditions such as fibromyalgia. The diagnosis and pathophysiologic mechanism of pain have implications for symptomatic pain treatment with medication. For example, evidence is limited for improved pain or function, or evidence exists of worse outcomes, with long-term use of opioids for several chronic pain conditions for which opioids are commonly prescribed, such as osteoarthritis, nonspecific low back pain, headache, and fibromyalgia. For moderate to severe chronic back pain or hip or knee osteoarthritis pain, a nonopioid strategy starting with acetaminophen or NSAIDs results in improved pain intensity with fewer side effects compared with a strategy starting with opioids. Tricyclic antidepressants, SNRI antidepressants, selected anticonvulsants, or transdermal lidocaine are recommended for neuropathic pain syndromes (e.g. diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia).

### Office management of fibromyalgia [^7d92a974]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The office management of fibromyalgia (FM) is best determined by two variables: (1) the severity and complexity of each patient's symptoms, and (2) the specialization and interest of the treating physician. Because there are 6 to 10 million Americans with FM, most patient visits will be to the primary care physician. Rheumatologists, physiatrists, and other musculoskeletal specialists must work with primary care physicians to foster the early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of FM. Primary care physicians are faced with enormous challenges in caring for patients with chronic pain disorders like FM. Our managed health care system insists that patient encounters be brief. Specialty referrals are often discouraged. There is little if any reimbursement for patient education. FM treatment is labor-intensive. Therefore, optimal planning and use of precious office time and resources are most important. Rheumatologists should train our primary care colleagues to recognize FM. Many patients still go months or years before this common syndrome is diagnosed. Rheumatologists should also spearhead teaching primary care physicians the basic treatment principles of FM. If the diagnosis is made early, patients with FM in community practice do very well with simple management techniques. As consultants, rheumatologists should confirm the diagnosis of FM and suggest basic FM management. Some primary care providers or other specialists will be fully capable of bypassing this consultation, especially if the patient responds to simple management suggestions. Manpower surveys have not studied the cost-effectiveness of specialty care in FM. Rheumatologists should also assume the responsibility for the management of FM patients who have not responded to basic FM management. Additionally, some rheumatologists may wish to subspecialize in FM, a major career commitment to this perplexing disorder. These situations constitute advanced FM management.

### Fibromyalgia [^f2401572]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common illness characterized by chronic widespread pain, sleep problems (including unrefreshing sleep), physical exhaustion and cognitive difficulties. The definition, pathogenesis and treatment are controversial, and some even contest the existence of this disorder. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) defined classification criteria that required multiple tender points (areas of tenderness occurring in muscles and muscle-tendon junctions) and chronic widespread pain. In 2010, the ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria excluded tender points, allowed less extensive pain and placed reliance on patient-reported somatic symptoms and cognitive difficulties. Fibromyalgia occurs in all populations worldwide, and symptom prevalence ranges between 2% and 4% in the general population. The prevalence of people who are actually diagnosed with fibromyalgia ('administrative prevalence') is much lower. A model of fibromyalgia pathogenesis has been suggested in which biological and psychosocial variables interact to influence the predisposition, triggering and aggravation of a chronic disease, but the details are unclear. Diagnosis requires the history of a typical cluster of symptoms and the exclusion of a somatic disease that sufficiently explains the symptoms by medical examination. Current evidence-based guidelines emphasize the value of multimodal treatments, which encompass both non-pharmacological and selected pharmacological treatments tailored to individual symptoms, including pain, fatigue, sleep problems and mood problems.

### Rethinking the criteria for fibromyalgia in 2019: the ABC indicators [^f94e2727]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing problem with diagnosing fibromyalgia by the ACR criteria

Since their inception in 1990, criteria for the diagnosis of the fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) have been discussed controversially.–Recent literature has highlighted current uncertainty and skepticism of the diagnosis of FM in the general medical community. Aiming to overcome previous shortcomings, experts proposed new diagnostic criteria for FM to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) in 2010, with a revised version subsequently published in 2011. Both the 2010 and 2011 criteria are based on satisfying one of two numerical cut-off combinations of the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Score (SSS). The WPI is an inventory of the occurrence of pain in 19 defined body locations. The SSS contains the four items fatigue, non-restorative sleep, cognitive symptoms and an item comprising a multiplicity of other concomitant symptoms.

Even though the 2010/2011 criteria are easy-to-administer, uncertainty remained regarding its clinical validity. Concerns raised were a) the lack of any pathophysiological disease concept underlying the criteria; b) exclusive reliance on self-reported symptoms; c) inconclusive recommendations for their use in overlapping rheumatological diseases, and d) insufficient diagnostic specificity and differentiation from localized functional pain syndromes.

In a previous study, the limitations of the ACR criteria 2010/2011 were examined in relation to other functional pain syndromes. By realizing the latter diagnostic deficit of the ACR criteria 2010/2011, Wolfe and colleagues aimed to increase specificity by (re-)defining FM as a generalized pain syndrome in 2016. Additively to the SSS and WPI scores, they reintroduced a widespread pain criterion (whole-body pain with pain in at least 4 of 5 defined body regions), while retaining the arguably redundant WPI-limit, which overlaps with the reintroduced widespread pain criterion. To summarize, in 2016 FM still appears as a "non-clinical diagnosis", emerged out of 3 checklists (with many redundancies) and without any visible underlying pathophysiological concept. Therefore, we fear that the acceptance and communicability of FM criteria remain limited. We believe that despite the ACR's decision in 2015 "to cease funding and endorsing research on further diagnostic criteria", the FM diagnosis still needs optimization.

### Treatments for enhancing sleep quality in fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7671c059]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fibromyalgia is a debilitating chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain accompanied by sleep difficulties, cognitive impairment, mood disturbance and fatigue. Sleep disturbance is central to fibromyalgia, and the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership emphasizes the importance of improving management of sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia. However, current clinical guidance for the management of sleep disturbance in fibromyalgia lacks clear consensus. The most recent EULAR guidance recommends meditative movement, amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine and pregabalin to improve sleep in the context of fibromyalgia. However, apart from amitriptyline, none of these therapies were recommended by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2021 guidelines for the management of chronic pain (NG193), and further research on cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) was encouraged.

CBT-based approaches have a substantial evidence base to support their effectiveness in improving quality of life, physical and mental health for people living with a range of physical and psychological health problems, but its effectiveness at improving sleep in fibromyalgia is less certain.

The aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the current evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological and CBT therapies in improving sleep quality in people with fibromyalgia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This systematic review and NMA was conducted in line with the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021296922).

Search strategy

Comprehensive search strategies were developed by an information scientist with input from our expert advisers to identify RCTs in patients with fibromyalgia with sleep as an outcome. The searches were not restricted by publication date or language, and we used the Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy filter for identifying RCTs. The following databases were searched in November 2021: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PyscINFO, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, EBSCO CINAHL, Clarivate Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Reference lists of systematic reviews and included studies were checked to identify additional potentially relevant reports. Details of the search strategies are reported in Supplementary Material S2.

Study selection

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs with a parallel‐group, cross‐over, or cluster design comparing pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to treat sleep problems in adults and children with fibromyalgia versus usual care, placebo, no treatment (including waiting list), or another active intervention. Studies that compared two or more regimens of the same treatment (eg, varying doses of the same drug) were excluded if a placebo or another intervention group was not considered. Two reviewers (MI and CR) independently screened a sample of 100 titles and abstracts at the beginning of the study selection process and compared results to ensure consistency. The remaining citations were divided into two sets and allocated to the same two reviewers. All potentially relevant articles were retrieved in full and assessed by one reviewer for inclusion with a second reviewer checking all articles that were labeled unclear and 10% of the excluded articles. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between reviewers.

Diagnosis of alternative or coexisting mimicking diseases in patients with RA

Four papers were found on coexisting mimicking diseases in RA, papers on alternative mimicking diagnoses in patients with RA were not found. Three of four papers reported on fibromyalgia as a coexisting mimicking disease (table 2, online supplemental table 2). In all three papers, the cut-off for the optimal sensitivity and specificity was selected by using an ROC analysis of the data of the same patient cohorts, resulting in a high RoB. The first study assessed the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool as a diagnostic test for fibromyalgia in consecutive patients suspected of RA or a mimicking disease. Using the clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia according to a rheumatologist as reference standard, a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 88% were found. In the second study, a score, derived using the individual components of the DAS28 and rearranging the formula (table 1), was used to assess a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Using the diagnosis of fibromyalgia according to the 2010 criteria, a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 80% were found. The third study used a case–control design, in which microRNA let-7a, −21–5 p, −143 and −103a-3p were assessed to diagnose concomitant fibromyalgia in established patients with RA. MicroRNA-143 was found to be downregulated in patients with concomitant fibromyalgia. A sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 70% were found.

Table 2
Papers on the diagnosis of mimicking disease in patients with RA

The only study with a low RoB, was a cross-sectional study reporting on bacterial infections as a mimicking disease in patients with RA who presented with a flare (table 2, online supplemental table 2). The reference standard for the presence of bacterial infections was the agreed diagnosis by physicians based on symptoms, bacterial culture tests, imaging and response to antibiotic therapy. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 15 mm/hour was found to have the highest sensitivity with 98%. Procalcitonin ≥ 0.5 ng/mL was found to have the highest specificity with 98%.

### Using multidisciplinary care to treat fibromyalgia [^02279973]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common condition associated with abnormal central pain processing, chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. Individuals with fibromyalgia often have comorbid anxiety, depression, and/or other pain syndromes. Multiple pharmacologic agents have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating some fibromyalgic symptoms, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle in the successful management of fibromyalgia. Thorough medical and psychiatric evaluations are necessary after confirming a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and a multidisciplinary treatment strategy including patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as pharmacotherapy has been shown to be effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms.

### The American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity [^28a2be57]. Arthritis Care & Research (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia" for fibromyalgia.

The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia serve as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. The criteria are designed to provide a standardized approach to diagnosis, facilitating early intervention and management.

The primary components of the diagnostic criteria include the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score. The WPI assesses the number of areas in which the patient has experienced pain over the past week, while the SSS score evaluates the severity of three common symptoms: fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria are met if the patient has a WPI of 7 or more and an SSS score of 5 or more, and these symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, with no other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain. Alternatively, the criteria are also met if the patient has a WPI between 3 and 6 and an SSS score of 9 or more, with the same conditions regarding symptom duration and exclusion of other disorders.

These criteria provide a comprehensive and objective measure for diagnosing fibromyalgia, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care and treatment.

The diagnostic tool for fibromyalgia helps determine if a person meets the criteria for a diagnosis by evaluating specific conditions. Here's how it works:

- The tool considers the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity (SS) scale scores in two scenarios:

- WPI of 7 or more and an SS score of 5 or more.
- WPI between 3 and 6 and an SS score of 9 or more.

- It also considers whether the symptoms have persisted at a similar level for at least three months.

- Additionally, it verifies that no other disorder explains the pain.

To determine if the diagnostic criteria are met, the tool checks the following conditions:

- The first condition is met if WPI is 7 or more, SS score is 5 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

- The second condition is met if WPI is between 3 and 6, SS score is 9 or more, symptoms have persisted for three months, and no other disorder explains the pain.

If either of these conditions is satisfied, the tool concludes that the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are met. Otherwise, it concludes that they are not met. This approach systematically uses established measurements to assess whether a fibromyalgia diagnosis is justified based on pain index, severity, duration, and exclusion of other disorders.

### Characterizing classes of fibromyalgia within the continuum of central sensitization syndrome [^b9f0238b]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

FM may be represented as a disease continuum, with identifiable classes and subclasses based on pain and symptom severity, specific comorbidities, and use of clinical procedures. Patients demonstrated increases in symptom severity and region of pain by class, suggesting that the FM continuum tracks with disease progression over time. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate and better define the classes by severity with the goal of informing potential approaches to patient evaluation and management. Such an understanding and characterization of how FM patients progress through their disease may enhance diagnosis and help optimize treatment, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and reductions in the health care system burden.

### Effects of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^95829bd0]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

There are several published systematic reviews assessing different forms of exercise training and other nonpharmacologic interventions for the management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Although not primarily focused on sleep problems, they all identify similar limitations to those we observed here, including heterogeneity across studies in terms of study protocols, insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of one intervention compared with another, lack of appropriate comparator treatments, insufficient statistical power in most studies and low‐to‐moderate quality of the evidence. One systematic review that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic treatments for fibromyalgia revealed that all types of exercise, except for flexibility exercises, helped reduce pain intensity, whereas aerobic and strengthening exercises helped improve sleep quality. However, the authors identified only a limited number of studies, usually of small sample sizes, for each form of exercise (10 for aerobic exercise, 9 for strengthening, and 2 for flexibility) and found considerable heterogeneity in outcome measures, intervention programs, and control interventions, in line with our findings.

Overall, there is a suggestion that some forms of exercise training, psychological and behavioral therapy, and some pharmacologic treatments may play a role in improving fibromyalgia‐related sleep problems and/or patients' QoL. However, the limitations of the current evidence do not allow reliable conclusions about optimal interventions for treating sleep problems in people with fibromyalgia. There is a clear need to improve the quality of existing evidence. It is worth noting that most participants were middle‐aged women from high‐income countries. Information on ethnicity and level of education was often not reported. Future studies should be properly designed and include an adequate number of diverse patients to reduce bias and to ensure results are generalizable. Interventions should be compared with established therapies or adequate sham treatments to demonstrate their comparative efficacy and safety. Descriptions of placebo and sham treatments should be guided by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication‐Placebo checklist. There should also be consensus on the best way to capture fibromyalgia symptoms. Currently, having different tools to measure symptoms not only impacts the ability to synthesize research evidence but also confuses health professionals and patients when trying to document and tackle fibromyalgia‐related symptoms. The development of a core outcome set for measuring sleep outcomes in both adults and children with fibromyalgia would be beneficial for informing new standardized PROMs in this field. It would also be crucial to involve people with fibromyalgia in the conception and content validation of any tool measuring sleep, ensuring that PROMs cover what matters most to patients.

### Evaluating the patient with fibromyalgia [^472c08e2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Once the physician has identified fibromyalgia as a potential diagnosis, further evaluation is warranted, both to understand the full dimensions of fibromyalgia and to evaluate other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. For example, mood disorders, sleep disorders, and daytime fatigue are often present in patients with fibromyalgia and often are closely related to pain. In addition, a number of physical conditions can mimic fibromyalgia and must be considered in the patient's evaluation. These include endocrine conditions, neurologic disorders, musculoskeletal diseases, and medication-related side effects. Taking a complete medical history and performing a thorough physical examination, including a complete laboratory assessment, can be very helpful in confirming the diagnosis or establishing an alternate diagnosis.

### Complementary and alternative medicine to treat fibromyalgia symptoms. A systematic review [^45e27feb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of generalized chronic pain, skin hypersensitivity, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep problems, and cognitive and psychological impairments (ie, higher prevalence of anxiety and depression). The diagnosis of FM is based predominately on the presence of chronic pain, as established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), which includes chronic widespread pain in at least 4 of 5 regions and for a minimum of three months. Likewise, they should present a Widespread Pain Index (WPI) ≥ 7 and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) score ≥ 5 OR a WPI of 4–6 and SSS score ≥ 9. Since diagnosis is based on clinical tests and not accompanied by laboratory or radiological tests, FM is still underdiagnosed.

Other multiple factors contribute to this underdiagnosis, such as stigmatization due to gender issues (eg, FM considered a 'disease of females'), and the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and their updates and suggestions (ie, 1990, 2010, 2011 and 2016). The most common treatment offered to these patients is pharmacological treatment (ie, opioid analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications, antidepressants). However, many of these drugs have important adverse effects and do not completely alleviate the symptoms of patients. Other commonly used therapies for FM are physical exercise (aerobic and resistance training) and lifestyle, which proved to be effective in the literature as well.

### Impact of enhanced pain knowledge on core outcomes in fibromyalgia patients with high self-reported pain education needs: a target trial emulation using the DANFIB registry [^28467b51]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, which aimed to emulate a target trial and was conducted in a large sample of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of fibromyalgia and a high self-reported need for pain education, found that patients succeeding in achieving pain educational learning objectives had better clinical disease outcomes. This finding supports the utility of implementing pain education as an integral part of educational programmes tailored for patients with fibromyalgia. Additionally, the study highlighted substantial interindividual variability in educational outcomes, suggesting the need for evaluating learning outcomes and providing remedial education for those with continued high learning needs. Targeted interventions seem necessary to enhance knowledge acquisition and address learning barriers within this heterogeneous patient population.

Existing guidelines for the management of fibromyalgia all agree on recommending a prompt diagnosis and the provision of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions tailored to individual patient needs, delivered through a stepped care model approach. Despite these recommendations, studies continue to report prolonged and uncoordinated diagnostic pathways for patients with fibromyalgia, and many patients describe negative healthcare experiences and a lack of sufficient information and understanding regarding their pain condition. Research has demonstrated that fibromyalgia patients understanding of their own condition is significantly associated with both patients' healthcare satisfaction and pain relief, as are provision of comprehensible information on the pain cause, efficient guidance on how to manage the pain, agreement in explanations and having their needs met. Explaining pain is assumed to change patients' understanding of persistent pain and help them to reverse unhelpful and often fearful ways of thinking about pain, which may discourage the acquisition of appropriate self-management skills. Our study results bolster the clinical benefits of enhancing patients' comprehension of the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin their pain. We found that the study participants in both groups showed improvements in fibromyalgia impact over 9 months, but participants experiencing a good pain educational outcome following a 2-day patient education programme had additional benefits regarding the impact of fibromyalgia on everyday life after 9 months, compared with participants whose learning outcomes were less successful. Significant group differences, favouring a more positive clinical outcome in participants experiencing a good pain educational outcome, were also reflected in secondary outcomes. These included statistically significant differences between groups in self-reported functional ability, overall symptom burden and scores of several individual core symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as level of pain, depression, anxiety and polysensory hypersensitivity.

### Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^ba0c8212]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to modification.

### Advances in the assessment of fibromyalgia [^981bded3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) has historically been considered a chronic pain condition. Recent clinical studies, however, reveal that while pain may be the cardinal symptom of FM, there are many other symptoms and consequences of having FM that have an impact on the lives of individuals with this condition. As such, an area of intense clinical research has focused upon improving approaches to assessment for FM. This article provides an overview of how the art of assessing FM has evolved over time, current methods of assessment, the value of patients' perspectives in assessment, and emerging advancements representing the future of for FM.

### Pain management in fibromyalgia [^2a25be57]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pain is the primary presenting symptom in the vast majority of inflammatory and noninflammatory rheumatic diseases. Patients tell us that improved pain relief is a principal concern. Many pain complaints respond incompletely to the treatment of the primary rheumatic disorder and pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia do not respond to traditional analgesic medications. Therefore, proper management requires consideration of additional medications for symptomatic relief. This review addresses newer strategies for the treatment of pain in patients with fibromyalgia that may be also useful in patients with other rheumatic diseases.

Recent Findings

New medications have been developed with a better understanding of chronic pain mechanisms that principally address pain neurobiology at the levels of the spinal cord and the brain. Clinical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin) and the norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and milnacipran) in fibromyalgia.

Summary

Patients with chronic pain, best classified as fibromyalgia, either primary or in association with other rheumatic disorders, may experience benefit from new therapies targeting central pain mechanisms.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^4ed74a62]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

To guide patient-specific selection of therapy, clinicians should evaluate patients and establish or confirm the diagnosis.
Clinicians should recommend appropriate noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches to help manage chronic pain, such as exercise (e.g. aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises) or exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis; weight loss for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g. yoga, tai chi, or qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache.
Low-cost options to integrate exercise include walking in public spaces or use of public recreation facilities for group exercise. Physical therapy can be helpful, particularly for patients who have limited access to safe public spaces or public recreation facilities for exercise or whose pain has not improved with low-intensity physical exercise.
Health insurers and health systems can improve pain management and reduce medication use and associated risks by increasing reimbursement for and access to noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence for effectiveness.
Clinicians should review FDA-approved labeling, including boxed warnings, and weigh benefits and risks before initiating treatment with any pharmacologic therapy.
When patients affected by osteoarthritis have an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise for arthritis pain, topical NSAIDs can be used in patients with pain in a single or few joints near the surface of the skin (e.g. knee). For patients with osteoarthritis pain in multiple joints or incompletely controlled with topical NSAIDs, duloxetine or systemic NSAIDs can be considered.
NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration needed and should be used with caution, particularly in older adults and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, chronic renal failure, or previous gastrointestinal bleeding.
When patients with chronic low back pain have had an insufficient response to nonpharmacologic approaches such as exercise, clinicians can consider NSAIDs or duloxetine for patients without contraindications.
Tricyclic, tetracyclic, and SNRI antidepressants; selected anticonvulsants (e.g. pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxcarbazepine); and capsaicin and lidocaine patches can be considered for neuropathic pain. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Duloxetine and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and pregabalin and gabapentin are FDA-approved for treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.
In patients with fibromyalgia, tricyclic (e.g. amitriptyline) and SNRI antidepressants (e.g. duloxetine, milnacipran), NSAIDs (e.g. topical diclofenac), and specific anticonvulsants (i.e. pregabalin and gabapentin) are used to improve pain, function, and quality of life. Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin are FDA-approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia. In older adults, decisions to use tricyclic antidepressants should be made judiciously on a case-by-case basis because of risks for confusion and falls.
Patients with co-occurring pain and depression might be especially likely to benefit from antidepressant medication (see Recommendation 8).
Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.
Opioid therapy should not be initiated without consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy to be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful.
Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine jointly with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish specific, measurable treatment goals.
For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥ 30 days, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy. Clinicians should avoid rapid tapering or abrupt discontinuation of opioids (see Recommendation 5).
Patient education and discussion before starting opioid therapy are critical so that patient preferences and values can be understood and used to inform clinical decisions.
Clinicians should review available low-cost options for pain management for all patients and particularly for patients who have low incomes, do not have health insurance, or have inadequate insurance.
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

### Is fibromyalgia a discrete entity? [^2ed000d6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined as chronic widespread pain (CWP) with allodynia or hyperalgesia to pressure pain, and is classified as one of the largest group of soft tissue pain syndromes. Its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, although it is currently believed to be the result of a central nervous system (CNS) malfunction that increases pain transmission and perception. There are no instrumental tests to confirm the diagnosis, but many of the differential diagnoses can be excluded by means of an extensive clinical examination and patient history. Although fibromyalgia is a recognisable clinical entity, it would seem appropriate to consider the entire range of tenderness and distress in clinic patients in order to tailor treatment on an individual basis.
