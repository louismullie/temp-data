## Question

Vitamin D deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vitamin D deficiency — specifically screening, diagnosis, and treatment — while preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define vitamin D deficiency and which biomarker to use. Then, I should verify screening recommendations for asymptomatic adults and reconcile differing guideline positions. Next, I will identify high-risk populations where testing is justified. After that, I need to confirm the diagnostic approach and thresholds. Then, I will outline treatment strategies, including special populations and monitoring. Finally, I should review safety, monitoring, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and the correct test. Vitamin D status is best assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which reflects both cutaneous synthesis and dietary intake and has a longer half-life than 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, making it the appropriate marker of stores rather than acute activity; I should double-check that 1,25(OH)2D is not used for deficiency screening, and indeed it is reserved for specific metabolic disorders, not routine deficiency assessment [^112zzYJM] [^1123HSa4] [^111vVZHD]. I initially thought to align thresholds strictly with the Endocrine Society's historical 30 ng/mL target, but wait, let me verify the most current stance; the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline no longer endorses a universal 30 ng/mL target and suggests against routine screening, reflecting evolving evidence and lack of outcome-linked thresholds, so I should not overstate a fixed numeric target in generally healthy adults [^11535HZz] [^115QqUNi]. For practical clinical use, many clinicians still operationalize deficiency as 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL and insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL, but I need to emphasize that these cut points are not universally endorsed for all outcomes and should be interpreted in context [^115TEChd] [^115GCzBc].

> Next, I should review screening recommendations for asymptomatic adults. The USPSTF issues an I statement, concluding that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults without signs or symptoms or conditions warranting vitamin D treatment; I should confirm that this applies to both 2014 and 2021 updates, which it does [^111UJRQk] [^113mKtpB]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: no trials demonstrate improved clinical outcomes from screening versus not screening, assay variability complicates classification, and overtreatment risks, though rare, exist; these points are explicitly highlighted in the USPSTF materials and patient-facing summaries [^113SWNpu] [^11594cLw]. The Endocrine Society's 2024 guideline aligns by suggesting against routine 25(OH)D testing in generally healthy adults, reinforcing that screening should be targeted rather than population-wide [^115QqUNi] [^11535HZz].

> I will now examine who should actually be tested, because targeted screening remains appropriate. High-risk groups include older adults, individuals with limited sun exposure or darker skin pigmentation, people with obesity, those with malabsorption or bariatric surgery, patients with chronic liver or kidney disease, and individuals on medications that impair vitamin D metabolism such as anticonvulsants or glucocorticoids; I should confirm that these are consistently cited across endocrine and primary care guidance, which they are [^1144Ymwq] [^111TsKkR]. But wait, what about pregnancy and pediatrics? For pregnancy, professional societies advise considering measurement in those at increased risk, and some nutrition guidance supports screening in pregnancy, whereas the 2024 Endocrine Society suggests against routine screening in pregnancy and instead supports empiric supplementation; I need to acknowledge this tension and tailor to local practice and patient risk [^111eaJDt] [^114YjBqz] [^111U4Jbv] [^11535HZz]. For children, routine screening is not advised in healthy kids, but targeted testing is appropriate in high-risk groups such as dark-skinned exclusively breastfed infants, those with chronic diseases, or suspected rickets; specific syndromes like Turner syndrome also warrant periodic screening from age 9–11 years [^114gUrCM] [^114dKESo] [^112NoRsq].

> Let me consider the diagnostic approach when testing is indicated. I should confirm that a reliable 25(OH)D assay is used, recognizing that immunoassays vary and LC-MS/MS is the reference method; preanalytical and analytical variability can misclassify patients, so clinical context matters and results near thresholds may warrant cautious interpretation or repeat testing if the clinical stakes are high [^113SWNpu] [^1123HSa4]. I need to ensure I do not order 1,25(OH)2D for deficiency screening; it is misleading in this context and should be reserved for specific disorders of vitamin D metabolism or calcium-phosphate handling [^111vVZHD]. Hold on, I should verify that consensus statements also caution against routine screening in obesity and dark complexion, which they do, reinforcing a risk-based testing strategy rather than blanket screening [^112vxbMP] [^117LEQP6].

> Now, treatment for confirmed deficiency. For adults with 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL, a common repletion approach is 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for 8 weeks or approximately 6,000 IU daily, followed by maintenance at 1,500–2,000 IU daily; I should confirm that both D2 and D3 are acceptable, though D3 has somewhat higher potency and bioavailability in many studies, and guidelines allow either form [^116Tw7ci] [^113zRN7e]. Wait, let me verify special populations: in obesity, malabsorption, or with medications that accelerate catabolism, higher doses, often 2–3 times standard, may be needed to achieve and maintain sufficiency; this adjustment is supported by endocrine guidance and hepatology recommendations for cholestatic liver disease where D3 is preferred and higher dosing may be required [^115rP1Fz] [^115EeB4G]. For children, typical repletion is 2,000 IU/day or 50,000 IU weekly for about 6 weeks, followed by age-appropriate maintenance dosing; I should confirm that calcitriol is not used for repletion because it does not rebuild stores, which is correct [^111X74a6] [^111JncrE] [^115HwqyY].

> Maintenance and monitoring deserve careful thought. After repletion, maintenance commonly uses 800–2,000 IU/day depending on age, risk, and baseline level; I should double-check whether routine retesting is necessary, and consensus suggests retesting is generally unnecessary for stable patients on maintenance up to 2,000 IU/day, though it may be reasonable at 8–12 weeks if compliance is uncertain or risk is high; checking serum calcium about 1 month after loading is prudent to detect unmasked primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia, especially in older adults or those with bone disease [^114Lxtxc] [^116Tw7ci] [^113zRN7e]. Hold on, I should verify that high-dose intermittent bolus regimens may increase falls in older adults; yes, large monthly boluses have been associated with more falls compared with daily dosing, so daily or weekly regimens are preferred in older patients [^117Va2Uq].

> I need to ensure safety and toxicity are addressed. Vitamin D toxicity is rare but serious, typically presenting with hypercalcemia when 25(OH)D exceeds about 150 ng/mL; symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia, confusion, and nephrolithiasis, and toxicity is usually due to excessive dosing or manufacturing errors rather than standard regimens; I should confirm that unlicensed high-dose products have been implicated in recent case series, reinforcing the need to use reputable sources and adhere to labeled dosing [^113MKBT4] [^112KAZmH] [^114jjzc7]. Let me reconsider whether routine calcium monitoring is needed for everyone; it is not, but checking calcium after loading or in high-risk patients is reasonable, and any hypercalcemia warrants stopping vitamin D and investigating causes including granulomatous disease or ectopic calcitriol production [^113zRN7e] [^113YzgpM].

> But wait, what about extraskeletal outcomes that patients often ask about? Large RCTs in largely replete populations have not shown reductions in fractures, cardiovascular events, or cancer with vitamin D, and meta-analyses in COPD show little to no effect on exacerbations overall, although subgroup signals in profoundly deficient patients have been explored; I should emphasize that benefits are most plausible when baseline deficiency is present and that population-wide supplementation without deficiency is unlikely to yield meaningful clinical gains [^1165kh6X] [^1135xNL5] [^113UqxEs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that vitamin D treats COVID-19; I should correct that: evidence for treating COVID-19 with vitamin D remains limited and uncertain, with very low certainty for mortality effects and no definitive recommendation for treatment use, so vitamin D should not be used as COVID-19 therapy outside trials [^117A5XTB].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For generally healthy, asymptomatic adults, do not screen; instead, offer empiric supplementation if risk factors are present, for example 800–2,000 IU/day of D3, recognizing small potential benefits and minimal risk; for adults older than 75 years, empiric supplementation may modestly reduce mortality, so offering it is reasonable even without testing [^115QqUNi] [^113cP2er] [^113h9V6a]. For patients with symptoms, bone disease, malabsorption, obesity, liver or kidney disease, or interacting medications, test 25(OH)D and treat confirmed deficiency with loading followed by maintenance, adjusting doses upward for malabsorption or obesity; monitor calcium after loading in high-risk patients and avoid bolus dosing in older adults when possible [^116Tw7ci] [^115rP1Fz] [^113zRN7e] [^117Va2Uq]. I should confirm that this targeted, risk-based strategy aligns with USPSTF, AAFP, and Endocrine Society positions, which converge on avoiding routine screening while addressing high-risk groups and supporting empiric supplementation in select populations [^111UJRQk] [^113LbYKt] [^11535HZz].

> Key takeaway, and let me double-check that I am not overstating anything: vitamin D deficiency is common and clinically important for bone health, but in generally healthy, asymptomatic adults, routine 25(OH)D screening is not supported; instead, use targeted testing for those at risk and treat confirmed deficiency with evidence-based loading and maintenance regimens, while recognizing that extraskeletal benefits are uncertain in replete populations and that safety is excellent with standard dosing but requires vigilance for rare toxicity and assay variability [^111UJRQk] [^115GCzBc] [^113MKBT4].

Vitamin D deficiency is defined as **25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL** [^115TEChd] and is common worldwide, especially in older adults, people with dark skin, those with limited sun exposure, and individuals with obesity or malabsorption [^1144Ymwq] [^116Q4h2v]. It increases the risk of osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and fractures, and is associated with muscle weakness and falls [^116pPHVn] [^114Lxtxc]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^111UJRQk]; testing is indicated for those with risk factors or symptoms [^1123HSa4]. Treatment is **oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)** [^115EeB4G], typically 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks [^116Tw7ci], then maintenance 800–2,000 IU daily [^114Lxtxc] [^116Tw7ci]; higher doses are needed in obesity or malabsorption [^115rP1Fz]. Maintenance targets are ≥ 30 ng/mL [^113cP2er]; monitor calcium when high-dose or long-term therapy is used [^113zRN7e].

---

## Definition and classification

Vitamin D status is classified by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] [^1123HSa4]:

| **Category** | **Serum 25(OH)D level** |
|-|-|
| Deficiency | < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Insufficiency | 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) [^115TEChd] |
| Sufficiency | ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) [^notfound] |

---

## Epidemiology

Vitamin D deficiency is **highly prevalent globally** [^1163Tpwm], with about 24% of US adults affected [^115GCzBc]. Prevalence is higher in older adults, individuals with dark skin, those with limited sun exposure, and in people with obesity or malabsorption syndromes [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency:

- **Limited sun exposure**: Living at high latitudes, indoor lifestyle, clothing covering most skin, or consistent use of sunscreen [^1144Ymwq].
- **Skin pigmentation**: Darker skin reduces cutaneous vitamin D synthesis [^notfound].
- **Age**: Older adults have reduced skin synthesis and dietary intake [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue lowers bioavailability [^1144Ymwq].
- **Medical conditions**: Malabsorption syndromes (celiac, IBD), chronic kidney/liver disease, bariatric surgery [^1144Ymwq].
- **Medications**: Anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, antifungals, HIV medications [^111TsKkR].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Vitamin D deficiency presents with **skeletal and extraskeletal features**:

- **Skeletal manifestations**: Osteomalacia (adults), rickets (children), osteoporosis, bone pain, muscle weakness, increased fracture risk [^1165kh6X].
- **Extraskeletal manifestations**: Increased risk of falls, infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Diagnosis

Serum 25(OH)D is the **primary biomarker** of vitamin D status [^1123HSa4]. Routine screening is not recommended for asymptomatic adults [^11535HZz]; testing is indicated for those with risk factors, symptoms, or conditions requiring vitamin D therapy [^114gUrCM] [^113zRN7e].

---

## Treatment

Treatment depends on severity, cause, and patient factors:

- **Initial treatment**: Oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks [^116Tw7ci] or 6,000 IU daily [^116Tw7ci].
- **Maintenance therapy**: 800–2,000 IU daily after repletion [^114Lxtxc] [^116Tw7ci].
- **Special populations**: Higher doses (6,000–10,000 IU/day) may be needed in obesity, malabsorption, or with medications affecting metabolism [^115rP1Fz].
- **Monitoring**: Recheck 25(OH)D after 3 months; monitor calcium in high-dose or long-term therapy [^113cP2er] [^113zRN7e].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **moderate sun exposure**, dietary intake, and supplementation. Empiric vitamin D is reasonable in older adults [^113h9V6a], during pregnancy [^111U4Jbv], and in children to prevent rickets and respiratory infections [^113oTVaN].

---

## Potential complications of untreated deficiency

Untreated deficiency can cause **significant morbidity**:

- **Skeletal complications**: Osteomalacia, osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^1165kh6X].
- **Extraskeletal complications**: Higher risk of falls, infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [^1144Ymwq].

---

Vitamin D deficiency is common and associated with significant skeletal and extraskeletal consequences. Targeted screening and treatment are essential, with prevention through sun exposure, diet, and supplementation [^114gUrCM].

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XbWDR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

New USPSTF recommendation on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

This recommendation applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults aged 18 years or older who are seen in primary care settings and are not known to have signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111YxQi8]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Treatment and interventions — management of adult vitamin D deficiency is described: Vitamin D deficiency is usually treated with oral vitamin D, and there are 2 commonly available forms — vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) — both of which are available as prescription medications or over-the-counter dietary supplements.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1145ZUz5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

### Vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19: a living systematic review [^117A5XTB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for COVID-19 has been a subject of considerable discussion. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials is required.

Objectives

To assess whether vitamin D supplementation is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19 in comparison to an active comparator, placebo, or standard of care alone, and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Web of Science and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 11 March 2021.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies investigating preventive effects, or studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following prioritised outcome categories: individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause mortality, clinical status, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events, and for individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease: all-cause mortality, development of severe clinical COVID-19 symptoms, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events.

Main Results

We identified three RCTs with 356 participants, of whom 183 received vitamin D. In accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale, two studies investigated participants with moderate or severe disease, and one study individuals with mild or asymptomatic disease. The control groups consisted of placebo treatment or standard of care alone. Effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We included two studies with 313 participants. Due to substantial clinical and methodological diversity of both studies, we were not able to pool data. Vitamin D status was unknown in one study, whereas the other study reported data for vitamin D deficient participants. One study administered multiple doses of oral calcifediol at days 1, 3 and 7, whereas the other study gave a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol at baseline. We assessed one study with low risk of bias for effectiveness outcomes, and the other with some concerns about randomisation and selective reporting. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (313 participants) We found two studies reporting data for this outcome. One study reported no deaths when treated with vitamin D out of 50 participants, compared to two deaths out of 26 participants in the control group (Risk ratio (RR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.13). The other study reported nine deaths out of 119 individuals in the vitamin D group, whereas six participants out of 118 died in the placebo group (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.04]. We are very uncertain whether vitamin D has an effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (very low-certainty evidence). Clinical status assessed by the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (237 participants) We found one study reporting data for this outcome. Nine out of 119 participants needed invasive mechanical ventilation when treated with vitamin D, compared to 17 out of 118 participants in the placebo group (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.13). Vitamin D supplementation may decrease need for invasive mechanical ventilation, but the evidence is uncertain (low-certainty evidence). Quality of life We did not find data for quality of life. Safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease We did not include data from one study, because assessment of serious adverse events was not described and we are concerned that data might have been inconsistently measured. This study reported vomiting in one out of 119 participants immediately after vitamin D intake (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.30). We are very uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation is associated with higher risk for adverse events (very low-certainty). Effectiveness and safety of vitamin D supplementation for people with COVID-19 and asymptomatic or mild disease We found one study including 40 individuals, which did not report our prioritised outcomes, but instead data for viral clearance, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D serum levels. The authors reported no events of hypercalcaemia, but recording and assessment of further adverse events remains unclear. Authors administered oral cholecalciferol in daily doses for at least 14 days, and continued with weekly doses if vitamin D blood levels were > 50 ng/mL.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment of COVID-19. The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of COVID-19 is very uncertain. Moreover, we found only limited safety information, and were concerned about consistency in measurement and recording of these outcomes. There was substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies, mainly because of different supplementation strategies, formulations, vitamin D status of participants, and reported outcomes. There is an urgent need for well-designed and adequately powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with an appropriate randomisation procedure, comparability of study arms and preferably double-blinding. We identified 21 ongoing and three completed studies without published results, which indicates that these needs will be addressed and that our findings are subject to change in the future. Due to the living approach of this work, we will update the review periodically.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113mKtpB]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation — screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults states that for asymptomatic, community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults, the USPSTF found that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency (I statement). It applies to community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended and does not apply to persons who are hospitalized or living in institutions such as nursing homes. Implementation notes add that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for vitamin D deficiency, and the recommendation is consistent with the 2014 USPSTF statement.

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25–40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

Potential harms — screening and treatment considerations: Screening may misclassify persons with a vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the cutoff for deficiency and variability of available testing assays, which can lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. A rare but potential harm of treatment with vitamin D is toxicity characterized by marked hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalciuria; however, the 25(OH)D level associated with toxicity (typically > 150 ng/mL) is well above the level considered sufficient, and in general, treatment with oral vitamin D does not seem to be associated with serious harms.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Vitamin D for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1135xNL5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

COPD is a common, preventable and treatable airway disease, and is currently the third leading cause of death worldwide. About one billion people worldwide are estimated to have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is common among people with COPD, and has been reported to be associated with reduced lung function and increased risk of acute exacerbations of COPD. Several clinical trials of vitamin D to prevent acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) and improve COPD control have been conducted, but an up-to-date meta-analysis of all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of this intervention is lacking.

Objectives

To assess the effects of vitamin D for the management of acute exacerbations and symptoms for people with COPD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We also searched trial registries directly, and contacted the authors of studies in order to identify additional trials. The date of the last search was 24 August 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites, for adults with a clinical diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease based on the presence of characteristic symptoms and irreversible airflow obstruction. We did not impose restrictions regarding disease severity or baseline vitamin D status, in order to maximise generalisability.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary outcome was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations (requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both). We also performed subgroup analyses to determine whether the effect of vitamin D on the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was modified by baseline vitamin D status, COPD severity or regular inhaled corticosteroid use. The main secondary outcomes of interest were the proportion of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (moderate or severe), the change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1, % predicted) and the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse events of any cause, mortality (all-cause) and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 10 double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in this review, involving a total of 1372 adults. Five studies contributed to the primary outcome analysis of the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both. The duration of studies ranged from six weeks to 40 months, and all investigated the effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3). One study included two intervention arms, one where vitamin D 3 was given and one where calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) was given. The majority of participants had mild to moderate COPD, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare (123 participants contributing data to subgroup analysis). Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites results in little to no change in the overall rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both (rate ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 5 studies, 980 participants; high-certainty evidence). Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any meta-analysed secondary outcomes. These were all based on moderate- or high-certainty evidence aside from adverse events and quality of life, which were based on low-certainty evidence. We observed little to no change in the proportion of participants experiencing one or more moderate or severe exacerbations (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.24; 5 studies, 980 participants; high-certainty evidence). Additionally, vitamin D probably results in little to no difference in the inter-arm mean change in FEV1 (% predicted) (mean difference 2.82 higher in intervention arm, 95% CI -2.42 to 8.06; 7 studies, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also probably no effect of vitamin D on the incidence of serious adverse events due to any cause; although we identified an anticipated absolute effect of 36 additional adverse events per 1000 people, the confidence interval included the null hypothesis of no effect (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 5 studies, 663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D may have little to no effect on mortality (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; 6 studies, 1019 participants; low-certainty evidence). It also may have little to no effect on quality of life as measured by validated instruments (narrative findings; 5 studies, 663 participants; low-certainty evidence). We assessed one study as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; this did not contribute data to the meta-analysis of the primary outcome reported above. Sensitivity analysis that excluded this study from the meta-analysed outcome to which it contributed, the inter-arm mean change in FEV1, did not change the findings.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that administration of vitamin D results in little to no effect on the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics or both or the proportion of participants experiencing one or more exacerbations (moderate or severe) (both high-certainty evidence). Further, vitamin D probably has no effect on the inter-arm difference in change in lung volumes and the proportion of participants with one or more serious adverse event of any cause (both moderate-certainty evidence), and may make little to no difference to mortality or quality of life (both low-certainty evidence). We recommend further research on the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D supplements in COPD for those with very low or very high starting vitamin D levels, because we assessed the available evidence as low-certainty for these groups.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.
Recent National guidance has been published on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Should we screen for vitamin D deficiency? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113hNi1n]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued guidelines on screening for vitamin D deficiency. The guidelines were based on randomized trials of vitamin D deficiency screening and treatment, as well as on case-control studies nested within the Women's Health Initiative. The USPSTF concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. Compared with placebo or no treatment, vitamin D was associated with decreased mortality; however, benefits were no longer seen after trials of institutionalized persons were excluded. Vitamin D treatment was associated with a possible decreased risk for at least 1 fall and the total number of falls per person but not for fractures. None of the studies examined the effects of vitamin D screening versus not screening on clinical outcomes. In this Grand Rounds, 2 prominent endocrinologists debate the issue of screening for vitamin D deficiency in a 55-year-old, asymptomatic, postmenopausal woman. They review the data on which the USPSTF recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of screening for vitamin D deficiency in primary care practice.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115HwqyY]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D formulations and cautions — injectable vitamin D is an excellent option for stoss therapy but is no longer commercially available, though it has been successfully prepared by local compounding pharmacies when necessary. Calcitriol is not preferred for stoss therapy, is expensive, has a short half-life, and does not build up vitamin D stores; its use in nutritional deficiency of vitamin D is limited to treating associated hypocalcemia alone, and when given in large doses may cause hypercalcemia because of its rapid onset of action. Similarly, dihydrotachysterol can only treat hypocalcemia associated with vitamin D deficiency but does not build up vitamin D stores. Increased 1-α-hydroxylase activity from high PTH levels in the second phase of rickets may cause transient hypercalcemia after vitamin D treatment because of elevation of 1,25(OH)2-D levels to well above the upper limit of the reference range.

### Correlation of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment: a randomized controlled trial [^116tHfz8]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the association of symptoms with vitamin D deficiency and symptom response to cholecalciferol treatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

Adult primary care patients in Duluth, Minnesota, were screened for vitamin D deficiency in February 2007. Participants completed questionnaires pertaining to a variety of symptoms, vitamin D intake, and selected medical conditions. Patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 10–25 ng/mL) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of vitamin D replacement and its effect on symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 000 units of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) weekly or placebo for 8 weeks. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D < 10 ng/mL) were treated in an unblinded fashion, and symptoms were reevaluated post treatment.

Results

A total of 610 patients underwent initial screening, and 100 patients with mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency participated in the RCT. Thirty-eight severely deficient patients were treated in an unblinded fashion. On initial screening, 46.2% of participants were deficient in vitamin D. Self-reported vitamin D supplementation, milk intake, celiac disease, gastric bypass, and chronic pancreatitis were predictive of vitamin D status. Severely deficient participants reported increased musculoskeletal symptoms, depression (including seasonal), and higher (worse) scores on a fibromyalgia assessment questionnaire. In the RCT, the treated group showed significant improvement in fibromyalgia assessment scores (P = 0.03), whereas the placebo-treated participants did not. Severely deficient patients did not show symptom improvement over the 8-week trial period or when followed up 1 year later.

Conclusions

Compared with participants in the placebo group, patients in the treatment group showed mild short-term improvement in the overall fibromyalgia impact score, but did not show significant improvement in most musculoskeletal symptoms or in activities of daily living.

In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Vitamin D and child health part 1 (skeletal aspects) [^1174bRGV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable clinical and academic interest in vitamin D as a consequence of a number of developments over the past decade. This was initially related to a recognised resurgence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children in the UK and other countries. The potential importance of maternal vitamin D status on bone mass in early childhood and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peak bone mass has been the subject of much research. An additional development has been the recognition that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and what level should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review consists of two parts, the first focuses on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D, while the second will review some of the potential extraskeletal aspects, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### An update on the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis: evidence-based recommendations from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^114qJU66]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to develop evidence-based clinical care guidelines for the screening, diagnosis, management, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Participants

The guidelines committee was comprised of physicians, registered dietitians, a pharmacist, a nurse, a parent of an individual with CF, and a health scientist, all with experience in CF.

Process

Committee members developed questions specific to vitamin D health in individuals with CF. Systematic reviews were completed for each question. The committee reviewed and graded the available evidence and developed evidence-based recommendations and consensus recommendations when insufficient evidence was available. Each consensus recommendation was voted upon by an anonymous process.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is common in CF. Given the limited evidence specific to CF, the committee provided consensus recommendations for most of the recommendations. The committee recommends yearly screening for vitamin D status, preferably at the end of winter, using the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, with a minimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) considered vitamin D sufficient in individuals with CF. Recommendations for age-specific vitamin D intake for all individuals with CF, form of vitamin D, and a stepwise approach to increase vitamin D intake when optimal vitamin D status is not achieved are delineated.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are rare genetic photodermatoses. Limited expertise with these disorders among physicians leads to diagnostic delays. Here, we present evidence-based consensus guidelines for the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria. A systematic literature review was conducted, and reviewed among subcommittees of experts, divided by topic. Consensus on guidelines was reached within each subcommittee and then among all members of the committee. The appropriate biochemical and genetic testing to establish the diagnosis is reviewed in addition to the interpretation of results. Prevention of symptoms, management of acute phototoxicity, and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options are discussed. The importance of ongoing monitoring for liver disease, iron deficiency, and vitamin D deficiency is discussed with management guidance. Finally, management of pregnancy and surgery and the safety of other therapies are summarized. We emphasize that these are multisystemic disorders that require longitudinal monitoring. These guidelines provide a structure for evidence-based diagnosis and management for practicing physicians. Early diagnosis and management of these disorders are essential, particularly given the availability of new and emerging therapies.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — clinical stages and manifestations: The clinical presentation of vitamin D–deficiency rickets includes symptoms and signs of bone deformity and/or pain and may be associated with hypocalcemia and associated clinical features. The disease can be divided into 3 stages; the first stage is characterized by osteopenia and subclinical or overt hypocalcemia, followed in the second stage by rising PTH levels, and in the final stage bone changes become more severe with hypocalcemia again evident. Symptoms range from none to irritability, delay in gross motor development, and bone pain, and signs include widening of the wrists and ankles, genu varum or valgum, prominence of the costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), delayed closure of fontanelles, craniotabes, and frontal bossing. Vitamin D deficiency presenting as hypocalcemic seizures or tetany is reported more frequently in infancy and adolescence than in childhood; hypocalcemic children may have apneic spells, stridor or wheezing, hypotonia, muscular weakness, and brisk reflexes, and severe deficiency may be associated with cardiomyopathy related to hypocalcemia that normalizes with treatment.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112cezVV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

### Global consensus recommendations on prevention and management of nutritional rickets [^116wNRwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.

Evidence

A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.

Process

Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.

Results

This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.

Conclusion

Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

### Primary vitamin D deficiency in adults [^113XiuF2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

In adults, prolonged deficiency of vitamin D (calciferol) can lead to osteomalacia, while lesser deficiency (insufficiency) is associated with various non-specific symptoms. Both vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are becoming more common in developed countries. In the UK, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in all adults is around 14.5%, and may be more than 30% in those over 65 years old and as high as 94% in otherwise healthy south Asian adults. By comparison, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in adults may be as high as 55%, and the condition is even more common in patients with osteoporotic fractures. Recently, we discussed the management of children with primary vitamin D deficiency. Here we review the management of adults with the condition.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^112KAZmH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, calcitriol is not suitable for supplementation or nutritional fortification, and none of many excellent reviews, guidelines, and policy papers consider the use of calcitriol in the nutritional context (supplementation and fortification). However, guidelines suggest that vitamin D supplementation is advised in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney failure, and low vitamin D status in addition to receiving therapeutic doses of calcitriol (see Table 4). Such a recommendation is motivated by the activity of extrarenal 1-α-hydroxylase, which is compromised by reduced renal function (ie, not regulated by PTH) and is not regulated by feedback mechanisms.

Vitamin D Safety and Monitoring

Vitamin D supplementation is generally a safe treatment with minimal adverse events and no need for strict monitoring. However, side effects of vitamin D treatment exist and can result in vitamin D toxicity (VDT).

Vitamin D toxicity

VDT is a clinical condition characterized by excess vitamin D (hypervitaminosis D), resulting in severe hypercalcemia that may persist for a prolonged period of time, leading to serious health consequences. Signs and symptoms of VDT are related primarily to hypercalcemia, with complications encompassing adverse events in the CV, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. VDT prevalence is unknown, but it is rare due to the wide therapeutic index of vitamin D. Evidence from systematic studies of VDT in humans is missing for ethical reasons, and data mostly stem from studies of VDT in animals and anecdotal reports. The condition of infantile hypercalcemia was first described in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, showing symptoms such as failure to thrive, osteosclerosis, developmental delay, and even death, but was not immediately associated with vitamin D intake. Suggestions were made that excess vitamin D intake may be a causative factor (children received up to 35 000 IU daily). Eventually, the British Ministry of Health suggested a substantial reduction in vitamin D allowance, resulting in a marked decrease in infantile hypercalcemia cases. As the prescriptions of vitamin D products are increasing worldwide, so is the number of VDT reports, with more than 75% published since 2010. Many of these cases result from inappropriate prescribing; moreover, the prescription of high-dose unlicensed and poorly manufactured treatments can be greater than 60%, as they are cheaper.

Ratings of quality of evidence

We graded the quality of the available evidence in a four-part hierarchy according to the GRADE scheme (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). GRADE assesses the quality of evidence using four grades: high, moderate, low, and very low. Observational studies always start with a rating of low quality of evidence because of the risk of residual confounding but can be upgraded for large treatment effects, dose effect gradients, or if apparent confounding would reduce the observed effect. Criteria for downgrading the quality of evidence are risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We dually evaluated the overall quality of evidence for each outcome viewed as "critical" for decision-making by the scientific expert panel. We reconciled all disagreements in grades through consensus discussion.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

Box 6 Recommendations for conventional treatment in adults

We recommend treatment in symptomatic adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) by active vitamin D together with oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) to reduce osteomalacia and its consequences and to improve oral health (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest treating pregnant and lactating women with active vitamin D in combination with phosphate supplements if needed (grade D, weak recommendation)
We do not recommend routine treatment of asymptomatic adults with XLH (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend using substantially lower doses of active vitamin D and oral phosphate than are used in children (grade C, moderate recommendation). We recommend a dose range of 750–1,600 mg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) for phosphate and of 0.50–0.75 and 0.75–1.5 μg daily for calcitriol and alfacalcidol, respectively (grade C, weak recommendation)
We recommend reducing doses of active vitamin D in patients in whom long-term immobilization is anticipated, to prevent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend stopping phosphate supplements in patients with markedly increased parathyroid hormone levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that active vitamin D might be given without phosphate supplements to adult patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is provided (grade D, weak recommendation)

### Vitamin D and child health: part 2 (extraskeletal and other aspects) [^117GVNaM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Vitamin D supplementation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shows variable effects across studies, and "severe" vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D levels under 10 ng per ml. Across included trials, supplementation resulted in a decrease in acute exacerbations (AE) in a sub-group with "severe deficiency", while other trials resulted in reduced AEs, no impact in lung function (LF) outcomes, or improvement in LF outcomes and a reduction in AEs. Conclusion statements supporting the recommendations are Fair. Synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D status definitions, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions.

Objective

To support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on Vitamin D for the Prevention of Disease.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Of the 14 questions, 10 clinical questions assessed the effect of vitamin D vs no vitamin D in the general population throughout the lifespan, during pregnancy, and in adults with prediabetes; 1 question assessed dosing; and 3 questions addressed screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

Electronic searches yielded 37 007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years with variable certainty of evidence. There was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years with high certainty of evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefit on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate certainty of evidence suggested reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls, compared to lower-dose daily dosing. We did not identify trials on the benefits and harms of screening with serum 25(OH)D.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of vitamin D for the prevention of disease. The guideline panel considered additional information about individuals' and providers' values and preferences and other important decisional and contextual factors to develop clinical recommendations.

### Vitamin D and diabetic complications: true or false prophet? [^116iGoss]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a condition of increasing prevalence worldwide. Vitamin D has an established role in calcium and bone metabolism; however, more recently associations with vitamin D deficiency and risk of developing diabetes, diabetes complications, and cardiovascular disease have all been acknowledged. The vitamin D receptor is ubiquitously expressed, and experimental, in vitro, and in vivo studies strongly suggest a role in regulating the transcription of multiple genes beyond calcium homeostasis. These include antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, angiogenic, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and neurotrophic factor expression. Observational studies report a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and cardiovascular and metabolic disorders; however, there remains a paucity of large long-term randomized clinical trials showing a benefit with treatment. An increasing body of literature suggests a possible pathogenetic role of vitamin D in the long-term complications of diabetes and vitamin D deficiency may also exacerbate symptoms of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. It remains unknown if supplementation of vitamin D to normal or non-deficient levels alters pathogenetic processes related to diabetic microvascular complications. With the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with diabetes and putative mechanisms linking vitamin D deficiency to diabetic complications, there is a compelling argument for undertaking large well-designed randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11535HZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Patient information: screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults… [^11594cLw]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. What Is Vitamin D Deficiency. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in calcium regulation and bone health. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, although in the US many foods are fortified with vitamin D. Most of the vitamin D the human body uses is made by the skin as a result of exposure to sunlight. After that, vitamin D is processed by the liver and kidney to be useful to the bones. Vitamin D deficiency results when a person does not get enough vitamin D from the skin or food or their liver and/or kidney has problems processing it. Every person has a different level of need for vitamin D, so an exact level of deficiency is difficult to define.

Significant vitamin D deficiency can result in bone problems for both children and adults. Many studies have suggested links between vitamin D deficiency and a variety of health concerns including depression, falls, fractures, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and infection; however, many of these links are inconclusive. This recommendation applies to nonpregnant adults who do not have any signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. What Are the Potential Benefits and Harms of Screening for Vitamin D Deficiency. The goal of screening for vitamin D deficiency is to identify and treat it before adverse clinical outcomes occur. However, there is currently not enough evidence to say whether screening for and treating asymptomatic vitamin D deficiency improves any of the health problems described above. Part of the challenge in interpreting studies is the variable definition of vitamin D deficiency.

Screening may misclassify people with vitamin D deficiency because of variability in cutoff values and among different tests. Another rare potential harm of screening is overtreatment with high-dose vitamin D supplements, which can lead to vitamin D toxicity. How Strong Is the Recommendation to Screen for Vitamin D Deficiency. Given current evidence, the USPSTF concludes that overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.
