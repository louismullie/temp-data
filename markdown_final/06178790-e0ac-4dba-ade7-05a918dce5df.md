## Question

75 year old with lone atrila fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a 75-year-old with so-called "lone" atrial fibrillation, specifically regarding stroke prevention and whether anticoagulation is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct definition of "lone AF" and whether it still applies meaningfully at age 75. Then, I should verify stroke risk using CHA2DS2-VASc and confirm how age ≥ 75 years is weighted. Next, I will review bleeding risk and how to balance it against ischemic risk. After that, I should compare anticoagulant options, including DOACs versus warfarin, and check dose adjustments for age and renal function. Finally, I will consider rhythm versus rate control, special situations like frailty or falls, and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not misapplying a label. Historically, "lone AF" meant AF in patients under about 60 years old without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including hypertension, and carried a low thromboembolic risk; however, in patients aged 75 years, the term is not appropriate and should not be used to guide therapy, as age itself becomes a major risk factor and the stroke risk rises substantially with aging [^115Px2x2] [^114ZjRFu] [^11318Eec].

> Wait, let me verify the stroke risk calculation using CHA2DS2-VASc, because that will anchor the decision. Age ≥ 75 years contributes 2 points, and even if there are no other risk factors, the score is 2 in a man and 3 in a woman, placing this patient in a high-risk category for thromboembolism. Contemporary guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for men with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 and women with ≥ 3, and even consider anticoagulation at a score of 1 in men or 2 in women when the estimated annual thromboembolic risk is ≥ 1%, which is almost always the case at age 75 [^112FQLed] [^113zvGVi] [^114sKXey].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bleeding risk without quantifying it. I should double-check bleeding risk using HAS-BLED, recognizing that age ≥ 75 is a component and that the score has imperfect discrimination; importantly, a higher HAS-BLED should prompt closer follow-up and mitigation of modifiable bleeding risks rather than withholding indicated anticoagulation, given the strong ischemic benefit in this age group [^111crtUe] [^116oV7Wb].

> I will now examine anticoagulant choices, and I need to ensure I align with current guidance. DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin for nonvalvular AF due to lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage and favorable net clinical benefit, including in older adults; however, I should confirm dose reductions for age, weight, and renal function, particularly for apixaban and dabigatran, and consider that some very elderly patients on stable, well-controlled VKA with polypharmacy may reasonably continue VKA rather than switch to a DOAC to avoid excess bleeding risk [^116oV7Wb] [^115hd5ba] [^111b8fx5].

> Let me think about specific dosing, because I should verify the exact reductions. For apixaban, the standard dose is 5 mg twice daily, reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily if at least two of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; for a 75-year-old without the other two criteria, full-dose apixaban is appropriate, with reassessment if weight is low or creatinine rises; for dabigatran, 150 mg twice daily is standard, with 110 mg twice daily considered in patients ≥ 80 years or those at high bleeding risk in regions where this dose is available; for rivaroxaban, 20 mg daily is standard, reduced to 15 mg daily if creatinine clearance is ≤ 50 mL/min; for edoxaban, 60 mg daily is standard, reduced to 30 mg daily if CrCl is 15–50 mL/min [^115hd5ba].

> But wait, what if the patient or family is concerned about falls or frailty? I should address that explicitly. Even in patients with occasional falls or mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment, the ischemic benefit of anticoagulation generally outweighs bleeding risk at this age, provided we mitigate hazards and align with patient preferences; guidelines emphasize shared decision-making and close follow-up rather than withholding indicated therapy solely due to fall risk or frailty, although very frequent falls or severe dementia warrant individualized discussion of uncertainty [^117Ws7SQ] [^114oYAkM].

> Next, I should review rhythm management, because I need to ensure we do not conflate rhythm control with anticoagulation decisions. Anticoagulation is indicated based on stroke risk, independent of whether a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is chosen; in a 75-year-old, rate control is often a reasonable initial approach unless symptoms are severe or there is heart failure where rhythm control may improve outcomes, and any rhythm-control attempt still requires anticoagulation per stroke risk stratification [^1121mx2i] [^114aKSkj] [^111noMow].

> Let me consider special scenarios, and I should double-check the nuances. If the patient is already on a well-controlled VKA with stable INR and high bleeding risk on switching, continuing VKA may be reasonable; if anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated, left atrial appendage occlusion can be considered in selected patients, but this is not the default for a 75-year-old who can otherwise receive pharmacologic anticoagulation; I should also remember that aspirin alone is not an adequate substitute for stroke prevention at this age and is notably inferior to oral anticoagulation [^111b8fx5] [^116umpYr] [^116U4uMF].

> I should confirm monitoring and follow-up, because safe anticoagulation requires proactive risk reduction. Baseline labs should include renal and hepatic function, complete blood count, and blood pressure assessment. Modifiable bleeding risks such as uncontrolled hypertension, concomitant antiplatelets or NSAIDs, and alcohol excess should be addressed. If VKA is used, maintain high time-in-therapeutic-range, and if a DOAC is used, reassess renal function at least annually or when clinically indicated in older adults to ensure appropriate dosing and safety [^116oV7Wb] [^115hd5ba].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I need to ensure the final plan is concise and evidence-based. For a 75-year-old with AF — even if otherwise "lone" by historical criteria — stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation is indicated because age ≥ 75 years alone yields a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 in men and 3 in women, corresponding to high thromboembolic risk. A DOAC is preferred if there are no contraindications, with attention to age, weight, and renal-based dose adjustments, while VKA remains reasonable if already stable and well controlled or if DOACs are unsuitable. Aspirin monotherapy should not be used for stroke prevention in this scenario. Rhythm strategy can be rate-control focused unless symptoms or heart failure dictate otherwise, and anticoagulation must continue irrespective of rhythm strategy [^112FQLed] [^113zvGVi] [^116oV7Wb] [^111b8fx5].

---

In a 75-year-old with lone atrial fibrillation, **oral anticoagulation is indicated** because age ≥ 75 years alone confers a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 in men and 3 in women, indicating elevated stroke risk [^112FQLed]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over warfarin due to lower intracranial bleeding risk and greater convenience, with apixaban favored in patients ≥ 75 years [^116oV7Wb] [^112PjwRr]. Rate control is the **preferred initial strategy** unless symptoms are severe or refractory, and rhythm control should be reserved for selected cases. Regular monitoring for bleeding, renal function, and drug interactions is essential, and anticoagulation should be individualized based on bleeding risk and patient preferences [^116oV7Wb] [^113EbK7M].

---

## Stroke risk assessment and anticoagulation

- **CHA2DS2-VASc score**: Age ≥ 75 years alone gives a score of 2 in men and 3 in women, indicating elevated stroke risk and a strong indication for anticoagulation [^116oV7Wb].

- **Choice of anticoagulant**: DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are preferred over warfarin due to lower intracranial bleeding risk and greater convenience. Apixaban is particularly favorable in patients ≥ 75 years because of lower bleeding risk and no routine laboratory monitoring [^116oV7Wb] [^112PjwRr].

- **Bleeding risk assessment**: Use HAS-BLED to identify modifiable bleeding risks and guide monitoring, but elevated bleeding risk alone should not preclude anticoagulation in patients ≥ 75 years with AF [^116oV7Wb].

---

## Rate versus rhythm control

Rate control is the **preferred initial strategy** for most elderly patients with lone AF, as it is effective, safe, and associated with fewer adverse events than rhythm control. Reserve rhythm control — using antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation — for patients with persistent symptoms despite optimal rate control or for those in whom rhythm control may improve outcomes (e.g. heart failure).

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients should have periodic follow-up to assess symptom control, bleeding risk, renal function, and drug interactions [^116oV7Wb].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about adherence, recognition of bleeding or thromboembolic symptoms, and when to seek medical attention [^113EbK7M].

- **Individualized care**: Treatment should be tailored to patient preferences, comorbidities, and functional status, with shared decision-making emphasized [^114oYAkM].

---

## Special considerations

In patients with **frailty**, assess frailty and adjust treatment plans accordingly; anticoagulation remains beneficial but requires careful monitoring. In patients with **falls**, occasional falls alone should not preclude anticoagulation; assess overall risk-benefit and consider strategies to minimize fall risk. Polypharmacy warrants regular medication reconciliation to manage interactions and adherence.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Anticoagulation | - Indicated for all patients ≥ 75 years with lone AF <br/> - DOACs preferred (especially apixaban) [^114KeSb7] [^116oV7Wb] |
| Rate control | Preferred initial strategy; use beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [^115TCGPH] |
| Rhythm control | Reserved for symptomatic patients or specific indications [^1139pN8w] |
| Monitoring | Regular follow-up for symptoms, bleeding, renal function, and drug interactions [^116oV7Wb] [^115hd5ba] |
| Individualization | Tailor treatment to patient preferences, comorbidities, and functional status [^114oYAkM] |

---

In a 75-year-old with lone AF, **anticoagulation is indicated** due to elevated stroke risk, with DOACs preferred. Rate control is the initial strategy, and treatment should be individualized with regular monitoring.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) epidemiology and subtype definitions — The term lone AF generally applies to young individuals (under 60 y of age) without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including hypertension, and these patients have a favorable prognosis with respect to thromboembolism and mortality. By convention, nonvalvular AF is restricted to cases in which the rhythm disturbance occurs in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease, a prosthetic heart valve, or mitral valve repair. AF is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, accounting for approximately one-third of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances. It has been estimated that 2.2 million people in America and 4.5 million in the European Union have paroxysmal or persistent AF, and during the past 20 y there has been a 66% increase in hospital admissions for AF due to a combination of factors including the aging of the population, a rising prevalence of chronic heart disease, and more frequent diagnosis through use of ambulatory monitoring devices.

### Assessment of female sex as a risk factor in atrial fibrillation in Sweden: nationwide retrospective cohort study [^116hSt9u]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Several studies have indicated that women with atrial fibrillation are at higher risk of ischaemic stroke than men, although other studies have found no difference. The systematic review of stroke risk factors by the Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Working Group concluded that female sex multiplied the risk of stroke by 1.6-fold, and female sex has been incorporated into stroke risk assessment guidelines.

Differences in stroke risk between the sexes is of clinical relevance, and of great practical importance if few or no other stroke risk factors exist, and a decision regarding anticoagulation treatment is needed. It is also important to determine whether the generally recognised risk factors for stroke are equally important for men and women — that is, whether one common scheme for stroke risk stratification can be used for men and women with atrial fibrillation, or each sex should have different schemes.

The recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the use of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score to refine stroke risk stratification, and female sex carries one point on this score. The guidelines clearly recommend that antithrombotic treatment is necessary in all patients with atrial fibrillation unless they are "age < 65 and low risk". However, this point is still commonly misinterpreted for women with atrial fibrillation who are younger than 65 years and do not have any other risk factors (that is, they still have a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1), in that they should be treated with "either oral anticoagulants or aspirin 75–325 mg daily, with oral anticoagulants preferred rather than aspirin". Indeed, should doctors recommend a physically active woman aged, for example, 45 years with atrial fibrillation (and no other risk factors) to take oral anticoagulants to avoid stroke, while recommend a man under the same circumstances to have no antithrombotic treatment? Furthermore, there remains uncertainty about whether the term "lone atrial fibrillation" is relevant in women, since their sex is considered a stroke risk factor. At a pragmatic level, young women with atrial fibrillation with female sex as the only risk factor (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score 1) should not need anticoagulation treatment, if they fulfil the criteria of "age < 65 and lone atrial fibrillation".

### Lone atrial fibrillation in elderly persons… [^114ZjRFu]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Lone atrial fibrillation occurring after age 60 years is a risk marker for a substantial increase in cardiovascular events that warrants consideration for antithrombotic therapy. At the time of diagnosis, the isolated form of LAF was present in 7 patients, the recurrent form in 16, and the chronic form in 32. By the end of the follow-up period, recurrent LAF had become chronic in 5 patients and continued to be recurrent in
11. This study provides strong evidence that the risk of cerebral ischemic events is increased in elderly patients with LAF in comparison with the risk in age- and sex-matched control patients with an equivalent absence of other cardiovascular diseases. These data contrast with the low risk of thromboembolism seen in younger patients with LAF from the same population base.

1 Cumulative event rates of TIA and myocardial infarction were significantly higher — 5. 0% per person-year compared with
1. 3% per person-year in the controls. The previous study confirmed the absence of an increased risk of stroke when atrial fibrillation is present in otherwise healthy patients without hypertension who are aged 60 years and younger. 1 This was also suggested prospectively in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation study, 12 in which none of 70 such patients had stroke or TIA. The present study suggests that age plays a major role in the incidence of stroke in these otherwise apparently healthy patients, probably through the associated development of atherosclerotic vascular disease. IN PATIENTS AGED 60 years and younger with LAF, the risk of stroke, TIA, or myocardial infarction is small at 1. 5 events per 100 patient-years and occurs mainly late in follow-up, whereas in older patients, the risk is appreciably higher at 50 events per 100 patient-years.

This may relate in part to the presence of subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, increasing blood pressure with age, increasing left ventricular dysfunction, or left atrial enlargement. 12, 14, 15 Also, a higher incidence of coronary artery disease may have been found in the control population because there were more sensitive diagnostic techniques available in 1978.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation — Risk stratification epidemiology: In Olmsted County, the 15-y cumulative stroke rate in people with lone AF defined as those younger than 60 y with no clinical history or echocardiographic signs of cardiopulmonary disease was 1.3%. In the Framingham Study, the age-adjusted stroke rate over a mean follow-up period of 11 y was 28.2% in those with lone AF compared with 6.8% in normal controls. In the SPAF study, the annualized rate of ischemic stroke during aspirin treatment was similar in those with paroxysmal (3.2%) and permanent (3.3%) AF. Those with prior stroke or TIA have a rate of subsequent stroke of 10% to 12% per year when treated with aspirin. In addition to prior thromboembolism, HF, hypertension, increasing age, and diabetes mellitus have consistently emerged as independent risk factors, and other factors such as systolic blood pressure over 160 mm Hg and LV dysfunction have been variably linked to stroke. Prior stroke or TIA is the strongest independent predictor, with incremental relative risks between 1.9 and 3.7 (averaging approximately 3.0), and patients with prior stroke or TIA are at high risk of recurrent thromboembolism and require anticoagulation unless there are firm contraindications.

### Age-related differences in presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with Atrial fibrillation in Europe: the EORP-AF general pilot registry (EURObservational Research programme-atrial fibrillation) [^116i3Bxb]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to compare age-related differences in presentation, treatment, and outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a wide cohort of European subjects.

Background

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the elderly.

Methods

We evaluated all patients enrolled in the EORP-AF (EURObservational Research Programme-Atrial Fibrillation) General Pilot Registry in 70 centers of 9 European countries.

Results

Among 3,119 subjects, 1,051 (33.7%) were age ≥ 75 years. Permanent AF was significantly more common in the elderly, who had a higher prevalence of hypertension, valvular diseases, chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior hemorrhagic event or a transient ischemic attack. Common diagnostic tests were underused in older subjects. Despite their higher stroke risk, the use of oral anticoagulants was significantly lower in the elderly (76.7% vs. 82.8%; p = 0.0012), whereas aspirin and clopidogrel alone or in combination were more often prescribed. Rate control was the management of choice in the older group, with electrical cardioversion and catheter ablation performed less frequently than in the younger age group. Antiarrhythmic drugs were significantly less prescribed in the elderly (29.8% vs. 41.7%; p < 0.0001). At the 1-year follow-up, mortality (11.5% vs. 3.7%; p < 0.0001) and the composite of stroke/transient ischemic attack, systemic thromboembolism, and/or death (13.6% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in the ≥ 75 years of age cohort.

Conclusions

In older patients, AF is more often associated with comorbidities. Rate control is the preferred therapeutic approach. Despite a higher CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, the use of oral anticoagulation is suboptimal. In elderly subjects, the rate of adverse events is higher at follow-up.

### Long-term progression and outcomes with aging in patients with lone atrial fibrillation: a 30-year follow-up study [^115TUB8S]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term natural history of lone atrial fibrillation is unknown. Our objective was to determine the rate and predictors of progression from paroxysmal to permanent atrial fibrillation over 30 years and the long-term risk of heart failure, thromboembolism, and death compared with a control population.

Methods and Results

A previously characterized Olmsted County, Minnesota, population with first episode of documented atrial fibrillation between 1950 and 1980 and no concomitant heart disease or hypertension was followed up long term. Of this unique cohort, 76 patients with paroxysmal (n = 34), persistent (n = 37), or permanent (n = 5) lone atrial fibrillation at initial diagnosis met inclusion criteria (mean age at diagnosis, 44.2 ± 11.7 years; male, 78%). Mean duration of follow-up was 25.2 ± 9.5 years. Of 71 patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation, 22 had progression to permanent atrial fibrillation. Overall survival of the 76 patients with lone atrial fibrillation was 92% and 68% at 15 and 30 years, respectively, similar to 86% and 57% survival for the age- and sex-matched Minnesota population. Observed survival free of heart failure was slightly worse than expected (P = 0.051). Risk for stroke or transient ischemic attack was similar to the expected population risk during the initial 25 years of follow-up but increased thereafter (P = 0.004), although CIs were wide. All patients who had a cerebrovascular event had developed ≥ 1 risk factor for thromboembolism.

Conclusions

Comorbidities significantly modulate progression and complications of atrial fibrillation. Age or development of hypertension increases thromboembolic risk.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114YEL6r]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Although there are several classification systems for AF, for this consensus document, we have adopted in large part the classification system that was presented in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation. We recommend that this classification system be used for future studies of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Paroxysmal AF (PAF) is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset (Table 1); persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond 7 days; and long-standing persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than 12 months' duration. Early persistent AF is a new term we have defined as continuous AF of more than 7 days' duration but less than 3 months' duration. Within the context of AF ablation and clinical trials of AF ablation, early persistent AF defines a population of patients in whom better outcomes of AF ablation are anticipated as compared with persistent AF of more than 3 months' duration. The term permanent AF is defined as AF in which the presence of the AF is accepted by the patient and physician, and no further attempts will be made to either restore or maintain sinus rhythm. It is important, therefore, to recognize that the term permanent AF represents a therapeutic attitude on the part of a patient and their physician rather than on any inherent pathophysiological attribute of the AF. Such decisions can change as symptoms, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, and patient and physician preferences evolve. If a rhythm control strategy is recommended after reevaluation, the AF should be redesignated as paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent AF. Within the context of any rhythm control strategy, including catheter and surgical AF ablation, the term permanent AF is not meaningful and should not be used. Silent AF is defined as asymptomatic AF diagnosed by an opportune ECG or rhythm strip. Paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent AF can be silent. We recognize that a particular patient might have AF episodes that fall into one or more of these categories; therefore, we recommended that patients be categorized by their most frequent pattern of AF during the 6 months prior to performance of an ablation procedure. Lone AF is a descriptor that has been applied to younger patients without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Because the definitions are variable, the term lone AF is potentially confusing, and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF nor to guide therapeutic decisions. The term chronic AF also has variable definitions and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF.

### How I manage anticoagulant therapy in older individuals with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism [^116Z2S9u]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy is the most effective strategy to prevent arterial and venous thromboembolism, but treating older individuals is challenging, because increasing age, comorbidities, and polypharmacy increase the risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. Warfarin and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are underused and often underdosed in the prevention of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation because of concerns about the risk of bleeding. Poor adherence to anticoagulant therapy is also an issue for older patients with atrial fibrillation and those at risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. In this review, we present 5 clinical cases to illustrate common challenges with anticoagulant use in older patients and discuss our approach to institute safe and effective antithrombotic therapy.

### Management of atrial fibrillation [^116DqPxZ]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and confers a substantial mortality and morbidity from stroke, thromboembolism, heart failure, and impaired quality of life. With the increasingly elderly population in the developed world, as well as improvements in the management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is increasing, resulting in a major public-health problem. This Review aims to provide an overview on the modern management of atrial fibrillation, with particular emphasis on pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Irrespective of a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy, stroke prevention with appropriate thromboprophylaxis still remains central to the management of this common arrhythmia. Electrophysiological approaches could hold some promise for a curative approach in atrial fibrillation.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — cerebrovascular events and anticoagulation discontinuation outcomes — are reported across observational cohorts. Another single-center report described outcomes in 635 patients with one or more risk factors for stroke during a mean follow-up of 836 ± 605 days after an AF procedure; when anticoagulation was discontinued in 434 of 710 patients who remained in sinus rhythm, there were three ischemic strokes and two TIAs with an estimated five-year stroke rate of 3%. An observational study from five large AF ablation centers included 3,344 patients; there were 347 that had a CHADS2 score of greater than two and among these 347 patients no thromboembolic events occurred. Age-stratified data showed a periprocedure CVA occurred in 0.8% and 1% of patients ≥ 65 and < 65 years of age, respectively, while late CVA occurred in 3% of patients ≥ 65 years of age and 1% of patients < 65 years of age; in those > 65 years, anticoagulation was stopped in 56% of those with a CHADS2 score ≥ 1, and 180 patients had a CHADS2 score of two or greater. Among patients > 75 years, age > 75 years was the only independent risk factor for CVA (OR, 4.9). A separate series of 565 patients found the only independent predictors of thromboembolic events were recurrence of AF despite multiple ablations and the CHA2DS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

Conclusions

In this multicenter target emulation trial of 818 patients with confirmed AF who were ≥ 75 years old from May 2021 to January 2024, we found no significant differences in the occurrence of major thromboembolic events, major or clinically relevant bleeding, or all-cause death between patients whose cases were reviewed and not reviewed by a hospital multidisciplinary team. However, as this study remains observational, residual biases may explain the observed results, and these results need to be confirmed in a randomized trial.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

### Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants in high-risk atrial fibrillation in an aging population [^113QkYaD]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the elderly. As the global overall population is aging, the incidence and prevalence of AF have risen markedly in recent decades. In Europe, 18 million people are expected to have AF by 2060, primarily considered to be the result of an increase in patients with AF aged ≥ 80 years. Elderly (age 65–79 years) and very elderly people (age ≥ 80 years) commonly have multimorbidities, which can lead to challenges in managing treatment strategies. AF management is particularly important because of its risk for stroke and systemic thromboembolism. A widely used therapy to prevent stroke and systemic thromboembolism in patients with AF without rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves (hereafter referred to as AF) is direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). With several advantages over warfarin, including fewer food–drug interactions, patients receiving DOACs have a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality and major bleeding than patients receiving warfarin. However, patients in many trials comparing DOACs with warfarin are often younger than patients with AF in actual clinical practice, and there remains a paucity of evidence in very elderly patients. Subgroup analyses of clinical trials have attempted to address these concerns, yet data in very elderly patients and those with a history of bleeding, renal impairment, cognitive impairments, or frailty remain insufficient.

Understanding the risks and benefits of treatments is increasingly important in the context of aging societies (Central Illustration). This state-of-the-art review will examine the current evidence regarding the use of DOACs to improve health outcomes in elderly and very elderly patients with AF. The search terms used were "anticoagulation", "atrial fibrillation", "elder/aging", or "outcome" in Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus.

Atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation efficacy — Meta-analysis using intention-to-treat shows adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation reduces all stroke versus placebo with a risk reduction of 62% (95% CI 48% to 72%). By on-treatment analysis excluding patients not undergoing oral anticoagulation at the time of stroke, the preventive efficacy of oral anticoagulation exceeded 80%. Among the randomized trials, 4 were placebo controlled; of the 2 that were double blinded with regard to anticoagulation, one was stopped early because of external evidence that oral anticoagulation was superior to placebo, and the other included no female subjects. In 3 trials dosing was regulated by prothrombin time ratio; 2 used INR target ranges of 2.5 to 4.0 and 2.0 to 3.0. Follow-up was generally between 1 and 2 y, with the longest 2.2 y.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation intensity targets in atrial fibrillation (AF) — For patients with nonvalvular AF, an INR of 1.6 to 3.0 is efficacious and relatively safe; for primary prevention in most AF patients under age 75 y and for secondary prevention, an INR of 2.5 (target range 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended, whereas a target INR of 2.0 (target range 1.6 to 2.5) seems reasonable for primary prevention in patients older than 75 y at high risk of bleeding. Maximum protection against ischemic stroke in AF is probably achieved at an INR range of 2.0 to 3.0, whereas an INR range of 1.6 to 2.5 is associated with incomplete efficacy, estimated at approximately 80% of that achieved with higher-intensity anticoagulation; trials targeting INR 1.4 to 2.8 (estimated mean achieved 2.0 to 2.1) found the largest relative risk reductions, but among AF patients with prior stroke or TIA, targeting 2.2 to 3.5 versus 1.5 to 2.1 found a greater rate of major hemorrhage with the higher intensity. Low-intensity anticoagulation requires special efforts to minimize time below the target range because stroke protection is sharply reduced; major bleeding across 5 randomized trials was 1.2% per year, and contemporary intracerebral hemorrhage rates are typically 0.1% to 0.6%.

Atrial fibrillation — preventing thromboembolism (Class IIa) specifies that for primary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF who have just 1 validated risk factor, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable, based upon an assessment of bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences, listing age greater than or equal to 75 y, hypertension, HF, impaired LV function, or diabetes mellitus (Level of Evidence: A). For patients with nonvalvular AF who have 1 or more less well-validated risk factors, antithrombotic therapy with either aspirin or a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable for prevention of thromboembolism, including age 65 to 74 y, female gender, or CAD, and the choice of agent should be based upon bleeding risk, ability to safely sustain adjusted chronic anticoagulation, and patient preferences (Level of Evidence: B). It is reasonable to select antithrombotic therapy using the same criteria irrespective of the pattern (i.e., paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) of AF (Level of Evidence: B). In patients with AF who do not have mechanical prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable to interrupt anticoagulation for up to 1 wk without substituting heparin for surgical or diagnostic procedures that carry a risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C).

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence — population estimates and demographics — ranges from 0.4% to 1% in the general population and increases with age, reaching 8% in those older than 80 y. The median age of AF patients is about 75 y, and approximately 70% are between 65 and 85 y old. The overall number of men and women with AF is about equal, but approximately 60% of AF patients over 75 y are female; the age-adjusted prevalence is higher in men, in whom the prevalence has more than doubled from the 1970s to the 1990s, while the prevalence in women has remained unchanged. In population-based studies, fewer than 12% of AF cases occur in patients without cardiopulmonary disease, although some series report lone AF over 30%. In the Euro Heart Survey on AF, idiopathic AF prevalence amounted to 10%, with 15% in paroxysmal AF, 14% in first-detected AF, 10% in persistent AF, and 6% in permanent AF. AF is less common among African-American than Caucasian patients with heart failure, and limited data suggest the age-adjusted risk of developing AF in blacks is less than half that in whites.

### Warfarin therapy for an octogenarian who has atrial fibrillation [^112HYKfF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

In North America, atrial fibrillation is associated with at least 75 000 ischemic strokes each year. Most of these strokes occur in patients older than 75 years of age. The high incidence of stroke in very elderly persons reflects the increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation that occurs with advanced age, the high incidence of stroke in elderly patients, and the failure of physicians to prescribe antithrombotic therapy in most of these patients. This failure is related to the increased risk for major hemorrhage with advanced age, obfuscating the decision to institute stroke prophylaxis with antithrombotic therapy. This case-based review describes the risk and benefits of prescribing antithrombotic therapy for a hypothetical 80-year-old man who has atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and it offers practical advice on managing warfarin therapy. After concluding that the benefits of warfarin outweigh its risks in this patient, we describe how to initiate warfarin therapy cautiously and how to monitor and dose the drug. We then review five recent randomized, controlled trials that document the increased risk for stroke when an international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 2.0 is targeted among patients with atrial fibrillation. Next, we make the case that cardioversion is not needed for this asymptomatic patient with chronic atrial fibrillation. Instead, we choose to leave the patient in atrial fibrillation and to control his ventricular rate with atenolol. Later, when the INR increases to 4.9, we advocate withholding one dose of warfarin and repeating the INR test. Finally, when the patient develops dental pain, we review the analgesic agents that are safe to take with warfarin and explain why warfarin therapy does not have to be interrupted during a subsequent dental extraction.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^1126bopV]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Cost effectiveness of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is described with reported reductions in annual health care costs from a mean of $1,920 ± 889 pre-ablation to $87 ± 68 post-ablation, with procedural costs approximately $17,000 and total charges typically greater than $50,000; another study reported an initial ablation cost of approximately 4,700 Euros with approximately 450 Euros/year thereafter versus pharmacological management approximately 1,600 Euros. In 55-year-old patients at moderate risk of stroke, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $28,700 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas in patients with no risk factors for stroke the ICER was $98,900 per QALY. In 65-year-old patients at moderate risk of stroke and with an 80% one-year success rate, the relative risk of stroke after ablation would need to decrease by ≥ 42% for the ICER to be < $50,000; $50,000 is generally considered the threshold for cost-effectiveness. Limited data suggest AF ablation may be cost-effective in patients with one or more risk factors for stroke but not in those with no risk factors.

### Multidisciplinary team for antithrombotics management and clinical outcomes in older adults with atrial fibrillation: a target trial emulation [^112mNKL1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our cohort had a particularly high mortality rate. The 1- and 6-month mortality rates were 10.5% and 30.3%, respectively, which is consistent with previous studies. For example, in a cohort of 1808 patients with AF who were ≥ 75 years old and hospitalized in the acute geriatric unit of the University Hospital of Pisa, the 10-month mortality rate was 45.2%. The risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding were elevated in our population, with 6-month thromboembolic and major or clinically relevant bleeding rates of 2.8% and 8.4%, respectively, including a 1.5% risk of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, higher than previously reported in the literature. In a cohort study of more than 30,000 older Japanese patients with AF (mean age 81.5 ± 4.8 years) from the All Nippon AF in the Elderly (ANAFIE) registry, the 2-year incidence rates were 3.01% for stroke/systemic embolic events and 2.00% for major bleeding. The PREFER in AF trial (461 hospitals from 7 European countries) reported a 3.4% annual stroke/systemic embolic event rate in 6412 patients > 75 years old. This discrepancy may be explained in part by the higher risk profile of our patients than in the previous studies.

### Assessment of female sex as a risk factor in atrial fibrillation in Sweden: nationwide retrospective cohort study [^116J8fNZ]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The absolute risk of atrial fibrillation related stroke in young and otherwise healthy women (that is, aged < 65 years and with lone atrial fibrillation) was low and only non-significantly higher than in men (0.7% v 0.5%, P = 0.09), indicating that female sex in the absence of other risk factors for stroke would not indicate a need for antithrombotic treatment. Nevertheless, healthy women aged 65–74 years old had an annual stroke rate of 1.9%, which may merit anticoagulation and evaluation of subtler risks such as absolute levels of blood pressure, whether the patient is aged closer to 65 years or to 75 years, and consideration of other risk factors beyond those in the risk stratification schemes in order to decide on optimal treatment. Eckman and colleaguessuggested that treatment with new and "safer" oral anticoagulant drugs could be an option even at this low absolute risk, for which the threshold for treatment might be an annual stroke rate of 0.9%. This observation is pertinent since aspirin is less effective than new oral anticoagulant drugs for stroke prevention and has a similar risk for major bleeding (and intracranial haemorrhage), and the evidence supporting aspirin use for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is weak.

The European Society of Cardiology's guidelinesrecommend antithrombotic treatment for stroke prevention in all patients with atrial fibrillation unless they are low risk (that is, age < 65 years and with lone atrial fibrillation); therefore, young women who have no risk factors would fall into this category, and the present study supports this. Thus, patients with "female sex" as the only risk factor (but who would still have a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 1 on that basis) would not need anticoagulation treatment, if they fulfil the criteria of being younger than 65 years and have lone atrial fibrillation. The central question is to carefully define patients who are truly at low risk of atrial fibrillation related stroke, which the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score can help with, as shown by performing best in identifying such patients.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^116xc5wT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As the population ages, atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence increases, but data on optimal oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients ≥ 80 years remain limited. This study tested whether direct OACs offer comparable benefits to vitamin K antagonists in patients ≥ 80 years with AF presenting to the emergency department.

Methods

This single‐center retrospective all‐comer study used data from the Heidelberg Registry of Atrial Fibrillation, including patients with AF presenting to the emergency department of the University Hospital of Heidelberg from June 2009 until March 2020. Data were analyzed by age for outcomes and risk factors for predefined end points.

Results

Patients ≥ 80 years comprised 32.2% of AF cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary end point (all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction) and secondary end point (including major bleeding) were 3.09 (95% CI, 2.73–3.21) and 2.96 (95% CI, 2.73–3.21) for patients ≥ 80 years, compared with younger patients. Anticoagulation rates were slightly lower in patients ≥ 80 years (67.9% versus 70.5%, P = 0.0070). OAC use, particularly the use of direct OACs, increased over time. Patients ≥ 80 years without OACs had higher HRs for primary (3.48 [95% CI, 3.07–3.94]) and secondary end points (3.23 [95% CI, 2.86–3.64]) compared with those with OACs. Vitamin K antagonist use was linked to higher HR for stroke or major bleeding events (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05–1.50]), rising to 1.64 (95% CI, 1.34–2.01) after excluding reduced direct OAC doses.

Conclusions

Our data highlight patients ≥ 80 years as an important and vulnerable subpopulation of patients with AF, where evidence for optimal OAC therapy remains conflicting.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation: part I. rate and… [^117HqUtY]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in the primary care setting. Approximately 4 percent of persons in the general U. S. population have permanent or intermittent atrial fibrillation, and the prevalence of the arrhythmia increases to 9 percent in persons older than 60 years. 2 Atrial fibrillation can result in serious complications, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolism. Recognition and acute management of atrial fibrillation in the physician's office or emergency department are important in preventing adverse consequences. Diagnosis The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation should be considered in elderly patients who present with complaints of shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. The arrhythmia should also be suspected in patients with acute fatigue or exacerbation of congestive heart failure.

3 In some patients, atrial fibrillation may be identified on the basis of an irregularly irregular pulse or an electrocardiogram obtained for the evaluation of another condition. Cardiac conditions commonly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation include rheumatic mitral valve disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Noncardiac conditions that can predispose patients to develop atrial fibrillation include hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, alcohol intoxication, and surgery.
4. Atrial fibrillation should also be distinguished from atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block, which usually presents with an atrial rate of approximately 150 beats per minute. In this condition, the atrial rate is regular, but conduction to the ventricles is not regular.

The resultant irregularly irregular rhythm may be difficult to differentiate from atrial fibrillation.
3. Because of the risk of complications such as heart failure and embolic stroke, restoration of sinus rhythm is thought to be preferable to allowing atrial fibrillation to continue. However, restoration of sinus rhythm is not always possible. In elderly patients with longstanding atrial fibrillation, repeated attempts at cardioversion may be counterproductive. The chances of reverting to and maintaining sinus rhythm are lower with longer duration of atrial fibrillation and decrease to particularly low levels when atrial fibrillation has been present for more than one year. When cardioversion is inappropriate or unsuccessful, medication should be used for ventricular rate control, and anticoagulation therapy should be considered.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb low-risk and treatment intensification: In patients with AF younger than 60 y without heart disease or risk factors for thromboembolism (lone AF), the risk of thromboembolism is low without treatment and the effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of stroke relative to the risk of bleeding has not been established (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

Thromboembolism — stroke burden and risk in elderly atrial fibrillation (AF) patients are highlighted as follows: Up to 25% of strokes in patients with AF may be due to other sources, and in patients 80 to 89 y old, 36% of strokes occur in those with AF. The annual risk of stroke for octogenarians with AF is in the range of 3% to 8% per year, depending on associated stroke risk factors. Among elderly AF patients, about half have hypertension and approximately 12% harbor carotid artery stenosis, while carotid atherosclerosis is probably a relatively minor contributing epidemiological factor in AF-associated stroke.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — risk thresholds and number needed to treat — shows that patients with a stroke risk of 2% per year or less do not benefit substantially from oral anticoagulation because it would require treating 100 or more patients for 1 y to prevent a single stroke, whereas for high‑risk patients with stroke rates of 6% per year or greater the number needed‑to‑treat is 25 or fewer, strongly favoring anticoagulation; opinion remains divided about routine anticoagulation for patients at intermediate stroke risk (annual rate 3% to 5%).

Atrial fibrillation — bleeding risk assessment highlights that anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding, so patients with AF are generally evaluated for bleeding risk as part of decision-making. Currently used bleeding risk scores — HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, and ATRIA — with listed components such as age ≥ 65 years, older age [≥ 75 years], and elderly age ≥ 75 years, discriminate poorly between patients with and without an increased risk of bleeding and include many nonspecific factors that predict an increased risk of stroke as well as an increased risk of bleeding. Assessment of factors that specifically predict an increased risk of bleeding without predicting an increased risk of stroke is more helpful when balancing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.

### Prevalence of diagnosed atrial fibrillation in adults: national implications for rhythm management and stroke prevention: the anTicoagulation and risk factors in atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) study [^115spxgv]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in elderly persons and a potent risk factor for stroke. However, recent prevalence and projected future numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation are not well described.

Objective

To estimate prevalence of atrial fibrillation and US national projections of the numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation through the year 2050.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Cross-sectional study of adults aged 20 years or older who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in California and who had atrial fibrillation diagnosed between July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997.

Main Outcome Measures

Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the study population of 1.89 million; projected number of persons in the United States with atrial fibrillation between 1995–2050.

Results

A total of 17 974 adults with diagnosed atrial fibrillation were identified during the study period; 45% were aged 75 years or older. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 0.95% (95% confidence interval, 0.94%-0.96%). Atrial fibrillation was more common in men than in women (1.1% vs 0.8%; P < .001). Prevalence increased from 0.1% among adults younger than 55 years to 9.0% in persons aged 80 years or older. Among persons aged 50 years or older, prevalence of atrial fibrillation was higher in whites than in blacks (2.2% vs 1.5%; P < .001). We estimate approximately 2.3 million US adults currently have atrial fibrillation. We project that this will increase to more than 5.6 million (lower bound, 5.0; upper bound, 6.3) by the year 2050, with more than 50% of affected individuals aged 80 years or older.

Conclusions

Our study confirms that atrial fibrillation is common among older adults and provides a contemporary basis for estimates of prevalence in the United States. The number of patients with atrial fibrillation is likely to increase 2.5-fold during the next 50 years, reflecting the growing proportion of elderly individuals. Coordinated efforts are needed to face the increasing challenge of optimal stroke prevention and rhythm management in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Rate versus rhythm control in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^1121mx2i]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with atrial fibrillation involves three main areas: anticoagulation, rate control and rhythm control. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive of each other. Anticoagulation is necessary for patients who are at a high risk of stroke; for example, those who are older than 75 years, or those who have hypertension, severe left ventricular dysfunction, previous cerebrovascular events, or diabetes. It is now clear that patients who are at a high risk of stroke require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin regardless of whether a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy is chosen. One possible exception might be patients who are apparently cured with catheter ablation. Several published trials comparing rate-control and rhythm-control strategies for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation have shown no difference in mortality between these approaches. The patients enrolled in these studies were typically over 65 years of age. Data comparing rate and rhythm strategies in patients who are younger than 60 years of age are limited. For more elderly patients, it seems reasonable to consider rate control as a primary treatment option and to reserve rhythm control for those who do not respond to rate control. For younger patients, we prefer to start with a rhythm-control approach and to reserve rate-control approaches for patients in whom antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation, or both, do not ameliorate the symptoms.

### Integrated care of patients with atrial fibrillation: the 2016 ESC atrial fibrillation guidelines [^116sNzgF]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the evolving epidemics in cardiovascular medicine. AF is projected to develop in 25% of currently 40-year-old adults, provokes many, often severe strokes, is associated with increased mortality and often leads to heart failure or sudden death even in well-anticoagulated patients. The last few years have seen the development of new approaches to detect and treat patients with AF, from ECG screening to surgical procedures to prevent recurrent AF. While these improvements provide tools to improve outcomes and quality of life in affected patients, they often need multidisciplinary input into patient management. It therefore seems timely that the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has issued new AF guidelines in August 2016.

### Management of atrial fibrillation for older people with frailty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V1CNv]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, affecting up to 4.2% of those aged 60–70 years and 17% of those aged 80 years or older [1]. Around one in four hospitalised older people have AF, so management of AF in older people is a commonly encountered clinical challenge. Old age is a risk factor for thromboembolic outcomes of AF, but there is evidence for a risk-treatment paradox whereby older patients who are at highest risk of complications of AF, including stroke, are not more likely to be prescribed oral anticoagulation (OAC) [– 6]. This appears to be related to fear of iatrogenic harm and a lack of confidence in the evidence of benefit in an older population [7, 8].

It is increasingly recognised that frailty is a more useful approach to guide care in older people than chronological age. It is a condition characterised by loss of biological reserves, failure of homeostatic mechanisms and vulnerability to a range of adverse outcomes, and can help guide more individualised treatments with advancing multi-morbidity and polypharmacy. The prevalence of patients with frailty and AF is growing [11], making optimal management an important goal for older people, clinicians, health services and social care.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends using the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score to identify individuals with a high ischaemic stroke risk, and offering OAC to men with a score of 1, and to men or women with a score of 2 or above [15]. However, the studies on which the guidance was based did not explicitly assess frailty. Assessment and modification of bleeding risk factors using the HAS-BLED score is recommended, but there may be additional considerations in a population with frailty such as a higher risk of bleeding and falls [16]. The optimal treatment strategy for people with AF and frailty is therefore unclear, as there is evidence of increased risk of stroke and of treatment related harms. Whilst direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) now provide further therapeutic options, generalisability of trial evidence across the spectrum of older people may be limited as they excluded people anticipated to be in the last one to two years of life and those with several co-morbidities [17–20].

The objective of this review is to synthesise the existing evidence base on the association between frailty, AF and clinical outcomes, with a particular focus on OAC.

### Effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation [^112PjwRr]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Age is a strong and independent risk factor for both stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Oral anticoagulation is associated with a net clinical benefit in elderly patients despite their elevated bleeding risk, and the 2020 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the management of AF recommend non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), without age restrictions.

In the pivotal randomised controlled trials (RCTs) leading to the approval of the NOACs, the median age was just over 70 years and approximately 65% of the patients included were men. In the real world, approximately half of patients with AF starting on oral anticoagulants (OACs) are 75 years or older, and approximately half of these are women. No RCT has investigated the efficacy and safety of NOACs specifically in elderly patients, but subgroup analyses of the RCTs, and observational studies, indicate that the benefits of NOACs over VKAs are maintained in the elderly population. More insight into the comparative abilities of anticoagulants to reduce the risk of stroke while keeping bleeding risk low in elderly patients is needed.

In this study, we aimed to compare the risks of stroke or systemic embolism (SE), and major bleeding, between standard and reduced doses of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and warfarin, in a Norwegian nationwide cohort of patients ≥ 75 years with AF. In Norway, data from all hospital contacts and prescription dispensations are routinely collected through national registries, making it possible to follow individuals over time with virtually no selection bias.

### The patient with atrial fibrillation [^114ootg5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a frequently encountered arrhythmia, particularly affecting the elderly. Patients at significant risk for stroke should be considered for anticoagulation with warfarin. Management of atrial fibrillation revolves around either controlling the ventricular rate response or trying to maintain sinus rhythm with either pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapies. There are many treatment options to consider, based upon the patient's expectations, symptoms, and comorbid conditions. Therefore, the treatment of atrial fibrillation must be individualized.

Atrial fibrillation — age-related considerations and applicability of RACE and AFFIRM data: In a patient with asymptomatic persistent AF, attempts to restore sinus rhythm may not be needed, and prospective studies like RACE and AFFIRM showed that patients who could tolerate rate-controlled AF had outcomes similar to those randomized to rhythm control; however, these studies enrolled predominantly older patients (average 70 y), of whom most had persistent AF and heart disease, and follow-up extended over just a few years, so the trial data do not necessarily apply to younger patients without heart disease or to patients whose dependency upon sinus rhythm is likely to change appreciably over time, and allowing AF to persist for years may make it impossible to restore sinus rhythm for long periods due to electrical and structural remodeling that favor permanent AF.

Screening for AF

ECG screening can help detect asymptomatic AF, allowing timely initiation of therapy, especially oral anticoagulation. This has the potential to prevent complications of AF, especially ischaemic strokes. The ESC guidelines recommend opportunistic ECG screening whenever a person aged 65 years or older is seen by a healthcare professional. In addition, and beyond prior guidelines, systematic ECG monitoring for at least 72 hours is recommended for patients with stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), with a suggestion that even longer ECG monitoring should be considered, especially when a cardioembolic origin of the stroke is suspected. More data are needed to inform the best approach to systematic screening of high-risk population using patient-operated or 'smart' devices, with promising initial results in populations aged 75 and above.

### Atrial fibrillation in the elderly [^116C5e5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is increasingly prevalent among older adults. It causes approximately 24% of strokes in patients aged 80 to 89 years. The management of atrial fibrillation is directed at preventing thromboembolism and controlling the heart rate and rhythm. Stroke prevention is most effectively accomplished through administering anticoagulants such as warfarin, although older patients have higher hemorrhagic risk. Cognitive dysfunction, functional impairments, and increased fall risk further complicate warfarin management in elderly patients. The use of risk stratification schemes can help guide the anticoagulation decision, although the benefits of warfarin generally outweigh the risks in most older patients with atrial fibrillation. Pharmacologic rate control has been shown to result in similar outcomes compared with pharmacologic restoration of sinus rhythm and should be the initial therapy for elderly patients. Anti-arrhythmic medications should be selected based on an individual patient's coexisting medical conditions. In symptomatic patients who fail pharmacologic therapy, invasive strategies such as AV nodal ablation may help improve quality of life and symptoms, although such strategies do not obviate the need for antithrombotic therapy.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^111EJt5F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As the population ages, atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence increases, but data on optimal oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients ≥ 80years remain limited. This study tested whether direct OACs offer comparable benefits to vitamin K antagonists in patients ≥ 80years with AF presenting to the emergency department.

Methods

This single-center retrospective all-comer study used data from the Heidelberg Registry of Atrial Fibrillation, including patients with AF presenting to the emergency department of the University Hospital of Heidelberg from June 2009 until March 2020. Data were analyzed by age for outcomes and risk factors for predefined end points.

Results

Patients ≥ 80years comprised 32.2% of AF cases. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary end point (all-cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction) and secondary end point (including major bleeding) were 3.09 (95% CI, 2.73–3.21) and 2.96 (95% CI, 2.73–3.21) for patients ≥ 80years, compared with younger patients. Anticoagulation rates were slightly lower in patients ≥ 80years (67.9% versus 70.5%, P = 0.0070). OAC use, particularly the use of direct OACs, increased over time. Patients ≥ 80years without OACs had higher HRs for primary (3.48 [95% CI, 3.07–3.94]) and secondary end points (3.23 [95% CI, 2.86–3.64]) compared with those with OACs. Vitamin K antagonist use was linked to higher HR for stroke or major bleeding events (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05–1.50]), rising to 1.64 (95% CI, 1.34–2.01) after excluding reduced direct OAC doses.

Conclusions

Our data highlight patients ≥ 80years as an important and vulnerable subpopulation of patients with AF, where evidence for optimal OAC therapy remains conflicting.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — mechanisms, efficacy, and practical considerations for rate control: The main determinants of ventricular rate during AF are the intrinsic conduction characteristics and refractoriness of the AV node and autonomic tone, and drugs that prolong the AV nodal refractory period are generally effective. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions designed to achieve rate control in AF has been about 80% in clinical trials. There is no evidence that pharmacological rate control has any adverse influence on LV function, but bradycardia and heart block may occur, particularly in patients with paroxysmal AF, especially the elderly. When rapid control is required or oral administration is not feasible, medication may be administered intravenously; otherwise, in hemodynamically stable patients with a rapid ventricular response, negative chronotropic medication may be administered orally. Combinations may be necessary to achieve rate control in both acute and chronic situations, some patients may require permanent pacing for symptomatic bradycardia, and nonpharmacological therapy should be considered when pharmacological measures fail.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in elderly adults [^117Aj7oq]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Driven in large part by the aging of the population and the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), there is a burgeoning epidemic of AF in elderly adults. Although there is a large body of literature to guide management of people with AF, elderly adults with AF are frequently underrepresented in clinical trials. This review provides a contemporary update on management of elderly adults with AF with a particular focus on the two main clinical challenges that AF poses: stroke risk reduction and control of symptoms. The evidence to support novel AF treatment strategies in elderly adults is reviewed, including novel oral anticoagulants and left atrial appendage closure for stroke risk reduction and catheter ablation for control of symptoms.

Clinical Perspective

Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and manifests in diverse prevalence rates, spanning from 0.1% in individuals younger than 55 years to 17.7% in octogenarians. Notably, the population aged 80 years and older is predicted to triple by 2050, signifying a rapid increase compared with patients with AF > 65 years. AF, often asymptomatic, harbors substantial risks, elevating the likelihood of stroke, heart failure, renal failure, cognitive decline, and all‐cause mortality. Its onset and severity strongly correlate with age and comorbidities, significantly augmenting stroke risk by 5‐fold. With advancing age, its prevalence escalates steadily, reaching 10% to 17% beyond 80 years. Conversely age emerges as a pivotal risk factor for AF, established through extensive studies alongside with arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease. An age‐associated rise in stroke risk is seen across sexes and spiking beyond 65 and 80 to 89 years, where AF emerges as a predominant contributor to stroke incidence. Moreover, age is considered a crucial factor in determining CHA 2 DS 2 VASc and HASBLED scores, indicative for increased thromboembolic and bleeding risks, respectively. Despite the efficacy and safety advantages for stroke prevention of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in nonvalvular AF, their utility in octogenarians remains unclear due to their underrepresentation in pivotal trials. There is an ongoing debate whether DOACs may not offer as many advantages in older patients compared with VKAs, which warrants careful evaluation. Given the potential differences in outcomes between these anticoagulation strategies in older populations, our study aims to test the hypothesis that DOACs do not provide as much benefit as VKA antagonists in patients aged 80 years and older. Thus, the objectives of this study are (1) to offer a comprehensive overview of prevalence, outcomes, and risk factors in patients ≥ 80 years presenting in the setting of an emergency department (ED); and (2) to evaluate the use of VKA versus DOAC treatment regimens, while specifically investigating whether DOACs are less beneficial compared with VKAs in this high‐risk older population.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — implications of the rhythm-control versus rate-control trials: Theoretically, rhythm control should have advantages over rate control, yet a trend toward lower mortality was observed in the rate-control arm of the AFFIRM study and did not differ in the other trials from the outcome with the rhythm-control strategy. The RACE and AFFIRM trials did not address AF in younger, symptomatic patients with little underlying heart disease, in whom restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion antiarrhythmic drugs or nonpharmacological interventions still must be considered a useful therapeutic approach. One may conclude from these studies that rate control is a reasonable strategy in elderly patients with minimal symptoms related to AF, and an effective method for maintaining sinus rhythm with fewer side effects would address a presently unmet need.

Atrial fibrillation — thromboembolic mechanisms and stroke risk highlight inflammatory activation, local left atrial coagulation, hemodynamic factors, age, and ventricular dysfunction. C-reactive protein is increased and correlates with stroke risk factors, and in rheumatic mitral stenosis coagulation markers (including prothrombin fragment F1.2) are increased in the left atrium versus the right atrium and femoral vein, indicating regional activation. Contrary to the concept that systemic anticoagulation for 4 wk organizes left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has verified resolution of thrombus in the majority of patients. Hypertension in AF is associated with reduced LAA flow velocity, spontaneous echo contrast (SEC), and thrombus formation, and aging in AF is associated with left atrial enlargement, reduced LAA flow velocity, and SEC, with prothrombin activation fragment F1.2 increasing with age. In the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation studies, age combined with other risk factors places women over age 75 y with AF at particular risk for cardioembolic strokes. LV systolic dysfunction predicts ischemic stroke in AF patients who receive no antithrombotic therapy but not in moderate-risk patients given aspirin.

### Review of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients… [^115mchEj]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age and is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular death, congestive heart failure and stroke in older patients. Aronow reviews current approaches to management of atrial fibrillation in patients more than 60 years of age. Atrial fibrillation may be discovered incidentally after a stroke or an episode of congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema. When present, symptoms may include palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, cough, fatigue or syncope. Diagnostic testing should include 12-lead electrocardiography with a one-minute rhythm strip, echocardiography and, possibly, 24-hour ambulatory ECG. Noncardiac causes of atrial fibrillation should be investigated as well, so thyroid function tests should also be ordered. Underlying causes of atrial fibrillation should be treated, including infection, congestive heart failure, hypoxia, hypokalemia and pneumonia.

Patients with atrial fibrillation should be advised to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these precipitate and exacerbate the problem. Propranolol in a dose of 1 mg should be given over five minutes, followed by 0. 5 mg per minute, up to
0. 1 mg per kg. After the ventricular rate is slowed, the oral forms of these medications should be started. Elective direct-current cardioversion is indicated in some patients. For a list of favorable and unfavorable conditions, see the accompanying table about elective cardioversion. Use of class I antiarrhythmic drugs after cardioversion does not seem to maintain sinus rhythm. Therefore, anticoagulant therapy and an agent to control ventricular rate, if needed, are advisable in older patients with atrial fibrillation.

Beta blockers are useful in these cases as they act to control ventricular arrhythmias; thus, if atrial fibrillation recurs after conversion to sinus rhythm, the beta blocker will help slow the ventricular rate.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in older adults [^114oYAkM]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Most people with atrial fibrillation are older adults, in whom atrial fibrillation co-occurs with other chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and geriatric syndromes such as frailty. Yet most randomized controlled trials and expert guidelines use an age agnostic approach. Given the heterogeneity of aging, these data may not be universally applicable across the spectrum of older adults. This review synthesizes the available evidence and applies rigorous principles of aging science. After contextualizing the burden of comorbidities and geriatric syndromes in people with atrial fibrillation, it applies an aging focused approach to the pillars of atrial fibrillation management, describing screening for atrial fibrillation, lifestyle interventions, symptoms and complications, rate and rhythm control, coexisting heart failure, anticoagulation therapy, and left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Throughout, a framework is suggested that prioritizes patients' goals and applies existing evidence to all older adults, whether atrial fibrillation is their sole condition, one among many, or a bystander at the end of life.

### Outcomes and disease management in patients with atrial fibrillation ≥ 80 Years: data from a consecutive 11-year real-world registry [^115ZrL64]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Third, our study observed no significant differences in the predefined outcome parameters between VKA and DOAC strategies among patients aged ≥ 80 years, prompting reconsideration of the optimal OAC approach in this subgroup. Although DOAC therapy showed favorable HR profile for stroke and major bleeding events, evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of DOAC regimens in older patients with AF remains limited. The percentage of patients ≥ 75 years included in randomized clinical trials is substantially limited, ranging from 31% in ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation)to 44% in ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation). Most evidence is derived from subgroup analyses or meta‐analyses from representative randomized clinical trials. However, it is noteworthy that older patients included in randomized clinical trials tend to exhibit relatively better health profiles, fewer comorbidities, and improved physical function compared with older adults in the general population. Thus, comparing our trial in the setting of an ED with these previous studies poses challenges due to the limited representation of frail older patients in the 4 pivotal DOAC trials. These patients were often excluded because of high anticipated bleeding risks or were overlooked by physicians, leading to underrepresentation of older patients with AF in current clinical trials. Moreover, prior analyses primarily assessed frailty through comorbidities and polypharmacy, overlooking broader aspects inherent in the clinical syndrome. Our findings additionally indicate that among patients aged ≥ 80 years, both apixaban (HR, 0.67; P < 0.001) and rivaroxaban (HR, 0.54; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a lower hazard of the primary composite end point compared with patients without an oral anticoagulation. However, the direct comparison between apixaban and rivaroxaban did not show a statistically significant difference (P = 0.155), suggesting that both DOACs provide similar protective effects in this age group. This reinforces the evidence that DOACs are effective alternatives to no anticoagulation in older patients with AF, despite the known frailty and comorbid conditions that characterize this population. However, the lack of significant differences between DOAC and VKA strategies in our study suggests that specific characteristics of the older population, such as increased frailty, multiple comorbidities, and polypharmacy, may limit the relative benefit of DOACs over VKAs in this age group. These factors can influence both the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of DOACs, potentially reducing their effectiveness compared with VKAs. This highlights the need for a more personalized anticoagulation approach in patients aged ≥ 80 years, taking into consideration individual bleeding risks and overall health status.

Aim

The "2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 12, 2022, to November 3, 2022, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.

Structure

Atrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" and the "2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.

### Management of atrial fibrillation in patients 75 years and older: JACC State-of-the-art Review [^116umpYr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing as the population ages. AF treatment-related complications also increase markedly in older adults (defined as ≥ 75 years of age for this review). The older AF population has a high risk of stroke, bleeding, and death. Syncope and fall-related injuries are the most common reasons for nonprescription of oral anticoagulation (OAC), and are more common in older adults when OACs are used with antiarrhythmic drugs. Digoxin may be useful for rate control, but associations with increased mortality limit its use. Beyond rate and rhythm control considerations, stroke prophylaxis is critical to AF management, and the benefits of direct OACs, compared with warfarin, extend to older adults. Invasive procedures such as AF catheter ablation, pacemaker implantation/atrioventricular junction ablation, and left atrial appendage occlusion may be useful in appropriately selected cases. However, older adults have generally been under-represented in clinical trials.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological management of recurrent persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation is organized by symptoms and rhythm strategy. Minimal or no symptoms are managed with anticoagulation and rate control as needed, while disabling symptoms in AF proceed from anticoagulation and rate control to electrical cardioversion as needed, followed by continuation of anticoagulation as needed and therapy to maintain sinus rhythm; consider ablation for severely symptomatic recurrent AF after failure of greater than or equal to 1 AAD plus rate control. For permanent AF, anticoagulation and rate control as needed are used. Initiate drug therapy before cardioversion to reduce the likelihood of early recurrence of AF, and AAD indicates antiarrhythmic drug.

### Impact of advanced age on management and prognosis in atrial fibrillation: insights from a population-based study in general practice [^112BhYKd]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

to examine the use of antithrombotic therapy and predictors of stroke and death in very elderly (≥ 85 years) atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in a general practice cohort from the UK.

Design

retrospective, observational cohort study; 12-month follow-up period.

Setting

eleven general practices serving the town of Darlington, England representing a population of 105,000 patients.

Patients

two thousand two hundred and fifty-nine patients with a history of AF, 561 (24.8%) aged ≥ 85 years.

Main Outcome Measures

use of antithrombotic therapy by age group and predictors of stroke and death.

Results

five hundred and sixty-one (24.8%) AF patients aged ≥ 85 years (mean (SD) age 89 (4) years; 66% female) identified with a mean CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.6 (SD 1.4). Thirty-six per cent received oral anticoagulation (OAC) compared with 57% in the 75–84 years age group. Forty-nine per cent of the very elderly received antiplatelet (AP) monotherapy; recorded OAC contraindications and declines were greatest among those aged ≥ 85 years. Stroke risk was highest among the very elderly (5.2% per annum), despite anticoagulation (3.9%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated an increased risk of stroke with AP monotherapy (odds ratio (OR) 2.45, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.05–5.70) and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with OAC therapy (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36–0.99).

Conclusion

the majority of very elderly AF patients in general practice do not receive OAC despite their higher stroke risk; almost half received AP monotherapy. AP use independently increased the risk of stroke, signifying that effective stroke prevention requires OAC regardless of age, except where true contraindications exist.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Management overview — Management of patients with AF involves 3 objectives — rate control, prevention of thromboembolism, and correction of the rhythm disturbance, and these are not mutually exclusive. The initial management decision involves primarily a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy; under the rate-control strategy, the ventricular rate is controlled with no commitment to restore or maintain sinus rhythm, while the rhythm-control strategy attempts restoration and/or maintenance of sinus rhythm and also requires attention to rate control. Depending on the patient's course, the strategy initially chosen may prove unsuccessful and the alternate strategy is then adopted.
