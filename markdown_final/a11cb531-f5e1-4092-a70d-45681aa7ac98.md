## Question

what type culture for oral thrush

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what type of culture should be obtained for oral thrush (oropharyngeal candidiasis). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether a culture is actually indicated in a typical oral thrush case. Then, I should verify the best specimen type and collection technique if culture is needed. Next, I will consider transport media and pre-analytic handling. After that, I should review the appropriate culture media and methods, including chromogenic agar and identification systems. Finally, I will check special situations like refractory disease, mixed infections, or non-albicans species, and confirm species-level identification practices to guide therapy, anchoring to high-quality guidelines and laboratory standards for credibility.

> Let me first confirm when a culture is warranted. In immunocompetent patients with classic pseudomembranous oral thrush, the diagnosis is primarily clinical. Laboratory confirmation with microscopy (KOH or Calcofluor white) is usually sufficient, and culture is not routinely required for initial management, so I should avoid over-ordering it in straightforward cases [^114XfMx3]. Wait, let me verify exceptions: culture becomes important if the presentation is atypical, if there is treatment failure or recurrence, if the patient is immunocompromised, or if species identification and susceptibility could change management, particularly with concerns for non-albicans Candida or antifungal resistance [^114mW2Ad] [^112z1b2x] [^116PoHw5].

> I will now examine the specimen type. A swab of the lesion is the practical specimen for oropharyngeal candidiasis; hold on, I should verify that we're not overthinking this — yes, swabbing the visible plaques or involved mucosa is appropriate and supported in guidance for mucocutaneous candidiasis diagnostics and oral thrush management reviews, and in head-and-neck infection testing principles where lesion-directed sampling is emphasized [^115FvEtk] [^114XfMx3]. Let me double-check that this aligns with dermatology guidance as well; reviews of oral candidiasis similarly endorse lesion swabs for culture when needed, reinforcing the approach here [^115FvEtk].

> Next, I should review collection technique. Gentle scraping of the white curd-like plaques with a tongue depressor or swab, and sampling the underlying erythematous mucosa, improves yield. I need to ensure we are collecting from multiple involved sites if disease is diffuse. This approach mirrors clinical descriptions of thrush plaques being readily scraped and is consistent with best practices for lesion-directed sampling in the oral cavity [^112Kp3av] [^115FvEtk].

> Hold on, I should verify transport conditions. If the swab cannot be processed promptly, it should be placed in appropriate transport medium (such as Stuart's or Amies medium) to preserve viability, and then transported to the laboratory as soon as possible; this is a general microbiology specimen stewardship principle and aligns with guidance on swab handling for head and neck infections, which emphasize timely transport and appropriate media to avoid drying and overgrowth of contaminants [^1138nQav].

> Now, I need to check the culture media and methods. Routine fungal culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) is acceptable for recovery of Candida, but chromogenic agar can expedite presumptive species identification by colony color and help detect mixed species, which is particularly useful when non-albicans Candida are suspected or in complex hosts. I should confirm that contemporary guidelines endorse chromogenic media for this purpose, and yes, they do [^1116QKFu] [^115yr5Je] [^114qACBY]. Let me consider identification next. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) provides rapid, accurate species-level identification from culture isolates and is recommended when available, with biochemical panels or automated systems as alternatives when MALDI-TOF is not accessible [^114wQKYD] [^114qACBY].

> But wait, what if I need faster or more sensitive detection than culture alone? I should review molecular options. Multiplex PCR assays on oral rinse or swab specimens can detect and speciate Candida directly, including mixed infections, and may outperform conventional phenotypic methods in some settings; however, availability varies and this is often reserved for refractory cases or research contexts rather than routine care in immunocompetent patients [^114Cz6CS]. Hold on, I should verify that this complements, not replaces, culture when susceptibility testing is needed; yes, culture remains essential for antifungal susceptibility when management is failing or species-level data will alter therapy [^notfound].

> I should confirm species-level identification practices. When treatment is being considered, obtaining identification to the species level is recommended to guide therapy, detect outbreaks, and support surveillance; this is particularly important because non-albicans species like C. glabrata or C. krusei have different fluconazole susceptibility profiles and may require alternative agents, and emerging species such as C. auris necessitate heightened vigilance and accurate identification workflows [^112z1b2x] [^116PoHw5]. Let me reconsider whether this applies to oral thrush; even in mucocutaneous disease, species-level data can inform management in refractory or high-risk patients, so the principle holds when culture is pursued [^112z1b2x].

> Next, I should review special situations. In immunocompromised hosts, in refractory or recurrent disease, or when there is concern for esophageal involvement, culture with species identification and, if needed, susceptibility testing is more strongly indicated. In parallel, direct microscopy remains valuable to rapidly confirm yeast and hyphae while culture is pending, and endoscopic evaluation is warranted for esophageal symptoms or persistent dysphagia/odynophagia despite therapy [^114mW2Ad] [^114XfMx3]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated invasive candidiasis guidance with mucocutaneous disease; I should clarify that while the species-level identification principle is consistent, the specimen type and urgency differ — here we are discussing a lesion swab for oral thrush, not blood or sterile-site cultures as in invasive disease [^114mW2Ad] [^112z1b2x].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final recommendation is precise. For oral thrush, obtain a lesion swab for fungal culture when the diagnosis is uncertain, when the patient is immunocompromised or has refractory/recurrent disease, or when species identification could change management; transport promptly in appropriate medium, culture on SDA with consideration of chromogenic agar for faster speciation, and identify isolates to species using MALDI-TOF or equivalent methods, reserving PCR for select scenarios where rapid speciation is needed and available [^114XfMx3] [^112z1b2x] [^1116QKFu] [^115yr5Je] [^114wQKYD] [^114Cz6CS].

For oral thrush, the recommended culture is a **swab of the oral lesions** [^115FvEtk] on Sabouraud dextrose agar or a chromogenic medium [^115yr5Je] to isolate and identify Candida species. If antifungal resistance is suspected or the patient is immunocompromised, request **antifungal susceptibility testing** [^notfound]. For infants, collect a **sterile oral swab** [^1116QKFu] and culture on Sabouraud agar with germ tube testing to confirm C. albicans. Routine culture is not required for typical cases but is indicated for atypical, severe, recurrent, or immunocompromised patients [^114XfMx3].

---

## Specimen collection methods

- **Swab of oral lesions**: Use a sterile cotton swab to collect material from the white, curd-like lesions [^115FvEtk] on the tongue, buccal mucosa, palate, or oropharynx. This is the standard method for collecting samples for culture in oral thrush [^115FvEtk].

- **Infant sampling**: In infants, a sterile cotton swab is used to collect oral samples [^1116QKFu] for culture and confirmation of Candida albicans.

- **Oral rinse method**: In research settings, oral rinse solutions have been used to collect samples for PCR-based identification of Candida species [^114Cz6CS].

---

## Culture media and identification methods

- **Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA)**: This is the standard medium for culturing Candida species. It supports the growth of Candida and allows for colonial morphology assessment [^1116QKFu].

- **Chromogenic agar**: Chromogenic media, such as CHROMagar Candida, allow for presumptive identification of Candida species based on colony color [^115yr5Je]. This method is particularly useful for detecting mixed infections and differentiating Candida albicans from other species.

- **Germ tube test**: This rapid test distinguishes Candida albicans from other Candida species by demonstrating the formation of germ tubes within 2–3 hours of incubation [^114Cz6CS].

- **Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)**: This modern method provides rapid and accurate identification of Candida species from culture isolates [^114wQKYD].

---

## Clinical indications for culture

Routine culture is **not required** for typical oral thrush cases [^114XfMx3]; however, culture is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Atypical presentation**: Unusual clinical features or lesions that do not respond to standard antifungal therapy.

- **Severe or recurrent infections**: Persistent or recurrent thrush, especially in immunocompromised patients [^notfound].

- **Suspected antifungal resistance**: Patients with a history of prolonged antifungal therapy or recurrent infections.

- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV-positive individuals, transplant recipients, or patients undergoing chemotherapy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of culture results

Culture results provide **species-level identification** of Candida, which is essential for guiding appropriate antifungal therapy [^112z1b2x]. Identification of non-albicans species, such as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei, may necessitate alternative antifungal agents due to differing susceptibility profiles [^112Kp3av]. Antifungal susceptibility testing can be performed on cultured isolates to guide therapy, particularly in cases of refractory or recurrent infections [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Time-consuming**: Culture results typically require 24–48 hours, which may delay definitive diagnosis and treatment initiation [^notfound].

- **Contamination risk**: Oral swabs may be contaminated with normal oral flora, potentially leading to false-positive results [^1164EPRW].

- **Limited sensitivity**: Culture may fail to detect low-level colonization or mixed infections, particularly if sampling is inadequate [^115yr5Je].

- **Clinical correlation required**: Culture results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, as colonization does not always equate to infection [^114tsrBc].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

- **Direct microscopy**: Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation allows for rapid identification of Candida yeast cells and pseudohyphae [^117WHEPy].

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: PCR-based methods offer rapid and accurate identification of Candida species, including detection of mixed infections [^114Cz6CS].

- **MALDI-TOF MS**: Rapid identification of Candida species from culture isolates, providing results within hours [^114wQKYD].

### Simultaneous Candida albicans and herpes simplex virus type 2 esophagitis in a renal transplant recipient [^114B1dfq]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Opportunistic infections in immunocompromised renal transplant patients are a fearful complication. The incidence is high in the first 6 months due to intense immunosuppression and transplant centres give prophylaxis against common infections during this period. Infectious esophagitis is among such opportunistic infections. Infectious esophagitis can present with symptoms including discomfort and difficulty in swallowing, pain while swallowing and retrosternal chest pain. Patients may have a prodrome of fever, malaise and nausea. The symptoms based on a previous reviews include dysphagia for both solids and liquids (37.5%), odynophagia (60.7%), chest pain (46.4%) heartburn, and/or vomiting.

Candida is the most common cause of fungal infection of oral mucosa and oesophagus in immunosuppressed patients. Candida albicans or candida tropicalis are the commonly involved species.50%–75% of patients with esophageal candidiasis have oropharyngeal candidiasis. Oropharyngeal candidiasis most commonly presents in a pseudomembranous form with white plaques on the oropharynx, tongue, palate and buccal mucosa. The presence of oral thrush may be helpful in the diagnosis of fungal esophagitis; however, the absence of oral involvement does not exclude esophageal candidiasis. Diagnosis is usually made using endoscopy. Endoscopic evidence of candida lesions may include superficial erosions, ulcers and white plaques that can be severe, resulting in necrosis and perforation. Histopathological examination of biopsies shows the presence of yeast and pseudohyphae with invasion of mucosal cells and the culture of the biopsy specimen grows candida. The treatment includes a course of oral fluconazole. Itraconazole can also be used; however, it has more drug interactions than fluconazole. Intravenous antifungal therapy may be required in patients with severe disease and in those who cannot take oral medications. Other azoles, such as posaconazole and voriconazole are preferred in refractory cases. Interaction of azole antifungals with calcineurin inhibitors should be kept in mind while treating renal transplant patients with azoles. Echinocandins and amphotericin B can be used for azole refractive cases. If symptoms do not improve within 3 to 4 days, co-infection by a different agent should be strongly suspected.

### Oral candidiasis [^116UFFxD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common fungal disease encountered in dermatology, most commonly caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans in the mouth. Although thrush is a well-recognized presentation of OC, it behooves clinicians to be aware of the many other presentations of this disease and how to accurately diagnose and manage these cases. The clinical presentations of OC can be broadly classified as white or erythematous candidiasis, with various subtypes in each category. The treatments include appropriate oral hygiene, topical agents, and systemic medications. This review focuses on the various clinical presentations of OC and treatment options.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^111Nz9tQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

Selection Criteria

~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Destructive genital and oral ulcers in rural patients [^112ZPi7q]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Histopathologic examination, a highly sensitive method of diagnosing PCM, demonstrated the presence of a chronic, ulcerated, suppurative, granulomatous, inflammatory process, and multiple budding structures typical of Paracoccidioides spp. better seen in Grocott silver staining, in both cases. Which of the following is the best option for a rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of PCM in endemic countries?
A. Direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide preparations
B. Culture
C. Serology
D. Intradermal reaction
E. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Answers:
A. Direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide preparations – Correct. The visualization of fungal elements typical of Paracoccidioides spp. is effective for PCM diagnosis, and direct microscopy allows a low-cost and rapid fungal identification.
B. Culture – Incorrect. Culture is effective, but it is often not available in rural settings. Paracoccidioides spp. usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to grow, and, as a dimorphic fungus, morphological conversion is necessary for diagnostic confirmation. A rapid method is important for an early diagnosis.
C. Serology – Incorrect. Serological methods for antibody detection are cost-effective and play an important role in PCM diagnosis and treatment follow-up. Immunodiffusion is currently the main method employed. However, sensitivity varies from 65% to 100%, negative results can occur in 21% of acute forms and 7.3% of the chronic forms, and it is not widely available in rural settings.
D. Intradermal reaction – Incorrect. Intradermal application of paracoccidioidin antigens detects PCM infection. It is often used in epidemiological surveys but not for diagnosis of the disease due to its low specificity.
E. PCR – Incorrect. Primers and probes have already been designed and standardized for molecular diagnosis of Paracoccidioides spp. and the use of PCR will be of great value for early diagnosis. However, it is currently not cost-effective and is yet to be validated for routine clinical use.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GtDpx]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody. However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g. those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

### Persistent and refractory thrush with unknown cause [^113TKk4g]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Oral thrush is considered as the opportunistic infection, which is caused by fungus Candida albicans. Various kinds of immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and invasive surgical procedures such as solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, lead to increased susceptibility to fungal infections, but persistent and refractory thrush, with typical clinical signs of oral fungal infection and without any other sign of immunodeficiencies, has not been reported so far. We describe a case of persistent and refractory thrush with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) as the unusual cause.

### Avian influenza virus A (H5N1), detected through routine surveillance, in child, Bangladesh [^115YiVQJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Examination showed that the child had a fever, a mildly elevated respiratory rate, and a clear nasal discharge (Table). He showed no evidence of respiratory distress, and the lungs sounded clear. Oral thrush was noted. The child weighed 8.7 kg (78th percentile for age). Blood for bacterial culture and viral serologic testing and a nasopharyngeal wash sample were collected according to accepted routine. A chest radiograph showed scattered bilateral alveolar infiltrates. Because of the duration of his fever, he received a diagnosis of suspected typhoid fever, which is endemic to this community, and was given oral amoxicillin and nystatin for oral thrush.

At a follow-up visit to the clinic on January 31, the patient was afebrile; he was in no distress and had a lower respiratory rate (36 breaths/min). His lungs sounded clear. The patient again visited the clinic on February 5 and February 10 and was afebrile on both occasions with a mildly elevated respiratory rate (38 breaths/min) and clear lungs. The mother reported that the child had had loose stools (possibly associated with amoxicillin) on February 10, but she denied that he had diarrhea. The child was never hospitalized; he completed a 14-day course of amoxicillin for suspected enteric fever and recovered fully. His blood culture was negative for any organism, and his final diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. On February 13, a convalescent-phase serum sample was collected as part of routine surveillance.

### The impact of maternal antibiotic consumption on the development of oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants: a quasi-experimental study [^1116QKFu]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Oral thrush is a common yeast infection caused by Candida albicans in infants during their first few weeks or months. Infant mothers' antibiotics consumption can contribute to this opportunistic fungal growth due to their weaker immune systems. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between maternal antibiotic consumption and oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants, this study aims to provide insights for health care professionals regarding antibiotic prescriptions and preventive strategies for managing oral thrush. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with a control group was used. Eighty-two breastfeeding infants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 40) infants of antibiotic-consuming mothers and Group 2 (n = 42) infants of nonantibiotic-consuming mothers. The oral samples were collected using sterile cotton swabs and cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar C. albicans, confirmed by simple staining and a germ tube test. Results: Infants aged 1–11 months with a mean ± standard deviation of 4.8 ± 3.51. Within all 82 oral swabs, 42.7% were positive for C. albicans growth and 57.3% were negative. The highest percentage was in 1-month-old infants (n = 9, 25.71%), and the lowest was in 11 months old (n = 2, 5.71%). Group 2 infants had significantly fewer positive C. albicans growth (n = 12, 28.57%) compared with group 1 (n = 23; 57.5%) (χ² = 7.0, p = 0.007; odds ratio = 3.332, 95% confidence interval = 1.35–8.46). Oral thrush clinical signs were identified in 66.6% and 33.4% of group 1 and 2 infants, respectively, while 31.4% of C. albicans- positive colonization showed no clinical manifestations. Conclusion: Maternal antibiotic consumption for more than 1 week is associated with the occurrence of oral thrush in breastfeeding infants. Differences in clinical signs in two groups of infants indicate the importance of laboratory tests for early oral thrush diagnosis. This can help health care professionals understand oral thrush causes, enable early detection, improve treatment, and enhance appropriate antibiotic use in breastfeeding mothers.

### Fluconazole is more effective for treating thrush in infants… [^112eLRT8]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Oral candidiasis commonly occurs in healthy infants. Nystatin oral suspension is the usual treatment, but cure rates as low as 54 percent have been confirmed in clinical studies. Fluconazole, from the imidazole class of antifungals, has been found effective in treating thrush in immunocompromised children, but studies among otherwise healthy children have not been done. Goins and associates compared fluconazole and nystatin suspensions for treatment of thrush in infants using a prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial. On day 3, at the end of therapy, and on day 28, patients were reexamined and follow-up cultures were performed. A clinical cure was considered the absence of any oral plaque at the end of therapy. A microbiologic cure was considered a negative fungal culture also obtained at this time.

Clinical recurrence was defined as oral plaques confirmed to be fungal by microscopic examination on day 28. Six of the 21 infants receiving nystatin were clinically cured after 10 days of treatment compared with all of the 15 infants receiving fluconazole for seven days. Microbiologic cure occurred in one of the 18 infants in the nystatin group who were cultured at the end of therapy compared with 11 of the 15 patients in the fluconazole group. Recurrence rates could not be evaluated in the nystatin group because 15 of the 21 patients who failed nystatin therapy were switched to fluconazole. There were no complications of therapy in either group. The authors conclude that administration of oral fluconazole, resulting in a high drug concentration in the oral mucosa and saliva, is significantly more effective than conventional nystatin suspension in the treatment of oral candidiasis in otherwise healthy infants.

There were no adverse events noted with fluconazole use. Problems with the use of fluconazole include cost and the possibility of developing fluconazole-resistant strains of. Candida albicans. Larger studies are needed to look at the cost efficiency of fluconazole treatment of thrush in infants.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114XfMx3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — diagnosis: Oropharyngeal candidiasis is usually diagnosed clinically based on the characteristic appearance of lesions, and unlike oral hairy leukoplakia the white plaques can be scraped off the mucosa. If laboratory confirmation is required, scrapings can be examined microscopically for characteristic yeast or hyphal forms using a potassium hydroxide preparation, and cultures of clinical exudative material yield the species of Candida present.

~bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Exploring cultural determinants to be integrated into preterm infant care in the neonatal intensive care unit: an integrative literature review [^1122NijB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Combining treatment practices

Combined treatment practices may refer to the utilisation of traditional medical practices and western medical practices. Combining treatment practices in this review are the concurrent use of traditional and western medications to treat preterm infants.

Concurrent use of traditional and western medication

Evidence supports integrating cultural practices into modern treatments when caring for preterm infants. Two studies done in Uganda and the United State indicated that parents were incorporating cultural treatment practices into western medicine depending on the type and nature of the condition of the infant, as an example, some Lumbee parents in the United States would offer over-the-counter drugs for conditions such as fever, but the same parents would take their infant to their aunt to wash off the oral thrush with pieces of fatback and salt, which were effective. Similarly, the Ugandan parents used chlorhexidine, which was better at dealing with foul umbilical cord smell than alternatives; however, the belief was that the use of kyogero, an herbal mixture, hastened umbilical cord separation. Finally, in studies conducted in Canada and India, parents indicated they would seek and implement medical treatment for their infant regardless of their beliefs in and use of home remedies.

### Fungal lesions of the oral mucosa diagnosis and management [^1146qv5n]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral fungal infections are opportunistic and due to impaired host resistance. The increasing number of immunosuppressed individuals contributes to rising numbers of mycoses worldwide, and the ease of global migration has allowed the geographic range of endemic mycoses to expand. Deep fungal infections can clinically mimic other pathologic conditions including malignancy. This review highlights the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations of eight fungal infections that can be encountered in the dental setting.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children — candidiasis diagnosis: Oral candidiasis can be diagnosed with a potassium hydroxide preparation and culture with microscopic demonstration of budding yeast cells in wet mounts or biopsy specimens. Esophageal candidiasis has a classic cobblestone appearance on barium swallow, and endoscopy findings may range from a few, small, raised, white plaques to elevated confluent plaques with hyperemia and extensive ulceration; endoscopy is also helpful for ruling out HSV, CMV, and Mycobacterium avium complex. Candidemia is best diagnosed with blood cultures using lysis-centrifugation techniques or automated broth-based systems, and when candidemia is present, retinal examination for endophthalmitis, cardiac echocardiogram for endocarditis, abdominal computed tomography or ultrasound for hepatic or renal involvement, and bone scans for osteomyelitis should be considered. New diagnostic techniques such as urine D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol ratio, serum D-arabinitol/creatinine ratio, Candida mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibody, (1,3)-beta-D-glucan assay, T2 biosystems for Candida, and real-time polymerase chain reaction are promising diagnostic alternatives under development for early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, but none have been validated or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children. There are no pediatric data to guide when to perform additional diagnostic testing for deep-seated foci, but among children with persistent candidemia, further investigation for dissemination should strongly be considered, and additional diagnostics can include an echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the kidney, liver and spleen, a lumbar puncture and an eye exam (strong, low).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114mW2Ad]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mucosal candidiasis diagnosis — adults and adolescents with HIV: Esophageal candidiasis should be suspected in people with low CD4 count who have substernal chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, especially if oral thrush is present, and the diagnosis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy; definitive diagnosis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal culture and speciation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is usually diagnosed by clinical presentation with demonstration of characteristic blastosphere and hyphal yeast forms in vaginal secretions on potassium hydroxide preparation; culture confirmation is rarely required but may provide supportive information, and self-diagnosis of vulvovaginitis is unreliable, with microscopic and culture confirmation required to avoid unnecessary exposure to treatment and to assess for other potential pathogens including sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Kp3av]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — clinical manifestations: Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, gums, oropharynx, or tongue surface, and lesions can often be scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. A proportion of people with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement; clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in people with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; it can be asymptomatic, endoscopy reveals whitish plaques similar to oropharyngeal disease, and plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In people with HIV, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity with sporadic recurrences, is less common in people with HIV, and when it occurs is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species; in those with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently.

### Acute oral ulcers [^116BNiLi]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

In general, a detailed history and examination of the patient provides sufficient information for diagnosis. The pattern, frequency, and natural history of ulcer episodes are helpful. The presence or absence of associated features and the site of oral involvement guides most physicians accurately in the diagnosis. Additional investigations, including blood tests, and occasionally the use of oral cultures or biopsy, are needed to make a definitive diagnosis. A multispecialty approach is often necessary to evaluate patients with other systemic features. Most acute oral ulcers heal spontaneously without specific therapy being necessary, but an understanding of the cause of the ulcer is reassuring to the patient and guides the clinician in management to prevent recurrent episodes of oral ulceration, or chronicity of ulcers.

### Comparison and correlation of candidal colonization in diabetic patients and normal individuals [^117P2vFW]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Fungi are eukaryotic ubiquitous micro organisms involved in degradation of organic materials. More than 100,000 fungal species were recognized out of that only 150 are pathogenic in nature. In the oral cavity, most frequently isolated species of fungus is Candida albicans, a harmless commensal organism.

Candida is a dimorphic yeast-like fungus, which can occur in both yeast and hyphae form. It is larger than bacteria and smaller than epithelial cells. It is measuring 5–50 μm (length) and 2–5 μm (diameter) in hyphae form and 5–25 μm (diameter) in yeast form. Candida replicates asexually by budding yeast form, pseudohyphae form and branching mycelial form. Pseudohyphae form is considered as an invasive phase of Candida.

Candida is a normal commensal of oral mucosa and it can colonize the buccal mucosa, dorsum of the tongue and in denture prosthesis. It can as well adhere to the oral bacteria and pellicle of dental plaque.

Although it is a commensal, it tends to form mild colonization in 20–40% of healthy individuals. In immunocompromised disorders, Candida becomes pathogenic; forms moderate to severe colonization and causes oral candidiasis. Oral candidiasis seen more frequently in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics and it can be diagnosed from their classical clinical features. However, moderate to severe candidal colonization can occur without any clinical manifestation.

This type of subclinical candidal colonization can make the individual more prone to develop further colonization in other mucosal areas, GIT mucosal region and can also disseminate into the blood circulation.

To identify the candidal colonization in diabetic patients, culture methods are available, but these are time consuming. To screen a mass of diabetic patients, we need a simple chair side technique. Oral exfoliative cytology is a very simple, time conserving, effective technique to assess the candidal colonization at the light microscopic level.

### A patient with painful oral ulcers [^116WVzne]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Tissue fungal culture was negative. Which is the best step in management for this patient?
A. Urine for antigen detection
B. Peripheral blood smear
C. Molecular-based polymerase chain reaction assay from tissue
D. Blood culture for fungus
E. Excision

Answers:
A. Urine for antigen detection – Incorrect. The sensitivity of Histoplasma capsulatum antigen detection in urine is 92%. A false negative result is presented in granulomatous patients. The sensitivity of penicilliosis is 94.6% to 100% with some false positive results. Urine antigen detection is sensitive in disseminated patients but may be negative in primary cutaneous infection.
B. Peripheral blood smear – Incorrect. In routine peripheral blood smear will sometimes show yeast-like organisms in neutrophils in especially disseminated patients and may not be detected in granulomatous group.
C. Molecular-based polymerase chain reaction assay from tissue – Correct. The molecular-based method is more rapid, has high sensitivity, and is accurate in diagnosis. The sensitivity of the test is 93.6%to detect fungus in fresh tissue.
D. Blood culture for fungus – Incorrect. The culture will be detected up to 6 weeks after specimen collection. In severe forms of histoplasmosis including disseminated type or pulmonary involvement will have the greatest yield for culture positivity. In milder form will usually remain negative.
E. Excision – Incorrect. There is no evidence of the benefit of surgery in histoplasmosis because histoplasmosis can be cured with medication.

### Analysis of clinical, immunological and molecular features of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I in Egyptian children [^112cL64w]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) represents a rare group of inherited inborn errors of immunity (IEI) characterized by bacterial infections, delayed umbilical stump separation, and autoimmunity. This single-center study aimed at describing the clinical, immunological, and molecular characterizations of 34 LAD-I Egyptian pediatric patients.

Methods

Details of 34 patients' personal medical history, clinical and laboratory findings were recorded; Genetic material from 28 patients was studied. Mutational analysis was done by Sanger sequencing.

Results

Omphalitis, skin and soft tissue infections with poorly healing ulcers, delayed falling of the umbilical stump, and recurrent or un-resolving pneumonia were the most common presentations, followed by chronic otitis media, enteropathy, periodontitis; and recurrent oral thrush. Persistent leukocytosis and neutrophilia were reported in all patients, as well as CD18 and CD11b deficiency. CD18 expression was < 2% in around 90% of patients. Sixteen different pathological gene variants were detected in 28 patients who underwent ITGß2 gene sequencing, of those, ten were novel and six were previously reported. Three families received a prenatal diagnosis. Patients were on antimicrobials according to culture's results whenever available, and on prophylactic Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg once daily, with regular clinical follow up. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was offered for 4 patients. However due to severity of the disease and delay in diagnosis, 58% of the patients passed away in the first 2 years of life.

Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and distribution of ITGß2 gene mutation in Egyptian children. Further molecular studies, however, remain a challenging necessity for better disease characterization in the region.

### Rapid identification of Candida species in oral rinse solutions by PCR [^114Cz6CS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of a multiplex PCR assay for the contemporary identification of major species involved in oral candidiasis, without extraction and purification of DNA from the samples under investigation; and evaluation of this method in comparison with routine phenotypic culture identification.

Methods

78 oral rinse solutions were collected. The concentrated oral rinse technique was used for a quantitative and qualitative study. Research and identification of Candida spp, with routine phenotypic culture identification (germ-tube test in serum at 37 degrees C for 3 hours and sugar assimilation strip analysis), were performed. Each sample was analysed with multiplex PCR directly on oral rinse solution. Samples giving discrepant results between routine phenotypic and PCR identification methods were resubcultured on CHROMagar Candida plates. The fungus-specific primers ITS1, ITS2, CA3, and CA4 were used. For the identification of other species (C kefyr, C famata and C dubliniensis), ITS1F, ITS1K, and ITS2D primers were designed.

Results

Multiplex PCR correctly identified all samples, including those with single species, or with mixed species, negative samples and positive samples which appeared to be negative from routine phenotypic methods.

Conclusion

This multiplex PCR assay provides a rapid alternative to the conventional culture based technique for the identification and speciation of the most frequently isolated Candida species. The absence of an extraction method made identification of 10 species possible in a few hours.

### Comparison and correlation of candidal colonization in diabetic patients and normal individuals [^115WZoZ3]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Oral cavity harbours various normal microbial flora among these Candida is a harmless commensal organism present in 20 to 40% of healthy individuals. Candida is an opportunistic yeast-like fungus among these Candida albicans is the most common species causing oral candidiasis. Several local and systemic factors of diabetes mellitus can predispose oral candidiasis.

Oral lesions are prevalent among diabetics and out of these lesions; oral candidiasis is the most common which can be diagnosed by their differential patterns of mucosal changes like erythematous, pseudomembranous and curd like plaques. However, in diabetic group, Candida albicans colonization can occur even in the absence of any clinical lesion.

Candidal colonization can be confirmed by culture methods which are very time consuming on the other hand oral exfoliative cytology is a very easy and effective chair side method.

The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of candidal colonization in diabetics.

### Systemic fungal infections in donors for corneal transplantation [^111RgVvU]. Cornea (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the prevalence of postkeratoplasty fungal infection when corneal tissue from donors with a recent medical history of oral thrush or respiratory, urine, wound, sputum, bronchial, tracheal, or throat culture positive for fungus is identified before recovery and after decontamination of the corneal tissue with 5% povidone-iodine flush to the donors' eyes during recovery.

Methods

This is a prospective analysis of corneas from 42 donors with a documented medical history of fungus or positive fungal culture, which were recovered between January 2010 and November 2010. Standard aseptic swab of the donors' corneas before and after application of 5% povidone-iodine solution was performed. Culture results were analyzed in relationship to the donors' medical history and potential posttransplantation infections.

Results

Eighty-four eyes from 42 patients were swabbed for cultures during the study period. Seven eyes (8.3%) were positive for fungal growth before treatment with 5% povidone-iodine, whereas there were no positive fungal cultures after treatment (P = 0.007). Fifty-four corneas from this study group were used for corneal transplantation. There were no cases of fungal infection in any postkeratoplasty eyes transplanted from this study group.

Conclusions

In this small study, the overall prevalence of fungal infections after corneal transplantation using corneal donor tissue from donors with a fungal-positive medical history is low. Corneal fungal contamination in donors with a history of fungal infection or a positive fungal culture can be significantly reduced with a 5% povidone-iodine flush.

### Reducing oral contamination during corneal scrapes [^111CtdSt]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Corneal tissue sampling for microscopy and culture is the gold standard for identifying the causative organisms in microbial keratitis. Accurate diagnosis is needed as visual loss can occur rapidly and significant morbidity is associated with chronic disease. Further, a diversity of species has been implicated. Corneal sampling, however, does not always yield reliable results; the reported culture positivity rate ranges from 25% to 78%, and false positives and negatives occur. Improved diagnosis of keratitis is needed because it is a significant and increasing cause of visual loss worldwide; it was estimated that over 1.5 million people worldwide developed corneal ulceration annually and its prevalence is rising with the increased use of contact lenses.

The reliability of corneal sampling may be compromised by contamination of the specimen. This can reduce the diagnostic value of the scrape resulting in delayed or inappropriate therapy. Methods to reduce contamination during corneal scraping have not been investigated. Recently, a simple experimental study identified that the use of surgical face masks significantly decreased the dispersion of bacteria that can contaminate the surgical field during intravitreal injections, leading to its widespread adoption to decrease contamination risk. Currently, masks are not routinely worn for corneal scraping.

Because of the lack of evidence on the role of face masks in reducing contamination of the collected samples in microbial keratitis, we performed a prospective experimental study. In this study, ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees re-enacted the corneal scraping procedure with and without a face mask. The purpose was to examine the effect of wearing a face mask on bacterial microbiota counts cultured on agar plates during an experimental corneal scrape procedure.

### Comparative clinical evaluation of the isoAmp® HSV assay with ELVIS® HSV culture / ID / typing test system for the detection of herpes simplex virus in genital and oral lesions [^115jcy2D]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The novel IsoAmp(®) HSV Assay employs isothermal helicase-dependent nucleic acid amplification and a user-friendly disposable test device to achieve rapid (< 1.5h), on-demand qualitative detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 in oral and genital lesions.

Objectives

To compare performance of the IsoAmp(®) HSV Assay with the ELVIS(®) HSV ID/typing (shell-vial culture and DFA) test system for clinical specimens collected from oral and genital lesions in symptomatic patients.

Study Design

A total of 994 specimens from male and female genital and oral lesions were obtained and evaluated at five study sites in the United States. Results from the IsoAmp(®) HSV Assay were compared to those from the ELVIS(®) system. Separate reproducibility studies were performed at 3 sites using a blinded and randomized study panel. Discrepant specimens were resolved by bidirectional sequencing analysis.

Results

After discrepant analysis, overall agreement of IsoAmp(®) with ELVIS(®) was 98.8% with 37.0% overall prevalence (all study sites). Reproducibility rates were well within expectations.

Conclusion

The IsoAmp(®) HSV Assay showed excellent performance for clinical use for detection of HSV in genital and oral specimens. In contrast to ELVIS(®), IsoAmp(®) HSV offers excellent sensitivity plus rapid on-demand testing and simpler specimen preparation.

### A DNA methylation signature from buccal swabs to identify tuberculosis infection [^112K8JBf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), was one of the most fatal infectious diseases worldwide in 2022. Mtb is spread via aerosol when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. The immunological events following exposure are heterologous and range from clearance of the bacteria with innate or adaptive immune responses, to latent infection or subclinical or clinical TB. There are several challenges with diagnosing both latent and active TB, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the End TB Strategy and issued a global priority in research for new diagnostic tools. The current diagnostic methods for latent TB infection include the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), both of which have several limitations. TST and IGRA are based on circulating adaptive immune memory but cannot distinguish between a latent, active, or eliminated infection. Diagnosis of active TB requires detection of Mtb in sputum through microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid amplification tests. The most contagious patients can be detected by smear microscopy, but the time to diagnosis with culture can take up to 6 weeks. In addition, diagnosis based on sputum is of limited use in children and in cases of extrapulmonary TB, which is common in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The laboratory handling of sputum samples used for culture and microscopy requires experienced personnel and laboratory facilities with high biosafety level. There is an urgent need for a diagnostic method that is resource-effective to enable rapid diagnosis in TB-endemic countries. Epigenetic signatures have become recognized as new promising tools for the diagnosis of different diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disease (reviewed in). Transcriptomic signatures from whole blood have been widely studied and diagnostic signatures for TB proposed. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whole blood, and lung immune cells have also been shown to distinguish both active and latent TB. The buccal mucosa is a part of the mucosal immunity and the first line of defense in respiratory infections. Humoral immune responses against Mtb have previously been described in saliva of TB patients. During active TB, the bacteria can be present in the oral cavity and oral TB infection can develop from a pulmonary infection. Several studies have investigated the possibility to diagnose TB by detection of Mtb DNA from mouth swab samples, but the sensitivity varies largely between studies. In this study, we aimed to investigate if TB infection and exposure could be reflected in the DNA methylome of buccal cells. We investigated the DNAm patterns using Illumina EPIC Array and identified differently methylated CpG sites (DMCs) between the patients and controls. Using a validation cohort of samples collected in Peru and Kenya, we confirmed DNAm changes in the buccal mucosa of patients with TB compared to controls. The results showed cross-continental DNAm differences in buccal swabs from TB patients and controls. We further used machine learning to identify a panel of 7 CpG sites with TB case/control discriminative potential.

Head and neck soft tissue infections — specimen selection and transport emphasize avoiding swabs, using tissue/fluid/aspirate, and ensuring appropriate transport, with special handling for epiglottitis and suspected anaerobes. Key points state, "A swab is not the specimen of choice for these infections because of the small volumes collected and ease of contamination with heavily colonized surfaces. Submit tissue, fluid, or aspirate when possible. This may require surgery with or without imaging guidance". They add, "Resist swabbing in cases of epiglottitis", "Use anaerobic transport containers if anaerobes are suspected. This includes most specimens", and "Keep tissue specimens moist during transport". Additional guidance notes, "Blood cultures, including aerobic and anaerobic media, are the preferred sample for the diagnosis of epiglottitis", that "If swabbing of the epiglottis is attempted, it should be in a setting with available appropriate emergency response", that "Swabbing is susceptible to contamination by adjacent bacterial microbiota, although swabbing for mumps virus NAAT testing is the preferred sample", and that when anaerobic pathogens are suspected "anaerobic transport is required".

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^116cnDP5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

- the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

PRECAUTIONS

General

Nystatin cream should not be used for the treatment of systemic, oral, intravaginal or ophthalmic infections.

If irritation or sensitization develops, treatment should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken as indicated. It is recommended that KOH smears, cultures, or other diagnostic methods be used to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous candidiasis and to rule out infection caused by other pathogens.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^116PoHw5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

### Symptoms of the oral cavity and their association with local microbiological and clinical findings – a prospective survey in palliative care [^114tsrBc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical and microbiological findings

Clinical inspection revealed mainly unremarkable age-adjusted findings (DMF-T ranging from 7.5 on average in the age group 30–40 years, and 24.8 in the age group 80 years and older; Table 4).

Table 4
Age-adjusted prevalence of caries and dental hygiene

Plaques not resembling Candida /thrush were the most prevalent finding on clinical examination (Table 2). An abnormal bacterial spectrum, defined as quantitative alterations of otherwise physiologically colonizing bacteria of the oral cavity and/or evidence of non-physiological bacteria, was found in 34 patients. In 10 patients, two distinct species were prominent; 1 patient showed a cluster of three pathogens (Enterobacter cloacae / Pseudomonas putida / Klebsiella oxytoca). Four mouth swabs revealed multiresistant bacteria (×3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA; ×1 vancomycin-resistant enterococci, VRE).

Yeasts were found in mouth swabs of 70 patients, as compared to 37 subjects of the control group (healthy working population, Table 5). In 10 patients, two different Candida spp. were isolated (Table 6). HSV DNA was detected by PCR in 19 patients, with mean low to moderate titers.

Table 6
Presence of two Candida spp. in 10 palliative care patients

The microbiological finding of Candida spp. was not always related to the clinical finding of overt thrush (from 72 patients with yeasts, 28 patients also showed thrush on mucosa), but in 52 of 72 (61.1%) and 21 of 72 (29.1%), respectively, of patients with yeasts, no thrush or even other types of plaques could be found. Patients showing plaques resembling thrush (defined as white, patchy pseudomembraneous plaques on erythematous ground) had a microbiological confirmation of Candida spp. in 20 of 23 (86.9%, tongue) or 28 of 32 (87.5%, mucosa) of cases, respectively. Plaques that did not show these clinical characteristics were still associated with yeasts in microbiological culture in 74.1% (60 of 81, tongue) or 80.9% (51 of 63, mucosa) of cases. Other possible specifications of oral candidiasis like hyperplastic type, erythematous type or angular cheilitis were not differentiated further.

### A pregnant woman with thymoma-associated pure red cell aplasia [^113AP3Tz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The patient required transfusion of a total of 3,360 mL of red blood cells (RBCs; 560 mL each at 32, 33, 34, 38, 40 weeks' gestation) during pregnancy. She gave birth to a healthy female baby at 40 weeks' gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery without any maternal complications. The birth weight was 2,548 g, and the Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min were 8 and 9, respectively. However, diffuse erythematous macular rash was observed over the whole body of the baby, with thrush in her mouth noted just after birth. The skin lesion was suspected to be congenital cutaneous candidiasis, a diagnosis that was confirmed by a thrush culture. The placental pathological findings suggested subclinical candida infection in utero, since Candida funisitis was cultured from distinctive pale-yellow plaque on the placenta and umbilical cord (Supplement Fig. 2). The baby's skin lesion recovered with topical anti-fungal cream treatment.

In the postpartum period, chest computed tomography showed that the thymoma had not increased in size, and the patient did not present with any symptoms associated with mass effects of thymoma. The maternal anemia did not improve, and the patient ultimately required another 2,800 mL of RBC after delivery before the operation was performed. Thymectomy was performed at 5 months postpartum, and 300 mg per day of oral cyclosporine A was initiated as induction therapy for PRCA. The histopathological classification revealed that the organotypic thymic epithelial neoplasm predominantly showed a cortical thymic epithelial appearance (WHO type B1). Microscopic tumor invasion was observed beyond the capsule, but no gross invasion of the thymus or surrounding adipose tissue was observed. Accordingly, the patient was diagnosed with Masaoka stage II-a thymoma (Fig. 2).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

### Inhaler technique: facts and fantasies. A view from the aerosol drug management improvement team (ADMIT) [^115dpWEq]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

4. Rinsing of the mouth after using an inhaler is clinically beneficial

Patients are often advised to 'rinse and spit' or gargle after using an inhaler device, particularly one containing corticosteroid. Intuitively, this might be expected to decrease local oropharyngeal adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids, especially oral candidiasis (thrush), although not dysphonia because the procedure cannot possibly irrigate the larynx.

A meta-analysis of 23 studiesshowed a fivefold prevalence of oral candidiasis in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids with a pMDI device and a threefold increase in those using DPIs, although there is wide variation between studies both in prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms and the correlation of these with the ability to culture yeasts from throat swabs. A large questionnaire study of almost 900 patients suggested a significant, threefold reduction of subjective oral symptoms by mouth washing after using inhalers, but curiously this was observed only in females using DPIs (and not pMDIs).

Two studies, showed that mouth washing after using inhalers reduced the amount of residual drug remaining in the oropharynx, but the possible clinical consequences of this observation were not assessed. A further study suggested that 'throat washing' reduced colonisation of the oropharynx with Candida species in patients inhaling fluticasone propionate using a dry powder inhaler. Yokoyama et al. showed that different types of mouth rinsing may be important, with rinsing and gargling more effective than rinsing alone for removing oropharyngeal fluticasone propionate deposited after using a DPI. An additional potential benefit of mouth rinsing after inhaling corticosteroids might be reduced deposition in the gut and thus reduced systemic exposure. This is most likely to be relevant for beclomethasone dipropionate, which has some oral bioavailability, but unlikely to be relevant with other commonly used inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone propionate and budesonide, as their oral bioavailability is so low. There do not appear to be any specific studies on the effects of mouth rinsing on systemic absorption of any inhaled corticosteroid.

### Comparison of adverse events associated with different spacers used with non-extrafine beclometasone dipropionate for asthma [^112jTTV7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation that has a substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare resources. National and international guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first-line therapy for treatment of asthma. ICS treatment has proven to be efficient at improving lung function, decreasing airway hyperresponsiveness, reducing symptoms, frequency, and severity of exacerbations, and improving patient quality of life. – Despite their proven efficacy, ICS can cause both oropharyngeal and systemic adverse events. –

Oropharyngeal adverse events associated with ICS use include oral candidiasis (oral thrush), hoarseness, dysphonia, pharyngitis, and cough reflex. – Oral thrush is a well-documented adverse event associated with regular use of ICS in patients with asthma. Approximately 5–10% of patients prescribed ICS reported adverse events in the oral cavity and pharynx, with the occurrence of clinically significant oropharyngeal candidiasis as high as 10% in adults, and between 1 and 3% in children. The reduction of the local immune response, or growth stimulation of Candida albicans through an increase in salivary glucose, are believed to be responsible for the development of candidiasis. Multiple factors have been reported to contribute to the incidence of oral thrush in patients with asthma, including the type and dose of ICS prescribed, the delivery device used, and patient adherence to medication instructions. – This relationship between risk of oral thrush and the type, dose, and delivery device of ICS has also been observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) patients.

The use of spacers with pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs)and careful mouth rinsing after using dry powder inhalers can reduce the risk of oral thrush. Spacers are recommended by asthma treatment guidelines for patients under the age of 16 years, for those who have problems coordinating actuation, for those prescribed high-dose ICS, for those at risk of suffering from local side effects, and for elderly patients. The addition of a spacer to a pMDI has proven to consistently reduce aerosol velocity and particle size in the aerosol plume, thus reducing the amount of prescribed therapy deposited in the oropharyngeal cavity and increasing the amount of active compound that reaches the lung. – Previous studies have suggested that spacers used with non-extrafine (non-EF) particle ICS may result in reduced rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis.

### Characterization of a new clinical yeast species, Candida tunisiensis sp. nov., isolated from a strain collection from Tunisian hospitals [^112V18eJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

From a collection of yeast isolates isolated from patients in Tunisian hospitals between September 2006 and July 2010, the yeast strain JEY63 (CBS 12513), isolated from a 50-year-old male that suffered from oral thrush, could not be identified to the species level using conventional methods used in clinical laboratories. These methods include matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), germ tube formation, and the use of CHROMagar Candida and metabolic galleries. Sequence analysis of the nuclear rRNA (18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and 26S rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) indicated that the ribosomal DNA sequences of this species were not yet reported. Multiple gene phylogenic analyses suggested that this isolate clustered at the base of the Dipodascaceae (Saccharomycetales, Saccharomycetes, and Ascomycota). JEY63 was named Candida tunisiensis sp. nov. according to several phenotypic criteria and its geographical origin. C. tunisiensis was able to grow at 42°C and does not form chlamydospores and hyphae but could grow as yeast and pseudohyphal forms. C. tunisiensis exhibited most probably a haploid genome with an estimated size of 10 Mb on at least three chromosomes. Using European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) Candida albicans susceptibility breakpoints as a reference, C. tunisiensis was resistant to fluconazole (MIC = 8 μg/ml), voriconazole (MIC = 0.5 μg/ml), itraconazole (MIC = 16 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (MIC = 4 μg/ml) but still susceptible to posaconazole (MIC = 0.008 μg/ml) and caspofungin (MIC = 0.5 μg/ml). In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS permitted the early selection of an unusual isolate, which was still unreported in molecular databases but could not be unambiguously classified based on phylogenetic approaches.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116tJK8m]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis — children with and exposed to HIV: Oral candidiasis can be diagnosed with a potassium hydroxide preparation and culture with microscopic demonstration of budding yeast cells in wet mounts or biopsy specimens; esophageal candidiasis has a classic cobblestone appearance on barium swallow, and endoscopy findings may range from a few, small, raised, white plaques to elevated confluent plaques with hyperemia and extensive ulceration, also helping rule out HSV, CMV, and Mycobacterium avium complex. Candidemia is best diagnosed with blood cultures using lysis-centrifugation techniques or automated broth-based systems, and when candidemia is present, retinal examination, echocardiogram, abdominal computed tomography or ultrasound, and bone scans should be considered. New techniques including the urine D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol ratio, serum D-arabinitol/creatinine ratio, Candida mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibody, (1,3)-beta-D-glucan assay, T2 biosystems for Candida, and real-time polymerase chain reaction are described as promising, but none have been validated or Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for use in children. Among children with persistent candidemia, further investigation for dissemination should strongly be considered and may include an echocardiogram, abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the kidney, liver and spleen, a lumbar puncture and an eye exam (strong, low).

A diagnosis based only on medical history and physical examination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all persons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be evaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers includes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination from lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT or culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing for type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is prevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should be performed.

No FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available in the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs are available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital specimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their own syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification studies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for HSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes (see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with immunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers that are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV testing should be performed on all persons not known to have HIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers (see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). NAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for cases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g. oral manifestations of syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs have not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, they can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory requirements for an off-label procedure.

Table 24 — laboratory diagnosis of pharyngitis summarizes etiologic agents, diagnostic procedures, specimens, and transport conditions. For Streptococcus pyogenes, rapid direct antigen test (followed by a secondary test if negative), direct nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), and nucleic acid probe tests use dual pharyngeal or pharyngeal swab, with transport using a swab transport device at room temperature (RT), < 2 h; for NAAT, stability is as specified by the lab/manufacturer and specific swabs/transport media may be required for each different NAAT in some cases. For Groups C and G beta-hemolytic streptococci, throat culture and antigen tests on isolates use a pharyngeal swab with swab transport device, RT, < 2 h. Corynebacterium diphtheriae testing (methylene blue stain and culture) uses a pseudomembrane specimen with sterile container, RT, < 2 h. Fusobacterium necrophorum requires anaerobic incubation and a pharyngeal swab in anaerobic swab transport, RT, < 2 h. Viral examples include EBV Monospot test using 5 mL serum in a clot tube, RT, < 2 h or refrigerated < 24 h, and HSV direct antigen detection from a swab of pharyngeal lesion with swab transport device, RT, < 2 h. Screening for sexually transmitted infection pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis uses direct NAAT on a pharyngeal swab with transport stability as specified by the lab/manufacturer; specific swabs/transport media may be required for each different NAAT in some cases.

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

COVID-19 molecular and antigen testing — acute diagnosis and test performance are outlined as follows: Following exposure to the virus, the incubation period is 3–5 days, and molecular tests detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal, anterior nares, or mid‑turbinate swabs; saliva samples have also been used. Viral culture should not be utilized for routine diagnosis because it requires biosafety level 3 practices. Molecular testing should only be performed for diagnosis of acute infection. In symptomatic patients, antigen tests have demonstrated a sensitivity of 70%–80%, whereas in the asymptomatic population sensitivity has ranged from 40% to 50%. A positive antigen test during the first week of symptoms is generally diagnostic for COVID‑19, but a negative result should be confirmed by a molecular test. Antigen tests are likely to be positive when high viral amounts are present, yet SARS‑CoV‑2 has been cultured in some cases where antigen testing was negative.

### Diagnosing invasive candidiasis [^116p33NP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Cultures are negative in ∼50% of invasive candidiasis. Data are emerging for the performance of nonculture tests such as mannan/antimannan, Candida albicans germ tube antibody, 1,3-β-d-glucan, PCR, and the T2Candida panel in diagnosing both candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis. In most settings, positive predictive values of nonculture test are low, and negative predictive values are high. For tests to be useful, clinicians must understand the pretest likelihood of invasive candidiasis and test performance for the most common disease manifestation in a given patient. This paper reviews nonculture Candida diagnostics and discusses how they might be used effectively in patient care.

### Candida infections of the mouth, throat, and esophagus… [^111vt5UN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Candida infections of the mouth, throat, and esophagus About Candidiasis is an infection caused by a yeast called Candida. Candida normally lives on the skin and inside the body, in places such as the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina, without causing any problems. 1 Sometimes, Candida can multiply and cause an infection if the environment inside the mouth, throat, or esophagus changes in a way that encourages fungal growth. Candidiasis in the mouth and throat is also called thrush or oropharyngeal candidiasis. Candidiasis in the esophagus is called esophageal candidiasis or Candida esophagitis. Esophageal candidiasis is one of the most common infections in people living with HIV/AIDS.
2. Risk and Prevention Who gets candidiasis in the mouth or throat. Candidiasis in the mouth, throat, or esophagus is uncommon in healthy adults.

People who are at higher risk for getting candidiasis in the mouth and throat include babies, especially those younger than 1 month of age, and people with at least one of these factors: 3–7
- Wear dentures
- Have diabetes
- Have cancer
- Have HIV/AIDS
- Take antibiotics or corticosteroids, including inhaled corticosteroids for conditions like asthma
- Take medications that cause dry mouth or have medical conditions that cause dry mouth
- Smoke Most people who get candidiasis in the esophagus have weakened immune systems, meaning that their bodies don't fight infections well. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS and people who have blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. People who get candidiasis in the esophagus often also have candidiasis in the mouth and throat. Sources Candida normally lives in the mouth, throat, and the rest of the digestive tract without causing any problems.

Sometimes, Candida can multiply and cause an infection if the environment inside the mouth, throat, or esophagus changes in a way that encourages its growth. This can happen when:

- a person's immune system becomes weakened,
- if antibiotics affect the natural balance of microbes in the body,
- or for a variety of other reasons in other groups of people. Treatment Candidiasis in the mouth, throat, or esophagus is usually treated with antifungal medicine.

### Shaping the oral mycobiota: interactions of opportunistic fungi with oral bacteria and the host [^112qb1gT]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

The oral mycobiota is an important component of the oral microbiota that has only recently received increased attention. The diversity and complexity of the oral mycobiota in healthy humans is greater than any other body site. Dysbiotic imbalance of indigenous fungal communities in immunosuppressed hosts has been proposed to lead to oropharyngeal fungal infections. As in other body sites, to survive and thrive in the oral cavity fungi have to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with the resident bacterial microbiota and the host. Here we review our current understanding of the composition of the oral mycobiota and how it may be influenced by oral commensal bacteria and the host environment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) diagnosis is typically clinical for oropharyngeal disease based on the characteristic appearance of lesions, and in contrast to oral hairy leukoplakia, the white plaques can be scraped off the mucosa. If laboratory confirmation is required, scrapings can be examined microscopically for characteristic yeast or hyphal forms using a potassium hydroxide preparation, and cultures of clinical exudate material yield the species of Candida present. The diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy or visualization of lesions plus fungal smear or brushings without histopathologic examination, while definitive diagnosis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal culture.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I² > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I² 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Symptoms of the oral cavity and their association with local microbiological and clinical findings – a prospective survey in palliative care [^114TbVEk]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

A number of aspects concerning the clinical relevance of several microbiological findings remain under further debate

In four patients, multiresistant bacteria like MRSA or VRE were diagnosed incidentally. This sheds light on hygiene standards or isolation policies, not seldomly conflicting palliative care priorities.

The "clusters of pathogens", multiple quantitative and qualitative bacterial alterations found in 11 patients focus on the aspects of bacterial colonisation versus infection, and deserve further consideration. The findings on yeasts and thrush give a first glimpse on the interdependency of microbiological and clinical findings and subjective relevance. Conclusions concerning changes over time, like the likelihood for progression from a subclinical, microbiologically confirmed yeast colonisation to overt thrush, require further longitudinal study.

Ten patients had two Candida spp. and the relevance of antifungal (especially azoles) drug resistance may be highlighted by this finding, even if antifungal resistance testing was not performed.

The microbiological criteria of an abnormal bacterial spectrum that was found in 34 patients and showed to be comparable to control group persons with respect to prevalence and leading pathogens need to be discussed. Also, anaerobic bacteria were not routinely screened due to technical colonisation reasons, and the microbiological findings that served as control group were not collected for this purpose.

Furthermore, the survey faces limitations with respect to missing details about grading of symptoms and signs, about previously taken antibiotics or antimycotics, food intake on the day of clinical examination and mouth swab/mouth wash, respectively.

There are only a few preceding investigations on palliative care patients that also focus on oral symptoms (e.g.) or the prevalence of oral infections/colonisations (e.g.). In these studies, the symptom burden has been found to be up to 77% (dry mouth), and the prevalence of microbiologically proven candidiasis was found to be 26%. A recent survey from Norway showed symptom prevalences and clinical findings similar to our patient cohort, except from the much higher prevalence of oral pain that might be attributed to anticancer treatment-related mucositis.

In these studies, it was not intended to detect possible associations between subjective local symptoms and clinical or microbiological findings, though. In order to extend therapeutic options in oral palliative care, the preceding and present study contribute to a better understanding of a comprehensive therapeutic approach.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate test to determine further management?
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing
C. Fungal culture
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures
E. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy
Answers:
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM – Incorrect. Serologic antibody titers to HSV-1 IgM may indicate a recent infection but are not as clinically useful as HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction or culture in establishing an active infection or treatment resistance.
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing – Correct. The patient had multiple positive HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction results, which established the diagnosis of herpes labialis but failed to respond to therapeutic doses of valacyclovir for 1 week. To assess for antiviral resistance, HSV isolates must be obtained by tissue viral culture. Viral culture and sensitivity testing were done, which found acyclovir resistance and prompted reconsideration of treatment.
C. Fungal culture – Incorrect. Fungal cultures may be used to diagnose other infectious causes of oral mucosal lesions and should be considered in immunosuppressed patients before administration of antimicrobial agents. Our patient had a positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis; therefore, fungal cultures would not help guide further management.
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures – Incorrect. Given the patient's positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis, bacterial cultures would not help guide further management.
E. DIF microscopy – Incorrect. DIF microscopy is useful in the evaluation of mucocutaneous immunobullous disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, and PNP. These conditions present with desquamative gingivitis, painful ulcerations of the gingiva, buccal and lingual mucosa, or severe stomatitis in the case of PNP.

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^1157SL71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. Invasive candidiasis Invasive candidiasis is much more severe than other types of candidiasis so it requires more intensive treatment. Invasive candidiasis typically occurs among people who are already sick.

Healthcare providers decide which type of antifungal medication, the dose, and length of treatment based on:

- Patient age
- Health conditions and immune status
- Location and severity of infection. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations. For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis.

### Oral candidiasis in a specialist palliative care unit: assessment, diagnosis, management [^114KZ7wL]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

We examined practices about assessment, diagnosis and management of oral candidiasis in a palliative care patient population. Prescribing practices were compared against therapeutic guidelinesand national AMS standards.

A statistically significant improvement in documented rates of physical examination showed during the audit cycle, but no improvement in documentation of oral symptoms. The educational intervention emphasised examination technique, differential diagnoses and microbiological testing for confirming or excluding oral candidiasis. Future educational interventions may benefit from highlighting history features. Assessment and intervention may occur but not be recorded, so repeating this audit cycle may further improve compliance with standards and improve practice.

Eleven per cent of patients in both cohorts were diagnosed with oral candidiasis, considerably less than the reported prevalence of > 30%. This suggests underdiagnosis and treatment. Alternatively, the rate of oral candidiasis may have been accurate. Statistically significant improvement in rates of microbiological testing to support clinical diagnosis showed during the audit cycle. No guideline exists for testing in this context; however, the ACSQHC AMS Clinical Care Standard encourages clinicians to 'obtain appropriate samples for microbiology testing when clinically indicated and before starting antimicrobial therapy whenever possible'. Microscopy, with or without culture tests, is widely available and relatively inexpensive. Judicious testing to improve sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnosis may enable patients to avoid unnecessary and burdensome treatment, as happened with the three patients with negative swabs in this audit.

The Study

Our patient was a 67-year-old woman with known high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma since 1993 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia since 2003. She had received multiple courses of chemotherapy, including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, pentostatin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone, and alemtuzumab. During 2004 through 2008, she had multiple hospitalizations with neutropenic complications. Her chemotherapy regimen was switched to bendamustine and cyclophosphamide in January 2009 because of persistent neutropenia.

In February 2009, the patient was hospitalized with fever and abdominal pain. No clear infectious etiology could be ascertained despite an extensive workup; she was treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole without any improvement. At the end of the antimicrobial drug course, she noticed 2 painful white lesions on her tongue and also had fever and chills. The lesions consisted of two 1.0- × 1.5-cm nodules on the anterior aspect of the tongue. These were initially treated as oral thrush with fluconazole without resolution. At the same time, the patient experienced a relapse of herpes zoster that was treated with valacyclovir.

In April 2009, biopsy samples of the lesions were obtained. Results of the initial histopathology report were consistent with an inflamed granulation type tissue with collections of epithelioid histiocytes resembling naked-type granulomatous changes. Numerous intracellular microorganisms were seen in the myocytes. Culture for bacteria and fungi was negative and culture for microsporidia was not attempted. Serologic test results for Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi were also negative.

Paraffin-fixed tissue and slides were sent to the laboratories of the Parasitic Diseases Branch and the Infectious Disease Pathology Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA. Detailed results of the evaluations performed at CDC are given below. On the basis of a preliminary diagnosis of microsporidia, the patient was treated with albendazole 400 mg daily without any improvement.

Newer rapid molecular techniques with increased sensitivity and specificity are becoming available at many centers.

### Carriage frequency, intensity of carriage, and strains of oral yeast species vary in the progression to oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals [^1133nE7K]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Candida samples were taken over a period of 2 years from 54 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive asymptomatic subjects to evaluate changes in yeast carriage, intensity of carriage, and genotype over time. Overall, we found that HIV-positive patients with CD4(+)-cell counts of between 200 and 400/microl had significantly more yeast colonization than healthy control subjects. Of the 54 patients, 11 developed thrush. We found that intensity of carriage in these 11 patients increased significantly in the progression from asymptomatic yeast carrier to an episode of oral thrush. Also, the most common yeast species isolated was Candida albicans; however, we did see a number of patients harboring multiple species at the same time. Using the C. albicans-specific probe Ca3, we found that 54% (n = 6) of the 11 patients who developed thrush maintained genetically similar strains throughout the study period, with minor genetic variations in all patients except one. Forty-six percent of these patients had either multiple strains throughout the study period (n = 2), strain replacement (n = 1), or species replacement (n = 2). Of the patients who had multiple strains, one (I4) was infected by two different strains of Candida dubliniensis distinguished by a recently developed species-specific probe. These results suggest that commensal strains colonizing HIV-positive individuals can undergo alterations prior to producing an episode of thrush.

### Symptoms of the oral cavity and their association with local microbiological and clinical findings – a prospective survey in palliative care [^116e7iKA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The high incidence of Candida spp. as the leading microbiological finding denotes the most remarkable result of the study, showing quite different microbiological characteristics in the given palliative care population, almost doubling regular prevalence in healthy subjects. This finding stands out even more, as the bacterial environment of the oral cavity was found to be not relevantly altered compared to a healthy working population, with the exception of an increased prevalence of multiresistant bacteria, obviously related to preceding hospitalisations.

Also, a relatively low number of our patients (19) have been positively tested for herpes simplex virus by PCR. Their spectrum of symptoms did not differ from other patient subgroups; especially, there was no increase in oral pain, as might have been suggested. Only two of the four patients addressing pain as a relevant symptom of the oral cavity had positive HSV PCR results.

A number of factors like thrush, yeasts, herpes simplex virus, anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines and opioids etc. went along with the perception of dry mouth, less often with the perception of altered taste. Significant correlations, though, predominantly involved the criteria of dry mouth, taste disturbances or yeasts/thrush respectively. As many conditions lead to a stereotype symptom pattern, clear causal relations, as attributed for instance to the role of anticholinergic drugs or opioids, can hardly be extrapolated in a complex palliative care setting.

This study allows a description of clinical and pathobiological associations rather than causal relations. The remarkably high prevalence of Candida spp. in the oral cavity may well be a causative factor for oral symptoms like dry mouth or taste disturbances (and therefore a possible target for empirical antifungal treatment). At the other hand, xerostomia and taste disturbances may rather be caused by salivary gland dysfunction (suggesting the substitution of saliva or therapeutic interventions to stimulate the salivary glands), that is followed by Candida infection. Therefore, future research agenda should involve efforts for a better understanding of the complex pathophysiological processes within the oral cavity of palliative care patients, including the potential role of cancer itself and its metabolic and immunological impact.

Nevertheless, even the mere description of clinical and pathobiological associations might be clinically useful: if a patient complains about dry mouth, the clinical alertness for associated Candida infection should be high.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Candidiasis in Patients with Psoriasis

Oral Candidiasis

Oropharyngeal candidiasis has been classified into four clinical variants. Acute pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush) is the most common form and is characterized by white, curd-like lesions that can be dislodged with gentle scraping, revealing underlying erosions (Fig. 1 a). Erythematous candidiasis (also referred to as chronic atrophic candidiasis or denture stomatitis) is characterized by red, atrophic plaques on the tongue and oral mucosa that are often found at the point of mucosal contact with dentures. Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis resembles leukoplakia and presents as thickened white plaques on the gums and inside the cheeks that cannot be easily scraped off. Angular cheilitis, or perleche, is characterized by erythema or fissuring at the corners of the mouth and is common in patients with dentures. In rare cases, oral infections may spread to the pharynx or esophagus.

Patients with oral candidiasis can be asymptomatic or may report pain, burning sensations, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and/or halitosis. While oral candidiasis can usually be diagnosed through physical examination and clinical history, the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases guidelines for the diagnosis of Candida diseases recommend culturing a swab of a lesion on selective media. Traditionally, microscopic examination using potassium hydroxide (KOH) or fungal cultures are both effective and sensitive methods for detection of oral Candida colonization.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^117WHEPy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

### Thrush in the breastfeeding dyad: results of a survey on diagnosis and treatment [^115f65hg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Candida albicans in the breastfeeding dyad has been associated with extreme pain in the breastfeeding mother and may lead to premature weaning. There is presently a dearth of information on diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of this condition in the literature. Therefore, before such a trial was conducted, a survey was sent to experts in the field of lactation, the members of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, on the diagnosis and treatment of thrush in the breastfeeding mother and baby. Results showed that the majority of respondents relied primarily on history and physical examination of the baby, but not the mother, to make the diagnosis. Laboratory tests were ordered only rarely. The most common initial treatment was oral nystatin for the infant and cream for the mother's breasts. This was followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother. Treatment of recurrence or persistence was again most commonly nystatin for both mother and infant, followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother or oral fluconazole for both. In the absence of controlled trials of this condition, these results may serve as suggestions for the clinician, until definitive data are available.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and ~48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and ~12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.
