## Question

A defendant is on trial for possession of heroin. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, a police officer testifies that he watched another officer seize a bag of white powder from the defendant and seal it in an envelope, which both officers initialed and dated and then placed in the police property room. The prosecutor then calls a chemist to testify that she obtained, intact from the property room, the dated, sealed envelope with the initials of both police officers, whose handwriting she recognized police officers, whose handwriting she recognized from previous experience, and that testing disclosed that the powder therein was heroin. The defendant argues that the prosecutor has not sufficiently authenticated the powder tested by the chemist as the powder that was seized from the defendant. Is the chemist's testimony admissible?

Answer Choices:
A. No, unless the envelope and powder are produced in court or their absence is explained.
B. Yes, because the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting is sufficient authentication.
C. No, because the chemist did not personally witness the seizure of the powder.
D. No, because the chemist did not directly receive the envelope from the police officers.
E. Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.
F. Yes, because an object in official custody is self-authenticating.
G. Yes, because the envelope was properly sealed and initialed by the officers.
H. No, because the chemist lacks firsthand knowledge that the powder came from the defendant.
I. No, because there is no proof that the powder in the envelope is the same powder that was seized.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the chemist's testimony about the heroin found in a sealed, initialed envelope from the police property room is admissible, given the defendant's authentication objection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal standard for authenticating physical evidence in criminal trials. Then, I should verify whether the chain of custody established by the police officer's testimony, combined with the chemist's recognition of the officers' handwriting, meets that standard. Next, I will examine common authentication pitfalls and whether any apply here. Finally, I will weigh the competing answer choices and select the best-supported option, making sure I don't overstate any legal rule or exception.

> Let me first confirm the legal standard. Authentication of physical evidence generally requires sufficient evidence to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is, and this can be established by testimony describing distinctive markings, seals, or a continuous chain of custody, among other means. I should confirm that the prosecution does not need to eliminate every theoretical possibility of substitution, just present enough evidence that a reasonable jury could find the item is genuine and unchanged.

> Wait, let me verify the chain of custody here. The police officer testified that he watched another officer seize the powder, seal it in an envelope, both officers initialed and dated it, and then it was placed in the police property room. The chemist then testified she retrieved the same dated, sealed envelope with the officers' initials, which she recognized from prior experience, and that the contents tested positive for heroin. This sequence establishes a continuous, documented chain from seizure to testing, which is a classic and generally sufficient authentication approach in criminal cases.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check whether the chemist's recognition of handwriting adds independent authentication value. Yes, distinctive markings and seals, including recognized handwriting, are accepted ways to identify an item as the one previously handled, and the chemist's prior familiarity with the officers' signatures supports the inference that the envelope she tested is the same one placed in custody, strengthening the chain of custody narrative.

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating authentication with the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt. Authentication is a threshold evidentiary question for admissibility, not a demand for perfect certainty. The defense can still argue gaps or suggest tampering, but that goes to weight, not admissibility, and here the prosecution has presented a prima facie case that the tested powder is the seized powder through sealed, initialed custody and confirming retrieval by the chemist.

> Let me consider the distractors carefully. Options that say "no" typically hinge on the chemist lacking firsthand knowledge of the seizure or direct handoff from the seizing officer, but that is not required for authentication; chain of custody can bridge those gaps if adequately established. Likewise, the envelope is not literally self-authenticating in the evidentiary sense, so I should avoid choosing an option that claims a self-authentication exception that doesn't fit here.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the correct answer might be that objects in official custody are self-authenticating, but that would be a misstatement of the law. I should correct that: while official custody can support authenticity, it is not a categorical self-authentication rule, so I should not pick an answer that relies on that incorrect premise.

> Putting this together, the best answer is that the chemist's testimony is admissible because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant via a documented chain of custody and the chemist's recognition of the officers' initials on the sealed envelope, which meets the authentication standard. The defense's objections go to weight and credibility, not admissibility.

> Final answer: E. Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant.

The chemist's testimony is **admissible** because the prosecution has established a sufficient chain of custody. The police officer's testimony that the powder was seized, sealed, initialed, dated, and placed in the property room, together with the chemist's testimony that she retrieved the same sealed, initialed envelope intact from the property room and recognized the officers' handwriting, provides adequate authentication. The defendant's objections go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility, and the prosecution is not required to produce the envelope in court or call every witness in the chain [^notfound].

---

## Legal standard for authentication

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rule 901, authentication requires **sufficient evidence to support a finding** that the item is what the proponent claims it to be. This can be established through testimony describing distinctive characteristics, such as seals, markings, or custody procedures, and does not require absolute certainty — only a prima facie showing that a reasonable jury could find authenticity [^notfound].

---

## Application to the facts

In this case, the prosecution has presented the following evidence to authenticate the heroin:

- **Seizure and initial handling**: The police officer testified that he witnessed another officer seize the powder, seal it in an envelope, and that both officers initialed and dated the envelope before placing it in the police property room.

- **Chain of custody**: The chemist testified that she retrieved the envelope intact from the property room, recognized the handwriting of both officers from prior experience, and confirmed that the envelope was sealed and bore the same initials and date.

- **Testing and identification**: The chemist further testified that testing revealed the powder to be heroin.

This evidence establishes a **continuous chain of custody** and provides sufficient authentication for the heroin to be admitted into evidence. The distinctive markings (initials and date), the sealed envelope, and the testimony linking the envelope from seizure to testing meet the prima facie standard required by Rule 901 [^notfound].

---

## Addressing the defendant's arguments

The defendant's arguments — that the chemist did not personally witness the seizure, did not directly receive the envelope from the officers, and that the envelope and powder were not produced in court — go to the **weight and credibility** of the evidence, not its admissibility. The prosecution is not required to produce the physical envelope in court or to call every witness in the chain of custody; rather, they must provide sufficient evidence to support a finding that the evidence is what they claim it to be. The jury can weigh any gaps or inconsistencies in the chain of custody when assessing credibility, but this does not render the evidence inadmissible [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The chemist's testimony is **admissible** because the prosecution has established a sufficient chain of custody and authenticated the heroin through testimony describing distinctive markings and custody procedures. The defendant's objections relate to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility, and the prosecution is not required to produce the envelope in court or call every witness in the chain [^notfound].

The correct answer is **E. Yes, because the powder is sufficiently identified as having come from the defendant**.

### Expert testimony: a perspective from the trenches [^96d7849f]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The controversy over the role of the "expert" in medical litigation is in some ways the product of semantic confusion. Many physicians mistake the legal definition of an expert with that of ordinary usage, further fueling the resentment of doctors who testify against other doctors. Legally, however, an expert is simply one qualified to offer an opinion. In ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony, a court determines whether the proffered expert has the minimal qualifications necessary to have an opinion. An expert, then, does not have to have the right opinion; rather, he or she has the right to have an opinion. The bar is thus set quite low. In medical malpractice litigation, the threshold of admissibility is usually met by board certification in the same specialty as the defendant. Although expert testimony, as defined above, is necessary in most medical malpractice cases, that need is obviated when negligence is so obvious that the law presumes that a lay jury can discover it. Abuses of expert testimony are real. They are, however, in some part the consequence of some of the best doctors' refusal to assist the victims of malpractice, creating a vacuum that the less scrupulous fill.

The origins of the use of expert witnesses to assist courts in helping understand the required conduct in determining the standard of care provides a basis for recognizing the consultant role sought in judicial proceedings. Both rules of evidence and court decisions have evolved in a manner that encourages the introduction of expert testimony while conditioning its use to avoid unfair bias. Trial court judges decide on permitting such testimony, while legal counsel is responsible for helping juries determine its importance and reliability. Certain types of restrictions and adverse consequences for misstatements exist but are subordinated to the trial process in most circumstances, a process that varies among different jurisdictions.

Body packing, pushing and stuffing are methods by which illicit drugs may be carried within the human body. Patients involved in these practices may present UK emergency departments with complex medical, legal and ethical considerations. This review article examines not only the evidence behind the clinical management of these patients, but also the legal powers afforded to the authorities to authorise the use of intimate searches and diagnostic imaging for forensic purposes. Serious complications from concealed drug packets are now rare, and most asymptomatic patients may be safely discharged from hospital after assessment. Emergency surgery is indicated for body packers with cocaine poisoning and for some cases of heroin poisoning. Urgent surgery is indicated for obstruction, perforation, the passage of packet fragments and failure of conservative treatment. Guidance is given for doctors who are faced with requests from the authorities to perform intimate searches and diagnostic imaging for forensic purposes.

Legal liability for expert witness testimony

Because expert testimony has been deemed admissible does not mean that the testimony necessarily is appropriate or credible. Courts have even acknowledged 'a judge's ruling that expert testimony is admissible should not be taken as conclusive evidence that [the testimony] is responsible'. hen a trial court is faced with a decision whether to allow questionable testimony, lawyers often argue that jurors should be the ones to determine whether to believe the expert and what weight to place on an expert's testimony. Unfortunately, when faced with contradictory expert opinions on the same issue, jurors may not have the ability to separate real science from pseudo-science, or to understand decisions when there is a lack of scientific evidence. Although medical experts still may testify about any opinions they wish, unsubstantiated opinions in medical malpractice cases are drawing closer scrutiny. In some cases, experts who provide unsubstantiated opinions are finding that they and their testimonies have become the targets of legal actions or professional sanctions by societies, licensing boards, or their local administrative leadership. This gives the defendant the opportunity to argue the opinions of the experts used against them. Doing your due diligence can pay huge dividends when arguing the reliability, validity, and strength of an opposing expert witness. Use the internet to search and explore each named expert to see their background, education, publications, and any other relevant information that is available that you and your attorney could potentially use to your advantage.

Many unknowns confronted the public-health response team during the anthrax investigation. The basics about exposure to B. anthracis– contaminated envelopes specifically sent to media outlets and government leaders were understood quickly, given the events in Florida, New York, and then Washington, D.C. Difficulties arose in characterizing anthrax risk to individuals and groups with suspected or confirmed exposure to B. anthracis– contaminated envelopes or environments. Challenges also arose in the evaluation of B. anthracis- containing powders, epidemiologic investigation, environmental assessment and remediation, surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and post-exposure prophylaxis.

Work with B. anthracis– contaminated goat hair in textile mills more than 40 years ago provided some data about the risk of B. anthracis spore-containing particles in naturally contaminated occupational environments. These data suggested that relatively high levels of B. anthracis spores were "not necessarily or consistently dangerous" in this setting. Biologic warfare experts considered it unlikely that terrorists could produce a B. anthracis spore powder for use in an envelope that would be capable of generating substantial primary (or secondary) aerosol threats for human infection or widespread contamination of environments. Yet, in Senator Daschle's office, in the Hart Senate Office building, in the room where the letter was opened (as well as outside the room) exposed persons' nasal mucosa were almost immediately contaminated. Re-aerosolization (secondary aerosol) at a level consistent with potential transmission was demonstrated off the implicated high-speed sorter in the Brentwood Processing and Distribution Facility. Recent research using simulates of B. anthracis spores from the Canadian Defense Establishment Suffield suggests that contaminated envelopes can cause heavy aerosol contamination. New understanding is accumulating, and this should improve public health response in the future.

### The dawn of a new synthetic opioid era: the need for innovative interventions [^20089ed1]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Overdose deaths related to illegal drugs in North American markets are now dominated by potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, a circumstance foreshadowed by often-overlooked events in Estonia since the turn of the century. Market transitions generate important and far-reaching implications for drug policy.

Argument and Analysis

The supplier-driven introduction of illegally manufactured synthetic opioids into street opioids is elevating the risk of fatal overdose. Using the most recent overdose mortality and drug seizure data in North America, we find that overdose deaths and seizures involving synthetic opioids are geographically concentrated, but this might be changing. Examination here suggests that in some places fentanyl and its analogues have virtually displaced traditional opioids, such as heroin. The concealing of synthetic opioids in powders sold as heroin or pressed into counterfeit medications substantially increases harms. The nature and scale of the challenge posed by synthetic opioids is unprecedented in recent drug policy history.

Conclusions

There is urgent need for policy and technological innovation to meet the challenges posed by illegally produced synthetic opioids. Novel interventions worth examining include supervising drug use, proactively deterring on-line distribution and new technologies aimed at improving transparency, such as point-of-use drug content testing. Continuing to approach this problem only with existing policies and available methods, such as naloxone, is unlikely to be enough and will result in many premature deaths.

Forensic science can be instrumental in providing investigative leads or clues to help identify the perpetrators, and those who are innocent, of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear terrorist attack, as well as identify leads during infectious outbreaks or other public health threats. Because of a need to react quickly in exigent circumstances during which the threat of continued attack persists, methods may be used that are not fully validated. A preliminary validation should be performed to evaluate the acquisition of limited test data to ensure that the interpretation of results remains within the limitations of known performance of the method. If results from a preliminarily validated method are used beyond developing an investigative lead, further validation should be considered to support its reliability for adjudication purposes.

A qualitative analysis of the trial and deposition testimony of professional historians who have testified on behalf of the tobacco industry shows that defence historians present a view of past knowledge about tobacco in which the public was frequently warned that cigarettes were both deadly and addictive over the broad historical period. While defence historians testify to conducting significant levels of independent research, they also draw upon a common body of research conducted by industry counsel to support its litigation efforts. Defence historians unduly limit their research materials, ignoring industry records and, therefore, critically undermine their ability to evaluate industry activity in the smoking and health controversy as it unfolded in historical time. A consequence is that defence historians present a skewed history of the cigarette in which the tobacco industry all but ceases to exist.

Sensitivity and specificity definitions — diagnostic utility: Sensitivity is defined as the likelihood that a given test is able to detect the presence of a drug or metabolite that is actually in the specimen, and a negative result in a test with high sensitivity is useful for ruling out substance use, since positive samples are rarely missed. Specificity is defined as the likelihood that a given test is able to identify the specific drug or metabolite of interest in the specimen and not to erroneously label other drugs or metabolites, and a positive result in a test with high specificity is useful for ruling in substance use, since negative samples are rarely mislabeled.

Use of specific terms — scope of "presumptive" and "definitive" labels is clarified: Presumptive and definitive tests are often referred to using terminology that actually describes differences in analytical method, test setting, or underlying purpose. While such differences may once have aligned with presumptive versus definitive categories, advances in technology have made these generalizations increasingly inaccurate. Table 1 illustrates a number of terms often used interchangeably to refer to presumptive and definitive tests. In this document, the terms "presumptive" and "definitive" are used, except when referring to a specific aspect of a test.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^1574a7b2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM appropriate use of drug testing — presumptive and definitive tests — states that presumptive testing should be a routine part of initial and ongoing patient assessment and should be used when it is a priority to have more immediate (although less accurate) results. Providers should know the cutoff threshold concentrations their laboratory uses when interpreting a report of "no drug present", and federal cutoff threshold concentrations used for occupational testing are not appropriate for clinical use. Definitive testing techniques should be used whenever a provider wants to detect specific substances not identified by presumptive methods, quantify levels of the substance present, and refine the accuracy of the results, and definitive testing should be used when the results inform clinical decisions with major clinical or non-clinical implications for the patient. If a patient disputes presumptive findings, a definitive test should be done, and when ordering a definitive test, providers should advise the laboratory if specific substances are suspected. Because not all laboratories automatically perform "reflex" testing of positive presumptive results, providers should be aware that a specific order may be required for definitive testing.

ASAM appropriate use of drug testing — responding to test results — advises that providers should attach a meaningful therapeutic response to test results, both positive and negative, and deliver it to patients as quickly as possible. Providers should not take a confrontational approach to discussing positive test results with patients. Providers should be aware that immediate administrative or legal response to a drug test result may not be appropriate and should consider all relevant factors rather than decide based solely on the test result, which is particularly important when results may lead to irreversible patient care decisions.

### CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials [^874f10c6]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Centralised or "third-party" assignment is especially desirable. Many good allocation concealment mechanisms incorporate external involvement. Use of a pharmacy or central telephone randomisation system are two common techniques. Automated assignment systems are likely to become more common. When external involvement is not feasible, an excellent method of allocation concealment is the use of numbered containers. The interventions (often drugs) are sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence. Enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes can be a good allocation concealment mechanism if it is developed and monitored diligently. This method can be corrupted, however, particularly if it is poorly executed. Investigators should ensure that the envelopes are opaque when held to the light, and opened sequentially and only after the participant's name and other details are written on the appropriate envelope.

A number of methodological studies provide empirical evidence to support these precautions. Trials in which the allocation sequence had been inadequately or unclearly concealed yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than did trials in which authors reported adequate allocation concealment. These findings provide strong empirical evidence that inadequate allocation concealment contributes to bias in estimating treatment effects.

Despite the importance of the mechanism of allocation concealment, published reports often omit such details. The mechanism used to allocate interventions was omitted in reports of 89% of trials in rheumatoid arthritis,48% of trials in obstetrics and gynaecology journals, and 44% of trials in general medical journals. In a more broadly representative sample of all randomised trials indexed on PubMed, only 18% reported any allocation concealment mechanism, but some of those reported mechanisms were inadequate.

Examples — "Determination of whether a patient would be treated by streptomycin and bed-rest (S case) or by bed-rest alone (C case) was made by reference to a statistical series based on random sampling numbers drawn up for each sex at each centre by Professor Bradford Hill; the details of the series were unknown to any of the investigators or to the co-ordinator… After acceptance of a patient by the panel, and before admission to the streptomycin centre, the appropriate numbered envelope was opened at the central office; the card inside told if the patient was to be an S or a C case, and this information was then given to the medical officer of the centre".

Expert testimony peer review — organizational recommendation — states that organizations should establish a practical mechanism for conducting single-specialty or multispecialty prospective peer review of proposed expert medical testimony in civil and criminal litigation, noting that judges are responsible for determining whether the underlying reasoning or methodology of the expert testimony is scientifically valid and can be applied properly to the facts at issue but do not have the necessary knowledge to make such a determination independently; therefore, professional associations and independent review organizations need an effective method, because any damage or injustice from inappropriate testimony is not likely to be remediated and a posttrial determination will not further the cause of justice, whereas a prospective peer review tailored to the case and, when complex scientific questions require multiple experts, a multidisciplinary review would achieve greater sophistication, accountability, and efficiency in the trial process.

ACOEM position statement — ethical aspects of drug testing specifies that the reason for any requirement for the drug testing program should be clearly documented, with reasons that might involve safety for the individual, other employees, or the public; security needs; or requirements related to job performance. Affected employees and applicants should be informed in advance of the company's policy concerning drug use, misuse, and screening, and employees should be made aware of their right to refuse such screening and the consequences of such refusal to their employment. Employees should have a clear understanding of — and the company's policy should state — the possible consequences of a non-negative test result including, but not limited to, refusal to hire, firing, suspension, rehabilitation, referral to substance abuse counseling, and not entering a facility. Where special safety or security needs justify testing for the presence of drugs on an unannounced and random basis, employees should be made aware of all aspects of the drug-testing program, and care should be taken to assure that such tests are done in a uniform and impartial manner for all employees in the affected group(s). Collection, transportation, and analysis of the specimens and the reporting of the results should meet stringent legal, technical, and ethical requirements, and the process should be under the supervision of a licensed physician (MD/DO). A licensed physician (MD/DO) with appropriate qualifications should be designated as the medical review officer (MRO) and should evaluate positive results prior to a report being made to the employer; this may require obtaining supplemental information from the employee or applicant to ensure that a test does not represent appropriate use of prescription drugs, over-the-counter medication, or other substances which could cause a positive test, and MRO training should include the pharmacology of substance abuse, laboratory testing methodology and quality control, forensic toxicology, pertinent federal regulations, legal and ethical requirements, chemical dependency illness, and employee assistance programs and rehabilitation. The affected employee or applicant should be advised of the positive results by the physician and have the opportunity for explanation and discussion prior to the reporting of results to the employer, if feasible, and the mechanism for accomplishing this should be clearly defined. Any report to the employer should provide only the information needed for work placement purposes or as required by government regulations; identification to the employer of the drug(s) found and quantitative levels should not be done unless required by law or upon specific release request by the donor, and reports to the employer should be made by a physician sensitive to the various considerations involved. If carefully designed and carried out, programs for the screening of employees and applicants for drugs, including alcohol, serve to protect and improve employee health and safety in an ethically acceptable manner, and physicians are encouraged to refer to the Medical Review Officer Certification Council's MRO Code of Ethics.

### Opening a Bacillus anthracis-containing envelope, capitol hill, Washington, D.C.: the public health response [^d314065a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Timeline of Events

On October 15, 2001, at 9:45 a.m. a staff member on the 6th floor of the Hart Senate Office Building (HSOB) in the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle cut open a taped business envelope containing a letter and a powdery substance (Table 1). Upon noticing a burst of dust, she placed the letter on the floor and notified the U.S. Capitol Police. Within 5 minutes of being notified, officers were at the scene. The hazardous device unit of the Capitol Police arrived minutes later. The officers and emergency response personnel, referred to as first responders, arrived with respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE) on hand, but equipment was not put on until after arrival at the scene. These officers tested the powder for B. anthracis spores twice, using commercial rapid tests. Preliminary results obtained within 15 minutes suggested that the powder contained B. anthracis. Laboratories at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Maryland, later confirmed these preliminary results.

At approximately 10:30 a.m. the ventilation system was shut off. Medical staff from the Office of the Attending Physician (OAP), U.S. Capitol, began collecting nasal swabs for B. anthracis culture from staff members in Senator Daschle's office, from staff in an adjacent office belonging to Senator Russell Feingold, and from the first responders; in addition, an initial 3-day antimicrobial postexposure prophylaxis regimen consisting of ciprofloxacin, 500 mg twice a day, was given to these persons. Only the person who opened the contaminated envelope removed and changed her clothing and was decontaminated with soap and water. All others washed their hands with soap and water.

### Damaging state legislation regarding opioids: the need to scrutinize sources of inaccurate information provided to lawmakers [^2f10f51a]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

An even more disconcerting piece of legislation signed into effect is the Arizona Opioid Epidemic Act of 2018. The lengthy document begins by stating that 75% of heroin users in treatment "started with painkillers, according to a 2014 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association". The JAMA study to which the authors alludewas actually published in JAMA Psychiatry, not JAMA. The data were collected "from third quarter 2010 to third quarter 2013", and included only a sample of patients admitted for substance dependence/abuse treatment during that timeframe. Consequently, the generalizability of this sample to all heroin users is questionable, to say the least. Most importantly, the data were collected during the midst of the prescription opioid epidemic in the United States, i.e. at a time during which there were many more opioids being prescribedand risk mitigation (e.g. more states requiring mandatory Prescription Drug Monitoring Program use, increased ease and sophistication of toxicology testing to assess potential aberrancy, percentage of market share of abuse-deterrent formulation opioids) was far less comprehensive than was the case when the law was written in 2018. Failure to recognize the dramatic change in the opioid prescribing zeitgeist between the study period and the time at which the state's law was written essentially invalidates the claim on which it was based. In fact, many have posited that the "prescription opioid crisis" has been over, or at least dissipating, for the past several years.–Further, the first author of the 2014 JAMA Psychiatry retrospective analysis has subsequently posited that the recent reduction of prescription opioid availability "has led many to turn to heroin". The author opined that "there is growing evidence that new opioid users, who previously used opioid drugs as their entry into opioid use, are now increasingly being introduced to opioids by using the more easily accessible heroin as their first exposure to an opioid" (p. 1322). Numerous others have recently analyzed the data and reached the same conclusion,–and have posited that restrictive opioid prescribing laws are related to the unintended consequence of broader demand for and use of far deadlier illicit fentanyl and its analogues. The rationale used to justify the Arizona law is rife with even more outdated and accordingly invalid data, such as its assertion that opioid prescribing rates for adolescents doubled between 1994 and 2007. In addition to the highly inaccurate premise behind the Arizona opioid law, implementation of the premise also leaves something to be desired. For example, the law dictates a 5-day limit on initial fills of prescription opioids in cases in which the state is the payer, even though there is no empirical evidence suggesting that this approach results in greater individual or societal safety. Regarding the law's 90 MME prescribing limit, officials in Arizona, not surprisingly, evoked the 2016 CDC Guideline.

### Promoting ethical and objective practice in the medicolegal arena of disability evaluation [^9278d848]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

As providers of medical information and testimony, clinicians have ultimate responsibility for ethical conduct as it relates to this information. The authors offer the following recommendations for enhancing ethical relationships between expert clinicians and the courts. 1. Avoid or resist attorney efforts at enticement into joining the attorney-client team. Such compromises of scientific boundaries and ethical principles exist on a continuum ranging from standard attorney-client advocacy at the beginning of the expert consultation phase (e.g., promotional information at the forefront of retaining an expert, with either provision of selective or incomplete records or less than enthusiastic efforts to produce all records) and extending to completion of evaluation, when requests for changes in reports and documentation might be made. 2. Respect role boundaries and do not mix conflicting roles. Remember that the treating doctor possesses a bond with the patient but does not as a rule obtain complete preinjury and postinjury information in the context of assessing causality and apportionment. In contrast, the expert witness must conduct a thorough and multifaceted case analysis sans the physician-patient relationship in order to facilitate objectivity and allow optimum diagnostic formulations. Finally, the trial consultant's function in this adversarial process is to assist with critically scrutinizing and attacking positions of experts for the opposing side. These roles all represent inherently different interests, and mixing them can only reduce objectivity. 3. Insist on adequate time for thorough record review, evaluation, and report generation. Also insist on sufficient time and preparation for deposition and court appearances. 4. Work at building a reputation for general objectivity, reliance on multiple data sources, reaching opinions only after reviewing complete information from both sides, and completing the evaluation. 5. Spend a good amount of time actually treating the patient population being examined or being offered testimony about. This treatment should be current and should be of a similar frequency to treating practitioner specialists. Be able to discuss relevant research and scientific methodology issues competently and without notes. 6. Arrive at opinions only after reviewing all of the evidence from both sides of the adversarial fence, employing multiple data sources, completing the evaluation, and interpreting data within the full context of comprehensive historical, behavioral observation, and contextual information. Being otherwise favorable to retaining attorney interests suggests endorsement of "opinion prostitute", "scientific perjurer", or "hired gun" status. The only way a practitioner can reduce the likelihood of facing an "opinion prostitute" on the opposing side in future cases is to insist on establishing and maintaining a reputation for scientific objectivity. 7. Balance cases from plaintiff and defense attorneys. Predilection for one side or the other suggests bias and sets up predisposition to nonobjectivity. For example, a preponderance of plaintiff work suggests an overdiagnosis or uncritical sympathy bias, whereas a ratio that favors hiring by the defense suggests an underdiagnosis or skepticism bias. Perhaps Brodsky's suggested cut-off ratio of .8 for favorability findings would represent an initial cutoff for defense versus plaintiff ratio. That is, experts should do at least 20% work for the opposite side of the current case being represented. Further, it might be a reasonable expectation that data on these ratios be collected as an important method for ensuring objective opinions. 8. Ensure against excessive favorability to the side of the retaining attorney or firm. Objectivity demands that scientific opinions not be influenced by the position of the legal advocate. Importantly, Brodsky recommends using a ratio of .8 as a cut-off for detecting excessive bias. That is, practitioners should possess prerequisite objectivity to disagree with the referring attorney at least 20% of the time. We suggest that a more useful cut-off would be .75, where experts are expected to generate findings that do not support the referring attorney's position at least 25% of the time. 9. Never arrive at opinions that are inconsistent with plaintiff records, examination data, test data, behavioral presentation, and so forth, especially when such opinions are favorable to the side of the retaining attorney firm. Instead, use the following recommendations. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### Fentanyl exposure and detection strategies utilized by clinical trial participants seeking linkage to opioid use disorder treatment at a syringe service program [^a8567836]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately half of the world's opioid-related overdose deaths occur in the USA. These deaths are currently driven by fentanyl saturation in the illicit drug market. Fentanyl is easier to produce than heroin and can be smuggled in small batches due to its potency. Given the clandestine nature of the illicit drug market, it is difficult to surveille trends; however, research suggests the first US-based illicit fentanyl laboratory was discovered in Kansas in the 1990s. Fentanyl subsequently appeared periodically in heroin batches until the mid-2000s when there was a sharp increase from the Midwest to the Northeast corridor, resulting in the national spread of fentanyl during the 2010s. Fentanyl's saturation of the North American drug supply expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is now the primary driver of US opioid overdoses. While prior research has demonstrated users of illicit opioids are concerned about fentanyl and attempt to avoid its exposure, the accuracy of the documented strategies used by this population to detect fentanyl and prevent overdose has not been adequately investigated.

While people who use opioids may attempt to avoid fentanyl because of the higher risk of overdose and test strips are available to detect fentanyl, many users instead report relying on personal detection methods such as sight, taste, smell, and the resulting high experienced after dosing. For example, individuals who use opioids have reported the presence of fentanyl can be identified by a powdery texture, abnormal colors like gray or purple, a sweeter taste, or sensations associated with use such as heavier sedation or "pins and needles". However, the accuracy of such detection methods is unknown and, even when these strategies are employed, research has found users of opioids' beliefs regarding fentanyl use are inaccurate. These studies rely on various drug testing methods (urine or saliva drug screening) with prevalence varying by sample and time frame. One North American study reported more than 50% of participants who denied use tested positive for fentanyl; however, this work was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic's onset. Further saturation of fentanyl within the street drug supply and associated changes in knowledge and expectations among people who use opioids require more current investigation in this area.

### Urine drug screening: a valuable office procedure [^1a14fa7f]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Urine drug screening can enhance workplace safety, monitor medication compliance, and detect drug abuse. Ordering and interpreting these tests requires an understanding of testing modalities, detection times for specific drugs, and common explanations for false-positive and false-negative results. Employment screening, federal regulations, unusual patient behavior, and risk patterns may prompt urine drug screening. Compliance testing may be necessary for patients taking controlled substances. Standard immunoassay testing is fast, inexpensive, and the preferred initial test for urine drug screening. This method reliably detects morphine, codeine, and heroin; however, it often does not detect other opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, and tramadol. Unexpected positive test results should be confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. A positive test result reflects use of the drug within the previous one to three days, although marijuana can be detected in the system for a longer period of time. Careful attention to urine collection methods can identify some attempts by patients to produce false-negative test results.

### Randomized controlled pilot trial of naloxone-on-release to prevent post-prison opioid overdose deaths [^4c1c59fb]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prisoners with a history of heroin injection have a high risk of drug‐related death (DRD) soon after prison release, which was estimated at five DRDs per 1000 eligible releases on the basis of record‐linkage studies in Scotland in 1996–99 1 and in England and Wales in 1999–2002 2; also see meta‐analyses 3, 4.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be administered intramuscularly and is used by emergency services to reverse heroin/opioid overdose 5. The feasibility of randomized provision of naloxone‐on‐release (NOR) to a high‐DRD risk population, such as inmates with a history of heroin injection use on their release from prison, as proposed by Bird & Hutchinson 1, had not been investigated. Prison‐based randomized trials must address either a concern that applies specifically to prisoners (as here) to counter the challenge that the same trial could have been conducted equally well in the outside community or be able to point to parallel trials on the outside to answer the challenge of exploiting prisoners' captivity.

One recent international review of non‐randomized community initiatives on take‐home naloxone, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, with follow‐up for 3–6 months of their trainees, gave an estimated fatality rate at witnessed opioid overdose of 6% (upper 95% confidence limit = 11%), suggesting that a target for the annual distribution of naloxone kits should be nine to 20 times a nation's annual number of opioid‐related deaths 6. A recent comprehensive monograph 7 has documented the historical development (from the 1990s) and spread of take‐home naloxone programmes through North America, Europe and Australia and considered their practical implementation, including the training of naloxone recipients in how to recognize and respond to an overdose. Although supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) 8, barriers remain to accessing take‐home naloxone: in most European jurisdictions, naloxone is a prescription‐only medicine; in others (see below), its addition to the exempt list of prescription‐only medicines did little to change clinical practice, take‐home naloxone being deemed contentious 9 by some, complex 10 by others. When the notification of overdose events triggers a report to the police, this may discourage witnesses from contacting emergency medical services, and the need to inject naloxone can prove a psychological barrier for some responders as well as being a potential health risk for all who administer the injection 7.

### The public health risks of counterfeit pills [^ef4a1f6e]. The Lancet: Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Increase public health monitoring of counterfeit pill contents

Given the rapidly evolving nature of the illicit drug supply — with new drugs and combinations constantly being developed and sold — it is an open question if public health monitoring will be able to keep up. Renewed investments are needed in supply-side monitoring efforts to detect new substances, sources, and polysubstance formulations that are being used, and trends in usage. These monitoring efforts must be linked to communication networks that broadcast news about emerging risks to consumers. Encouraging efforts to put early warning alert networks into place and bolster public health monitoring of synthetic drug crises are ongoing, for example, through the European Union Drugs Agency's Early Warning System for Novel Psychoactive Substancesand the Organization of American States' Early Alert System for the Americas. To best monitor for emerging threats, these systems should ideally leverage and integrate a broad range of supply-side indicators, including data from law enforcement drug seizures, (which must be made rapidly available to the public and researchers) alongside community-engaged drug checking services, routinely collected clinical indicators from pre-hospital and emergency department encounters involving fatal and non-fatal overdose events, and rapid toxicology from overdose autopsy investigations leveraging panels of tests for novel synthetic substances.

### Alleged breaches of "standards of medical care" in a patient overdose death possibly related to chronic opioid analgesic therapy, application of the controlled substances model guidelines: case report [^aac33394]. Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this medicolegal case report are the following: 1) to present details of a chronic pain patient (CPP) who was placed on chronic opioid analgesic therapy (COAT), and subsequently overdosed on multiple drugs, some of which were not prescribed by his COAT physician; 2) to present both the plaintiff's and defendant's (the COAT prescriber) expert witnesses' opinions as to the allegation that COAT prescribing was the cause of death; and 3) based on these opinions, to develop some recommendations on how pain physicians can utilize the use of Controlled Substances Model Guidelines in order to protect the patient and themselves from such an occurrence.

Methods

This is a case report of a CPP treated by a pain physician.

Results

Differences between the plaintiff's and defendant's expert's opinions are explained utilizing the Controlled Substances Model Guidelines.

Conclusions

Some CPPs may withhold information critical to their COAT treatment. Application of the Controlled Substances Model Guidelines and the newer Federation of State Medical Boards' policy on opioid prescribing can be helpful in improving patient care and may be helpful in protecting the physician medicolegally.

### Fentanyl is used in Mexico's Northern border: current challenges for drug health policies [^fd04f894]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Results from a recent study among 750 heroin users in three Mexico's northern border cities revealed an increase in white powder availability (also known as China white) and preference for this product among heroin users, as well as a general perception of increased overdose cases among this population. Here, we questioned whether those findings reflect an increased presence of heroin laced with fentanyl, which is associated with greater risks of overdose but that, until now, has not been described in Mexico.

Design

We tested fentanyl using highly sensitive test strips in syringe plungers, metal cookers and drug wrappings associated with heroin use.

Setting

Three injection sites in Tijuana, Baja California, México.

Participants

Eighty-nine heroin users who interchanged paraphernalia for new syringes.

Measurements

We tested 59 residues of 'pure' white powder. The rest were white powder with black tar (n = 5) or white powder with crystal meth (n = 9), black tar with crystal meth (n = 1), black tar only (n = 13) and crystal meth only (n = 2).

Findings

Users believed that they consumed either white powder heroin, white powder heroin with crystal meth, white powder with black tar heroin or black tar heroin only. Analyses revealed that 93% (n = 55) of the 'pure' white powder samples had fentanyl. All (n = 9) the white powder samples mixed with crystal meth and 40% (n = 2) of the white powder with black tar were also laced with fentanyl.

Conclusions

In a sample of 89 heroin users in Mexico, most white powder heroin users were unknowingly exposed to fentanyl, with fentanyl detected in 93% of white powder samples.

### Randomized controlled pilot trial of naloxone-on-release to prevent post-prison opioid overdose deaths [^5df5c9a5]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

N‐ALIVE packs

Each prison had a supply of pre‐numbered sealed N‐ALIVE packs (Meade et al. in review). Control and naloxone packs were identical in appearance, sounded alike when shaken and were similar weights. All packs contained the N‐ALIVE DVD, a wallet and had tamper‐evident stickers attached.

The wallet in the control pack did not contain a syringe. The wallet in the naloxone pack included all the same material as the control wallet, but also contained a pre‐filled syringe, the unscrewed plunger rod for the syringe and a safety‐covered, sterile‐packed hypodermic needle; see Supporting information. The plunger had been removed from the syringe barrel so that both fitted into the N‐ALIVE wallet; both had to be fitted to the syringe before use. The syringe contained 2 mg of naloxone hydrochloride in 2 mL of solution, for once‐only intramuscular injection in the event of overdose. During information and consent sessions, participants were advised on how to administer the N‐ALIVE‐recommended 0.8 mg intramuscular dose of naloxone. For trial purposes, the naloxone needed to be a single product (see Meade et al. in review). As none of the available products fitted our needs well, the correct dose in single product form was most crucial. Accordingly, we selected the 2‐mg pre‐loaded syringe as an acceptable formulation for the pilot trial period (see Meade et al. in review), which necessitated additional instructions for administration to be limited to a 0.8 mg dose.

Returned prisoner self‐questionnaire

We asked participants if they were willing to complete an anonymous follow‐up questionnaire if they returned to prison within 6 months of their most recent N‐ALIVE release date. The RPSQ identified the participant's randomized assignment and the time interval between the preceding N‐ALIVE release date and completion date but, to encourage frankness, the identity of the respondent was not recorded. Forms were neither checked nor overseen by the N‐ALIVE worker unless the respondent so chose.

### Heroin and its metabolites: relevance to heroin use disorder [^0fc95276]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine or diamorphine) is a semi-synthetic derivative of morphine, a naturally occurring opiate contained, along with codeine, in the latex of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). The opium poppy was first domesticated circa 6000 B.C.E. in Europe, and its cultivation spread eastwards over the following millennia. It is worth noticing that the frequent reference in textbooks and journal articles to a supposed initial spread of opium production from Mesopotamia has long been shown to be based on flawed scholarship. While the medical use of opium in antiquity (first by Greco-Roman medicine and centuries later by Arab, Indian, and Chinese medicines) is well documented, reliable evidence of widespread 'recreational' use is much more recent and appears to be related to technological innovations. The introduction of tobacco and tobacco pipe by European traders in South-East Asia (16th-17th century) made it possible to smoke opium and opium laced tobacco, whereas the standardization of laudanum, a hydroalcoholic extract (tincture) of opium, in Europe (17th–18th century) made it possible to take large amounts of morphine and codeine with a single draught. Technological innovations were crucial also in the case of morphine, which was isolated in 1817, but became widely used for medical and non-medical purposes only after the invention of the hypodermic syringe a few decades later. At present, the non-medical use of morphine is a relatively rare occurrence, compared to heroin. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine, which will be discussed in the following sections, might help to explain the reason for this preference.

### Epidemiology in the courtroom: an evidence-based paradigm for the determination of causation in compensation environments [^1d9eba19]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Identify an evidence-based paradigm for the determination of causation of occupational injury and illness litigation.

Methods

The Westlaw and LexisNexis databases were used to identify legal principles governing the admissibility of scientific evidence in legal proceedings. The Medline database was referenced to identify evidence-based methods for the determination of causation complying with legal precepts for the admissibility of scientific testimony.

Results

Expert witness testimony must be relevant and reliable. Testimony must be sufficiently based on reliable facts and data. Testimony must be the product of reliable principles or methods. The witness must have reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

Conclusions

Conscientious application of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Guide for the Determination of Work-Relatedness of Disease, as adapted, comforts with legal prerequisites for the admissibility of scientific evidence in medicolegal proceedings.

### Expert witness participation in civil and criminal proceedings [^ef0ee76b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Compensation for expert testimony — Appropriate compensation is described as being commensurate with the expertise, time, and effort required for preparing and providing responsible testimony, and written expert witness agreements often include a fee schedule for depositions and in-court testimony, a cancellation policy, out-of-pocket expenses (eg, travel costs, car rental, hotel, food, parking, etc), research, printing, postage and express packages, preparation time, the retaining counsel's fee payment responsibility, and interest for overdue accounts. Guidance notes that asking for excessive compensation may be considered unethical and states it is unethical to charge unreasonable rates or to exaggerate the time required to prepare expert testimony, and that it is also unethical for remuneration to be contingent on the outcome of the case. Common factors in valuing expert testimony include the amount earned if the pediatrician, pediatric medical subspecialist, or pediatric surgical specialist saw patients in the office or performed surgery that day, the difficulty in preparing the case, and the dearth of appropriate experts in a specific field.

### Opening a Bacillus anthracis-containing envelope, capitol hill, Washington, D.C.: the public health response [^576f746f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among the series of bioterrorism incidents during 2001 related to B. anthracis –contaminated envelopes, this event was unique because it was the first with a known source of exposure, enabling a rapid public health response by a multidisciplinary team including law enforcement officers, medical and public health personnel, laboratory personnel, industrial hygienists, and engineers. The known source enabled us to assess the usefulness of nasal swab cultures in determining exposure to B. anthracis.

The contaminated letter purportedly contained about 2 g of powder, with each gram reported to contain between 100 billion to 1 trillion spores. The recovery of B. anthracis from nasal cultures was limited to persons who were inside Senator Daschle or Feingold's offices or in the hallway joining the two offices. Nasal swab results suggest that the ventilation system played a very small role, if any, in the spread of anthrax spores in HSOB. Based on proportions of persons with positive nasal swabs, most dissemination likely occurred through room currents from the 6th to the 5th floor of the Daschle suite via an open staircase; closed doors that blocked air currents were most likely the reason a smaller proportion in Senator Feingold's office had positive nasal cultures despite being adjacent to Senator Daschle's office.

Swabs were taken within 1 day of the initial event from all 71 persons in the immediate exposure area, including those with positive nasal cultures for B. anthracis. However, in others with negative results, testing was not done for up to 4 days. Although these persons were located outside the immediate exposure area, it is uncertain whether prompt antibiotic administration, a delay in nasal swab testing, or both, may have had an effect on those nasal culture results. In one animal model involving macaques, large inhaled doses of anthrax spores in a controlled setting yielded B. anthracis in nasal swabs of all animals within 24 hours of exposure, and although sensitivity decreased as time progressed, positive nasal cultures were recovered in some macaques 1 week after exposure. In the Florida anthrax investigation, positive nasal cultures were detected in a person > 1 week after presumed exposure. Repeat swabs from the persons with initially positive cultures were negative at 7 days postexposure, but prophylaxis administration may have influenced those results. The greatest sensitivity for recovery of B. anthracis can be achieved by obtaining nasal swab specimens as early as possible after recognized exposure.

### Broad evidence of xylazine in the UK illicit drug market beyond heroin supplies: triangulating from toxicology, drug-testing and law enforcement [^b6050cc8]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Xylazine is a non-opioid sedative which has spread rapidly throughout the US illicit drug supply. This study aimed to describe the spread of xylazine throughout the UK illicit drug supply.

Methods

Xylazine detections in human biological samples were collated from toxicology laboratories operating in the United Kingdom with the date, location, case type, xylazine concentration and co-detected drugs (with quantifications where performed) detailed, where permitted, by the corresponding coroner. Drug-testing cases positive for xylazine were collated from the Welsh Emerging Drugs and Identification of Novel Substances (WEDINOS) drug-testing postal service with the date, location, purchase intent and co-detected drugs detailed. Drug seizures made by UK law enforcement were communicated by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities with the date and location detailed.

Results

By the end of August 2023, xylazine was detected in 35 cases from throughout toxicology, drug-testing and drug seizure sources covering England, Scotland and Wales. There were no cases reported from Northern Ireland. Xylazine was detected in biological samples from 16 people. In most cases where full toxicology results were provided, xylazine was detected with heroin and/or a strong opioid (n = nine of 11), but this polydrug use pattern was not evident in all cases (n = two of 11), suggesting a wider circulation of xylazine in the UK illicit drug market beyond heroin supplies. Evidence from WEDINOS supports this claim, as all 14 drug samples (100%) submitted from across the UK contained xylazine; however, in none of these cases was heroin the purchase intent but rather counterfeit prescription medication tablets (n = 11 of 14), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) vapes (n = two of 14) or white powder (n = one of 14). Additional evidence for the spread of illicit xylazine comes from five drug seizures made by law enforcement.

Conclusions

Xylazine has penetrated the UK illicit drug market and is not limited to heroin supplies.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^7db07a37]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ASAM drug testing — responding to test results states that "All physicians (and others involved in drug testing) should determine the questions the test is intended to answer before the testing is administered and should have a plan for what to do with the results"; drug testing should function as a therapeutic tool, so a provider's response to test results should not be confrontational, and providers should be aware that a positive drug test does not diagnose a SUD and a negative test result does not rule out a SUD, while all tests have some false-positive and false-negative outcomes. A false positive occurs when a negative sample is incorrectly labeled as positive, and the use of a detection threshold, or cutoff limit, is meant to reduce false-positive results; providers without formal toxicology training can participate in available courses and/or should collaborate with a medical toxicologist, a toxicologist from the testing laboratory, or a physician certified as an MRO, and providers could consider MRO training and/or certification. A false negative occurs when a positive sample is incorrectly labeled as negative; sometimes this is the result of the use of a cutoff limit, and in this case, a negative result does not exclude the presence of a drug or metabolite, but reflects it was not a sufficient amount to cross the cutoff limit.

Implementation Considerations

Toxicology testing should not be used in a punitive manner but should be used in the context of other clinical information to inform and improve patient care. Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care on the basis of a toxicology test result. Dismissal could have adverse consequences for patient safety, potentially including the patient obtaining opioids or other drugs from alternative sources and the clinician missing opportunities to facilitate treatment for substance use disorder.
Before starting opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy, clinicians should consider the benefits and risks of toxicology testing to assess for prescribed opioids and other prescription and nonprescription controlled substances that increase risk for overdose when combined with opioids, including nonprescribed and illicit opioids and benzodiazepines.
Clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in testing and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about patients.
Predicting risk is challenging, and available tools do not allow clinicians to reliably identify patients who are at low risk for substance use or substance use disorders. Clinicians should consider toxicology screening results as potentially useful data, in the context of other clinical information, for all patients and consider toxicology screening whenever its potential limitations can be addressed.
Clinicians should explain to patients that toxicology testing will not be used to dismiss patients from care and is intended to improve their safety.
Clinicians should explain expected results (e.g. presence of prescribed medication and absence of drugs, including nonprescribed controlled substances not reported by the patient) and ask patients in a nonjudgmental manner about use of prescribed and other drugs and whether there might be unexpected results.
Limited toxicology screening can be performed with a relatively inexpensive presumptive immunoassay panel that tests for opiates as a class, benzodiazepines as a class, and several nonprescribed substances. Toxicology screening for a class of drugs might not detect all drugs in that class. For example, fentanyl testing is not included in widely used toxicology assays that screen for opiates as a class.
Clinicians should be familiar with the drugs included in toxicology screening panels used in their practice and should understand how to interpret results for these drugs. For example, a positive opiates immunoassay detects morphine, which might reflect patient use of morphine, codeine, or heroin, but does not detect synthetic opioids and might not detect semisynthetic opioids. In some cases, positive results for specific opioids might reflect metabolites from opioids the patient is taking and might not mean the patient is taking the specific opioid that resulted in the positive test.
Confirmatory testing should be used when toxicology results will inform decisions with major clinical or nonclinical implications for the patient; a need exists to detect specific opioids or other drugs within a class, such as those that are being prescribed, or those that cannot be identified on standard immunoassays; or a need exists to confirm unexpected screening toxicology test results.
Restricting confirmatory testing to situations and substances for which results can reasonably be expected to affect patient management can reduce costs of toxicology testing.
Clinicians might want to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and should discuss unexpected results with the patient.
Clinicians should discuss unexpected results with patients in a nonjudgmental manner, avoiding use of potentially stigmatizing language (e.g. avoid describing a specimen as testing "clean" or "dirty").
Discussion with patients before specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and remove the need for confirmatory testing during that visit. For example, a patient might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because they felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results from toxicology screening are not explained, a confirmatory test on the same sample using a method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g. gas or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) might be warranted.
Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g. optimize pain management strategy [see Recommendation 2], carefully weigh benefits and risks of reducing or continuing opioid dosage [see Recommendation 5], reevaluate more frequently [see Recommendation 7], offer naloxone [see Recommendation 8], and offer treatment or refer the patient for treatment with medications for opioid use disorder [see Recommendation 12], all as appropriate).

### Methadone hydrochloride (Diskets) [^565c3a37]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

9.1 Controlled Substance

DISKETS contain methadone, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DISKETS contain methadone, a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol. DISKETS can be abused and is subject to misuse, addiction, and criminal diversion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.

Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes: a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in its use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes a physical withdrawal.

"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Healthcare providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction.

### Translating clinical findings to the legal norm: the defendant's insanity assessment support scale (DIASS) [^5fa02e91]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

A negative attitude toward the insanity defense has been reported, and it has been found to be associated with juror judgments. A common perception by the lay public is that the insanity defense is overused and might allow criminals to avoid punishment, a belief that appears to entail an implicit distrust regarding the underlying forensic mental health evaluations –. Such a perception, however, might be inaccurate in view of the existing data. For instance, in a dated pioneering study, it was found that insanity pleas are raised in about 1% of felony cases and proving successful only in about 28% of those cases. Nevertheless, a more recent study from our group showed 42% of insanity judgments among evaluated defendants. These differences are mainly due to different legal thresholds for admitting psychiatric evidence in criminal cases that vary broadly.

A possible source of distrust lies however in the frequent disagreement among experts, with a recent meta-analysis showing that forensic evaluators disagreed 25–35% of the time. This may be associated with the intrinsic limits of psychiatric diagnosis, the different and non-standardized evaluation methodologies, and with the longitudinal variability of psychiatric symptoms, implying that evaluations carried out at different times can lead to different conclusions on the same case. As a consequence, expert evaluation has often been considered a "battle of the experts" rather than accurate, objective, and reliable testimony on the defendant's criminal responsibility — in particular in adversarial legal systems. The absence of biological markers available to guide forensic psychiatric evaluations, and the relative scarcity of reliable and diagnostic tools to guide such assessments, might also account for discrepancies between expert testimonies. In addition, the paucity of research on insanity evaluations implies poor empirical support underlying such assessment. Finally, the dialectic of the criminal trial must be acknowledged, where different parties plead their case, which entails the possibility of different opinions, which the court or jury weighs. At the same time, we should be cautious in interpreting this finding, since this analysis concerns those cases that went to trial. In some jurisdictions, when the experts agree, the cases may not go to trial.

### Investigation of bioterrorism-related anthrax, United States, 2001: epidemiologic findings [^ca9e9d64]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Cases of anthrax occurred in persons near those targeted for infection and also in those along the mail path of spore-containing envelopes. After the mailing of the September 18 envelopes, cases of cutaneous anthrax occurred, but were initially unrecognized, in workers at the postal processing center in New Jersey where the implicated envelopes originated. After the mailing of the October 9 envelopes, inhalational disease was identified in workers at postal facilities in the District of Columbia and New Jersey. Investigators did not anticipate the exposures and fulminant disease in those exposed to aerosols of B. anthracis spores from unopened envelopes along the path of the mail. No prior experience with mailed B. anthracis–positive, powder-containing envelopes is described in published reports; previous descriptions of aerosolized B. anthracis spores indicated that risk for re-aerosolization or resuspension of spores was low. Previous preventive strategies for presumed B. anthracis exposures now appear inadequate in light of recent findings. Before this incident, antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended only for direct exposures to the envelopes, and limited decontamination was suggested only for the immediate site of envelope opening. Cutaneous and inhalational disease in postal workers in our investigation clearly shows that sealed, B. anthracis–positive, powder-containing envelopes can be a source of infection, presumably via the airborne route, for persons processing contaminated mail in postal facilities. Airborne transmission at the Brentwood and Hamilton facilities may have been facilitated by the use of high-speed sorters, as well as air-blowers used for routine cleaning. Any future investigations of bioterrorism-related anthrax should evaluate persons potentially exposed along the path of the delivery vehicle as well as those targeted by the attack.

### Vital signs: characteristics of drug overdose deaths involving opioids and stimulants-24 States and the district of columbia, January-June 2019 [^bdaa7354]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This report provides three critical insights that can inform overdose prevention efforts. First, approximately 80% of overdose deaths involved opioids, and three of four opioid overdose deaths involved IMFs. The supply of IMFs and overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids excluding methadone (primarily IMFs) are projected to have increased for the seventh straight year in 2019. §§§§ Second, IMFs, heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine (alone or in combination) were involved in nearly 85% of overdose deaths. Complicating intervention and treatment efforts, one half of these deaths involved two or more of these four drugs. Third, potential opportunities for intervention, which could be targeted for overdose prevention, were documented in approximately 60% of overdose deaths.

Interventions should address characteristics of overdoses involving IMFs. First, IMFs can be highly potent (e.g. fentanyl has 50–100 times the potency of morphine; carfentanil has 30–100 times the potency of fentanyl), and use might quickly progress to overdose, especially when injected. Consequently, improving overdose response time by expanding community naloxone distribution, increasing naloxone prescribing and dispensing from pharmacies, and encouraging persons to not use drugs when alone might reduce IMF overdose deaths. Second, powdered IMFs are often sold as or mixed with white powdered heroin (primarily east of the Mississippi River) with or without the knowledge of the person buying the products, but deaths involving IMFs and products containing IMFs are less prevalent in western black tar heroin markets. Mixing of IMFs into heroin, and in some places IMFs supplanting the heroin supply, is increasing over time, consistent with findings that more than seven in 10 (73.6%) heroin-involved overdose deaths co-involved IMFs. Pressing IMFs into counterfeit prescription pills resembling both prescription opioids and other drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines) has allowed IMFs to spread into additional drug markets. IMFs are difficult to mix consistently, resulting in possibly varying concentrations of IMFs between and within products, or persons might use IMFs when expecting to use heroin, other opioids, or (rarely) nonopioids; either could increase the risk for overdose. Interventions conducted by risk reduction organizations (e.g. syringe services programs) to reduce overdoses among persons exposed to IMFs (e.g. naloxone distribution) and to link populations at high risk (e.g. persons who inject drugs) with prevention and treatment services might mitigate these overdose risks. ††††† Finally, timely response by public health and public safety officials to growing threats such as mixing of IMFs in nonopioid products, and outbreaks involving fentanyl analogs (e.g. carfentanil) is warranted. §§§§§

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^28074efb]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Appendix E — Monitoring patients during withdrawal management — specifies minimum monitoring frequencies and use of withdrawal symptom scales by substance. For alcohol, re-assessment using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) at least every 8 hours during alcohol withdrawal management until the CIWA-Ar score remains below 10 for 24 hours; if the CIWA-Ar is ≥ 19, repeat the CIWA-Ar at least every 6 hours during alcohol withdrawal management until the score falls below 19, then continue monitoring with the CIWA-Ar at least every 8 hours until the score remains below 10 for 24 hours. For sedatives, perform daily clinical assessment by a qualified health care professional for at least the first week or as condition indicates, then after the first week re-assess by a qualified health care professional at least two times per week until withdrawal management is complete. For opioids, monitor using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score (COWS) at least every 4 hours for patients who report use of a short-acting opioid (e.g., heroin, oxycodone, fentanyl), and monitor using the COWS at least every 8 hours for patients who report using long-acting opioids (e.g., extended-release formulations, methadone). For stimulants, monitoring, at an interval determined by the treating clinician, is for suicide risk, cardiac complications, severe or persistent psychosis, significant agitation, and possible opioid withdrawal (due to potential contamination of stimulant drugs). The page cautions that the most frequent monitoring noted is the minimum expectation and providers may need to increase monitoring, and it notes that clinical assessments should be conducted by qualified health care professionals not less than twice per day, not more than 16 hours apart unless otherwise stated.
