## Question

Does having a known MSH6 gene mean you are not an MSH2 carrier?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a person with a known pathogenic MSH6 variant can also be an MSH2 carrier, and whether identifying MSH6 effectively rules out MSH2 carriage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the genetic architecture of Lynch syndrome and whether MSH2 and MSH6 are independent loci. Then, I should verify inheritance patterns and the functional interaction between MSH2 and MSH6. Next, I will review prevalence data and the probability of dual pathogenic variants, and check if large cohorts report individuals or families with more than one MMR gene mutation. After that, I need to evaluate current testing practices and what a negative MSH2 result means when an MSH6 pathogenic variant has been found. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications for counseling and whether further testing is indicated in practice [^112X5jsQ].

> Let me first confirm the genetic framework. Lynch syndrome results from pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair genes — classically MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, with EPCAM deletions secondarily silencing MSH2 — so the relevant loci are distinct and inherited independently on different chromosomes, even though their protein products interact in the MMR pathway [^112X5jsQ].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about function versus inheritance. MSH2 and MSH6 proteins form the MutSα heterodimer for mismatch recognition, but the genes themselves are separate loci with independent Mendelian transmission; carrying a pathogenic variant in MSH6 does not biologically "protect" against also carrying a separate pathogenic variant in MSH2, even though the proteins are partners functionally [^115n9upw] [^112X5jsQ].

> Now, let me think about probability and empirical observation. Population prevalence estimates for Lynch syndrome range approximately from 1:370 to 1:226 depending on the population studied, with substantial gene-specific and population-specific variation, implying that the joint probability of independent pathogenic variants in two different MMR genes in one person is the product of two rare events and therefore extremely low in outbred populations [^113cYVVQ] [^1173yXtF]. Initially, I thought no studies reported individuals or families with dual pathogenic variants across MMR genes, but wait, I should double-check that assumption, because some registry descriptions include families with more than one mutated MMR gene, such as MLH1 plus PMS2 in the same family, which implies that dual-carrier individuals can occur, albeit rarely, in certain lineages or founder contexts [^115Db8AM].

> Next, I should review how large cohorts categorize carriers. Major cohort and registry analyses typically assign probands and families to mutually exclusive gene categories for risk estimation — MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 — which reflects analytical design rather than impossibility of dual mutations; this practice does not exclude the rare existence of dual carriers but underscores how uncommon they are in clinical series [^115z8gna] [^115UMii1] [^113s1wgk]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — the mutual exclusivity in study tables is methodological, not biological, so I should not misinterpret that as evidence that dual carriage cannot happen [^115z8gna].

> I will now examine testing workflows. In current practice, germline evaluation for suspected Lynch syndrome is commonly performed via multigene panels that include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM, often prompted by universal tumor screening and/or risk models like PREMM5; such panels would typically detect a second pathogenic variant if present at assayable sensitivity and coverage [^117QU3Hz] [^111m3vkV] [^1134hBAN] [^1169xboJ]. Wait, I should verify the implication — if comprehensive panel testing was done and MSH2 was negative, that result at that point in time effectively rules out being an MSH2 carrier within the test's technical limits; however, if only targeted MSH6 testing was performed, then MSH2 status remains unknown until a broader panel is completed [^117QU3Hz] [^1169xboJ].

> Let me consider clinical interpretation and counseling. Identification of a clearly pathogenic MSH6 variant establishes Lynch syndrome due to MSH6 and guides gene-specific risk management; searching for a second MMR gene mutation is not routinely indicated unless there are red flags such as an atypically severe or discordant tumor phenotype in the proband or family that exceeds what is expected for MSH6 alone, in which case expanded testing or reanalysis could be reasonable [^115jr2AA] [^112X5jsQ]. I should confirm that guidelines emphasize gene-informed management and reserve further germline interrogation for cases with unexplained mismatch repair patterns or phenotypes out of keeping with the known variant, rather than reflexively seeking a second hit in a different MMR gene [^115jr2AA].

> But wait, what if tumor testing shows a pattern inconsistent with the germline MSH6 variant, such as isolated MSH2/MSH6 loss suggesting upstream MSH2 involvement, or double somatic events explaining dMMR without a second germline lesion? In that scenario, I need to check for somatic MMR defects, MLH1 methylation when relevant, or other explanations before invoking a second germline mutation, because tumor-level mechanisms frequently explain discordant IHC/MSI findings in Lynch-like cases [^117KVWTF] [^114hTJBQ].

> Pulling this together, I should double-check my bottom line. Genetically, carrying a pathogenic MSH6 variant does not preclude also being an MSH2 carrier; it's just exceptionally unlikely in the general population. In practice, if comprehensive germline panel testing has shown MSH6 pathogenic and MSH2 negative, then the individual is not an MSH2 carrier to the limits of that assay, and further MSH2 testing is unnecessary unless there are unusual clinical or tumor features prompting re-evaluation or updated testing over time as methods evolve [^117QU3Hz] [^115jr2AA] [^1173yXtF].

No, a known pathogenic MSH6 variant does not preclude being an MSH2 carrier; although co-occurrence is rare, **independent testing** of MSH2 is needed if clinical suspicion remains. MSH6 and MSH2 are distinct genes [^116zsqFP] with **separate inheritance**, and standard testing panels **assess each gene individually**.

---

## Genetic relationship between MSH6 and MSH2

- **Distinct genes**: MSH6 and MSH2 are separate mismatch repair genes on different chromosomes, inherited independently.
- **Independent inheritance**: A pathogenic MSH6 variant does not exclude an MSH2 variant; both can co-occur, though this is rare.
- **Functional interaction**: MSH2 and MSH6 form the MutSα heterodimer for mismatch recognition [^116zsqFP], but each gene is tested separately.

---

## Clinical implications of MSH6 and MSH2 mutations

Clinically, **cancer risk** is increased for colorectal and endometrial cancers with both genes, but MSH2 generally confers a higher and broader risk than MSH6 [^115z8gna] [^116QQGyw]. For **surveillance**, management should be tailored to gene-specific risks [^112ZCis1] [^115jr2AA].

---

## Genetic testing and interpretation

In genetic evaluation, **testing panels** (e.g. PREMM5) assess MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM separately [^1169xboJ]. For **interpretation**, a pathogenic MSH6 result does not rule out an MSH2 variant; each gene must be evaluated independently.

---

## Rare co-occurrence of MSH6 and MSH2 mutations

Rare co-occurrence of MSH6 and MSH2 mutations has been reported; **double heterozygosity** is uncommon, and both genes should be tested if clinical suspicion persists. For **clinical significance**, co-occurrence may increase cancer risk and affect management.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Per clinical guidelines and recommendations, **independent testing** means testing each MMR gene separately; a pathogenic result in one does not exclude others. **Genetic counseling** should be provided to explain results, risks, and management [^114FXJPV].

---

## Conclusion

A known pathogenic MSH6 variant does not exclude MSH2 carrier status; **independent testing** of MSH2 is still required if suspicion remains.

### Canadian consensus for the assessment and testing of Lynch syndrome [^112ZCis1]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2025). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common inherited cause of colorectal and endometrial cancer (EC). It is caused by monoallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (PV/LPV) in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, as well as deletions in the 3'UTR region of the EPCAM gene, which induce epigenetic silencing of MSH2.

Estimates of cancer penetrance in LS are evolving, both in terms of types of associated malignancies and gene-specific risks. The Prospective Lynch Syndrome Database studied 6,350 confirmed LS carriers from 25 countries, including 173 Canadian families. The study reported that MLH1 and MSH2/EPCAM carriers have the highest lifetime risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (Female (F)/Male (M): MLH1 48.3%/57.1%, MSH2 46.6%/51.4%), with lower risks observed in MSH6 and PMS2 (F/M: MSH6 20.3%/11.7%, PMS2 10.4%). Despite these quoted lifetime cancer risks, only 14% of MSH2 and MLH1 carriers have the typically quoted CRC risk. A very small percentage of MSH6 and PMS2 carriers have an unexpectedly high CRC risk, suggesting that other factors impact risk among gene carriers. While the exact risk factors for cancer in LS are unknown, it may be influenced by geographical location and family cancer burden.

EC is the most penetrant cancer among females with MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6, and PMS2 PV, and the second most common cancer in MLH1 PV. PMS2-LS has an EC lifetime risk of 12.8%, and the remaining MMR gene carriers have a risk ranging from 37% to 49%. It is the sentinel cancer in 51% of female carriers. LS carriers are at higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.

### Suspected Lynch syndrome associated MSH6 variants: A functional assay to determine their pathogenicity [^116zsqFP]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited predisposition to various malignancies at a young age, primarily colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC). It is caused by inactivating germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2, or by a deletion in the 3' region of the EPCAM gene that affects MSH2 expression.

The DNA MMR system is essential for the fidelity of DNA replication. Its primary function is the correction of base-base mismatches and insertion-deletion loops that may arise during DNA replication. Base-base mismatches are recognized by the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer, while MSH2-MSH3 detects loops of unpaired bases. Following mismatch binding, the MSH heterodimers recruit another heterodimer, MLH1-PMS2, to coordinate removal and resynthesis of the error-containing strand. A second function of the DNA MMR system is to mediate the toxicity of certain DNA-damaging agents such as methylating agents and thiopurines. These DNA-damaging agents create adducts in the genome that give rise to mismatches when replicated. The DNA MMR system recognizes the mismatches but removes the incorporated nucleotide rather than the lesion itself, creating a repetitive cycle of nucleotide incorporation and deletion that ultimately leads to DNA breakage and cell death. In the absence of MMR, cells tolerate methylation damage but consequently show high levels of DNA damage-induced mutagenesis on top of a strongly elevated level of spontaneous mutagenesis.

### Current clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome are not sensitive enough to identify MSH6 mutation carriers [^113yRuFL]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, Norwegian cancer genetic clinics have recruited families with an aggregation of cancers of any type. Thousands of cancer kindreds have been examined for hereditary cancer syndromes. Reports from this are listed on. Upon referral, the families were classified using preset wide-ranging criteria, and IHC/MSI analyses were performed not only on the families that met the clinical criteria for HNPCC and familial CRC. We here report the sensitivities of the AMSI, AMSII, and BII criteria when applied to families that were shown by genetic testing to have an MMR mutation. As Norwegian legislation dictates that genetic testing is restricted to clinical departments, and as all genetic departments collaborated in this report, we here present a complete report of all clinical genetic activity in a defined population up to November 2009.

### Functional analysis of MSH2 unclassified variants found in suspected Lynch syndrome patients reveals pathogenicity due to attenuated mismatch repair [^111TuLhp]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by high colorectal and endometrial cancer risks, is caused by inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Mutations fully abrogating gene function are unambiguously disease causing. However, missense mutations often have unknown functional implications, hampering genetic counseling. We have applied a novel approach to study three MSH2 unclassified variants (UVs) found in Dutch families with suspected Lynch syndrome.

- **Methods**: The three mutations were recreated in the endogenous Msh2 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells by oligonucleotide-directed gene modification. The effect of the UVs on MMR activity was then tested using a set of functional assays interrogating the main MMR functions.

- **Results**: We recreated and functionally tested three MSH2 UVs: MSH2-Y165D (c.493T > G), MSH2-Q690E (c.2068C > G), and MSH2-M813V (c.2437A > G). We observed reduced levels of MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E but not MSH2-M813V proteins. MSH2-M813V was able to support all MMR functions similar to wild-type MSH2, whereas MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E showed partial defects.

- **Conclusions**: Based on the results from our functional assays, we conclude that the MSH2-M813V variant is not disease causing. The MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E variants affect MMR function and are therefore likely the underlying cause of familial cancer predisposition. Since the MMR defect is partial, these variants may represent low penetrance alleles.

### Cancer risks associated with germline mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes in Lynch syndrome [^115z8gna]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Providing accurate estimates of cancer risks is a major challenge in the clinical management of Lynch syndrome. The objective of this study is to estimate the age-specific cumulative risks of developing various tumors using a large series of families with mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Families with Lynch syndrome were enrolled between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009, from 40 French cancer genetics clinics participating in the ERISCAM (Estimation des Risques de Cancer chez les porteurs de mutation des gènes MMR) study. A total of 537 families with segregating mutated genes (248 with MLH1; 256 with MSH2; and 33 with MSH6) were analyzed.

- **Main outcome measure**: Age-specific cumulative cancer risks were estimated using the genotype restricted likelihood (GRL) method, accounting for ascertainment bias.

- **Results**: Significant differences in estimated cumulative cancer risk were found between the three mutated genes (P = 0.01). The estimated cumulative risks of colorectal cancer by age 70 years were 41% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 25%-70%) for MLH1 mutation carriers, 48% (95% CI, 30%-77%) for MSH2, and 12% (95% CI, 8%-22%) for MSH6. For endometrial cancer, corresponding risks were 54% (95% CI, 20%-80%), 21% (95% CI, 8%-77%), and 16% (95% CI, 8%-32%). For ovarian cancer, they were 20% (95% CI, 1%-65%), 24% (95% CI, 3%-52%), and 1% (95% CI, 0%-3%). The estimated cumulative risks by age 40 years did not exceed 2% (95% CI, 0%-7%) for endometrial cancer nor 1% (95% CI, 0%-3%) for ovarian cancer, irrespective of the gene.

### Development and validation of the PREMM model for comprehensive risk assessment of Lynch syndrome [^117QU3Hz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of Lynch syndrome (LS) prediction models is to quantify the risk to an individual of carrying a pathogenic germline mutation in three mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. We developed a new prediction model, PREMM 5, that incorporates the genes PMS2 and EPCAM to provide comprehensive LS risk assessment.

PREMM 5 was developed to predict the likelihood of a mutation in any of the LS genes by using polytomous logistic regression analysis of clinical and germline data from 18,734 individuals who were tested for all five genes. Predictors of mutation status included sex, age at genetic testing, and proband and family cancer histories. Discrimination was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and clinical impact was determined by decision curve analysis; comparisons were made to the existing PREMM 1,2,6 model. External validation of PREMM 5 was performed in a clinic-based cohort of 1,058 patients with colorectal cancer.

Results showed that pathogenic mutations were detected in 1,000 (5%) of 18,734 patients in the development cohort; mutations included MLH1 (n = 306), MSH2 (n = 354), MSH6 (n = 177), PMS2 (n = 141), and EPCAM (n = 22). PREMM 5 distinguished carriers from non-carriers with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), and performance was similar in the validation cohort (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.92). Prediction was more difficult for PMS2 mutations (AUC, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.68) than for other genes. The performance characteristics of PREMM 5 exceeded those of PREMM 1,2,6.

### Prediction of germline mutations and cancer risk in the Lynch syndrome [^114VvAiY]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Identifying families at high risk for Lynch syndrome (i.e. hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) is critical for both genetic counseling and cancer prevention. Clinical guidelines are effective but limited by applicability and cost.

The objective was to develop and validate a genetic counseling and risk prediction tool that estimates the probability of carrying a deleterious mutation in mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6, and the probability of developing colorectal or endometrial cancer.

The design, setting, and patients involved external validation of the MMRpro model, conducted on 279 individuals from 226 clinic-based families in the United States, Canada, and Australia (referred between 1993–2005). This was done by comparing model predictions with results of highly sensitive germline mutation detection techniques. MMRpro models the autosomal dominant inheritance of mismatch repair mutations, with parameters based on meta-analyses of the penetrance and prevalence of mutations and the predictive values of tumor characteristics. The model's prediction is tailored to each individual's detailed family history information on colorectal and endometrial cancer and to tumor characteristics, including microsatellite instability.

The main outcome measure was the ability of MMRpro to correctly predict mutation carrier status, as measured by operating characteristics, calibration, and overall accuracy.

Results showed that in the independent validation, MMRpro provided a concordance index of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.88) and a ratio of observed to predicted cases of 0.94 (95% confidence).

### Associations of pathogenic variants in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 with risk of colorectal adenomas and tumors and with somatic mutations in patients with Lynch syndrome [^113SWADQ]. Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome is caused by variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). In patients with Lynch syndrome, CRCs can develop via different pathways. We studied associations between Lynch syndrome-associated variants in MMR genes, risks of adenoma and CRC, and somatic mutations in APC and CTNNB1 in tumors in an international cohort of patients.

- **Methods**: We combined clinical and molecular data from three studies. Clinical data were obtained from 2,747 patients with Lynch syndrome associated with variants in MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 from Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland. These patients received at least two surveillance colonoscopies and were followed for a median time of 7.8 years for the development of adenomas or CRC. We performed DNA sequence analyses of 48 colorectal tumors (from 16 patients with mutations in MLH1, 29 patients with mutations in MSH2, and three with mutations in MSH6) for somatic mutations in APC and CTNNB1.

- **Results**: The risk of advanced adenoma in 10 years was 17.8% in patients with pathogenic variants in MSH2 compared to 7.7% in MLH1 (P < .001). Higher proportions of patients with pathogenic variants in MLH1 or MSH2 developed CRC in 10 years (11.3% and 11.4%) than patients with pathogenic variants in MSH6 (4.7%), with P-values of .001 and .003 for MLH1 and MSH2 vs MSH6, respectively. Somatic mutations in APC were found in 75% of tumors from patients with pathogenic variants in MSH2 vs 11% in MLH1 (P = 0.015). Somatic mutations in CTNNB1 were found in 50% of tumors from patients with pathogenic variants in MLH1 compared to 7% in those from MSH6.

### Comprehensive population-wide analysis of Lynch syndrome in Iceland reveals founder mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 [^1173yXtF]. Nature Communications (2017). High credibility.

The MLH1 germline translocation described is, to our knowledge, the first case of a translocation causing Lynch syndrome (LS). The translocation is passed to offspring, and affected family members had close to 100% cancer penetrance. Screening for translocations should be considered where LS is suspected and germline mutations cannot be found.

The population-based prevalence of LS has been estimated in colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer studies in several countries, but no country has determined the prevalence empirically. It has been postulated that LS prevalence is higher than estimated in most studies, and here we show the highest prevalence so far: 0.442% or 1:226 individuals. Notably, the prevalence is higher than elsewhere, even though the proportion of LS in CRC is just 2.3%. This is due to the markedly low cancer penetrance of the MSH6 and PMS2 mutations in Iceland, as compared with cancer penetrance associated with MLH1 and MSH2 mutations, which dominate in most populations.

One of the strengths of this study is the ability to determine cancer risk for each of the imputable mutations. This will help tailor genetic counseling in Iceland, specific to the individual mutation. The MSH6 p. Leu585Pro mutation is associated with a high (∼50%) lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, while the PMS2 mutations (p. Pro246Cysfs*3 and p. Met1?) have a lower lifetime risk of cancer. One of the limitations of this study is the small size of the population, which makes it difficult to estimate the risk of rare cancers such as brain cancer, as confidence intervals around odds ratios are wide.

### The PREMM(1,2,6) model predicts risk of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 germline mutations based on cancer history [^117D8Vdm]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

We developed and validated a model to estimate the risks of mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 based on personal and family history of cancer.

- **Methods**: Data were analyzed from 4,539 probands tested for mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. A multivariable polytomous logistic regression model (PREMM(1,2,6)) was developed to predict the overall risk of MMR gene mutations and the risk of mutation in each of the three genes. The discriminative ability of the model was validated in 1,827 population-based colorectal cancer (CRC) cases.

- **Results**: Twelve percent of the original cohort carried pathogenic mutations (204 in MLH1, 250 in MSH2, and 71 in MSH6). The PREMM(1,2,6) model incorporated the following factors from the probands and first- and second-degree relatives (odds ratio; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]): male sex (1.9; 1.5–2.4), a CRC (4.3; 3.3–5.6), multiple CRCs (13.7; 8.5–22), endometrial cancer (6.1; 4.6–8.2), and extracolonic cancers (3.3; 2.4–4.6). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82–0.91) for MLH1 mutation carriers, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83–0.92) for MSH2, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.69–0.93) for MSH6; in validation, they were 0.88 for the overall cohort (95% CI, 0.86–0.90) and the population-based cases (95% CI, 0.83–0.92).

- **Conclusions**: We developed the PREMM(1,2,6) model, which incorporates information on cancer history from probands and their relatives to estimate an individual's risk of mutations in the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. This web-based decision-making tool can be used to…

### Comprehensive molecular analysis of mismatch repair gene defects in suspected Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) cases [^1169xboJ]. Cancer Research (2009). Low credibility.

An accurate algorithm is essential for effective molecular diagnosis of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we have extended the analysis of 71 CRC cases suspected to be Lynch syndrome cases for MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 gene defects. All cases were screened for mutations in MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6, and all cases where tumors were available were screened for microsatellite instability (MSI) and expression of MSH2 and MLH1. Subsequently, mutation-negative cases were screened for MLH1 methylation and mutations in PMS2. Of the MSI-high (MSI-H) cases, 96% had a mismatch repair (MMR) gene defect, mostly involving MSH2 or MLH1; one PMS2 mutation, one MLH1 epimutation, and no MSH6 mutations were found. Four of the 28 MSI-H cases, including one Amsterdam criteria case, had biallelic tumor MLH1 methylation, indicating that sporadic cases can be admixed in with Lynch syndrome cases, even those meeting the strongest criteria for Lynch syndrome. MMR gene defects were found in similar frequency in cases where tumors were and were not available. One MLH1 and one MSH2 deletion mutation were found in MSI-stable/low cases, indicating that MSI testing can exclude cases with pathogenic mutations. Our analysis supports a diagnostic algorithm where cases are selected for analysis based on clinical criteria or prediction models; isolated sporadic young-onset cases can be prescreened by tumor testing, whereas familial cases may be directly subjected to molecular analysis for mutations in MMR genes followed by MSI, protein expression, and DNA methylation analysis to aid in the resolution of mu.

### Functional analysis of MSH6 mutations linked to kindreds with putative hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome [^111ngVKZ]. Human Molecular Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, five mismatch-repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MSH3, and PMS2, are known to be involved in human MMR function. Two of these, MLH1 and MSH2, are the most common susceptibility genes for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), while MSH3 and PMS2 are seldom (PMS2) or not at all (MSH3) reported to be involved in HNPCC. Despite the increasing number of MSH6 germline mutations, their pathogenicity remains questionable because the mutations are mainly linked to putative HNPCC families lacking the typical clinical and molecular characteristics of the syndrome, such as early age at onset and high microsatellite instability (MSI). High MSI is a consequence of MMR defect, and the pathogenicity of germline mutations in HNPCC is thus linked to malfunction of MMR.

To address the question of whether and how MSH6 mutations cause susceptibility to HNPCC, we studied heterodimerization of four MSH6 variants with MSH2 and the functionality of these MutSalpha complexes in an in vitro MMR assay. All mutations occurred in putative HNPCC patients. Irrespective of the type or the site of the amino acid substitutions, all the variants repaired G.T mismatches to A.T as wild-type MSH6 protein. However, the MSH6 protein carrying a mutation in the MSH2/MSH6 interaction region was poorly expressed, suggesting problems in its stability.

Our results are clinically relevant, as they demonstrate that under stable in vitro conditions, when the amounts of proteins are adequate for repair, the tested MSH6 mutations do not affect repair function.

### Unexplained mismatch repair deficiency: Case closed [^114hTJBQ]. HGG Advances (2023). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS; MIM) is the most prevalent form of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC). LS is caused by pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MLH1 (MIM), MSH2 (MIM), MSH6 (MIM), and PMS2 (MIM), or by the deletion of the 3′ end of the EpCAM gene (MIM). To identify LS carriers, most Western countries now perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRCs and endometrial carcinomas (ECs) to assess the presence of MMR proteins. The absence of at least one MMR protein indicates underlying LS and necessitates further LS diagnostics. This includes the assessment of MLH1 promoter hypermethylation (with or without BRAF analysis), MMR germline analysis, and examination of the tumor for somatic MMR pathogenic variants (PVs).

Upon complete LS diagnostics, the majority of MMR-deficient (MMRd) CRCs have explained causes. However, for the remaining MMRd tumors, their cause remains unexplained (UMMRd). While risk estimates for CRC development in patients with UMMRd are lower than in LS carriers, they are higher than in the general population. It is currently unclear to what extent these patients are at risk for developing LS-associated tumors. This uncertainty complicates the creation of an accurate surveillance strategy for these patients and their relatives.

Additionally, estimates of UMMRd percentages differ. A recent meta-analysis performed by our group showed that the number of UMMRd cases found largely depended on age cutoff and diagnostics performed. In general, 4.2% of all CRCs remain unexplained. However, in studies where somatic PV analysis was conducted, the statistics may vary.

### Two integrated and highly predictive functional analysis-based procedures for the classification of MSH6 variants in Lynch syndrome [^112mXSh6]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The mechanism of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency of MSH6 alleles was identified in the genetic screen.

- **Western blot analysis**: Total lysates from MSH6-variant ES cells were analyzed. PCNA served as a loading control. In addition to MSH6, we also probed for MSH2. Since the stability of MSH2 depends on MSH6, MSH2 protein levels are a surrogate marker for MSH6 protein stability.

- **Electrophoretic mobility shift assay**: The binding of control and MSH6-variant proteins to a G·T mismatch within a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe was assessed. Bars represent the mean ± S.E.M. of more than three experiments.

- **Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced mismatch release**: ATP-induced mismatch release was evaluated for MSH6-variant proteins in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ATP (0.5 mM) was added after allowing proteins to bind to the probe. For clarity, all (-) ATP reactions are normalized to 1, and all (+) ATP reactions are normalized to their respective (-) ATP reactions. Bars represent the mean ± S.E.M. of more than three experiments.

- **Higher ATP concentrations**: MSH6-mutant proteins deficient in ATP-induced release were challenged with higher amounts of ATP in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

### Association of mismatch repair mutation with age at cancer onset in Lynch syndrome: Implications for stratified surveillance strategies [^116GkCh7]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that promotes an extra tier of risk stratification according to mutation type, and not just the mutated gene. Cancer surveillance could be started later for individuals with MSH6 mutations, and surveillance for EC could be started later in those with truncating MLH1 mutations.

### Two integrated and highly predictive functional analysis-based procedures for the classification of MSH6 variants in Lynch syndrome [^116CD9N4]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS, OMIM 120435) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition caused by a germline defect in a single allele of one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, or PMS2. Sporadic somatic loss of the wild-type allele results in cellular MMR deficiency. The mutator phenotype that results from the inability to correct DNA replication errors lies at the origin of LS-associated colorectal and endometrial cancers.

Missense variants comprise a significant fraction of the genetic variants identified in the MMR genes, particularly in MSH6. In cases where such a variant cannot be classified as (likely) pathogenic or (likely) non-pathogenic, personalized health care for affected families cannot be implemented.

The Variant Interpretation Committee (VIC) of the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors (InSiGHT) has devised the use of qualitative or quantitative integration of evidence to classify variants in the MMR genes, employing standards set by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Unfortunately, classification of MSH6 variants has proven particularly difficult due to the relatively low penetrance of cancer in LS patients with a proven MSH6 defect, complicating the use of cosegregation as a diagnostic tool. For this reason, the VIC has been able to classify only a few MSH6 variants as pathogenic (IARC class 5, probability of pathogenicity > 0.99), likely pathogenic (IARC class 4, probability of pathogenicity > 0.95), likely not pathogenic (IARC class 2, probability of pathogenicity < 0.05), or not pathogenic.

### Somatic mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are a frequent cause of mismatch-repair deficiency in Lynch syndrome-like tumors [^117KVWTF]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and tumors associated with this condition are characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI). However, a considerable number of MSI-positive tumors have no known molecular mechanism of development.

By using Sanger and ion semiconductor sequencing, 25 MSI-positive tumors were screened for somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity in mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and mutS homolog 2 (MSH2). In 13 of 25 tumors (8 MLH1-deficient and 5 MSH2-deficient tumors), we identified two somatic mutations in these genes. We conclude that two acquired events explain the MMR deficiency in more than 50% of the MMR-deficient tumors without causal germline mutations or promoter methylation.

### Genetic anticipation in Swedish Lynch syndrome families [^115Db8AM]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Among hereditary colorectal cancer-predisposing syndromes, Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2, is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early-onset colon and endometrial cancer, as well as other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families, and genetic anticipation — i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations — has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases, and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala, and Umeå between the years 1990–2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families, including one family with an EPCAM–MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1,028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1,003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study.

Using a normal random effects model (NREM), we estimate a 2.1-year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model also supported this finding.

### A durable response to pembrolizumab in a patient with uterine serous carcinoma and Lynch syndrome due to the MSH6 germline mutation [^114oJMoK]. The Oncologist (2021). Low credibility.

Pembrolizumab, a programmed death 1 ligand (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor, has elicited responses in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient advanced solid tumors, leading to its agnostic approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2017 when no other therapeutic options are available. However, there are still insufficient data on the response to checkpoint inhibitors in advanced endometrial cancer related to Lynch syndrome (LS) and, specifically, in uterine serous carcinoma, which is uncommon in LS.

Here we report a case of metastatic uterine serous carcinoma due to a germline MSH6 mutation (Lynch syndrome) that was discovered because of a patient's tumor MMR deficiency. The patient was started on first-line pembrolizumab in 2018 and sustained a partial response. She remains asymptomatic and progression-free for more than 2 years. Tumor sequencing showed a high mutational burden and an upstream somatic mutation in the same gene, p.F1088fs. Immunohistochemical staining was negative for PD-L1 expression.

We discuss clinical characteristics of the patient, molecular features of her tumor, and the mechanism of her tumor response. We also discuss the duration of immunotherapy in her case. Our case demonstrated a partial response and a long-term remission from the frontline single-agent pembrolizumab in a woman with metastatic uterine serous carcinoma and Lynch syndrome due to a germline MSH6 gene mutation. Our experience suggests a potential significant clinical benefit of checkpoint inhibitors used as single agents early on in the treatment of MMR-deficient/high microsatellite instability tumors.

### MSH6 and PMS2 germ-line pathogenic variants implicated in Lynch syndrome are associated with breast cancer [^115yW7KV]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). High credibility.

This study suggests that women with pathogenic variants (PVs) in MSH6 or PMS2 may benefit from increased breast cancer screening. Replication of our gene-specific breast cancer risks will be important to the future development of breast cancer management guidelines for female Lynch syndrome (LS) patients. In addition, further assessment of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in breast tumors may provide more information to evaluate the link between MMR genes and breast cancer. Finally, family studies of additional individuals with MMR PVs may also provide better breast cancer risk estimates.

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that PVs in MSH6 or PMS2 are associated with a modest but statistically significant increased risk for breast cancer. Previously, identifying a PV in MSH6 or PMS2 in a woman with breast cancer may have been considered an incidental finding. Here, we show that PVs in MSH6 or PMS2 are associated with breast cancer and that these MMR genes should be considered when ordering a multigene panel for women with a personal or family history of breast cancer.

### MSH2 mutation carriers are at higher risk of cancer than MLH1 mutation carriers: A study of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer families [^116jH5X7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the clustering of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and various other cancers. The disease is caused by mutations in DNA-mismatch-repair (MMR) genes, most frequently in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6. The aims of the present study were to compare the risk of developing colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers between families with the various MMR-gene mutations.

Clinical and pathologic data were collected from 138 families with HNPCC. Mutation analyses were performed for all families. Survival analysis was used to calculate the cumulative risk of developing cancer in the various subsets of relatives.

Mutations were identified in 79 families: 34 in MLH1, 40 in MSH2, and five in MSH6. The lifetime risk of developing cancer at any site was significantly higher for MSH2 mutation carriers than for MLH1 mutation carriers (P < .01). The risk of developing colorectal or endometrial cancer was higher in MSH2 mutation carriers than in MLH1 mutation carriers, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.13 and P = 0.057, respectively). MSH2 mutation carriers were found to have a significantly higher risk of developing cancer of the urinary tract (P < .05). The risk of developing cancer of the ovaries, stomach, and brain was also higher in the MSH2 mutation carriers than in the MLH1 mutation carriers, but the difference was not statistically significant.

Pending large prospective studies, the extension of the surveillance program is necessary.

### Pms2 monoallelic mutation carriers: the known unknown [^112bGjAY]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Germ-line mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 have been shown to cause Lynch syndrome. The penetrance of the cancer and tumor spectrum has been repeatedly studied, and multiple professional societies have proposed clinical management guidelines for affected individuals. Several studies have demonstrated a reduced penetrance for monoallelic carriers of PMS2 mutations compared with the other mismatch repair (MMR) genes, but clinical management guidelines have largely proposed the same screening recommendations for all MMR gene carriers.

The authors considered whether enough evidence existed to propose new screening guidelines specific to PMS2 mutation carriers with regard to age at onset and frequency of colonic screening. Published reports of PMS2 germ-line mutations were combined with unpublished cases from the authors' research registries and clinical practices, and a discussion of potential modification of cancer screening guidelines was pursued.

A total of 234 monoallelic PMS2 mutation carriers from 170 families were included. Approximately 8% of those with colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed before age 30, and each of these tumors presented on the left side of the colon. As it is currently unknown what causes the early onset of CRC in some families with monoallelic PMS2 germline mutations, the authors recommend against reducing cancer surveillance guidelines in families found having monoallelic PMS2 mutations in spite of the reduced penetrance.

### Molecular and clinical characteristics of MSH6 variants: An analysis of 25 index carriers of a germline variant [^113XxTma]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

The MSH6 gene is one of the mismatch-repair genes involved in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Three hundred sixteen individuals who were known or suspected to have HNPCC were analyzed for MSH6 germline mutations. For 25 index patients and 8 relatives with MSH6 variants, molecular and clinical features are described.

For analysis of microsatellite instability (MSI), the five consensus markers were used. Immunohistochemical analysis of the MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 proteins was performed. Five truncating MSH6 mutations, of which one was detected seven times, were found in 12 index patients, and 10 MSH6 variants with unknown pathogenicity were found in 13 index patients. Fourteen (54%) of 26 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and endometrial cancers showed no, or only weak, MSI. Twelve of 18 tumors of truncating-mutation carriers and 3 of 17 tumors of missense-mutation carriers showed loss of MSH6 staining. Six of the families that we studied fulfilled the original Amsterdam criteria; most families with MSH6, however, were only suspected to have HNPCC.

In families that did not fulfill the revised Amsterdam criteria, the prevalence of MSH6 variants is about the same as the prevalence of those in MLH1/MSH2. Endometrial cancer and/or atypical hyperplasia were diagnosed in 8 of 12 female carriers of MSH6 truncating mutations. Most CRCs were localized distally in the colon. Although molecularly, missense variants are labeled as doubtfully pathogenic, clinical data disclose a great resemblance between missense-variant carriers and truncating-mutation carriers. We conclude that

### Comprehensive population-wide analysis of Lynch syndrome in Iceland reveals founder mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 [^113cYVVQ]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common inherited cause of colorectal cancer (CRC) with an estimated population frequency of 1:370 to 1:2,000 in Western populations. LS is associated with an increased lifetime risk of several other cancer types, including endometrial and ovarian cancer. LS prevalence has never been determined across an entire nation.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) are hallmarks of LS-related CRC. About 15% of CRC exhibits dMMR, with 2–3% caused by germline mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or EPCAM genes, while 12% of CRC cases have somatic inactivation of MLH1 via promoter hypermethylation (MLH1-hm). Furthermore, double somatic mismatch repair (MMR) mutations may explain up to 67% of dMMR CRC cases without LS or MLH1-hm.

Several groups in Europe and the United States have recommended universal screening of CRC using MSI testing or immunohistochemistry for the MMR proteins to identify potential LS cases. MLH1-hm can be assessed directly or inferred by the presence of a somatic BRAF V600E mutation.

Due to the low frequency of individual LS mutations and heterogeneity in phenotypic expression, it has proven difficult to accurately establish population-based prevalences and assess the cancer penetrance of LS gene mutations. Furthermore, numerous reported variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) complicate genetic counseling. Recently, a collaborative effort was undertaken to reclassify MMR variants in the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT) database.

### Revised guidelines for the clinical management of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC): Recommendations by a group of European experts [^115jr2AA]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is characterized by the development of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and various other cancers, caused by a mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. In 2007, a group of European experts (the Mallorca Group) published guidelines for the clinical management of LS. Since then, substantial new information has become available, necessitating an update of the guidelines.

In 2011 and 2012, workshops were organized in Palma de Mallorca. A total of 35 specialists from 13 countries participated in the meetings. The first step was to formulate important clinical questions. Then, a systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed database and manual searches of relevant articles. During the workshops, the outcome of the literature search was discussed in detail.

The guidelines described in this paper may be helpful for the appropriate management of families with LS. Prospective controlled studies should be undertaken to further improve the care of these families.

### Two integrated and highly predictive functional analysis-based procedures for the classification of MSH6 variants in Lynch syndrome [^113Px2pG]. Genetics in medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A genetic screen was conducted for inactivating missense variants in Msh6.

- **Pipeline to generate mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell lines**:
	- I. A mES cell line, heterozygous for Msh6 (Msh6 +/−), is subjected to mutagenic treatment with ENU.
	- II. Cells that have acquired 6-TG tolerance, by loss of heterozygosity at Msh6 (Msh6 +/−) due to an ENU-induced inactivating variant at a critical residue in the monoallelic Msh6 gene (Msh6 M/−), or by an inactivating variant at the monoallelic Hprt gene (Hprt -), are selected using two brief 6-TG selections.
	- III. The unwanted Hprt -deficient clones are eliminated by culture in HAT-supplemented medium.
	- IV. Inadvertent clones that have lost the wild-type Msh6 allele by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) rather than by a missense substitution are excluded by using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
	- V. The inactivating substitution in the remaining clones is identified by sequence analysis. A "reverse diagnosis catalog" is compiled that lists inactivating substitutions at Msh6 as a proxy for pathogenic human variants.

- **Representation of all inactivating missense substitutions in Msh6**:
	- The top and bottom panels show alignments of the mismatch binding and ATPase domains of human and mouse Msh6, highlighting residues that were mutated in the genetic screen (orange boxes). Phe-X-Glu indicates the mismatch-contacting loop. The middle panel displays all other inactivating Msh6 substitutions. Numbers reflect amino acid numbering of mouse Msh6.

### Current clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome are not sensitive enough to identify MSH6 mutation carriers [^111DoZK9]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

The concept of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) was developed to denote families with inherited colorectal cancer (CRC). The Amsterdam (AMSI) criteria identified families with CRC. As extracolonic cancers, especially endometrial cancer, were shown to be part of the inherited syndrome, the revised Amsterdam criteria (AMSII) were introduced. The Bethesda guidelines included the tumor marker microsatellite instability (MSI), and the revised Bethesda criteria (BII) specified all cancers known at the time to be associated with the syndrome. Prostate cancer has recently been shown to possibly be part of the syndrome.

Germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, have been identified to cause HNPCC (reviewed by Lynch and Lynch). However, it has become clear that not all families fulfilling the clinical criteria have an identifiable deleterious mutation (hereafter called 'mutation') in one of these genes. In addition, because MMR mutations confer an increased risk of several types of cancer in addition to CRC, it has been suggested that the term Lynch syndrome should replace HNPCC in families where a mutation has been detected. This definition of Lynch syndrome will be used in the present report.

Families fulfilling the AMSII criteria without a demonstrable MMR mutation may be denoted HNPCC. Families with an aggregation of CRC and not corresponding to Lynch syndrome or HNPCC may be referred to as familial CRC. Tumors caused by mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 show a high degree of MSI.

### Risks of less common cancers in proven mutation carriers with Lynch syndrome [^116QQGyw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). High credibility.

Patients with Lynch syndrome are at high risk for colon and endometrial cancer, but are also at an elevated risk for other less common cancers. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to provide risk estimates for these less common cancers in proven carriers of pathogenic mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6.

Data were pooled from the German and Dutch national Lynch syndrome registries. Seven different cancer types were analyzed: stomach, small bowel, urinary bladder, other urothelial, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Age-, sex-, and MMR gene-specific cumulative risks (CRs) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Sex-specific incidence rates were compared with general population incidence rates by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of sex and mutated gene on cancer risk.

The cohort comprised 2,118 MMR gene mutation carriers (MLH1, n = 806; MSH2, n = 1,004; MSH6, n = 308). All cancers were significantly more frequent than in the general population. The highest risks were found for male small bowel cancer (SIR, 251; 95% CI, 177 to 346; CR at 70 years, 12.0; 95% CI, 5.7 to 18.2). Breast cancer showed an SIR of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.4) and a CR of 14.4 (95% CI, 9.5 to 19.3). MSH2 mutation carriers had a considerably higher risk of developing urothelial cancer than MLH1 or MSH6 carriers.

The sex- and gene-specific differences of less common cancer risks should be taken into account in cancer surveillance strategies for MMR gene mutation carriers.

### Two integrated and highly predictive functional analysis-based procedures for the classification of MSH6 variants in Lynch syndrome [^116GuFUZ]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Variants in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene MSH6, identified in individuals suspected of Lynch syndrome, are difficult to classify owing to the low cancer penetrance of defects in that gene. This not only obfuscates personalized health care but also the development of a rapid and reliable classification procedure that does not require clinical data.

- **Methods**: The complete in vitro MMR activity (CIMRA) assay was calibrated against clinically classified MSH6 variants and, employing Bayes' rule, integrated with computational predictions of pathogenicity. To enable the validation of this two-component classification procedure, we employed a genetic screen to generate a large set of inactivating Msh6 variants as proxies for pathogenic variants.

- **Results**: The genetic screen-derived variants established that the two-component classification procedure displays high sensitivities and specificities. Moreover, these inactivating variants enabled the direct reclassification of human variants of uncertain significance (VUS) as (likely) pathogenic.

- **Conclusion**: The two-component classification procedure and the genetic screens provide complementary approaches to rapidly and cost-effectively classify the large majority of human MSH6 variants. The approach followed here provides a template for the classification of variants in other disease-predisposing genes, facilitating the translation of personalized genomics into personalized health care.

### A prospective prostate cancer screening programme for men with pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes (IMPACT): Initial results from an international prospective study [^113Sowha]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). High credibility.

- **Summary**: Lynch syndrome is a rare familial cancer syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2. These variants predispose individuals to various cancers, predominantly colorectal and endometrial cancer. Emerging data suggest that pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes increase the risk of early-onset aggressive prostate cancer. The IMPACT study is prospectively assessing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in men with germline mismatch repair pathogenic variants. This report details the usefulness of PSA screening, prostate cancer incidence, and tumour characteristics after the first screening round in men with and without these germline pathogenic variants.

- **Methods**: The IMPACT study is an international, prospective study involving men aged 40–69 years without a previous prostate cancer diagnosis. Participants included those with a known germline pathogenic variant in the MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6 gene, alongside age-matched male controls who tested negative for a familial pathogenic variant in these genes. Recruitment was conducted through 34 genetic and urology clinics in eight countries, where participants underwent a baseline PSA screening. Men with a PSA level higher than 3.0 ng/mL were offered a transrectal, ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, followed by a histopathological analysis. All participants are subject to a minimum of 5 years' annual screening. The primary endpoint is to determine the incidence, stage, and pathology of screening-detected prostate cancer in carriers of pathogenic variants compared with non-carrier controls. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of cancer cases detected between the groups.

### Molecular pathology of Lynch syndrome [^112X5jsQ]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). High credibility.

Lynch syndrome is associated with various symptoms including fatigue, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is linked to genetic abnormalities. Mutations in specific genes such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or EPCAM are commonly observed in individuals with this syndrome.

### Dna polymerases as potential therapeutic targets for cancers deficient in the DNA mismatch repair proteins MSH2 or MLH1 [^115n9upw]. Cancer Cell (2010). Low credibility.

Germline mutations in the MMR genes MLH1 or MSH2 predispose individuals to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, which accounts for approximately 5% of all colorectal cancer cases. Furthermore, aberrant MLH1 promoter methylation has been proposed as a cause of some sporadic colorectal cancers. MSH2 and MLH1 are proposed to act as classical tumor suppressor genes, where tumor cells lose MSH2 or MLH1 function while normal cells retain at least one functional allele.

Although other functions have been ascribed to both MSH2 and MLH1, their most well-defined function is in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MMR is primarily concerned with the repair of DNA lesions that occur during DNA replication, such as DNA polymerase errors that include base-base or insertion/deletion mismatches. Recent evidence suggests that MMR proteins are also involved in the repair of DNA lesions caused by oxidative damage.

In brief, DNA mismatches are recognized by the MutSα complex, an MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer. This interaction enables MutSα to recruit the MutLα complex, a heterodimer consisting of the MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. MutLα binding stabilizes the MutSα:DNA interaction and acts as an interface between mismatch recognition by MutSα and additional proteins that excise and repair the DNA mismatch.

### Suspected Lynch syndrome associated MSH6 variants: A functional assay to determine their pathogenicity [^112itzCP]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The results of our study demonstrate that the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis screen we previously described for the characterization of MSH2 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) can be extended to MSH6 VUS. Combining oligo targeting in Msh6 ± mESCs with 6TG selection and sequence analysis allows pathogenic MSH6 variants to be distinguished from polymorphisms. The efficacy of the genetic screen was established in a proof of principle study with four known pathogenic MSH6 mutations and five polymorphisms.

This number was low due to the paucity of MSH6 variants classified with 100% certainty. Not one of the five non-pathogenic variants was identified as mismatch repair (MMR) abrogating. Among the 26 MSH6 VUS we subsequently analyzed, not one of the four variants classified as likely not pathogenic was identified as pathogenic by our screen. Functional assays established that one of the VUS, not detected as pathogenic by the screen (G565R), indeed did not influence MMR activity.

The false positive rate of the screen, i.e. the chance that the screen identified a VUS as MMR abrogating while it was a priori or a posteriori identified as (likely) non-pathogenic, was 90.0%. The sensitivity of the genetic screen is a measure of the false negative rate; it is the likelihood that a pathogenic mutation is not detected. All six InSiGHT classified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, as well as the previously proven pathogenic G1139S mutation, were recognized as MMR abrogating by the screen, translating to a sensitivity of > 85.7%.

### Suspected Lynch syndrome associated MSH6 variants: A functional assay to determine their pathogenicity [^114DYj8A]. PLOS Genetics (2017). High credibility.

The investigation involved a genetic screen to identify pathogenic MSH6 variants. The oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis screen comprises four steps for identifying pathogenic MSH6 mutations:

1. **Site-directed mutagenesis**: Introduce the variant of interest into a subset of Msh6 ± mESCs.

2. **Cell selection**: Select cells that have consequently lost mismatch repair (MMR) capacity.

3. **PCR analysis**: Exclude cells that lost MMR capacity due to the loss of the Msh6 + allele, indicating loss of heterozygosity events.

4. **Sequence analysis**: Confirm the presence of the planned mutation in the MMR-deficient cells.

- **Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis screen**:

	- Msh6 ± mESCs were exposed to LMOs encoding the mutations of interest. This exposure introduced the mutation into the endogenous Msh6 gene in approximately 1 per 1000 Msh6 ± mESCs.

	- To determine if the subset of cells carrying the mutation in the Msh6 + allele had lost MMR activity, the mESCs were treated with 6-thioguanine (6TG). MMR-proficient cells die in response to 6TG exposure, while MMR-deficient cells are 6TG resistant.

	- Cells may also lose MMR capacity due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events deleting the Msh6 + allele. To exclude these cells from further investigation, a PCR was performed that detected the presence of both Msh6 alleles.

	- 6TG-resistant LMO-exposed mESCs that maintained the Msh6 + allele were sequenced to confirm the presence of the planned mutation.

### Universal molecular screening does not effectively detect Lynch syndrome in clinical practice [^1134hBAN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by an inherited damaging mutation in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, comprises 3% of all incident colorectal cancer (CRC). Molecular testing using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR proteins is a recommended screening tool to identify LS in incident CRC. This study assessed outcomes of population-based routine molecular screening for the diagnosis of LS in a regional center.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective, consecutive case series study of universal IHC testing on cases of resected CRC from September 2004 to December 2013. Referred cases with abnormal IHC results that attended a familial cancer clinic were assessed according to modified Bethesda criteria (until 2009) or molecular criteria (from 2009).

- **Results**: A total of 1612 individuals underwent resection for CRC during the study period and had MMR testing by IHC. Of these, 274 cases (16.9%) exhibited loss of expression of MMR genes. The mean age at CRC diagnosis was 68.1 years (± standard deviation 12.7), and the mean age of those with an IHC abnormality was 71.6 (± 11.8). A total of 82 (29.9%) patients with an abnormal result were seen in a subspecialty familial cancer clinic. Patients aged under 50 (p = 0.009) and those with loss of MSH6 staining (p = 0.027) were more likely to be referred and to attend. After germline sequencing, 0.6% (10 of 82) were identified as having a clinically significant abnormality. Additionally, eight probands with pathogenic germline mutations were identified from other referrals to the service over the same time period.

While technically accurate, the yield of the screening was low.

### Suspected Lynch syndrome associated MSH6 variants: A functional assay to determine their pathogenicity [^1145DPx5]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis screen presented here is a relatively simple tool that can be used to investigate the pathogenic phenotype of many MSH6 VUS in parallel. While the evolutionary conservation of MMR justifies the use of mouse cells for the majority of VUS, testing of splice-site and intronic mutations necessitates adaptation to human cells. Also, as long as uncertainty exists about its specificity and sensitivity, functional testing needs to be combined with clinical data and in silico estimations to arrive at a reliable classification of VUS.

Conforming to the updated American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) standards and guidelines for sequence variant interpretation, we are currently transferring our functional tests to certified Clinical Genetics laboratories. We are also creating an infrastructure where test results are compared and interpreted, taking into account all available data. In this way, LS mutation carriers can be identified with the highest certainty and enrolled in tailored surveillance programs, while relatives without the mutation can be excluded from surveillance.

### Frequent mismatch-repair defects link prostate cancer to Lynch syndrome [^114CAAXq]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

A possible role for prostate cancer in Lynch syndrome has been debated based on observations of mismatch-repair defective tumors and reports of an increased risk of prostate cancer in mutation carriers. Potential inclusion of prostate cancer in the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum is relevant for family classification, risk estimates, and surveillance recommendations in mutation carriers.

- **Methods**: We used the population-based Danish HNPCC-register to identify all prostate cancers that developed in mutation carriers and in their first-degree relatives from 288 Lynch syndrome families. The tumors were evaluated for clinicopathologic features and mismatch-repair status, and the cumulative risk of prostate cancer was determined.

- **Results**: In total, 28 prostate cancers developed in 16 mutation carriers and in 12 first-degree relatives at a median age of 63 years. The majority of the tumors were high-grade tumors with Gleason scores 8–10. Prostate cancer was associated with mutations in MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6 with loss of the respective mismatch repair protein in 69% of the tumors, though an MSI-high phenotype was restricted to 13% of the tumors. The cumulative risk of prostate cancer at age 70 was 3.7% (95% CI: 2.3–4.9).

- **Conclusion**: We provide evidence to link prostate cancer to Lynch syndrome through the demonstration of MMR defective tumors and an increased risk of the disease, which suggests that prostate cancer should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of Lynch syndrome.

### Uniquemutations in colonic adenomas in an obligate germline Lynch syndrome carrier [^117YBtcA]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Low credibility.

An obligate germline Lynch syndrome carrier had four colonic adenomas removed. The adenomas were evaluated for grade of dysplasia, MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 protein expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF status, methylation status, and a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 52 cancer genes.

- **Results**: There were four tubular or tubulovillous adenomas from the hepatic flexure, rectosigmoid, and rectum: one with both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia, one with high-grade dysplasia only, and two with low-grade dysplasia. All four adenomas showed retention of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 but complete loss of PMS2 in both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia areas. Two of the four adenomas were MSI-high, BRAF V600E wild type, and were not MLH1 methylated. NGS identified an MLH1 germline variant: NM_000249.3: c.1558+1 G > A, p.(?) in all tissue (adenomas and normal), likely explaining the pathophysiology of Lynch syndrome in this patient. Other variants were also detected in MLH1 and MSH6 in all four adenomas tested; these have been reported previously in somatic colorectal cancers.

- **Conclusion**: We highlight an MLH1 variant in the colonic adenomas of an obligate Lynch syndrome carrier that resulted in PMS2 protein loss in the absence of mutations in the PMS2 gene.

### Additional loss of MSH2 and MSH6 expression in sporadic deficient mismatch repair colorectal cancer due to MLH1 promoter hypermethylation [^116gvHGV]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common, with 3% of cases associated with germline mutations in the mismatch repair pathway characteristic of Lynch syndrome (LS). The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends screening for LS in all patients newly diagnosed with CRC, irrespective of age. The Yorkshire Cancer Research Bowel Cancer Improvement Programme includes a regional LS screening service for all new diagnoses of CRC.

In the first 829 cases screened, 80 cases showed deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), including four cases displaying loss of expression of all four mismatch repair proteins by immunohistochemistry. The cases demonstrated diffuse MLH1 loss associated with BRAF mutations and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, consistent with sporadic dMMR. It is presumed that there are additional double-hit mutations in MSH2 ± MSH6 rather than underlying LS. Recognition and accurate interpretation of this unusual phenotype are important to prevent unnecessary referrals to clinical genetics and associated patient anxiety.

### Phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity in the Lynch syndrome: Diagnostic, surveillance and management implications [^111qfDP3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome is the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC). This review covers the cardinal features of Lynch syndrome with particular emphasis on its diagnostic criteria, molecular genetics, natural history, genetic counseling, surveillance, and management. Considerable attention has been given to the etiologic role of mismatch repair (MMR) genes, as well as low penetrance alleles and modifier genes.

The American founder mutation, a deletion of exons 1–6 of MSH2, is discussed in some detail, owing to its high frequency in the US (19,000–30,000 carriers). Genetic counseling is essential prior to patients undergoing DNA testing and again when receiving their test results. Families with a lower incidence of CRC and extracolonic cancers, despite being positive for Amsterdam I criteria but who do not have MMR deficiency by tumor testing, are probably not Lynch syndrome and should preferably be designated as familial CRC of undetermined type.

Patients who are either noncompliant or poorly compliant with colonoscopy, and who are MMR mutation-positive, may be candidates for prophylactic colectomy, while MMR mutation-positive women who are noncompliant with gynecologic surveillance may be candidates for prophylactic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

### Current clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome are not sensitive enough to identify MSH6 mutation carriers [^115Rc75v]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

- **Patients, registries, and ethics**: The initial material included all families investigated for inherited CRC in Norway until November 2009. Wide-ranging selection criteria were used to identify the families. Besides including all kindreds meeting the AMSII or BII criteria, all families with four CRC cases were explored, irrespective of age and including skipped generations or an aggregation of any cancer associated with Lynch syndrome. All activities were conducted as part of the healthcare system, with all information included in the patient files. Genetic testing was conducted according to national legislation, which included genetic counselling before and after the testing, with written informed consent obtained from participants. Relevant diagnoses were validated in medical files or cancer registry after consent from relatives or descendants if the subject was deceased. No research registry that included names was produced; only summarized data were taken from medical files for the present report. All information described has been disclosed to the patients/families, and family members were offered appropriate healthcare according to the Mallorca guidelines.

- **MSI/IHC examinations**: Upon referral and inclusion according to the wide-ranging criteria, families were subjected to examination for Lynch syndrome as described in the Mallorca guidelines, with IHC/MSI analysis of at least two affected family members if available, continuing to full mutation analysis of the relevant gene(s).

### Frequent mismatch-repair defects link prostate cancer to Lynch syndrome [^111g2Cwk]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

A possible role for prostate cancer in Lynch syndrome has been debated based on observations of mismatch-repair defective tumors and reports of an increased risk of prostate cancer in mutation carriers. The potential inclusion of prostate cancer in the Lynch syndrome tumor spectrum is relevant for family classification, risk estimates, and surveillance recommendations in mutation carriers.

- **Methods**: We used the population-based Danish HNPCC register to identify all prostate cancers that developed in mutation carriers and their first-degree relatives from 288 Lynch syndrome families. The tumors were evaluated for clinicopathologic features and mismatch-repair status, and the cumulative risk of prostate cancer was determined.

- **Results**: In total, 28 prostate cancers developed in 16 mutation carriers and in 12 first-degree relatives at a median age of 63 years. The majority of the tumors were high-grade tumors with Gleason scores of 8–10. Prostate cancer was associated with mutations in MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6, with loss of the respective mismatch repair protein in 69% of the tumors, though an MSI-high phenotype was restricted to 13% of the tumors. The cumulative risk of prostate cancer at age 70 was 3.7% (95% CI: 2.3–4.9).

- **Conclusion**: We provide evidence to link prostate cancer to Lynch syndrome through demonstration of MMR defective tumors and an increased risk of this disease, which suggests that prostate cancer should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of Lynch syndrome.

### Comprehensive population-wide analysis of Lynch syndrome in Iceland reveals founder mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 [^116XBn7g]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome, caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes, is associated with increased cancer risk. Here, using a large whole-genome sequencing data bank, cancer registry, and colorectal tumor bank, we determine the prevalence of Lynch syndrome, associated cancer risks, and pathogenicity of several variants in the Icelandic population. We use colorectal cancer samples from 1,182 patients diagnosed between 2000–2009. One-hundred and thirty-two (11.2%) tumors are mismatch repair deficient per immunohistochemistry. Twenty-one (1.8%) have Lynch syndrome, while 106 (9.0%) have somatic hypermethylation or mutations in the mismatch repair genes. The population prevalence of Lynch syndrome is 0.442%.

We discover a translocation disrupting MLH1 and three mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 that increase endometrial, colorectal, brain, and ovarian cancer risk. We find thirteen mismatch repair variants of uncertain significance that are not associated with cancer risk. Founder mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 prevail in Iceland, unlike most other populations.

### Optimizing risk-reducing surgery and aspirin decision aids for Lynch syndrome carriers using the person-based approach: A think-aloud interview study [^114FXJPV]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

Lynch syndrome manifests through a germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes: MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2, or through deletion of the 3′ end of the EPCAM gene, leading to hypermethylation of the MSH2 promoter. Collectively, these are termed path_MMR variants. Individuals with Lynch syndrome "carriers" bear a path_MMR variant but may never develop cancer, particularly with path_PMS2 or path_MSH6 variants, which are associated with lower risks.

Testing individuals newly diagnosed with colorectal or endometrial cancers, irrespective of age or family history, identifies germline path_MMR variants in 3% and 6%, respectively. Lynch syndrome is a lifelong, multi-organ genetic cancer predisposition. Decisions often "distributed" over time as they become relevant involve consultations with clinicians across integrated care pathways and significant others who influence decision-making.

Decision aids could be particularly beneficial for carriers as they navigate complex, interrelated decisions, revisiting these aids as risks evolve with age or personal priorities shift. Well-designed decision aids might serve as educational resources for clinicians, friends, and family, easing the informational burden on carriers to educate others about their condition.

### Msh6 and Pms2 germ-line pathogenic variants implicated in Lynch syndrome are associated with breast cancer [^114Rt8af]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is responsible for repairing single base pair mismatches and small insertions or deletions that occur when DNA polymerase attempts to replicate small repeat sequences. Pathogenic variants within the MMR genes result in errors in DNA repair, leading to an increased mutation load in MMR-deficient cells. Screening for MMR deficiency by microsatellite instability and immunohistochemistry assays is often performed on colorectal and endometrial tumors to identify patients with Lynch syndrome (LS). Although screening for MMR deficiency in breast tumors is not standard clinical practice, multiple studies have shown that breast cancers from women with LS are more likely to exhibit microsatellite instability and loss of one or more MMR proteins via immunohistochemistry compared with sporadic breast cancers.

Clinical studies evaluating breast cancer risk in women with LS have been conflicting. Some studies show up to a fourfold increased breast cancer risk, while others report no increased risk. Ascertainment bias may have affected these results: many previous LS studies assessing breast cancer ascertained their study cohorts based on criteria heavily weighted toward colorectal cancer. As a result, many study cohorts consist only of MLH1 and MSH2 carriers, although some studies also included MSH6. A few studies have included all four MMR genes but presented only a single combined breast cancer risk, likely due to a small number of MSH6 and PMS2 carriers. Thus, the lack of a consistent association between breast cancer and LS in previous studies may reflect the genetic composition of the cohorts.

### Revised guidelines for the clinical management of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC): Recommendations by a group of European experts [^116uY5ro]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is characterized by the development of colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and various other cancers, and is caused by a mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. In 2007, a group of European experts (the Mallorca group) published guidelines for the clinical management of LS. Since then, substantial new information has become available, necessitating an update of the guidelines. In 2011 and 2012, workshops were organized in Palma de Mallorca. A total of 35 specialists from 13 countries participated in the meetings.

The first step was to formulate important clinical questions. Then a systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed database and manual searches of relevant articles. During the workshops, the outcome of the literature search was discussed in detail. The guidelines described in this paper may be helpful for the appropriate management of families with LS. Prospective controlled studies should be undertaken to improve further the care of these families.

### Mortality by age, gene and gender in carriers of pathogenic mismatch repair gene variants receiving surveillance for early cancer diagnosis and treatment: a report from the prospective Lynch syndrome database [^113s1wgk]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Most deaths following cancer in path_MMR carriers, particularly in women and in path_MSH2 carriers of both genders, occurred after LS-associated cancers in organs other than the colorectum. While CRC incidence was high in those having colonoscopy surveillance, early diagnosis, treatment, and the emergence of immunotherapy probably contributed to the low CRC mortality observed. Any study like ours will inevitably have time-trend biases related to changes in treatment during the observation period. Because modern treatment may be associated with increased survival, our results are likely to represent minimum estimates for survival and maximum estimates for mortality. To further reduce mortality in LS, it may be reasonable to address prevention and treatment needs for the cancers now associated with most of the deaths.

We present cumulative cancer incidences for separate organs and groups of organs (Supplementary Tables S3–S6). If, for example, we report the cumulative incidences in female path_MLH1 carriers at 75 years, the cumulative incidences of colon and rectal cancer were 46.2% and 7.4%, respectively, with the sum being 53.6%, but the cumulative incidence for colon or rectal cancer was 48.3%. The difference (5.3%) indicates how many carriers had both colon and rectal cancers. Similarly, for endometrial and ovarian cancer, the sum would be 45.2% while the observed value for endometrial or ovarian cancer was 43.2%. The sum of the cumulative incidences for all four cancers would be 98.8%, while the observed value was 79.7%.

### Screening for the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) [^111m3vkV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Germ-line mutations in the mismatch-repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 lead to the development of the Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), conferring a strong susceptibility to cancer. We assessed the frequency of such mutations in patients with colorectal cancer and examined strategies for molecular screening to identify patients with the syndrome.

- **Methods**: Patients with a new diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma at the major hospitals in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio, were eligible for the study. Genotyping of the tumor for microsatellite instability was the primary screening method. Among patients whose screening results were positive for microsatellite instability, we searched for germ-line mutations in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 genes with the use of immunohistochemical staining for mismatch-repair proteins, genomic sequencing, and deletion studies. Family members of carriers of the mutations were counseled, and those found to be at risk were offered mutation testing.

- **Results**: Of 1066 patients enrolled in the study, 208 (19.5 percent) had microsatellite instability, and 23 of these patients had a mutation causing the Lynch syndrome (2.2 percent). Among the 23 probands with the Lynch syndrome, 10 were more than 50 years of age, and 5 did not meet the Amsterdam criteria or the Bethesda guidelines for the diagnosis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (including the use of age and family history to identify patients at high risk for the Lynch syndrome).

### Determining the frequency of de novo germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes [^116RqYBt]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Carriers of a germline mutation in a DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene — that is, persons with Lynch syndrome — have substantially high risks of colorectal (CRC), endometrial, and several other cancers. The proportion of carriers who have de novo mutations, meaning not inherited from either parent, is not known. This study reports a case series of de novo mutations in MMR genes and estimates the frequency of de novo mutation in MMR genes using the Colon Cancer Family Registry.

- **Methods**: Screening for germline MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 mutations was performed for all incident CRC cases recruited from cancer registries (population-based probands) displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) or loss of expression of MMR genes by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and probands with CRC in multi-case families recruited from clinics (clinic-based probands), regardless of MSI or IHC status. All relatives of probands with a pathogenic mutation who donated a blood sample underwent testing for the mutation identified in the proband.

- **Results**: Of 261 probands (202 clinic-based, 59 population-based) with MMR gene mutations for whom it was possible to determine the origin of the mutation, six (2.3%, 95% CI 0.9% to 5.0%) were confirmed as de novo, and the remaining 255 (97.7%, 95% CI 95.0% to 99.1%) were inherited. Of the de novo mutation carriers, three were clinic-based probands (1.5%, 95% CI 0.3% to 4.5%) and three were population-based probands (5.1%, 95% CI 1.2% to 14.5%). Two were in MLH1, three in MSH2, and one in MSH6.

- **Conclusion**: De novo MMR gene mutations are uncommon causes of Lynch syndrome.

### Current clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome are not sensitive enough to identify MSH6 mutation carriers [^114K9gPB]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

Reported prevalence, penetrance, and expression of deleterious mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, may reflect differences in the clinical criteria used to select families for DNA testing. The authors have previously reported that clinical criteria are not sensitive enough to identify MMR mutation carriers among incident colorectal cancer cases.

- **Objective**: To describe the sensitivity of the criteria when applied to families with a demonstrated MMR mutation.

- **Methods**: Families with an aggregation of colorectal cancers were examined for deleterious MMR mutations according to the Mallorca guidelines. All families with a detected MMR mutation as of November 2009 were reclassified according to the Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine different DNA variants were identified in a total of 129 families. The original Amsterdam clinical criteria were met by 38%, 12%, 78%, and 25% of families with mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2, respectively. Corresponding numbers for the revised Amsterdam criteria were 62%, 48%, 87%, and 38%. Similarly, each of the four clinical Bethesda criteria had low sensitivity for identifying MSH6 or PMS2 mutations.

- **Conclusion**: Amsterdam criteria and each of the Bethesda criteria were inadequate for identifying MSH6 mutation-carrying kindreds. MSH6 mutations may be more common than currently assumed, and the penetrance/expression of MSH6 mutations, as derived from families meeting clinical criteria, may be misleading. To increase the detection rate of MMR mutation carriers, all cancers…

### Genetic anticipation in Swedish Lynch syndrome families [^114Y4aBh]. PLoS Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Among hereditary colorectal cancer-predisposing syndromes, Lynch syndrome (LS), caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2, is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early-onset colon and endometrial cancer, as well as other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, the age at first primary cancer varies within families, and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS.

Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be demonstrated in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Linköping, Uppsala, and Umeå between 1990 and 2013.

We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families, including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families. Of these, 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM), we estimated a 2.1-year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox model was also considered.

### Two integrated and highly predictive functional analysis-based procedures for the classification of MSH6 variants in Lynch syndrome [^115ndCVT]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Inactivation of Msh6 function can be caused by different molecular defects. To pinpoint the molecular defects in Msh6 protein function of the variants identified in the genetic screen, and to further validate these as a proxy for pathogenic MSH6 variants, we performed biochemical analyses. MMR is initiated by binding of the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer to a mismatched nucleotide pair, which induces ATP binding by both proteins. This binding provokes a conformational change that converts the heterodimer into a clamp that slides on the DNA and binds MLH1/PMS2. We argued that the 43 inactivating variants from the genetic screen might either display a defect in any of these activities of Msh2/Msh6, or destabilize the Msh2/Msh6 heterodimer.

Western blotting of all inactivating Msh6-variant cell lines revealed that levels of the inactive Msh2/Msh6 proteins varied between the 43 different cell lines, supporting destabilization of some mutant proteins (Fig. 3a and Table S4). We then tested the ability of all mutated Msh2/Msh6 proteins to bind to mismatched oligonucleotides by employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays with extracts from the corresponding variant cell lines. The majority of the Msh6 variants displayed either partial or complete loss of mismatch binding, in many cases coinciding with reduced protein levels (Fig. 3a, b, Table S4).

### Variation in the risk of colorectal cancer in families with Lynch syndrome: a retrospective cohort study [^115UMii1]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Existing clinical practice guidelines for carriers of pathogenic variants of DNA mismatch repair genes (Lynch syndrome) are based on the mean age-specific cumulative risk (penetrance) of colorectal cancer for all carriers of pathogenic variants in the same gene. We aimed to estimate the variation in the penetrance of colorectal cancer between carriers of pathogenic variants in the same gene by sex and continent of residence.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we sourced data from the International Mismatch Repair Consortium. This includes 273 members from 122 research centers or clinics in 32 countries across six continents involved in Lynch syndrome research. Families with at least three members and at least one confirmed carrier of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a DNA mismatch repair gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2) were included. The families of probands with known de-novo pathogenic variants were excluded. Data were collected on the method of ascertainment of the family, sex, carrier status, cancer diagnoses, and ages at the time of pedigree collection and at last contact or death. We used segregation analysis conditioned on ascertainment to estimate the mean penetrance of colorectal cancer and modeled unmeasured polygenic factors to estimate the variation in penetrance. The existence of unknown familial risk factors modifying colorectal cancer risk for Lynch syndrome carriers was tested by using a Wald p-value for the null hypothesis that the polygenic SD is zero.

- **Findings**: 5585 families with Lynch syndrome from 22 countries were included in the study.
