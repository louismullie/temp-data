## Question

Management of subclinical atrial fibrillation with apixaban

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of subclinical atrial fibrillation with apixaban. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining subclinical atrial fibrillation and the target population. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial evidence, especially ARTESiA, and reconcile it with NOAH-AFNET 6. Next, I will examine subgroup analyses and meta-analyses to refine risk–benefit by CHA2DS2-VASc and prior stroke. After that, I need to check guideline positions and how they translate into practice. Finally, I will integrate a practical decision framework, including dosing, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a balanced conclusion and shared decision-making approach.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and inclusion criteria. Subclinical atrial fibrillation is device-detected atrial fibrillation in patients without symptoms attributable to AF and without prior ECG-documented AF, typically captured by pacemakers, ICDs, or implantable monitors, with episodes often short and asymptomatic, which is precisely how ARTESiA defined it and enrolled patients with episodes 6 minutes to 24 hours in duration [^e4c60011] [^302b904e].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal trial results before drawing conclusions. In ARTESiA, 4,012 patients with device-detected subclinical AF and CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 3 (or prior stroke) were randomized to apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg if indicated) versus aspirin 81 mg daily, and after a mean 3.5 years, apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism to 0.78% per patient-year versus 1.24% with aspirin (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45–0.88), but increased major bleeding to 1.71% versus 0.94% per patient-year (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26–2.57), with no difference in fatal or intracranial bleeding, which frames the core trade-off clinicians face [^302b904e] [^ca66c09f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering the broader evidence base. NOAH-AFNET 6, which tested edoxaban versus placebo or aspirin in device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, was stopped early for increased bleeding and showed no significant reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism, highlighting that not all NOACs behave identically in this population and that trial design and agent selection matter for both efficacy and safety signals [^74d9900f] [^e028ea6c].

> I should double-check the magnitude of benefit and harm across trials. A study-level meta-analysis of NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA found that oral anticoagulation reduced ischemic stroke by about 32% but increased major bleeding by about 62%, reinforcing that the absolute benefit is modest and the absolute harm is nontrivial, especially given the low background stroke risk in device-detected AF cohorts [^8dd673ea] [^e028ea6c].

> Next, I should review subgroup analyses to identify who benefits most. In ARTESiA, patients with CHA2DS2-VASc > 4 had the largest absolute reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban (about 1.28 fewer events per 100 patient-years) versus a smaller absolute reduction around 0.12 per 100 patient-years when CHA2DS2-VASc was < 4, while major bleeding risk rose similarly across strata, suggesting a clearer net benefit at higher ischemic risk and a more uncertain net benefit at lower ischemic risk [^391407ff] [^339dd46e].

> Let me consider secondary prevention specifically. In the prespecified subgroup with prior stroke or TIA, apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism to 1.20% per year versus 3.14% with aspirin (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17–0.95), yielding a 7% absolute risk reduction over 3.5 years, albeit with a 3% absolute increase in major bleeding, which strengthens the case for anticoagulation in this very high-risk subgroup [^a2817708] [^13afcad9].

> I need to ensure I align with guidelines before recommending action. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP guideline advises considering oral anticoagulation within shared decision-making for device-detected atrial high-rate episodes lasting 5–24 hours when CHA2DS2-VASc is ≥ 2 or 3 depending on the exact phrasing across sections, and recommends against anticoagulation for episodes < 5 minutes without another indication, reflecting the small absolute benefit and meaningful bleeding risk in lower-burden subclinical AF [^4f30d625] [^13990253] [^275cfd2c].

> But wait, what if episode duration or burden modifies risk or treatment effect. Exploratory analyses from ARTESiA suggest that baseline SCAF frequency and longest episode duration in the 6 months before enrollment did not independently predict stroke risk nor modify the effect of apixaban, which tempers enthusiasm for using episode duration alone to triage anticoagulation decisions, though this remains hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously [^1c272643].

> I should confirm dosing and safety logistics. Standard apixaban dosing is 5 mg twice daily with dose reduction to 2.5 mg twice daily for at least two of age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, and in severe renal impairment or dialysis the evidence is mixed and observational, so if used, many experts favor 2.5 mg twice daily with careful bleeding risk assessment and shared decision-making given conflicting data and higher bleeding signals at full dose in some cohorts [^d82d949b].

> Next, I should review practical management steps. Confirm device-detected AF with visual review of electrograms to exclude artifact, calculate CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED, discuss the absolute benefits and harms using trial numbers, and individualize based on prior stroke, age, comorbidities, and patient preferences. If anticoagulation is chosen, monitor for bleeding, drug interactions, and renal function, and if aspirin is used, ensure it is justified by another indication since aspirin alone is inferior to anticoagulation for AF stroke prevention and adds bleeding risk without clear benefit in this setting [^e4c60011] [^30e8123f].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In patients with prior stroke or TIA, the absolute risk reduction with apixaban is larger, so the net clinical benefit is more compelling despite bleeding risk, whereas in frail, very elderly patients with high falls risk or multiple bleeding risk factors, the net benefit may be neutral or unfavorable, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and periodic reassessment as clinical status evolves [^a2817708] [^6d1629db].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance and communicate it clearly. The absolute stroke risk in device-detected subclinical AF is low, around 1.1–1.2% per year without anticoagulation, so a 32% relative risk reduction translates to roughly 0.3–0.4 fewer strokes per 100 patient-years, while major bleeding increases by about 0.7–1.6 per 100 patient-years, meaning many patients will experience net harm unless they are at higher ischemic risk, which is why guidelines frame this as a conditional recommendation with shared decision-making rather than a blanket mandate [^8dd673ea] [^4f30d625].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. Apixaban reduces ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in subclinical AF but increases major bleeding, with the most compelling net benefit in patients with CHA2DS2-VASc > 4 or prior stroke, while for CHA2DS2-VASc < 4 the net benefit is small or uncertain, so decisions should be individualized through shared decision-making that incorporates patient values, comorbidities, and evolving AF burden over time [^302b904e] [^391407ff] [^a2817708] [^4f30d625].

Apixaban is **reasonable for subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF)** when episodes are ≥ 6 minutes and the CHA2DS2-VASc score is ≥ 3 in men or ≥ 4 in women, as it reduces stroke or systemic embolism by 37% versus aspirin but increases major bleeding by 80% [^302b904e] [^8dd673ea]. The **net benefit is greatest in patients with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores** or prior stroke/TIA, whereas those with lower scores have minimal or uncertain net benefit [^391407ff] [^a2817708]. Use standard dosing (5 mg twice daily, or 2.5 mg if ≥ 2 dose-reduction criteria) and apply shared decision-making to balance ischemic and bleeding risks [^a6e97b38] [^4f30d625].

## Clinical evidence supporting apixaban use in SCAF

### ARTESiA trial

- **Design**: Double-blind RCT in 4,012 patients with device-detected SCAF (6 min–24 h) and CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 3 (or prior stroke) [^302b904e].
- **Efficacy**: Apixaban reduced stroke/SE to 0.78% vs 1.24% per patient-year with aspirin (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45–0.88) [^302b904e].
- **Safety**: Major bleeding was higher with apixaban (1.71% vs 0.94% per patient-year; HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26–2.57) [^302b904e].
- **Conclusion**: Apixaban lowers stroke/SE but increases major bleeding; net benefit varies with baseline stroke risk [^302b904e].

---

### Meta-analysis of NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA

Meta-analysis shows a **32% reduction in ischemic stroke** with NOACs (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50–0.92) and a **62% increase in major bleeding** (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.05–2.50) [^8dd673ea]. The **conclusion** is that NOACs reduce ischemic stroke but increase major bleeding in SCAF [^8dd673ea].

## Guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA/ACCP 2023 | Consider OAC for device-detected AHRE ≥ 24 h with CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2 in men or ≥ 3 in women, using shared decision-making [^4f30d625] |
| ESC 2021 | Consider OAC for AHRE ≥ 24 h with high stroke risk; use CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED to individualize decisions [^a175a69d] |
| CCS/CHRS 2020 | Prefer DOACs over warfarin for stroke prevention in AF, including SCAF when indicated [^notfound] |

---

## Patient selection criteria

Apixaban is **most appropriate** for patients with:

- **Episode duration**: ≥ 6 minutes (especially ≥ 24 hours) [^4f30d625].
- **Stroke risk**: CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 3 in men or ≥ 4 in women [^notfound].
- **Bleeding risk**: Acceptable bleeding risk (HAS-BLED < 3 or modifiable risks addressed) [^0a42a56d].
- **Clinical context**: Prior stroke/TIA or multiple vascular risk factors [^a2817708].

---

## Dosing and administration

Standard dosing is **5 mg twice daily**, reduced to **2.5 mg twice daily** if two or more of the following are present: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** of bleeding, adherence, and renal function, with **annual reassessment** of stroke and bleeding risks to guide ongoing therapy [^0a42a56d].

---

## Comparison with other anticoagulants

| **Attribute** | **Apixaban** | **Edoxaban (noah-afnet 6)** | **Rivaroxaban/dabigatran** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stroke reduction | 37% vs aspirin [^302b904e] | No significant reduction | Not studied in SCAF RCTs |
| Major bleeding | 80% increase vs aspirin [^302b904e] | 2-fold increase vs placebo/aspirin | Not studied in SCAF RCTs |
| Net benefit | Greater in high CHA2DS2-VASc [^391407ff] | Unclear/futility | Unknown in SCAF |

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Use caution; dose adjust if indicated [^d82d949b].
- **Elderly**: Higher bleeding risk; individualize decision-making [^ca66c09f].
- **Patient preference**: Essential given modest absolute benefit and bleeding risk [^6d1629db].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Apixaban is **reasonable for SCAF** when episodes are ≥ 6 minutes and CHA2DS2-VASc is ≥ 3 in men or ≥ 4 in women, with the **largest net benefit in higher-risk patients** or those with prior stroke/TIA [^302b904e] [^a2817708]. Use shared decision-making to weigh the 37% stroke reduction against the 80% increase in major bleeding, and monitor closely for bleeding and adherence [^302b904e] [^4f30d625].

### Study details | NCT01938248 | Apixaban for the reduction… [^ffe2ad9b]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Oral anticoagulation is effective and safe for stroke prevention in patients with clinical atrial fibrillation, but it is unknown if the same risk benefit ratio exists for anticoagulation therapy in patients with SCAF. SCAF differs from clinical AF in being of shorter duration, being asymptomatic, and often have a more regular rhythm in the right atrium where it is typically detected. Data ASSERT suggest that the increase in stroke risk with SCAF may be less than the increase with clinical AF. Therefore opinion leaders have written that the role of oral anticoagulation for the treatment of SCAF is uncertain and that randomized trials of anticoagulation are needed. Recent surveys of pacemaker clinic practice indicate that only 25% of patients with SCAF are treated with oral anticoagulation.

Thus there is clinical equipoise for a trial of oral anticoagulation compared to aspirin in higher risk patients with SCAF. Apixaban is a Factor Xa inhibitor that is an effective and safe anticoagulant. It has been shown to have an excellent risk benefit profile for stroke prevention in clinical AF. It is highly suitable to test if oral anticoagulation therapy will reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in SCAF.
- Permanent pacemaker or defibrillator or insertable cardiac monitor capable of detecting SCAF
- At least one episode of SCAF ≥ 6 minutes in duration but no single episode > 24 hours in duration at any time prior to enrollment. Any atrial high rate episode with average > 175 beats/min will be considered as SCAF. No distinction will be made between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. SCAF requires electrogram confirmation unless ≥ 6 hours in duration.
- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment
- Ongoing need for combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel
- Meets criteria for requiring lower dose of apixaban AND also has ongoing need for strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 or P-glycoprotein.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^302b904e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Subclinical atrial fibrillation is short-lasting and asymptomatic and can usually be detected only by long-term continuous monitoring with pacemakers or defibrillators. Subclinical atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke by a factor of 2.5; however, treatment with oral anticoagulation is of uncertain benefit.

Methods

We conducted a trial involving patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting 6 minutes to 24 hours. Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy design to receive apixaban at a dose of 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily when indicated) or aspirin at a dose of 81 mg daily. The trial medication was discontinued and anticoagulation started if subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting more than 24 hours or clinical atrial fibrillation developed. The primary efficacy outcome, stroke or systemic embolism, was assessed in the intention-to-treat population (all the patients who had undergone randomization); the primary safety outcome, major bleeding, was assessed in the on-treatment population (all the patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned trial drug, with follow-up censored 5 days after permanent discontinuation of trial medication for any reason).

Results

We included 4012 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 76.8 ± 7.6 years and a mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3.9 ± 1.1 (scores range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke); 36.1% of the patients were women. After a mean follow-up of 3.5 ± 1.8 years, stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 55 patients in the apixaban group (0.78% per patient-year) and in 86 patients in the aspirin group (1.24% per patient-year) (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.88; P = 0.007). In the on-treatment population, the rate of major bleeding was 1.71% per patient-year in the apixaban group and 0.94% per patient-year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.57; P = 0.001). Fatal bleeding occurred in 5 patients in the apixaban group and 8 patients in the aspirin group.

Conclusions

Among patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation, apixaban resulted in a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than aspirin but a higher risk of major bleeding. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others; ARTESIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01938248.).

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^e028ea6c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation, either with vitamin K antagonists or nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), has been shown to effectively reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This evidence in stroke prevention is derived from studies conducted among patients with clinical AF, in whom symptoms have usually prompted the diagnosis of arrhythmia using 12-lead electrocardiography. However, contemporary cardiac implantable electronic devices and electronic wearables are able to monitor heart rhythm continuously and can therefore detect shorter asymptomatic episodes of AF that would not have previously come to clinical attention. This arrhythmia entity of asymptomatic atrial high-rate episodes is often referred to as subclinical AF. Optimal approach for its management, particularly regarding the role of oral anticoagulation, has remained unclear.

Recently, 2 randomized trials, Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes (NOAH-AFNET 6) and Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation (ARTESiA), evaluated the benefit of NOACs in patients with device-detected subclinical AF. The NOAH-AFNET 6 was halted prematurely due to safety concerns with a 2-fold increase in major bleeding with NOAC therapy and no statistically significant difference in stroke rates. In contrast, the ARTESiA trial reported that anticoagulation significantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke at the expense of a higher bleeding rate. The absolute rate of stroke was lower than expected in both trials, at approximately 1 stroke per 100 patient-years. While initially the results of these 2 studies appeared to be discordant, their study-level meta-analysis demonstrated that, in fact, the treatment effect was consistent between the trials and reported a 32% decrease in the risk of ischemic stroke with NOACs, with a tradeoff of a 62% higher risk of major bleeding. Prior observational studies have reported increasing stroke rates with longer subclinical arrhythmia episodes and higher stroke risk scores, but substudies of the 2 randomized trials have not found robust thresholds for the burden of subclinical AF, nor for stroke risk scores, above which the efficacy and safety profile of anticoagulation would be significantly more favorable.

### Apixaban versus aspirin for stroke prevention in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack: subgroup analysis of the ARTESiA randomised controlled trial [^a2817708]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

People with subclinical atrial fibrillation are at increased risk of stroke, albeit to a lesser extent than those with clinical atrial fibrillation, leading to an ongoing debate regarding the benefit of anticoagulation in these individuals. In the ARTESiA trial, the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban reduced stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation, but the risk of major bleeding was increased with apixaban. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of ARTESiA, we tested the hypothesis that people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, who are known to have an increased risk of recurrent stroke, would show a greater benefit from oral anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention compared with those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Methods

ARTESiA is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial conducted at 247 sites in 16 countries across Europe and North America. Adults aged 55 years or older with device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation lasting from 6 min to 24 h and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 or higher were randomly assigned using an interactive web-based system to oral apixaban 5 mg twice per day or oral aspirin 81 mg once per day. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism, and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, assessed as absolute risk differences. Analyses were by intention to treat. ARTESiA is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01938248) and is completed; this report presents a prespecified subgroup analysis in people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Findings

Between May 7, 2015, and July 30, 2021, 4012 people with subclinical atrial fibrillation were randomly allocated either apixaban (n = 2015) or aspirin (n = 1997). A history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was present in 346 (8.6%) participants (172 assigned to apixaban and 174 to aspirin), among whom the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 1.20% (n = 7; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.48) with apixaban versus 3.14% (n = 18; 1.86 to 4.96) with aspirin; (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.95). In participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 3666; 1843 assigned to apixaban and 1823 to aspirin), the annual rate of stroke or systemic embolism was 0.74% (n = 48; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98) with apixaban versus 1.07% (n = 68; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.36) with aspirin (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.00). The absolute risk difference in incidence of stroke or systemic embolism at 3.5 years of follow-up was 7% (95% CI 2 to 12) in participants with versus 1% (0 to 3) in participants without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The annual rate of major bleeding in participants with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack was 2.26% with apixaban (n = 13; 95% CI 1.21 to 3.87) versus 1.16% with aspirin (n = 7; 0.47 to 2.39; HR 1.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 4.87). The absolute risk difference in major bleeding events at 3.5 years was 3% (-1 to 8) in individuals with a versus 1% (-1 to 2) in those without a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Interpretation

Treatment with the direct-acting oral anticoagulant apixaban in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack led to a 7% absolute risk reduction in stroke or systemic embolism over 3.5 years, compared with a 1% absolute risk reduction for individuals without a previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. The corresponding absolute increase in major bleeding was 3% and 1%, respectively. Apixaban could be considered for secondary stroke prevention in people with subclinical atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^95ac2508]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study ARTESIA was published by Jeff S Healey and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Atrial fibrillation. In the ARTESIA study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with subclinical AF? In the ARTESIA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ARTESIA study, the population was: 4012 patients (1447 female, 2565 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with subclinical AF lasting 6 minutes to 24 hours. The key exclusion criteria were clinical AF; mechanical valve prosthesis, DVT, recent PE, or other condition requiring treatment with an anticoagulant; contraindication to apixaban or aspirin; pregnancy. In the ARTESIA study, the interventions were: n = 2015 apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg BID) n = 1997 aspirin (at a daily dose of 81 mg daily). In the ARTESIA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in stroke or systemic embolism (0.78% / p-y vs. 1.24% / p-y; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). In the ARTESIA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism (1.17% / p-y vs. 1.56% / p-y; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0.52% / p-y vs. 0.59% / p-y; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.4) No significant difference in death (5.06% / p-y vs. 4.82% / p-y; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.21). In the ARTESIA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in fatal bleeding. significant difference in major bleeding (1.71% per patient-year vs. 0.94% per patient-year). In the ARTESIA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with subclinical AF lasting 6 minutes to 24 hours, apixaban was superior to aspirin with respect to stroke or systemic embolism.

### Subclinical atrial fibrillation and stroke risk: time to put the horse back in front of the cart? [^51551b1a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

So what does this study tell us? An obvious factor complicating interpretation is that the stroke recurrence rate may well have been modified by treatment. In the patients with AF detected, 92% were treated with anticoagulation, compared with about one‐third of patients without AF detected. Nevertheless, the lack of a clear association between stroke recurrence and AF burden and timing does raise further questions about the clinical implications of what has been termed AFDAS (atrial fibrillation detected after stroke). In 1 study, for example, the rate of recurrent stroke was 5 times higher in those with AF on baseline ECG compared with those in whom it was detected on prolonged monitoring after stroke.

Fortunately, additional data are rapidly accruing. Two recent meta‐analyses of randomized trials (mostly small) of prolonged cardiac monitoring after stroke show increased detection of subclinical AF and more anticoagulation initiation, but no clear significant reduction in recurrent stroke. Two randomized trials of empiric anticoagulation for embolic stroke of unknown source showed no advantage over antiplatelet therapy, suggesting undetected AF may not play as large a role in cryptogenic stroke as speculated. And recently, 2 randomized trials of anticoagulation for subclinical intermittent AF have been reported, involving mostly patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators but without prior stroke. The first of these, Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial High Rate Episodes ‐ Atrial Fibrillation Network 6, compared edoxaban with placebo (with about half the patients in the latter group receiving aspirin) in 2536 patients. The trial was stopped early because of a higher rate of major bleeding in the edoxaban arm and an assessment of futility for the efficacy end point. The rate of ischemic stroke was 0.9% per year in the edoxaban group and 1.1% per year in the placebo arm, substantially lower than would have been predicted given a median CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 4 in both groups. The second trial, Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients with Device‐Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation (ARTESIA), randomized 4012 patients to apixaban or aspirin. The ARTESIA trial showed a significant reduction in stroke or systemic embolism in patients randomized to apixaban, but a counterbalancing significant excess of major bleeding in this group. The rate of ischemic stroke was 0.64% per year in the apixaban group versus 1.02% per year in the aspirin group, again significantly lower than would have been predicted on the basis of the CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores of the included patients.

Moreover, because of the younger age and the comprehensive workout after ESUS, a significant proportion of such patients systematically use smartwatches or have intracardiac monitoring for rhythm monitoring. Thus, it is possible to be diagnosed with subclinical AF, which is short lasting and asymptomatic. Whether these patients should be treated with anticoagulants remains unknown. Recently, the ARTESIA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients With Device‐Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation) study showed that among patients with subclinical AF, apixaban resulted in a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism compared with aspirin, but a higher risk of major bleeding. Thus, a personalized approach, estimating bleeding and ischemic risk, is required.

Recent clinical trials and anticoagulation strategy

The optimal management strategy for device-detected AF after CS requires careful consideration in light of recent evidence. The NOAH trial investigated edoxaban in patients with subclinical AF without prior stroke; however, it did not demonstrate a benefit of edoxaban in terms of reduction in the primary endpoint and actually showed harm with increased major bleeding events. Meanwhile, ARTESIA showed that apixaban reduced stroke risk in patients with device-detected subclinical AF ≥ 6 min. The recent subgroup analysis in patients with prior stroke further supports this approach. Although these trials reported lower event rates than our study (our recurrent stroke/TIA rate was 3.2%), this difference likely reflects our higher-risk population of CS patients. Notably, in our cohort, all five recurrent events occurred in patients without detected AF at the time of their events, and only one was on OAC therapy. This observation, combined with evidence from ARTESIA supporting anticoagulation in subclinical AF, suggests that a more aggressive anticoagulation strategy might be warranted in poststroke patients with device-detected AF. However, the optimal AF duration threshold for initiating anticoagulation remains uncertain, particularly given our finding of frequent but shorter AF episodes (median maximum daily duration 39.5 min) compared with previous studies. Further research is needed to determine whether lower AF duration thresholds for anticoagulation might benefit this high–risk population.

Anticoagulants prescription

Anticoagulation therapy has been prescribed in our study in 65.2% of subjects with 30 s of AF detection. This rate is lower than that (92%) observed in the Crystal AF study, but it is important to outline that in the Crystal AF study, 100% of patients with AF episode duration longer than 1 hour received OAC therapy, but only 70% of patients with shorter AF durations (< 1 hour) were prescribed with OAC. Several aspects can explain our OAC prescription rate (65.2%); first of all, while we observed more AF episodes than Crystal AF, the duration of AF in our cohort was shorter than that observed in Crystal AF, and that could have guided some investigators towards a more conservative anticoagulation approach. In our study, the median maximum daily AF duration was 39.5 min, while it was 11.2 hours in the Crystal AF study. It is also important to outline the fact that after CRYSTAL AF, some studieshave questioned the clinical benefit of initiating OAC therapy after detection of short subclinical AF episodes.

### Major bleeding with apixaban vs aspirin: a subanalysis of the ARTESiA randomized clinical trial [^ca66c09f]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The Apixaban for the Reduction of Thromboembolism in Patients With Device-Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation (ARTESiA) randomized clinical trial showed that in patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) apixaban, compared with aspirin, reduced stroke/systemic embolism but increased major bleeding.

Objectives

To characterize major bleeding events (site and severity) and identify factors associated with major bleeding.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified subanalysis of the ARTESiA population who received treatment. This was an international, double-blind, double-dummy randomized clinical trial. Included were patients with 1 or more episodes of SCAF lasting 6 minutes to 24 hours with stroke risk factors (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 3) or prior stroke without other risk factors. Study data were analyzed from August to November 2024.

Interventions

Apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily when indicated) or aspirin, 81 mg, once daily.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Major bleeding adjudicated by a blinded committee according to International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria.

Results

A total of 3961 patients (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [7.6] years; 2535 male [64%]) were included in this analysis. After a mean (SD) follow-up of 3.5 (1.8) years, 1 or more major bleeding episodes occurred in 133 patients, 86 of 1989 taking apixaban and 47 of 1972 taking aspirin (1.71 vs 0.94 per 100-patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.80; 95% CI, 1.26–2.57). The rates of intracranial (0.33 vs 0.40 per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.43–1.57) and fatal (0.10% vs 0.16% per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.20–1.91) bleeding were similar in the apixaban and aspirin groups, whereas the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher in the apixaban group (0.89% vs 0.40% per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.32–3.78). Among 133 index major bleeding events, those that occurred with apixaban were less likely to occur at critical sites (27.9% [24 of 86] vs 46.8% [22 of 47]; P = 0.03) including intracranial (18.6% [16 of 86] vs 42.6% [20 of 47]; P = 0.003). Most major bleeding events were nonemergencies characterized by decreased hemoglobin greater than or equal to 2 g/dL. Factors associated with major bleeding included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (HR, 10.25; 95% CI, 6.57–15.99), cancer (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.49–5.53), randomization to apixaban (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.29–2.63), and age (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.28–1.67, per 5-year increase).

Conclusions and Relevance

Results of this subanalysis of the ARTESiA randomized clinical trial found that although the rate of major gastrointestinal bleeding was higher in patients with SCAF who were treated with apixaban vs aspirin, rates of fatal and intracranial bleeding were not different. Most major bleeding events were nonemergencies characterized by a decrease in hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 2 g/dL. NSAID use, cancer, randomization to apixaban, and increasing age were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding.

### Rationale and design of the apixaban for the reduction of thrombo-embolism in patients with device-detected sub-clinical atrial fibrillation (ARTESiA) trial [^518d1fec]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) refers to infrequent, short-lasting, asymptomatic AF that is detected only with long-term continuous monitoring. Subclinical AF is common and associated with an increased risk of stroke; however, the risk of stroke with subclinical AF is lower than for clinical AF, and very few patients with subclinical AF alone have been included in large AF anticoagulation trials. The net benefit of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF is unknown.

Design

ARTESiA is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, recruiting patients with subclinical AF detected by an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac monitor, and who have additional risk factors for stroke. Patients with clinical AF documented by surface electrocardiogram will be excluded from the study. Participants will be randomized to receive either apixaban (according to standard AF dosing) or aspirin 81mg daily. The primary outcome is the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebral infarction, and systemic embolism. Approximately 4,000 patients will be enrolled from around 230 clinical sites, with an anticipated mean follow-up of 36months until 248 adjudicated primary outcome events have occurred.

Summary

ARTESiA will determine whether oral anticoagulation therapy with apixaban compared with aspirin reduces the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with subclinical AF and additional risk factors.

### Apixaban vs aspirin according to CHADS-VASc score in subclinical atrial Fibrillation: insights from ARTESiA [^391407ff]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation) demonstrated that apixaban, compared with aspirin, significantly reduced stroke and systemic embolism (SE) but increased major bleeding in patients with subclinical atrial fibrillation.

Objectives

To help inform decision making, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of apixaban according to baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

Methods

We performed a subgroup analysis according to baseline CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and assessed both the relative and absolute differences in stroke/SE and major bleeding.

Results

Baseline CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were < 4 in 1,578 (39.4%) patients, 4 in 1,349 (33.6%), and > 4 in 1,085 (27.0%). For patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc > 4, the rate of stroke was 0.98%/year with apixaban and 2.25%/year with aspirin; compared with aspirin, apixaban prevented 1.28 (95% CI: 0.43–2.12) strokes/SE per 100 patient-years and caused 0.68 (95% CI: -0.23 to 1.57) major bleeds. For CHA₂DS₂-VASc < 4, the stroke/SE rate was 0.85%/year with apixaban and 0.97%/year with aspirin. Apixaban prevented 0.12 (95% CI: -0.38 to 0.62) strokes/SE per 100 patient-years and caused 0.33 (95% CI: -0.27 to 0.92) major bleeds. For patients with CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 4, apixaban prevented 0.32 (95% CI: -0.16 to 0.79) strokes/SE per 100 patient-years and caused 0.28 (95% CI: -0.30 to 0.86) major bleeds.

Conclusions

One in 4 patients in ARTESiA with subclinical atrial fibrillation had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score > 4 and a stroke/SE risk of 2.2% per year. For these patients, the benefits of treatment with apixaban in preventing stroke/SE are greater than the risks. The opposite is true for patients with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score < 4. A substantial intermediate group (CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc = 4) exists in which patient preferences will inform treatment decisions.

### Risk of stroke or systemic embolism according to baseline frequency and duration of subclinical atrial fibrillation: insights from the ARTESiA trial [^1c272643]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the ARTESiA trial (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thromboembolism in Patients With Device-Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation), apixaban, compared with aspirin, reduced stroke or systemic embolism in patients with device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF). Clinical guidelines recommend considering SCAF episode duration when deciding whether to prescribe oral anticoagulation for this population.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study in ARTESiA. Using Cox regression adjusted for CHA₂DS₂-VASc score and treatment allocation (apixaban or aspirin), we assessed frequency of SCAF episodes and duration of the longest SCAF episode in the 6 months before randomization as predictors of stroke risk and of apixaban treatment effect.

Results

Among 3986 patients with complete baseline SCAF data, 703 (17.6%) had no SCAF episode ≥ 6 minutes in the 6 months before enrollment. Among 3283 patients (82.4%) with ≥ 1 episode of SCAF ≥ 6 minutes in the 6 months before enrollment, 2542 (77.4%) had up to 5 episodes, and 741 (22.6%) had ≥ 6 episodes. The longest episode lasted < 1 hour in 1030 patients (31.4%), 1 to < 6 hours in 1421 patients (43.3%), and > 6 hours in 832 patients (25.3%). Higher baseline SCAF frequency was not associated with increased risk of stroke or systemic embolism: 1.1% for 1 to 5 episodes versus 1.2%/patient-year for ≥ 6 episodes (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.59–1.34]). In an exploratory analysis, patients with previous SCAF but no episode ≥ 6 minutes in the 6 months before enrollment had a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than patients with at least one episode during that period (0.5% versus 1.1%/patient-year; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.27–0.85]). The frequency of SCAF did not modify the reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban (P interaction = 0.1). The duration of the longest SCAF episode in the 6 months before enrollment was not associated with the risk of stroke or systemic embolism during follow-up (< 1 hour: 1.0%/patient-year; 1–6 hours: 1.2%/patient-year [adjusted hazard ratio, 1.27 (95% CI, 0.85–1.90)]; > 6 hours: 1.0%/patient-year [adjusted hazard ratio, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.63–1.66)]). SCAF duration did not modify the reduction in stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban (P trend = 0.1).

Conclusions

In ARTESiA, baseline SCAF frequency and longest episode duration were not associated with risk of stroke or systemic embolism and did not modify the effect of apixaban on reduction of stroke or systemic embolism.

Finally, current guidelines recommend considering prior stroke and bleeding events, among other risk factors, when deciding on anticoagulant therapy for subclinical AF. Thus, as a sensitivity analysis, we constructed a separate model in which changes in treatment status after experienced events were accounted for: the occurrence of an intracranial bleeding event in a patient using NOACs led to cessation of anticoagulation, and an ischemic stroke event led to the initiation of anticoagulation. Cumulative QALYs in a 10-year model were compared based on the initial anticoagulation decision in an intention-to-treat manner.

### Use of oral anticoagulation in a real-world population with device detected atrial fibrillation [^1ea9f9db]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Current US guidelines strongly support the use of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ≥ 2 stroke risk factors, without regard of AF duration or burden. 1 Device‐detected AF of various durations, often referred to as subclinical AF, has been shown to be associated with increased stroke risk, though at a rate less than that of clinically detected AF. 2, 3, 4 Anticoagulation recommendations for clinical AF are based on studies of stroke risk in the clinical AF population. 1 While patients may have both clinical and subclinical AF, the increasing use of implantable and consumer‐grade technologies capable of detecting AF will likely increase the latter population significantly. There is, however, considerable clinical equipoise about the management of these episodes of subclinical AF, particularly those that are paroxysmal and of short duration. Even the 2019 update of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines noted that it is not yet clear what the optimal management strategy is in these patients with regards to anticoagulation. 1 There are trials currently being conducted to answer this question, but in the meantime, clinicians are presented with such clinical scenarios daily. 5, 6

A recent statement from the American Heart Association noted the considerable evidence gap in answering this clinical question. 7 Given the uncertainty of anticoagulation management in device‐detected AF and the absence of randomized trial results for guidance, it is of interest to determine the practice patterns of anticoagulation use in patients with device‐detected AF among US physicians.

### Pivotal trials testing the efficacy of novel anticoagulants for preventing emerging cardioembolic risk entities [^74d9900f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Two recent RCTs investigated the use of NOACs in AHRE/subclinical AF. First, the double‐blind placebo‐controlled NOAH‐AFNET 6 (Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes) trial investigated anticoagulation with edoxaban versus placebo (or aspirin if indicated) in 2536 patients aged ≥ 65 years with AHRE detected by an implanted device (Table). Notably, the trial was halted early for safety reasons, as the rate of major bleeding was increased in the edoxaban arm (2.1% versus 1.0% per patient‐year). The primary end point — a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism (including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism) — was not different (3.2% using edoxaban versus 4.0% per patient‐year), with no difference regarding stroke (1.1% using edoxaban versus 0.9% per patient‐year) in a population with 10% prior stroke/transient ischemic attack at baseline (Table). In addition to premature termination compromising power, the primary end point of NOAH‐AFNET 6 includes components that are less responsive to oral anticoagulation treatment (eg myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death), driving the study result toward equipoise. A published subanalysis of NOAH‐AFNET 6 revealed that AHRE lasting ≥ 24 hours did not interact with the efficacy or safety of oral anticoagulation, but this subgroup of 259 patients was small and there were only a few events during follow‐up. Second, the double‐blind placebo‐controlled ARTESIA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients With Device‐Detected Sub‐Clinical Atrial Fibrillation) trial randomized 4012 patients (aged ≥ 55 years, CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 3) with device‐detected subclinical AF to apixaban or aspirin. The trial was terminated early because of problems in resupply of medication, slow recruitment, and an event rate lower than expected. After a mean follow‐up of 3.5 years, the rate of stroke and systemic embolism was lower with apixaban versus aspirin (0.78% versus 1.24% per patient‐year) in a population with 9% prior stroke/transient ischemic attack at randomization. Although there was a relative risk reduction of 37% regarding the primary end point in the intention‐to‐treat population (Table), the relative risk of major bleeding was increased by 80% in the apixaban arm (1.7% versus 0.94% per patient‐year) in the on‐treatment population.

Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common dysrhythmia in the United States, with a prevalence that is expected to rise significantly as the population ages. Despite the recognition of several modifiable risk factors for AF, such as obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and alcohol use, its prevalence and incidence continue to grow, making it an attractive target for preventive interventions. The preventive approach for AF is 2‐fold: (1) targeting and treating risk factors and (2) promptly diagnosing and initiating antithrombotic therapy to minimize thromboembolic complications.

Although limiting symptoms may significantly affect one's quality of life, the most feared complication associated with AF is stroke or systemic embolism. To this end, selective ECG screening for clinically asymptomatic disease in otherwise healthy persons may be indicated for stroke prevention. In the recently presented STROKESTOP (Population screening of 75‐ and 76‐year‐old men and women for silent atrial fibrillation) trial, population‐based screening of asymptomatic patients in Sweden identified 5% of the population as candidates for oral anticoagulation. The full study is currently under way.

Once AF has been diagnosed, thromboembolic risk assessment should be performed to determine optimal antithrombotic therapy. The 2014 ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society AF guidelines recommend risk stratification using the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, which performs better than the CHADS₂ score alone. Although not formally recommended in the guidelines yet, biomarkers, including high‐sensitivity troponin, have been shown to improve risk assessment. Although aspirin and warfarin have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in AF, – most patients warrant anticoagulant therapy. Until recently, warfarin was the sole anticoagulant approved for AF patients. Novel oral anticoagulants now offer alternatives that do not require prothrombin time monitoring and are associated with superior efficacy and/or safety in nonvalvular AF. – These agents inhibit the coagulation cascade either as a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or a factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, which has not yet received US Food and Drug Administration approval).

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^5abb0200]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Although the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials have elucidated the prognosis of subclinical AF and the effects of its treatment, many clinically relevant questions remain unanswered. The stroke risk in patients with subclinical AF appears to be low, and determining if the one-third reduction of this already low stroke risk is worth the two-thirds increase in major bleeding can be challenging for clinicians. Numerical comparison of event rates does not capture the true burden of outcomes, as the severity of events varies considerably. Furthermore, anticoagulation modifies event severity, reducing the severity of ischemic strokes while increasing the severity of intracranial bleeding events. In addition to assessing whether there in fact even is a net benefit or net harm with anticoagulation, the magnitude of this effect remains unclear. Intuitively weighing the impact of possible outcomes on an individual's life is complex, let alone effectively communicating this information to enable shared decision-making on the initiation of a new, somewhat costly, and potentially cumbersome medication. We aimed to answer these important clinical questions with a Markov decision model analysis. Based on the new trial-based data on outcome probabilities and prior evidence on their impact on quality of life, we assessed the outcomes of initiating NOACs in patients with device-detected subclinical AF.

The widespread use of cardiac implantable electronic devices and wearable monitors has led to the detection of subclinical atrial fibrillation in a substantial proportion of patients. There is evidence that these asymptomatic arrhythmias are associated with increased risk of stroke. Thus, detection of subclinical atrial fibrillation may offer an opportunity to reduce stroke risk by initiating anticoagulation. However, it is unknown whether long-term anticoagulation is warranted and in what populations. This scientific statement explores the existing data on the prevalence, clinical significance, and management of subclinical atrial fibrillation and identifies current gaps in knowledge and areas of controversy and consensus.

CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED risk assessment and anticoagulation — Until more evidence is forthcoming, stroke and bleeding risk in these patients should be assessed using CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED, and a high HAS-BLED score is not a reason to withhold OAC. Given that all clinical risk scores have only modest predictive value, the initial step should be the identification of 'low risk' patients (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 in males, 1 in females) who do not need any antithrombotic therapy; the subsequent step is to consider stroke prevention (which is OAC) in patients with ≥ 1 stroke risk factors, with a clear recommendation for OAC in those with CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2. OAC refers to a NOAC or well controlled VKA, with time in the therapeutic range (TTR) > 70%, and a TTR of > 70% is associated with the best efficacy and safety of the VKAs; a good TTR can be predicted by clinical factors encompassed within the SAMe-TT2R2 score.

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^6d1629db]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The current study employed Markov decision modeling to evaluate the net benefit of treating patients with device-detected subclinical AF with NOACs. Over the 10-year simulation period, patients initiated with NOACs had fewer ischemic strokes and more major bleeding events, and these resulted in marginally higher total life-years and QALYs when compared with withholding treatment. However, importantly, the magnitude of outcome differences was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to model the net effect size of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF. Previous evidence on the overall benefits of NOACs in this patient group has not been entirely conclusive, with the results of the 2 major trials pointing in somewhat different directions. Additionally, disparities in the trial designs complicate the implementation of the evidence they provide. Current US guidelines emphasize the importance of personalized risk assessment and shared decision-making and recommend considering NOACs for patients with longer atrial high-rate episodes and high stroke risk scores. However, these recommendations are based on observational data and have not been strongly supported by the data from the 2 trials. Moreover, intuitively weighing the net impact of the treatment on patients' lives in a clinical setting is challenging, particularly when the initial untreated risks are so low. To achieve this, it is crucial not only to compare event rates but also to assess the variations in mortality and quality of life associated with different events. When initiating a new medication with rare but serious adverse risks, it is essential to consider patients' values and preferences, but effectively translating previous evidence to the patient to facilitate shared decision-making is difficult.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^6a83bf4b]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — supportive evidence and pathophysiology relevant to secondary prevention indicate that the left atrial appendage is thought to be the main source of cardioembolism in AF and, in a series of patients with stroke and AF evaluated by echocardiography, 90% of identified thrombus was seen in the left atrial appendage; anticoagulation decreases thrombus formation systemically, including the left atrium, and reduces the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in AF, but at the cost of increased bleeding. VKA with warfarin reduced the primary event rate in the randomized SPAF trial by 67% (7.4% to 2.3%) and was superior to treatment with aspirin alone, which reduced the primary event rate by 42%; four direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have been studied in 4 large randomized trials against VKA with consistent evidence of noninferior reduction in thromboembolic risk and reduced bleeding risks. All trials of DOACs specifically excluded patients with valvular AF; however, up to 20% of patients in these trials had some degree of valvular heart disease (VHD), and DOACs should not be used in patients with moderately severe or severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve. Additionally, the presence of stroke or TIA places a patient in a category in which anticoagulation is recommended regardless of other risk factors, and even brief subclinical episodes of AF are associated with increased risk of stroke.

Conclusions

In this decision analysis model study, initiating anticoagulation in patients with device-detected subclinical AF was associated with minimally higher QALYs. However, the benefits were uncertain, and the effect size did not appear to be clinically meaningful. Overall, the results do not support routine use of NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with device-detected subclinical AF.

The small effect size of the benefit of anticoagulation is understandable, given the low untreated stroke rate it aims to mitigate and the substantially higher competing risk of mortality in this patient population characterized by advanced age and high prevalence of comorbidities. The increase in bleeding events, although largely consisting of milder extracranial bleeds, further reduces the potential benefits of anticoagulation. Additionally, clinical AF can be considered a competing event. Once overt AF develops, the decision on anticoagulation becomes more straightforward according to current guidelines, making it outside the scope of the initial question of whether or not to start anticoagulation in the clinical setting of subclinical AF. Indeed, the rather short time before these competing events limits the likelihood that the small stroke risk will materialize for patients. The multistate Markov model used inherently incorporates these competing events and their outcomes. Moreover, the competing risks are even higher in real-life patients.

Questions remain as to what to recommend for patients and what patients would choose. Prior studies have shown that patients are generally more inclined to avoid strokes than bleeding events, even more so than their physicians, which is in part understandable since strokes result in permanent loss of brain tissue, whereas major bleeding is typically reversible. However, intracranial bleedings, despite their small share of all major bleeding events, actually confer substantial mortality and permanent disability, particularly with prior anticoagulantion. It may be that patients are less aware of potential harms of bleeding events, and thus the fear of strokes dominates patients' views in treatment decisions. Moreover, patients' values and preferences vary considerably; some are willing to pursue all possible treatments for even minor gains, while others prioritize avoiding potentially cumbersome medications, their costs, and even minor adverse effects.

Subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias — stroke prevention recommendation: The presence of atrial high rate episode (AHRE) > 5 min is associated with an increased risk of stroke/SE, especially with ≥ 2 stroke risk factors using the CHA2DS2-VASc score; thus, oral anticoagulation (OAC) should be considered in such patients, whether as a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) or a well controlled vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with TTR > 70%.

Subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) risk stratification and anticoagulation — device-detected atrial high rate episodes (AHRE): Assessment of the patient's stroke risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc score is recommended. No antithrombotic therapy for any patient with CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 in males or 1 in females, irrespective of AHRE, is recommended. For patients with two additional CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors (i.e. ≥ 2 in males, ≥ 3 in females) oral anticoagulation is recommended if AF burden > 5.5 h/day (if there are no contraindications). Consider oral anticoagulation for AF burden (longest total duration of AF on any given day) of > 5.5 h in patients with 1 additional CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor (i.e. score = 1 in males, = 2 in females). Recognize that the data suggest risk is similarly increased by a mere 5-min episode, but it is reasonable to see a patient with only a single 5-min episode again in follow-up to observe their AF burden over time before committing them to life-long oral anticoagulation. Bleeding risk should be assessed using validated scores, such as the HAS-BLED score; patients at high risk (score ≥ 3) should be identified for more regular review and follow-up, and the reversible bleeding risk factors addressed, and a high HAS-BLED score is not a reason to withhold anticoagulation.

Methods

Analytic Approach

The study follows, in applicable parts and excluding the economic aspects, the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline statement. According to Finnish legislation on medical research, ethical approval and informed consent were deemed unnecessary, as this study used an analytical model based on publicly available data without collecting new data or accessing patient information. We estimated the net changes of the decision to initiate NOACs on the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of a patient with subclinical AF, compared with the decision to withhold anticoagulation using a decision analytic Markov model. This modeling approach is necessary since the original trials did not report quality-of-life outcomes, and assessing net benefit using this measure in a clinical trial would require a substantially larger sample size and longer follow-up to reliably capture the long-term quality-of-life effects of the treatment. The Markov model consists of multiple health states individuals can move between based on specific transition probabilities (Table 1).

Table 1.
Markov Model Input Parameters

Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; NOAC, nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; RR, relative risk.

Rates and probabilities were transformed to 1-month probabilities to the model.

Base Case Patient

As a base case patient for the analysis, we used a patient aged 77 years, aligning with the mean age of the trial populations, and applied the average untreated stroke and bleeding rates from the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials. Similarly, average mortality rates were obtained from these trials. Our model focused on ischemic strokes, major bleeding, and mortality since these are the main outcomes to consider when evaluating the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy. Other events, such as myocardial infarctions and pulmonary embolisms, were excluded from the model also because their incidence did not change with anticoagulation in the trials, and their impact on quality of life varies considerably.

### Great debate: device-detected subclinical atrial fibrillation should be treated like clinical atrial fibrillation [^2de1b9d8]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

It has been postulated that the risk of stroke is related to the duration and burden of SCAF. Longer duration of SCAF episodes between 12 and 23 h is independently associated with the risk of clinical AF. Device-detected AF and higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores at baseline also predict the subsequent development of clinical AF. These factors possibly contributed to the higher risk of stroke with SCAF episodes lasting > 24 h as reported in the ASSERT study. The heterogeneity of SCAF definition and differences in previously analysed patient populations add to the complexity of determining the optimal burden and duration of SCAF that could benefit from OAC therapy.

The risk of bleeding is also a major concern, as studies of novel OAC have demonstrated a risk of bleeding from 3% to 5%. Two large randomized controlled trials, NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESIA, have recently added to our understanding of the role of nonvitamin K antagonist OAC in this group of patients. Although providing further information, the management of device-detected silent AF should be focused on offering a personalized, patient-centred approach; balancing the risks and benefits of OAC initiation; as well as identifying and reducing the factors driving AF progression to improve overall clinical outcomes.

Although providing the clinician with greater granularity of rhythm monitoring, several important questions remain. Here, we present the debate on the equipoise related to device-detected SCAF and how the clinician should manage these patients (Graphical Abstract).

### Direct oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation: a study-level meta-analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials [^8dd673ea]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Device-detected atrial fibrillation (also known as subclinical atrial fibrillation or atrial high-rate episodes) is a common finding in patients with an implanted cardiac rhythm device and is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Whether oral anticoagulation is effective and safe in this patient population is unclear.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Embase for randomized trials comparing oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet or no antithrombotic therapy in adults with device-detected atrial fibrillation recorded by a pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, cardiac resynchronization therapy device, or implanted cardiac monitor. We used random-effects models for meta-analysis and rated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (GRADE). The review was preregistered (PROSPERO CRD42023463212).

Results

From 785 citations, we identified 2 randomized trials with relevant clinical outcome data: NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes; 2536 participants) evaluated edoxaban, and ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation; 4012 participants) evaluated apixaban. Meta-analysis demonstrated that oral anticoagulation with these agents reduced ischemic stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50–0.92]; high-quality evidence). The results from the 2 trials were consistent (I² statistic for heterogeneity = 0%). Oral anticoagulation also reduced a composite of cardiovascular death, all-cause stroke, peripheral arterial embolism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.73–0.99]; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There was no reduction in cardiovascular death (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.76–1.17]; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.96–1.21]; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). Oral anticoagulation increased major bleeding (RR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.05–2.50]; I² = 61%; high-quality evidence).

Conclusions

The results of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials are consistent with each other. Meta-analysis of these 2 large randomized trials provides high-quality evidence that oral anticoagulation with edoxaban or apixaban reduces the risk of stroke in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation and increases the risk of major bleeding.

### Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation detected by an implantable cardiac monitor: a subgroup analysis of ARTESiA [^7f6335e2]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The ARTESiA trial randomized patients with pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or implantable cardiac monitor (ICM), and with subclinical atrial fibrillation to either apixaban or aspirin.

Objective

We aimed to explore the effects of apixaban in the subset of patients with an ICM.

Methods

We assessed the efficacy outcome of stroke or systemic embolism (SE) and the safety outcome of major bleeding, stratifying by device type.

Results

Of 4,012 participants, 209 (5.2%) had ICM and 3,803 (94.8%) had pacemaker/ICD. Patients with ICM were younger (74.9 ± 7.4 vs 76.9 ± 7.6 years), more likely to be female (50.2% vs 35.3%) and to have a prior stroke (24.9% vs 7.7%) than those with pacemaker/ICD. In the ICM cohort, stroke/SE occurred in 1 of 103 in the apixaban group (0.3%/year) vs 9 of 106 in the aspirin group (2.6%/year); HR 0.11 [95% CI: 0.01–0.88] and ARR 2.31%/year [95% CI: 0.55–4.07]. The corresponding rates in the pacemaker/ICD cohort were 0.8%/year with apixaban vs 1.2%/year with aspirin; HR 0.69 [95% CI: 0.49–0.98] and ARR 0.36%/year [95% CI: 0.02–0.70] (pinteraction = 0.078 and 0.002, respectively). Among patients with ICM, major bleeding occurred at 1.3%/year vs 1.1%/year for apixaban vs aspirin; HR 1.13 [95% CI: 0.30–4.31]. No significant difference in HR or ARR was observed across the device types (pinteraction = 0.808 and 0.406, respectively).

Conclusion

In ARTESiA, patients with ICM experienced a stroke rate at 2.6%/year on aspirin, higher than that in the remaining trial population. The risk was significantly reduced by apixaban, consistent with the overall ARTESiA results.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, DOACs, CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend to prefer DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) over warfarin in most patients with NVAF.

Progression and safety context for rhythm control and ablation — in patients with subclinical AF < 24 hours, progression to overt AF or episodes > 24 hours occurs at a rate of 8.8% per year and those who develop AF are more likely to be hospitalized for HF; in one trial, serious adverse events associated with ablation were observed in 8% of patients; the treatment effect of rhythm control was largest in those who underwent catheter ablation for rhythm control, particularly in those with paroxysmal AF and LA diameters ≤ 50 mm; in a post hoc analysis of EAST-AFNET 4, the benefit of rhythm control on the primary composite outcome was independent of symptom status, and catheter ablation for rhythm control was used in approximately 20% of patients, whether symptomatic or not.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: looking forward [^3abf18c8]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Ischemic strokes related to atrial fibrillation are highly prevalent, presenting with severe neurologic syndromes and associated with high risk of recurrence. Although advances have been made in both primary and secondary stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation, the long-term risks for stroke recurrence and bleeding complications from antithrombotic treatment remain substantial. We summarize the major advances in stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation during the past 30 years and focus on novel diagnostic and treatment approaches currently under investigation in ongoing clinical trials. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants have been proven to be safer and equally effective compared with warfarin in stroke prevention for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are being investigated for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease, for the treatment of patients with recent embolic stroke of undetermined source and indirect evidence of cardiac embolism, and in the prevention of vascular-mediated cognitive decline in patients with atrial fibrillation. Multiple clinical trials are assessing the optimal timing of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant initiation after a recent ischemic stroke and the benefit:harm ratio of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation and history of previous intracranial bleeding. Ongoing trials are addressing the usefulness of left atrial appendage occlusion in both primary and secondary stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation, including those with high risk of bleeding. The additive value of prolonged cardiac monitoring for subclinical atrial fibrillation detection through smartphone applications or implantable cardiac devices, together with the optimal medical management of individuals with covert paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, is a topic of intensive research interest. Colchicine treatment and factor XIa inhibition constitute 2 novel pharmacologic approaches that might provide future treatment options in the secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke attributable to atrial fibrillation.

### Atrial high-rate episode duration thresholds and thromboembolic risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c716fda]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The meta‐regression graphically suggested a linear association between AHRE threshold and stroke risk, although the statistical result was not significant. Although this result may be limited by the potential overlap of the various duration thresholds, it suggests a potential dose‐dependent relation between AHRE duration and thromboembolic risk and generates the hypothesis that AHRE may need to be considered as a continuous variable.

Traditionally, when it comes to treatment decisions on stroke prevention, AF is considered in a binary manner (ie, present or absent), without taking into consideration the burden of AF. In specific, the pattern of AF (ie, paroxysmal or permanent) is not taken into consideration to guide decisions about antithrombotic treatment, as it is believed that it does not add significantly to the assessment of risk based on patient characteristics (ie, the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score). Despite the evidence that AHRE of short duration increases the thromboembolic risk, it is still unclear whether this risk is high enough to allow for a potential beneficial effect of oral anticoagulation that would exceed the associated bleeding risk. Although in some of the included studies patients were treated with anticoagulants, there is still no evidence to prove the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF, and this is investigated in the ongoing (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients With Device‐Detected Sub‐Clinical Atrial Fibrillation) and NOAH‐AFNET (the Non–vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes‐Atrial Fibrillation NETwork) trials. Currently, the assessment of the thromboembolic risk in patients with subclinical AF is based on the individualized thromboembolic risk (ie, the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score), and anticoagulation may only be considered in specific patients with longer AHREs (≥ 24 hours). The initiation of anticoagulation after a cumulative AF > 24 hours was recently associated with reduced stroke risk, although this was only significant when AF lasted at least 6 minutes. Also, we are dealing with a heterogeneous and dynamic arrhythmia, and what is 30‐seconds duration at one monitoring period may be 30 hours at the next monitoring period.

AF Detected After: How Strong Is the Causal Association?

There is a growing amount of evidence that suggests that the causal association of AF detected after ESUS is weaker than initially considered. For example, in the ASSERT (Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation and the Risk of Stroke) and TRENDS (The Relationship Between Daily Atrial Tachyarrhythmia Burden From Implantable Device Diagnostics and Stroke Risk) studies, the majority of embolic events did not occur proximal to recent episodes of atrial tachycardia or fibrillation. In addition, the rate of AF detection was similar between patients with ESUS and non‐ESUS stroke in the AF‐Randomized study.

Moreover, the negative results of the NAVIGATE ESUS (Rivaroxaban for Stroke Prevention After Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) and RE‐SPECT ESUS trials, in which rivaroxaban and dabigatran, respectively, did not reduce stroke rates compared with aspirin, point to the same direction; if AF was a major cause of ESUS, it could be expected that they would show reduced stroke rates compared with aspirin in these 2 trials. Considering the striking benefit of apixaban in reducing the risk of stroke compared with aspirin in patients with AF in the AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) trial, the results of NAVIGATE ESUS and RE‐SPECT ESUS do not support the hypothesis of strong causal association between AF and ESUS.

It is hypothesized that the more proximal an AF episode is to the index stroke, and the longer it lasts, the more likely it is that there is a causal association. On the other hand, episodes that are chronologically distant from the ESUS or are of short duration might be irrelevant in regard to cause. The hypothesis that AF episodes of shorter duration are only weakly associated with ESUS, if at all, is also supported by the results of the NOAH‐AFNET‐6 (Non vitamin K antagonist Oral anticoagulants in patients with Atrial High rate episodes) trial, which evaluated the potential benefit of oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial high‐rate episodes. The trial was terminated prematurely due to an observed trend toward futility for efficacy combined with expected safety concerns, which weakens the putative causal association of short episodes of AF with ESUS.

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^b874da41]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

However, we would argue that for practically all patients diagnosed with subclinical AF by a cardiac device, who are often well over the age of 80 years with several preexisting comorbidities, the potential gains from anticoagulation would seem negligible. Indeed, the uncertain benefits of additional days or weeks over a 10-year perspective would likely be considered minimal by most patients and not worth the burden of a new medication. Nevertheless, it is possible that some younger patients with longer life expectancies are more willing to initiate NOACs to benefit from the small potential gains in stroke reduction over a longer period. However, this is generally not the case for elderly patients with cardiac devices detecting subclinical AF in clinical practice. Of the 2 trials on NOACs in subclinical AF, our results support the conclusions of the NOAH-AFNET 6. Our results align with the cautious level IIb recommendation of the latest European guidelines on anticoagulation for device-detected AF and do not support upgrading this recommendation. The minimal effect size in our analysis is also concordant with the small and uncertain effect of AF screening on clinical outcomes. Indeed, in light of current evidence, it remains uncertain whether subclinical AF should even be routinely screened for with cardiac devices implanted for other indications.

### Device-detected atrial fibrillation and the impact of prior stroke in stroke prevention [^a2cd825d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The recently reported results from 2 trials (NOAH‐AFNET‐6 [Non‐vitamin K antagonist Oral Anticaogulants in Patients with Atrial High Rate Episodes]and ARTESIA [Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients with Device‐etected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation]) evaluating patients with a low burden (generally < 24 hours) of DDAF have shed new light on the potential risks and benefits of anticoagulation in this population. In 1 secondary analysis of the ARTESIA trial, the benefit of anticoagulation in these patients appears to be augmented by a higher CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc (congestive heart failure, age, diabetes, stroke, (female) sex, and vascular disease history) score. In that subgroup analysis, there was no benefit of apixaban over aspirin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism when the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc score was < 4 (absolute risk reduction [ARR] −0.04 [95% CI, −1.94 to 1.85]). Conversely, patients with a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc score of 4 (ARR −2.25 [95% CI, −4.19 to 0.31]) or > 4 (ARR –3.95 [95% CI, −6.72 to −1.19]) had a lower risk of stroke/systemic embolism or cardiovascular death with apixaban (P interaction = 0.06). Moreover, there appeared to be no effect of the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc score in the risk of major bleeding in this analysis (P interaction = 0.60). These data challenge previously published findings from the AVERROES trial (Apixaban versus Acetylsalicylic Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment), which unlike ARTESIA, enrolled patients with permanent, persistent, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In the AVERROES trial, investigators found no significant difference across the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc strata with respect to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. Although patients in the highest CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc stratum (6–8) were at the highest risk of ischemic stroke, these patients derived a similar benefit with apixaban for preventing ischemic stroke as compared with those with scores of 3–5 or 2 (P interaction = 0.35). One potential explanation for the differential findings from AVERROES and ARTESIA (which reported a differential benefit of apixaban across CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc strata) may be that a minority of patients (27%) from AVERROES had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and burden of atrial fibrillation was not fully characterized. A more sophisticated risk stratification schema, incorporating atrial fibrillation burden, CHA 2 DS 2 ‐Vasc score, and other clinical or laboratory findings may be necessary to identify a patient group likely to benefit from anticoagulation.

2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation (AF) guideline — identified gaps and research priorities span ablation outcomes, devices, procedural standards, candidate selection, artificial intelligence, anticoagulation strategies, subclinical AF thresholds, risk scores, and LAA strategies. Historically, ablation failure has been defined as having 30 seconds of AF, yet this 30-second metric might not reflect meaningful burden reduction and patient-oriented outcomes are emphasized. Consumer wearable heart monitoring devices are widespread for AF diagnosis and therapy monitoring, but validation of accuracy and how best to use them, including for AF screening, must be better defined. Large practice variation in AF ablation persists; large registries and more data are required, the value of extra ablation lines remains uncertain, and best approaches to persistent AF and repeat ablation are poorly defined. Better criteria and clinical markers are needed to identify when catheter ablation is unlikely to benefit and to define candidacy for first-time and repeat procedures. Artificial intelligence could potentially tailor therapy choices such as anticoagulation versus left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO), rhythm versus rate control, or catheter ablation versus medical therapy. After ablation, ongoing trials are assessing anticoagulation strategies because it is unclear in whom anticoagulation can be discontinued; studies of intermittent or continuous rhythm monitoring to guide anticoagulation are underway, and "PITP" or "electrocardiographic-guided" approaches are investigational. For subclinical AF, the AF burden threshold that mandates stroke-prevention therapy must be better defined. Reliance on the CHA2DS2-VASc score may limit use of other potentially useful scores, and additional studies are needed for group-specific tools. Surgical left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion has shown benefit but rigorous trials included concomitant anticoagulation; more evidence is needed for patients with anticoagulation contraindications and around rhythm-control interventions such as cardioversion.

Perioperative direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) interruption — The PAUSE protocol studied patients on apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, and resulted in low rates of major bleeding (0.90%-1.85%) and thromboembolism (< 1%). A high rate (> 90%) of minimal anticoagulant level (< 50 ng/mL) was achieved, and a meta-analysis of reports of periprocedural events from pivotal DOAC trials suggested similar outcomes in patients on DOAC or warfarin, with reduced major bleeding during an uninterrupted strategy with DOACs.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation two or more months post AF ablation — consensus recommendation, rationale, and monitoring: It is the consensus of this Task Force Writing Group that systemic anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely in patients with a high risk for stroke as estimated by currently recommended schemes (CHADS₂, or CHA₂DS₂-VASc), especially those who are 75 years of age or older or with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); this is based on observations that AF recurrences and asymptomatic AF are common, AF ablation destroys a portion of the atria with uncertain stroke impact, no large randomized trials have assessed stopping anticoagulation, and direct thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are more convenient than warfarin. A TRENDS sub-analysis identified a subgroup of 40 patients (1.6%) with stroke or systemic embolism and reported that 29 (73%) had a zero AF burden within 30 days prior to the event. For patients who stop systemic anticoagulation we recommend that some type of continuous monitoring be performed to screen for silent AF at regular intervals as long as they remain off systemic anticoagulation.

Limitations

The most important limitations of our study are related to the inherent challenges of mathematically modeling complex real-life scenarios. Parameter uncertainty may affect the results of the main analysis, since due to a lack of available data, we were unable to derive all model input values directly from randomized studies investigating patients with subclinical AF on NOACs. Relatedly, baseline risks for stroke, bleeding and mortality are most likely higher in real-life patients with subclinical AF than in the trial participants. However, importantly, all these aspects were explored in the sensitivity analyses, wherein the magnitude of differences between the treatment decisions remained small even when the model inputs were changed across a clinically credible range. Our model's base-case scenario reflected average age and treatment effects from the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials, but the benefits of anticoagulation may vary in some specific clinical scenarios, such as in younger patients with higher stroke risk scores. Of note, our analysis focused on stroke and major bleeding events, excluding nonmajor bleeding. Additionally, our study did not account for the impact of NOAC medication use per se on quality of life, such as associated costs, pharmacy visits, minor adverse effects, and the need for additional blood tests. The model also assumed complete adherence to initiated NOAC therapy. All these factors would likely further reduce the observed marginal benefits of anticoagulation in a real-world setting. Moreover, the utility weights used cannot account for all variations in subjective experiences and patient values. For instance, some patients may view a severely disabling stroke as a worse outcome than death. Finally, mathematical models cannot account for all the multifaceted possibilities that may occur for patients in real life; however, our model considered the most important aspects that the decision to initiate anticoagulation actually affects.

Moreover, we investigated how varying model inputs across a clinically relevant scale was associated with the difference in cumulative QALYs between the decision groups over a 10-year simulation period. First, while randomized clinical trials are the criterion standard in determining relative treatment effect, the absolute effect size may be different in patients treated outside the clinical setting due to usually higher untreated risks when compared with trial participants. Thus, to assess potential changes in the effect size, the initial ischemic stroke, bleeding, and mortality rates were raised to reflect observational studies (1.9, 1.7, and 8.5 per 100 patient-years, respectively). Second, we explored different weights for the outcome of NOACs on bleeding types, ranging from 70% to 90% weight for the proportion of nonintracranial bleedings of the overall increase in major bleedings. Third, we adjusted the effects of NOACs on stroke and bleeding based on the hazard ratio point estimates of the trials: 0.79 for ischemic stroke and 2.10 for major bleeding in NOAH-AFNET 6 and 0.62 for ischemic stroke and 1.36 for major bleeding in ARTESiA.

Additionally, a substudy of the ARTESiA trial showed a trend toward better stroke prevention with NOACs in patients with higher stroke risk scores. However, this trend was not statistically significant, and a similar phenomenon was not observed in the NOAH trial. Nonetheless, as a hypothesis-generating analysis, we performed separate analyses to explore the net benefit in the 3 CHA₂DS₂-VASc (congestive heart failure [1 point], hypertension [1 point], age ≥ 75 years [2 points], diabetes [1 point], history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points], vascular disease [1 point], age 65–74 years [1 point], female sex category [1 point]) score categories of the ARTESiA substudy (> 4, 4, or > 4). We used the average nonanticoagulated stroke and major bleeding rates of the ARTESiA and NOAH trials and the hazard ratio point estimates for stroke and bleeding from the ARTESiA trial. Mortality rates in different risk score categories were not reported in the ARTESiA substudy, and they were derived from the NOAH trial. The values used in this sensitivity analysis are presented in the eTable in Supplement 1.

Antiplatelet therapy in atrial fibrillation — evidence and directive: A meta-analysis of AF trials from the 1990s and early 2000s found that while antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke and systemic embolism compared with placebo, antiplatelet therapy was inferior to warfarin. In AVERROES, the trial was stopped early due to the benefit of apixaban over aspirin to prevent stroke or systemic embolism, with similar major bleeding between arms; in ACTIVEW, the trial was stopped prematurely due to the superiority of anticoagulation with VKAs. Unless there is an indication for antiplatelet therapy such as CAD or vascular disease, patients with AF should not be prescribed antiplatelet therapy to reduce stroke risk.

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS atrial fibrillation — direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs): DOACs were developed to address the disadvantages of warfarin and are currently recommended as the first-line therapy over warfarin in patients with AF (except moderate to severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve recipients). Across pivotal trials, major bleeding risks were lower in the apixaban, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and edoxaban 30 mg or 60 mg daily dose groups versus warfarin, while differences were nonsignificant for the dabigatran 150 mg twice daily group or the rivaroxaban group; all DOAC groups showed significantly lower risks of intracranial hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding risks were significantly higher with dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, edoxaban 60 mg once daily, and rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, whereas apixaban did not significantly increase gastrointestinal bleeding versus warfarin.

Oral anticoagulant therapy in asymptomatic atrial fibrillation — Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) using either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) effectively reduces stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality in AF patients at increased risk of stroke, and compared to VKAs, NOACs exert broadly similar efficacy, but are safer with less intracranial bleeding, and more convenient for long-term use. The decision to use OAC for thromboprophylaxis in AF patients depends on the presence of CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk factors, but not on arrhythmia-related symptoms. In observational studies of asymptomatic AF, OAC use vs. no therapy has been associated with a significant reduction in stroke and mortality; and residual stroke risk was similar among anticoagulated AF patients and matched non-AF controls; however, adherence can be challenging, with a screening-detected cohort reporting the 5-year adherence to OAC was 88% and stroke rates significantly declined. After AF ablation, whether OAC can be stopped is uncertain, and current guidelines recommend continuation of OAC in the presence of stroke risk factors, irrespective of the apparent success of rhythm-control interventions; the OCEAN trial is an ongoing multicentre randomized controlled trial evaluating two antithrombotic treatment strategies (rivaroxaban vs. aspirin).

Atrial fibrillation burden was defined as cumulative duration of all atrial fibrillation episodes lasting > 6 min from the first adjudicated atrial fibrillation episode onward, divided by total duration of monitoring

Device-detected atrial fibrillation

Systematic Holter ECG recordings first showed that short atrial arrhythmias, including atrial runs and frequent atrial ectopy, can be precursors of AF. Such short atrial arrhythmias are associated with a risk of AF, stroke, and death. Different terms were used to describe short and rare atrial arrhythmias, including micro-AF, subclinical AF, and atrial high-rate episodes. In the NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial High Rate Episodes) trial, almost all (97%) atrial high-rate episodes documented at enrolment were confirmed to be AF by an experienced core lab. The analysis of DDAF episodes helped to improve our understanding of the development of AF: DDAF is found 10 times more (∼30% of patients with implanted devices and stroke risk factors)than ECG-diagnosed AF. Many patients only have a few short episodes of DDAF. In the LOOP (Atrial Fibrillation Detected by Continuous ECG Monitoring Using Implantable Loop Recorder to Prevent Stroke in High-risk Individuals) study, the median AF burden was 0.13%, 16% of patients in LOOP progressed to episodes lasting longer than 24 h, but 22% did not have repeat episodes in the last 6 months or longer of monitoring. Two large randomized trials with 6-monthly ECGs during clinic visits consistently show a slow progression from DDAF to ECG-diagnosed AF [ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients with Device-Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation), 6%/year including advancement to long episodes of DDAF; NOAH-AFNET 6, 9%/year]. The slightly higher rate of progression in NOAH-AFNET 6 may be due to the shorter follow-up time and inclusion of patients with longer episodes in NOAH-AFNET 6.

Severe CKD and dialysis — anticoagulation considerations note that the role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is controversial. The pivotal clinical trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min, but FDA-approved labeling was extended to include those with end-stage renal failure, including those on hemodialysis. A pharmacokinetic study found apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily produced drug levels approximating those seen with 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more appropriate dose in such patients. Observational data are mixed: a Medicare cohort found no difference in thromboembolism but less major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin, while another analysis found increased risk of thromboembolism and fatal or intracranial bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin in hemodialysis did not show differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but reported significantly more bleeding than stroke events.

### Global results of implantable loop recorder for detection of atrial fibrillation after stroke: reveal LINQ registry [^98ab62ea]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Incident ischemic stroke/TIA was infrequent in patients with detected AF in the present study and was numerically less common than in those without detection, although one should note that few events could cause statistical bias. One interpretation could be that, once AF was detected, appropriate AF‐associated stroke prevention, including OAC, catheter ablation, and device therapies, were commonly performed and might have decreased the risk of stroke recurrence. Another possible cause of the low event rate was the short observation period. A different study with similar design but completing 3‐year follow‐up for all subjects reported recurrent strokes in 17.6% and 12.5% in patients with and without AF, respectively. Lower rate of recurrent stroke and higher rate of OAC initiation in patients receiving ILR compared with those receiving conventional cardiac rhythm monitoring have previously been reported in a single‐center study and 2 meta‐analyses. One should note that > 20% of the present patients were taking OAC at baseline, mainly because most patients were enrolled before the publication of the results from NAVIGATE ESUS (New Approach Rivaroxaban Inhibition of Factor Xa in a Global Trial Versus ASA to Prevent Embolism in Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) and RE‐SPECT ESUS that did not show the superiority of direct OACs to aspirin for secondary prevention of ESUS.

The benefit of OAC in reducing stroke recurrence in patients with AF detected after stroke by ILR is unproven. In the recent ARTESIA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients with Device‐Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation) and Non‐vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes trials including different cohorts with device‐detected subclinical AF (mainly patients who were stroke‐naïve), apixaban resulted in a lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism than aspirin, but edoxaban did not reduce the risk of composite events, including stroke, as compared with placebo or aspirin. The combined analysis of these 2 trials showed a consistent reduction of ischemic stroke with direct OACs versus control (relative risk, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50–0.92]) and an increase in major bleeding (relative risk, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.05–2.5]).

### Secondary stroke prevention in people with atrial fibrillation: treatments and trials [^34b4a54f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias and is a major cause of ischaemic stroke. Recent findings indicate the importance of atrial fibrillation burden (device-detected, subclinical, or paroxysmal and persistent or permanent) and whether atrial fibrillation was known before stroke onset or diagnosed after stroke for the risk of recurrence. Secondary prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and stroke aims to reduce the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke. Findings from randomised controlled trials assessing the optimal timing to introduce direct oral anticoagulant therapy after a stroke show that early start (ie, within 48 h for minor to moderate strokes and within 4–5 days for large strokes) seems safe and could reduce the risk of early recurrence. Other promising developments regarding early rhythm control, left atrial appendage occlusion, and novel factor XI inhibitor oral anticoagulants suggest that these therapies have the potential to further reduce the risk of stroke. Secondary prevention strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a stroke despite oral anticoagulation therapy is an unmet medical need. Research advances suggest a heterogeneous spectrum of causes, and ongoing trials are investigating new approaches for secondary prevention in this vulnerable patient group. In patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, the latest data from randomised controlled trials on stroke prevention shows that oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke but more data are needed to define the safety profile.

### Device-detected atrial fibrillation: what to do with asymptomatic patients? [^2c728d13]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia and conveys an increased risk of stroke, regardless of whether it is symptomatic. Despite multiple studies supporting an association between subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices and increased risk of thromboembolic events, clinical intervention for device-detected AT remains sluggish, with some clinicians delaying treatment and instead opting for continued surveillance for additional or longer episodes. However, the 2014 updated clinical practice guidelines on AF recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk score for nonvalvular AF, with oral anticoagulation recommended for scores ≥ 2, regardless of whether AF is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. This paper reviews the epidemiology of AF and mechanisms of stroke in AF, and discusses device-detected AF and its clinical implications.

Oral anticoagulant–related major bleeding and reversal agents — incidence, supportive care, and agent performance are summarized as follows: about 2% to 4% of patients who receive oral anticoagulants (OACs) experience major bleeding; activated charcoal may be administered up to 6 to 8 hours after the last dose; emergency department visits for OAC bleeding due to direct oral anticoagulants increased from 2.3% in 2011 to 37.9% in 2017; failure to achieve effective hemostasis is associated with a > 3 times higher risk of death; idarucizumab for dabigatran-induced major bleeding and andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban associated major bleeding are FDA approved; in RE-VERSE AD, idarucizumab achieved reversal in 100% of patients with 67.7% bleeding cessation and thrombosis events 4.7% within 30 days, and a post hoc gastrointestinal bleeding analysis found 97.5% complete reversal with 76.2% bleeding cessation; for dabigatran-associated bleeding, activated PCC evidence includes a 14-patient cohort with 9 patients (64%) rated good, 5 (36%) moderate, and no thromboembolic events, plus a randomized crossover trial in 12 healthy subjects showing 4-factor PCC completely reversed rivaroxaban by prothrombin time but did not reverse dabigatran by aPTT, ecarin clotting time, or thrombin time; ANNEXA 4 evaluated andexanet alfa in adults with acute major bleeding (safety population, n = 254; efficacy population, n = 254) receiving factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban 55%, rivaroxaban 36%, edoxaban 3%, enoxaparin 6%), with median anti–factor Xa activity decreased by 89%, clinical hemostasis excellent or good in 37 of 47 patients (79% [95% CI, 64%-89%]) at 12 hours, and thrombotic events in 12 of 67 patients (18%) during 30-day follow-up; currently, andexanet alfa is FDA-approved for only apixaban- or rivaroxaban–associated life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, and a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies compared andexanet alfa (n = 438) with PCC (n = 1278) in patients with acute bleeding associated with oral factor Xa inhibitors.

### Anticoagulation in patients with device-detected atrial fibrillation with and without a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack: the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial [^1d6a3a10]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Oral anticoagulation reduces the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with ECG‐documented atrial fibrillation (AF). Anticoagulation is particularly effective in patients with AF and a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)due to the high risk of recurrent stroke in these patients. In patients with a prior stroke without ECG‐documented AF, including those with embolic stroke of unknown source, and patients with atrial cardiomyopathy, oral anticoagulants mainly increase bleeding with only a weak effect on ischemic stroke. Detection of AF to guide initiation of oral anticoagulation has, therefore, been a priority in patients with a prior stroke or TIA. Two randomized outcome trials, NOAH‐AFNET 6 (Non‐Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes) and Apixaban for stroke prevention in subclinical atrial fibrillation (ARTESIA), recently reported low rates of ischemic stroke in patients with device‐detected AF (DDAF) (stroke rate 1.1%–1.2% per year without anticoagulation). Due to the low stroke rate, the effect of anticoagulation on stroke using edoxaban (NOAH‐AFNET 6) or apixaban (ARTESIA) was small; overall, anticoagulation prevented approximately 0.3 strokes per 100 patient‐years and induced 0.7 to 1.6 major bleeding events per 100 patient‐years. Screening for DDAF using implanted long‐term ECG monitors and subsequent initiation of oral anticoagulation in the Implantable loop recorder detection of atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke (Loop) study did not significantly reduce the rate of stroke, but there was a signal that detection of DDAF and subsequent initiation of anticoagulation could be effective in patients with a prior stroke. Given these results, this prespecified subanalysis of the NOAH‐AFNET 6 trial assessed the effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulation in patients with DDAF and a prior stroke or TIA.

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^9cc1b187]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The most important measure in our results is the QALY difference, which at the 10-year point of the simulation corresponded approximately to 1 quality-adjusted week of life in favor of anticoagulation. Similarly, anticoagulation was associated with a marginal reduction in mortality, translating on average to only 9 days of life per patient over 10 years. Initiating anticoagulation in the subclinical phase of AF led to a 22% decrease in ischemic strokes and a 37% increase in major bleeding, including a 20% increase in intracranial bleeding. These estimates provide a clear view of the potential benefits and harms of anticoagulation, reflecting a relatively balanced net outcome. Moreover, the small potential gains, measured in life-years and QALYs, are considerably easier to communicate to patients than the metrics provided by previous studies.

In sensitivity analyses accounting for parameter uncertainty, the results were materially similar to those of the main analysis. Anticoagulation appeared beneficial when the model used the risk estimates from the ARTESiA trial, but slightly harmful when the risk estimates from the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial were applied. These results are concordant with the main results of these 2 trials and underscore the marginal effect size and uncertainty in the net benefit of anticoagulation. In the exploratory analyses across different CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score categories, NOAC therapy was associated with a larger increase in QALYs for patients with a score greater than 4, corresponding to approximately 1 quality-adjusted month per patient. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution, as, in fact, none of the multiple interactions tested between treatment effects and risk categories in the ARTESiA and NOAH substudies reached statistical significance. When the initial stroke, bleeding, and mortality rates were raised to a level that better reflects data from observational studies, the QALY increase with NOACs was consistent with the main analysis, approximately 1 week per patient. Indeed, despite substantial changes in model parameters, the magnitude of the QALY difference remained small, ranging approximately from a decrease of 1 week to an increase of 1 month over 10 years. Importantly, when the 95% CIs of the treatment effects were considered in the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, there was only a 66% certainty that anticoagulation was associated with a positive net effect, with a mean effect size of 1 week. Overall, these results suggest that the question of whether or not to start NOACs for a patient with subclinical AF may actually have very limited clinical significance. It is also worth noting that the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 34% possibility that the treatment could be harmful to the patient.

### Practical considerations for using novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^d6e5fbbb]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, represent new options for preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, as shown by the results from large, randomized phase III trials. Because of their greater specificity, rapid onset of action, and predictable pharmacokinetics, the novel oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) address several limitations of warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists in day-to-day clinical practice. However, a range of practical questions relating to the novel oral anticoagulants has emerged, including topics such as patient selection, treatment of patients with renal impairment, risk of myocardial infarction, drug interactions, switching between anticoagulants, and management of bleeding, in addition to use of these agents in patients requiring antiplatelet drug treatment or undergoing cardioversion or percutaneous interventions (eg, ablation). In this review, practical aspects of the use of novel oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation are discussed, with reference to available data and guidance from prescribing information.

### Assessment and management of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [^d804190c]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac dysrhythmia encountered in practice. It is currently estimated that AF affects approximately 2% of the general population; however, the true prevalence of AF is likely to be at least 3%-4%when asymptomatic AF is considered. For clinically apparent AF, the investigations and management are relatively well established. The identification of minimally symptomatic patients is challenging, and furthermore, the optimal management is less certain. Although there is some debate about the ideal treatment pathway for asymptomatic AF, in most cases, the investigations and comprehensive management follow the same recommendations as clinically apparent AF. In contrast, beyond risk factor optimisation, the ideal management of subclinical or device-detected AF remains undefined. The purpose of the current review is to discuss the assessment and management of asymptomatic AF.

### Net benefit of anticoagulation in subclinical device-detected atrial fibrillation [^e17c8d0b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The role of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with device-detected atrial high-rate episodes, also known as subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF), is a subject of equipoise.

Objective

To assess the net benefit of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with device-detected subclinical AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Decision analytical model run with 10 000 patients with anticoagulation and 10 000 patients without anticoagulation in a clinical scenario of deciding whether to start NOACs for stroke prevention in patients with subclinical AF. A Markov decision model was conducted on October 1, 2024, to estimate net outcomes of NOACs. The patients had stroke risk and bleeding risks similar to those of patients in randomized trials of anticoagulation in subclinical AF.

Exposure

Anticoagulation was modeled to decrease the risk of ischemic stroke by 32% and increase the risk of major bleeding by 62%. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the 95% CIs for treatment effect sizes were also considered.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measure for overall net benefit was the cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) during the simulation. The model considered the number and severity of ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, other intracranial bleeds, and extracranial bleeds, as well as the number of deaths during a 10-year simulation.

Results

When comparing the 2 cohorts of 10 000 patients (mean age, 77 years; 3700 [37%] women), those receiving NOAC therapy had 233 fewer ischemic strokes (21.7%), 55 fewer deaths (1.1%), and 453 more major bleeding events (37.3%) over a 10-year simulation period. Per patient, these differences translated to approximately 1 additional quality-adjusted week of life (0.024 QALYs) with NOAC treatment during the 10-year simulation. When the 95% CIs of treatment effect sizes were considered in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 65.8% probability that NOAC treatment leads to more QALYs than withholding treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this analytical model study, initiating NOACs in patients with device-detected subclinical AF was associated with a minimal increase in QALYs. However, the benefits were uncertain, and the effect size of the overall net benefit does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

### Pivotal trials testing the efficacy of novel anticoagulants for preventing emerging cardioembolic risk entities [^5cdd58da]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, results from the third ESUS trial were published. The ATTICUS (Apixaban for Treatment of Embolic Stroke of Undetermined Source) trial is different in design, end point, and sample size to the 2 former studies (Table). It included patients with ESUS with at least 1 predictive factor for AF (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 4, left atrium size > 45 mm, spontaneous echo contrast or flow velocity of ≤ 0.2 m/s in the left atrial appendage, atrial runs of < 30 seconds) or a patent foramen ovale. The trial was halted for futility after a planned interim analysis, resulting in 352 (of the targeted 500) patients randomized 1:1 to standard dose apixaban or aspirin 100 mg OD. Nearly all patients received an implantable loop recorder. If any episode of clinical AF or subclinical AF lasting > 2 minutes was detected, patients on aspirin were switched to apixaban. The primary end point — at least 1 new magnetic resonance imaging‐detected ischemic brain lesion — was not different (13.6% using apixaban versus 16.0% using aspirin) during 1 year of follow‐up. Recurrent ischemic stroke (5.7% versus 5.9%) or major bleeding (0.6% versus 0.6%) rates were similar. Notably, 26% of all study patients and > 40% of those aged ≥ 75 years were switched to apixaban following AF detection, minimizing power to show a difference between study arms. As similarly shown in RESPECT‐ESUS, there was a trend toward a benefit of apixaban in patients aged ≥ 75 years, which needs confirmation in a future RCT. Taken together, aspirin but not oral anticoagulation is indicated for long‐term stroke prevention in patients with ESUS.

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation-is it worth the effort? [^040174b6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes (mSToPS)

To determine the effect of a self‐applied wearable ECG patch for screening of AF, the mSToPS clinical trial used a siteless study design and recruited participants via email and regular mail from a large health insurance plan's members in the United States [75]. The study included individuals older than 75 years, or males aged above 55 years and females aged above 65 years with specified co‐morbidities. The participants were intended to make two separate 2‐week recordings using an ECG patch with 3 months between recordings. Participants were also randomized to immediate (within 2 weeks) or delayed (4 months later) screening. There were no physical visits within this trial; all communication, including participants' consent and instructions, was digital except for a share of the invitations which were sent by regular mail. Notably, only 4.3% of the eligible invitees who were sent an email (n = 52 553) and only 0.76% of the 50 000 invited by regular mail invitation were enrolled. In the immediate screening group, 3.9% were identified with new AF as compared to 0.9% in the delayed group. Monitored individuals had higher rates of AF diagnosis, greater initiation of OAC treatment and increased healthcare consumption at one year. This important study shed light on several important aspects of AF screening, such as the possibility to use siteless and digital enrolment of participants using the patch ECG device. However, it also revealed the very limited response rate to invitations which led to optimization of the recruitment process [51].

ARTESiA

Another study focusing on silent episodes of AF recorded in implanted devices is the multinational, multicentre ARTESiA trial [65]. This trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial recruiting patients with an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator or cardiac monitor. Participants with subclinical episodes of AF < 24 h and stroke risk factors are eligible and randomized 1:1 to treatment with apixaban or aspirin, and the primary outcome is a composite of stroke and systemic embolism. The study will include approximately 4000 participants and address the important knowledge gap if short, often asymptomatic episodes of AF recorded in cardiac implanted devices will have a net benefit from OAC treatment. This trial is projected to complete inclusion in 2020.

Atrial fibrillation — timing of anticoagulant interruption before invasive procedures (Table 18): Apixaban is held 1 d before low bleeding risk procedures and 2 d before high bleeding risk procedures. Dabigatran with creatinine clearance (CrCl) > 50 mL/min is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk, and with CrCl 30–50 mL/min is held 2 d for low risk and 4 d for high risk. Edoxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. Rivaroxaban is held 1 d for low risk and 2 d for high risk. For warfarin, hold 5 d or for a target INR < 1.5; an alternative is 2–3 d for a target INR < 2. For patients with CrCl lower than the table values, the footnote states to consider holding for an additional 1 to 3 days, and it clarifies that the number of days refers to full days before surgery and the drug is also not taken the day of surgery.

### Anticoagulation in device-detected atrial fibrillation with or without vascular disease: a combined analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials [^74a6a354]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Device-detected atrial fibrillation (DDAF) is found in 20%–30% of older adults with cardiovascular disease, often in patients without electrocardiogram (ECG)-documented atrial fibrillation (AF). Device-detected atrial fibrillation refers to episodic atrial arrhythmias that resemble AF but are typically short and rare. Expert consensus and analogies between DDAF and ECG-documented AF led clinicians to prescribe anticoagulation to patients with DDAF. Two recent trials compared anticoagulation with no anticoagulation in patients with DDAF and stroke risk factors, but without ECG-documented AF. The NOAH-AFNET 6 (Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Atrial High Rate Episodes) trial randomized patients with DDAF lasting 6 min or longer to anticoagulation with edoxaban or no anticoagulation. Patients with vascular disease and an indication for acetylsalicylic acid randomized to no anticoagulation received aspirin 100 mg once daily with the study medication; the others received placebo (double dummy design). The trial was stopped prematurely due to an expected increase in bleeding combined with a trend towards futility for efficacy. The ARTESiA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo-Embolism in Patients with Device Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation) trial randomized patients with DDAF lasting 6 min to 23:59 h to anticoagulation with apixaban or aspirin 81 mg once dailyand found a small stroke risk-reducing effect of anticoagulation compared with aspirin. Both trials consistently found a low rate of stroke without anticoagulation (1.1%–1.2% per patient-years), the expected increase in bleeding with anticoagulation, and a small further reduction in stroke with anticoagulation.

Many patients with DDAF (56% in NOAH-AFNET 6, 46% in ARTESiA) have concomitant vascular disease that creates an indication for antiplatelet therapy, usually aspirin, to prevent thromboembolic events including ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and systemic arterial embolism (SE). Aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding compared with no therapy. This may alter the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy. We therefore performed subgroup analyses of NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA in patients with and without vascular disease.

### Spotlight on neurocardiology: an emerging field gaining traction among neurologists and cardiologists [^27e8fabc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

AF and Stroke

With the aging of the global population, AF has become one of the leading causes of stroke. As such, substantial efforts have been made in recent years to improve AF detection both before and after stroke occurrence. Hannemann et al evaluated a cohort of 280 patients with ischemic stroke from the FIND‐AF (Future Innovations in Novel Detection for Atrial Fibrillation) trial and found that elevated blood concentrations of symmetric dimethylarginine, a metabolite of‐arginine, was associated with increased AF detection on Holter monitoring. Symmetric dimethylarginine was also increased after rapid pacing in cultured human cardiomyocytes in this study, suggesting that it may be a specific marker of cardiac tachyarrhythmia. These findings indicate that symmetric dimethylarginine could be used as a biomarker to identify patients presenting with stroke who are more likely to be diagnosed with AF via prolonged cardiac monitoring.

Two important clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus antiplatelet therapy or placebo in patients with subclinical AF detected on cardiac implantable devices were published in 2023, NOAH‐AFNET 6 (Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High Rate Episodes)and ARTESIA (Apixaban for the Reduction of Thrombo‐Embolism in Patients With Device‐Detected Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation).NOAH‐AFNET 6 was stopped prematurely due to increased major bleeding in the edoxaban arm. No differences were observed with respect to the primary composite efficacy end point of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism. ARTESIA showed a 37% lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism (primary efficacy end point) with apixaban compared with aspirin, at the expense of 80% increased major bleeding. In this Neurocardiology Spotlight, Diener et al present a prespecified subanalysis of NOAH‐AFNET 6 in patients with device‐detected AF and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), but no AF detected on 12‐lead ECG. This subanalysis did not find any treatment interaction with prior stroke or TIA for any of the primary or secondary outcomes. In the accompanying editorial, Siegler and Brorson suggest that a personalized approach is recommended when deciding anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF with and without previous stroke or TIA.

Subclinical and device-detected AF definitions — 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline: Subclinical AF refers to this arrhythmia identified in individuals who do not have symptoms attributable to AF and in whom there are no previous ECGs documenting AF, including AF identified by implanted devices or wearable monitors. Atrial high-rate episodes are defined as atrial events exceeding the programmed detection rate limit set by the device and, though recorded by implanted devices, require visual inspection to confirm AF and exclude other atrial arrhythmias, artifact or oversensing. AF burden encompasses both frequency and duration and refers to the amount of AF that an individual has, and for this guideline is defined as the duration of an episode or as a percentage of AF duration during the monitoring period depending on how it was defined in the individual studies.

### Prevention of stroke in patients with silent cerebrovascular disease: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^38eba906]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association — management for patients with silent cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF): Proceed with oral anticoagulation when otherwise indicated for NVAF despite microbleeds, and it is therefore reasonable not to perform routine MRI screening of patients with NVAF. The lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage with NOAC anticoagulation suggests potential usefulness in patients at increased ICH risk; we suggest that, for patients with NVAF in whom anticoagulation is indicated but who are considered at particularly high risk of future ICH on the basis of microbleed number and location, it may be reasonable to administer dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban in preference to warfarin. Another alternative to warfarin anticoagulation that might be considered is percutaneous closure of the left atrial appendage. For general measures, these guidelines for patients with ICH include blood pressure control and no restriction on the use of statins, and it is reasonable to avoid antiplatelet agents when there is no specific cardiovascular or cerebrovascular indication but otherwise to use them according to currently recommended indications. We suggest that it may be reasonable to follow AHA/ASA guidelines for primary stroke prevention in individuals with microbleeds, and we suggest that the presence of microbleeds alone, in isolation of other findings and patient characteristics, does not warrant the initiation of antiplatelet medications or statin therapy for preventing stroke.

Figure 1.
Net clinical benefit of warfarin and new oral anticoagulants dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban by CHA₂DS₂-VASc and HAS‐BLED scores. A, HAS‐BLED ≤ 2. B, HAS‐BLED ≤ 3. For HAS‐BLED ≥ 3, there were no data with CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASC score = 0. D110, dabigatran 110 mg (twice‐daily; BID); D150, dabigatran 150 mg BID. Modeling was based on recent clinical trial outcome data for the new oral anticoagulants and "real‐world" data from the Danish National Patient Registry, collected from patients with nonvalvular AF between 1997 and 2008 to predict the net clinical benefit of new oral anticoagulants, compared to warfarin. Reproduced with permission from Banerjee et al. AF indicates atrial fibrillation.

Registry findings, such as those from Denmark and Sweden (Table 1), have helped develop and refine risk‐scoring systems for stroke and bleeding in AF patient cohorts. Scoring systems such as CHADS₂ and CHA₂DS₂-VASc have changed the approach to risk stratification of AF patients and guide judicious use of OAC in patients at greatest risk. – Registry data have been crucial in deriving risk stratification schemes and validating the utility in clinical practice. – Both the CHADS 2 and CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores were found, by examination of registry data, to underestimate the risk of thromboembolism associated with previous ischemic events. Another scoring system, developed from the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) Study, identified risk stratification schemes for bleeding and thromboembolism to develop a simple method for quantifying the risk of warfarin‐associated hemorrhage based on 5 clinical variables with performance comparable to the CHADS 2 index.

### Role of new drugs for management of atrial fibrillation [^63993035]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of newer agents in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Data Sources

EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched (up to June 2012) combining medication names with atrial fibrillation, humans, clinical trials, and pharmacoeconomic. References of the articles identified and www.clinicaltrials.gov were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were limited to the English language with clinical or pharmacoeconomic end points followed by the consensus of 3 authors.

Data Synthesis

Formulated to reduce some of the adverse effects associated with amiodarone by removing the iodine component, dronedarone has improved clinical outcomes over placebo when used in paroxysmal or persistent AF; however, it is less efficacious than amiodarone. Worse outcomes with dronedarone have been seen in patients with heart failure or permanent AF. It has not been compared to antiarrhythmic agents other than amiodarone, and pharmacoeconomic evaluations are lacking. Dabigatran 150 mg is superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and has been associated with lower rates of vascular-associated mortality. Although the rates of major bleeding were not significantly different between the 2 agents, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial infarction occurred more frequently with dabigatran. Dabigatran appears to have the most pharmacoeconomic benefit over warfarin in patients with a higher risk of stroke. Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, with no difference in the rates of major bleeding. Cost-effectiveness studies have not been performed with this agent at this time. In patients with AF who were not suitable candidates for warfarin, apixaban is superior to aspirin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism without increasing the risk for major bleeding. Additionally, apixaban is superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, results in fewer bleeding events, and is associated with lower mortality. Apixaban is not cost-effective against aspirin when used for a short duration but gains superiority with prolonged use or in patients with higher risks of stroke. Additionally, apixaban appears to offer a pharmacoeconomic advantage over warfarin at no to minimal cost. Each new anticoagulant lacks a reversal agent and an assay to detect the presence of the anticoagulant, as well as long-term data when used in the clinical setting.

Conclusions

Use of dronedarone should be limited to patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and should not be used in patients with heart failure or with permanent AF. Newer antithrombotic agents appear to be promising alternatives for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF; however, more data are needed to understand their role.

### Management of atrial fibrillation: translating clinical trial data into clinical practice [^b9c82eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia with significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality. In light of the limitations of available pharmacologic treatment options (suboptimal efficacy plus safety and tolerability issues), atrial fibrillation management should be individualized based on patient characteristics and comorbidities that could influence response to specific management approaches. The importance of adequate anticoagulation should not be overlooked. This review provides a practical guide for primary care physicians, internists, and cardiologists on current management strategies for atrial fibrillation, based on recent guidelines and current clinical data.

Unresolved Questions

Additional important questions remain to be answered. In a position paper summarizing the existing evidence, An de Vriese and Gunnar Heine suggest that patients on dialysis with atrial fibrillation may have a lower attributable risk for ischemic stroke than the general population. This could be explained either by a high prevalence of subclinical atrial fibrillation in the "no atrial fibrillation" arm in observational studies or by the fact that in these patients, many episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may occur during hemodialysis while receiving parenteral anticoagulation.

Optimal discrimination between individuals who will have an event or not is another major issue. The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score may overestimate the risk of stroke and cut-off values currently used might explain, at least in part, poor model performance. Therefore, there is an unmet need for development of a dialysis-specific predictive model to accurately identify patients at high risk of stroke.

Another important consideration is whether anticoagulation can really prevent the occurrence of new strokes in patients on maintenance dialysis with atrial fibrillation. The pathophysiology of stroke seems to be different in this population. It has been shown that the relative incidence of hemorrhagic stroke increases as the kidney function declines. Taking this observation into consideration, as well as the failure of VKAs to reduce the incidence of new strokes as mentioned above, it seems reasonable that novel agents, such as DOACs, should be compared with no anticoagulation instead of standard VKA treatment in patients with ESKD. There is only one retrospective observational study comparing apixaban with no treatment in this population. Mavrakanas et al. used the US Renal Data System to create a propensity score-matched cohort including 2,082 patients (521 on apixaban and 1,561 without any anticoagulant prescription). The incidence of the composite outcome of new ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic thromboembolism was similar in the apixaban and the no treatment group (HR 1.24; 95% CI: 0.69–2.23). However, the incidence of fatal or intracranial bleeding events was significantly higher in the apixaban group (HR 2.74; 95% CI: 1.37–5.47). This result was driven by a significantly higher incidence of fatal or intracranial bleeding in patients treated with the standard apixaban dose (5 mg twice daily). The risk of bleeding seems to be even higher in patients who were also treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor without any benefit on the risk of stroke.

Device-detected atrial fibrillation (AF) and anticoagulation — evidence synthesis indicates the NOAH-AFNET 6 study demonstrated no benefit of edoxaban vs placebo on a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiac death, whereas ARTESIA, a study of device-detected AF between 6 minutes and 24 hours, reported lower stroke or systemic embolism rates with apixaban (0.78% vs 1.24% per patient-year; P = 0.007). A meta-analysis of both trials indicated stroke and systemic embolism were consistently reduced by anticoagulation (relative risk [RR]: 0.68; CI: 0.50–0.92), although slightly higher bleeding rates were seen in the anticoagulation arms.

### Comparative effectiveness of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and warfarin in the management of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^8872b336]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Alternative anticoagulants to warfarin (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) are becoming available for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF), but there is a lack of information on their comparative effectiveness. Using a discrete event simulation method adopting a lifetime horizon of analysis, we made an indirect comparison of the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, and ARISTOTLE trial results for AF patients in the US population. Over a lifetime, apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban accrued 0.130 (95% central range (CR) -0.030 to 0.264), 0.106 (95% CR -0.048 to 0.248), and 0.095 (95% CR -0.052 to 0.242) more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively, than warfarin, with apixaban having a 55% probability of accruing the highest total QALYs. In the absence of a definitive trial, and acknowledging the limitations of an indirect comparison, the available evidence suggests apixaban to be the most effective anticoagulant.

### Long-term detection of subclinical atrial fibrillation in cryptogenic stroke patients with insertable cardiac monitors [^d5ea3d33]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The main finding of our multicenter real‐world project — including nearly 800 patients with CS and ICM — was the constantly increasing SCAF detection even 2 years after the index stroke, with a 37% rate over a 4‐year follow‐up. SCAF detection almost invariably led to the initiation of OAC. We also found that a CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score ≥ 5, anterior circulation stroke, and a cortical infarct location, as well as age > 71 years, were associated with an increased risk of SCAF.

These findings might have important implications for the care of patients with CS, because AF may remain undetected for a long time, delaying initiation of anticoagulant or other therapies and increasing the risk of stroke recurrence.

Even though the efficacy of anticoagulation in CS patients with SCAF remains to be definitely proven, data on its potential beneficial effects are accumulating. Tsivgoulis et al. in their meta‐analysis, demonstrated that the 2.1‐fold higher OAC initiation rate — secondary to a 2.5‐fold higher SCAF detection rate with prolonged cardiac monitoring — led to a 55% reduction of stroke recurrence compared to traditional monitoring and that the diagnostic yield with ICM was higher than Holter ECG and ECM. These findings were confirmed by a recent prospective non‐randomized single‐site study that reported a SCAF detection rate of 21.1% over 24 months after implantation in 123 CS patients. Moreover, a recent subgroup analysis of the ARTESiA trial showed that apixaban in people with SCAF and a history of stroke or TIA leads to a 7% absolute risk reduction in stroke or systemic embolism over 3.5 years, with an absolute increase in major bleeding of 3%. Therefore, ICMs increase the detection rate of SCAF, lead to higher OAC initiation rates, and appear to lower stroke recurrences.

### Thromboembolic risk and oral anticoagulation in subclinical atrial fibrillation [^84c8903c]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Availability of devices capable of continuous rhythm monitoring such as smartwatches, implantable loop recorders, or pacemakers/defibrillators is continuously increasing. Importantly, device detected "subclinical" atrial fibrillation seems to convey a significantly lower risk of thromboembolism than "clinical" atrial fibrillation verified by a conventional ECG recording. While current guidelines indicate a possible role of oral anticoagulation in selected high-risk patients with subclinical AF, recent trials show an ambiguous risk/benefit relationship of anticoagulation in this setting. The present review therefore summarizes current data on the role of oral anticoagulation in subclinical AF, aims at aiding in the decision process of anticoagulation, and illustrates current gaps in evidence regarding subclinical AF.

### Pivotal trials testing the efficacy of novel anticoagulants for preventing emerging cardioembolic risk entities [^a175a69d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation in Patients With Atrial High‐Rate Episodes/Subclinical

Implantable devices (pacemakers, defibrillator, cardiac monitors) allow continuous ECG monitoring. They ensure the detection of even short episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or pauses. Atrial high‐rate episodes (AHRE) are defined as any atrial tachycardia with a frequency of 175 bpm or higher in patients in whom clinical AF is not previously detected. There is a large overlap with the term subclinical AF, which includes AHRE confirmed to be AF, atrial flutter, or AF episodes detected by insertable cardiac monitors or wearable monitors and confirmed by visually reviewed intracardiac electrograms or ECG‐recorded rhythm. As patients with subclinical AF had a 2.5‐fold increased risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism in the ASSERT (Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Patients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pacing Trial) study, present European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend that "the use of oral anticoagulation may be considered in selected patients with AHRE/subclinical AF (lasting ≥ 24 hours) and an estimated high individual risk of stroke". Notably, the relationship of AHRE and stroke is temporally rather low.

### Anesthesiologists guide to the 2019 AHA / ACC / HRS focused update for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^61fd4200]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Perioperative physicians should be well versed in atrial fibrillation (AF) management because it is the most common sustained arrythmia in the United States. In this narrative review of the 2019 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiologists/Heart Rhythm Society Focused Update on Atrial Fibrillation, the authors detail the emergence of new evidence from completed studies that may affect the management of patients with AF presenting for surgery. Updates regarding non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) comprise the bulk of the update with newer evidence emerging regarding their equivalence and/or superiority compared to Coumadin. Apixaban is now the preferred drug of choice for first line stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF over Coumadin. Renal dysfunction and the management of patients with AF on hemodialysis is examined; in patients on hemodialysis with AF, the focused update recommends administration of either warfarin or dose-reduced apixaban. Evidence from new trials addressing the appropriate bridging of NOACs before surgery is discussed. Patients with nonvalvular AF may not exhibit an added benefit from bridging of anticoagulation, and perioperative physicians should balance the risks of stroke and major bleeding before surgery. Advances in nonpharmacologic treatment and management of AF are outlined, including left atrial appendage occlusion devices, catheter ablations, and electrical cardioversion. Anesthesiologists' understanding of these 2019 updated guidelines will allow for more adept optimization of patients with AF presenting for surgery.

### Physician and patient preferences for oral anticoagulation therapy decision making in atrial fibrillation: results from a national best-worst scaling survey in Türkiye [^3804d5a7]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With a prevalence of 1%–3% in the general population, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent cardiac dysrhythmia and one of the most common causes of ischemic stroke. In particular, the risk of ischemic strokes is up to fivefold higher in AF patients than in the general population which results in significant clinical and economic burden. The Copenhagen Stroke Study revealed that AF was associated with a 70% increase in mortality, a 40% decrease in discharge rate, a 20% increase in the length of hospital stay, and a marked increase in impairment and disability among survivors. Moreover, subclinical atrial tachyarrhythmias were independently associated with a substantial increase in the risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism.

Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is the cornerstone of the management of patients with atrial fibrillation. "Avoid stroke/anticoagulation" is the "A" of the Atrial Fibrillation Better Care (ABC) pathway which is recommended and encouraged in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. OAC therapies including vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, and non‐VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), significantly reduce the risk of stroke (by at least 64%) and death (by at least 26%) compared with control or placebo. Structured, clinical, risk‐score−based assessment of individual thrombo‐embolic risk, using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score, should be performed as the first step in optimal thrombo‐embolic risk management in AF patients. Patients with AF and risk factors for stroke need to be treated with OAC and, if patients are eligible, NOACs should be preferred over VKAs.

Cost-effectiveness of device-based screening for silent atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke — Modeling studies indicate that 7-days outpatient cardiac monitoring could detect atrial fibrillation (AF) at 5.9% vs. 1.45% with standard care and was reported as cost-effective with a cost-utility ratio of ~ $130 000 per QALY gained. In a Sweden decision model, intermittent handheld ECG screening (6% detection of AF) outperformed 24 h Holter monitoring (0.8% detection of AF) and yielded a gain of 29 life-years or 23 QALYs with cost saving of €55400 after 7 years, assuming that 88% of detected AF patients received lifetime oral anticoagulation (OAC). A UK National Health Service analysis based on CRYSTAL-AF yields found implantable cardiac monitors (ICM) detecting AF in 8.9%, 12.4% and 30% at 6, 12 and 36 months, with cost per QALY estimated at £17 175 using non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and £13 295 using warfarin, supporting ICM as a cost-effective diagnostic tool to prevent recurrent stroke in cryptogenic stroke patients.

Europace (2017). Medium credibility.

TRENDS and ASSERT cohorts — definitions and detection rates of subclinical AF detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices are described: in TRENDS, newly detected AF defined as an atrial high rate episode (AHRE) lasting at least 5 min occurred in 45 of 163 patients (28%) over a mean follow-up of 1.1 years after excluding those with a documented history of AF, warfarin use, or antiarrhythmic drug use; in ASSERT, subclinical AF defined as lasting at least 6 min was detected at least once in 35% of patients over a mean follow-up of 2.5 years.
