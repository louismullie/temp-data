## Question

Cough reflex pathway

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cough reflex pathway. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the afferent sensory limb and which vagal afferents are most critical. Then, I should verify the central processing hubs in the brainstem and higher brain. Next, I will examine the efferent motor output and the mechanical phases of cough. After that, I need to consider modulatory inputs and the concept of cough hypersensitivity. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and highlight key gaps and controversies, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the afferent limb. The primary sensory neurons are bronchopulmonary vagal afferents arising from the nodose and jugular ganglia, with two functionally distinct subtypes dominating cough: myelinated Aδ-fibers ("cough receptors") that respond to mechanical stimuli and rapid acidification, and unmyelinated C-fibers that are polymodal and respond to chemical irritants such as capsaicin, bradykinin, and ATP; both project centrally to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla, and the most sensitive cough-triggering regions are the larynx, trachea, carina, and large bronchi, with distal airway involvement also documented in some contexts [^77278951] [^4f4d3339] [^a88d8ce2] [^1a662f18].

> Wait, let me verify the central processing steps. Vagal afferents synapse in the NTS, which functions as a relay and integrative hub, not merely a passive waystation; second-order neurons project to a distributed brainstem cough network including the ventrolateral medulla, raphe nuclei, and pons, which coordinates the timing and magnitude of cough motor output; concurrently, ascending projections reach higher brain regions (insula, cingulate, prefrontal cortex) that encode the urge to cough and enable voluntary suppression or facilitation, establishing a dual control system of reflexive brainstem circuits and cortical modulation [^7448c199] [^819aecb9] [^962db618] [^697a3bbd].

> I will now examine the efferent limb and the mechanical phases. The motor pattern generator in the ventral respiratory group drives phrenic and spinal motor neurons to produce the classic three-phase cough: inspiratory, compressive (glottic closure with expiratory muscle contraction), and expulsive (glottic opening with high-velocity airflow); this pattern is tightly coupled to lung volume and expiratory flow requirements, and the same brainstem circuitry that governs breathing is reconfigured to produce cough when needed [^0c9f7214] [^7448c199] [^819aecb9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform sensitivity. I should confirm modulatory inputs that can facilitate or inhibit cough. Pulmonary stretch receptors (SARs/RARs) modulate cough strength and timing via volume-related feedback; upper airway trigeminal afferents can inhibit cough via TRPM8 activation (e.g., menthol), while esophageal acid can sensitize cough reflexes through central mechanisms; hypoxia generally depresses cough, and attentional focus can modulate cough frequency and urge, reflecting cortical influences on brainstem circuits [^dbfd70f8] [^3f04790f] [^c2e7de01] [^d31237e9].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology of cough hypersensitivity. Chronic cough often reflects peripheral sensitization of airway afferents (e.g., TRPV1/TRPA1 upregulation, inflammatory mediator priming) and/or central sensitization with amplified brainstem and cortical responses; clinically, this manifests as hypertussia to low-intensity stimuli and allotussia to innocuous triggers, with neuroimaging evidence of midbrain/periaqueductal gray hyperactivation and impaired inhibitory control, supporting a neuropathic model akin to chronic pain [^1be83309] [^2d1f195b] [^1bf9315a] [^adeb3b51].

> But wait, what if the peripheral architecture itself changes in disease? I need to check that. Evidence in chronic cough suggests increased airway nerve density and remodeling of afferent terminals, though data are mixed and human confirmation remains limited; this potential neuroplasticity, together with inflammatory neuroimmune interactions, likely contributes to persistent hypersensitivity even after peripheral triggers resolve [^01c80dea] [^75de7090] [^8d2e517b].

> I should double-check clinical implications and therapeutic targets. Management of chronic cough increasingly adopts a treatable traits approach targeting peripheral drivers (e.g., P2X3 antagonism with gefapixant, TRP channel modulation, sodium channel blockade) and central sensitization (e.g., gabapentinoids, speech therapy, neuromodulation), with variable response implying patient-specific endotypes; nonpharmacologic cough control therapy addresses laryngeal dysfunction and behavioral reinforcement, aligning with the central modulatory component of cough [^3158405c] [^55c36b60] [^065fefd0] [^80707e59].

> Let me reconsider key gaps and controversies so I don't overstate certainty. The relative contributions of Aδ-fibers versus C-fibers differ between species and experimental models, and human translational validation remains incomplete; central sensitization is plausible and supported by imaging, but causal mechanistic links in humans are still being established; and while P2X3 antagonism is effective in some patients, heterogeneity of cough endotypes likely necessitates personalized, combination strategies rather than a single-target approach [^f4959a0d] [^1bf9315a] [^4f06fd3e] [^065fefd0].

> In summary, I need to ensure the pathway is presented as an integrated loop: afferent vagal sensory neurons detect mechanical and chemical threats and convey signals to the NTS; brainstem cough networks reconfigure respiratory motor output to execute the three-phase cough; higher brain centers modulate sensitivity and enable voluntary control; and chronic cough emerges when peripheral and/or central sensitization lowers thresholds and amplifies responses, explaining the clinical heterogeneity and guiding multimodal therapy [^7448c199] [^1be83309] [^3158405c].

The cough reflex is a **protective brainstem reflex** [^7448c199] triggered by airway irritation, with afferent signals carried by vagal sensory neurons to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) [^697a3bbd], where they are integrated and relayed to the ventral respiratory group (VRG) to coordinate the efferent output to respiratory muscles and glottis, producing the characteristic three-phase cough [^0c9f7214]. Chronic cough reflects **cough hypersensitivity** [^1be83309] with peripheral and central sensitization [^2d1f195b] [^3d495a68], and is managed by treating underlying causes and using neuromodulators or speech therapy to reduce hypersensitivity [^3158405c] [^fc18addb].

---

## Afferent sensory pathways

- **Primary afferent neurons**: Vagal sensory neurons from the nodose and jugular ganglia innervate the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, detecting mechanical and chemical stimuli [^77278951] [^3b12df14].

- **Sensory subtypes**: Myelinated Aδ-fibers ("cough receptors") respond to mechanical stimuli and acid; unmyelinated C-fibers respond to chemical irritants (capsaicin, bradykinin, ATP) [^4f4d3339] [^d693fd7e].

- **Peripheral sensitization**: Inflammation and mediators (PGE2, bradykinin, NGF) increase afferent excitability, contributing to cough hypersensitivity [^2d1f195b] [^75de7090].

---

## Central integration and processing

- **Nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)**: Primary relay for afferent input; integrates sensory information and relays to brainstem respiratory centers [^7448c199] [^697a3bbd].

- **Ventral respiratory group (VRG)**: Generates the cough motor pattern via respiratory muscles and glottic control [^7448c199] [^819aecb9].

- **Higher brain centers**: Cortex and subcortical regions modulate cough via voluntary control and perception of the urge to cough [^962db618] [^7448c199].

---

## Efferent motor pathways

The efferent limb includes **vagal motor neurons** to the larynx and glottis for glottic closure, **phrenic and intercostal motor neurons** to the diaphragm and intercostal muscles for forceful expiration, and **abdominal muscle activation** to generate high expiratory flow [^0c9f7214] [^ac776cc1].

---

## Phases of the cough reflex

| **Phase** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Inspiratory | Deep inhalation to maximize lung volume [^0c9f7214] |
| Compressive | Glottic closure, expiratory muscle contraction, and increased intrathoracic pressure [^ac776cc1] |
| Expulsive | Glottic opening, explosive expiratory flow, and clearance of irritants [^0c9f7214] |

---

## Modulatory influences

- **Peripheral modulation**: RARs, SARs, and C-fibers modulate cough sensitivity and pattern [^cb618f35] [^361aa7bc].

- **Central modulation**: Descending inhibitory pathways and attentional focus can suppress or facilitate cough [^d31237e9] [^962db618].

- **Extrapulmonary inputs**: Esophageal, nasal, and somatic afferents can modulate cough sensitivity [^c2e7de01] [^3fa018ca].

---

## Pathophysiology of chronic cough

Chronic cough reflects **cough hypersensitivity** [^1be83309] with peripheral sensitization (increased afferent excitability) and central sensitization (amplified brainstem and cortical responses) [^3d495a68] [^1bf9315a]. Common causes include upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, GERD, and idiopathic cough [^f6f0cd36] [^2023117c].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Treat underlying causes**: Address asthma, GERD, UACS, and other contributors [^f6f0cd36] [^2023117c].

- **Neuromodulators**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, and P2X3 antagonists (e.g. gefapixant) reduce hypersensitivity [^3158405c] [^55c36b60].

- **Speech therapy**: Cough control therapy targets laryngeal dysfunction and central sensitization [^fc18addb] [^80707e59].

---

The cough reflex is a **coordinated brainstem reflex** with peripheral and central components; chronic cough arises from hypersensitivity and is managed by treating causes and modulating neural pathways [^1be83309] [^3158405c].

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^496c2564]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical perspective—clinical cough is a reflex event beginning with activation of vagal afferent sensory nerves located in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites that project the signal centrally, where it undergoes modulation, resulting in the generation of the appropriate efferent motor response. This concept of distinct afferent sites has provided the rationale for use of the anatomic diagnostic protocol to evaluate and manage patients with cough, and this approach has become embedded in clinical practice, leading to a broad recognition that asthma, GERD, and upper airways disease are, at least in adult patients, the most common causes of chronic cough; adequate treatment of one or more of these causes is effective in the majority, although a significant minority remains troubled with unexplained, refractory chronic cough despite extensive investigation and trials of therapy. The most sensitive regions of the airways for mechanically eliciting cough are the larynx and the tracheal and bronchial bifurcations.

Central regulation of cough—current understanding separates control into three main areas: (1) brainstem processing of afferent information, (2) organization of the brainstem control network, and (3) higher brain (encompassing subcortical and cortical) circuits that support the role of consciousness, perception, and emotion in the expression of cough.

Anatomy and Neurophysiology of Cough—CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report explains that bronchopulmonary C-fibers and a subset of mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive myelinated sensory nerves play essential roles in regulating cough, and these vagal sensory nerves terminate primarily in the larynx, trachea, carina, and large intrapulmonary bronchi; other bronchopulmonary sensory nerves, sensory nerves innervating other viscera, as well as somatosensory nerves innervating the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal musculature regulate cough patterning and cough sensitivity. The brainstem and higher brain control systems that process this sensory information are complex, but our current understanding of them is considerable and increasing, and the relevance of these neural systems to clinical phenomena, such as urge to cough and psychologic methods for treatment of dystussia, is high, with modern imaging methods having revealed potential neural substrates for some features of cough in the human. Cough preserves the gas-exchanging functions of the lung by facilitating clearance of aspirate, inhaled particulate matter, accumulated secretions, and irritants that are either inhaled or formed at sites of mucosal inflammation, and an impaired cough reflex can have acute, dire consequences. Under normal conditions, therefore, cough serves an important protective role in the airways and lungs; however, cough is also a mechanism for the spread of life-threatening respiratory tract infections.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^7448c199]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Central mechanisms regulating cough—airway sensory afferent neurons project to the brainstem with termination predominantly in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS); projections from the NTS can reflexively induce coughing by modulating the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG) in the ventral respiratory group (VRG), whose output via motor neurons (MNs) drives the respiratory muscles needed to elicit the cough motor pattern. A complex higher brain network superimposed on this reflex pathway also receives input from the NTS, gives rise to respiratory sensations and emotions associated with airway irritation, and enables a higher level of motor control over basic reflexive cough pathways; centrally acting antitussive agents likely affect both brainstem and higher brain processes to modify coughing.

### Cough: what's in a name? [^779d22b0]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The cough reflex (CR) and the expiration reflex (ER) are two defensive reflexes from the respiratory tract, the latter mainly from the larynx. Both are elicited by mechanical and chemical irritation of the airway mucosa, and are a characteristic of airway diseases, but they have different functions. The CR first draws air into the lungs, to accentuate the subsequent expulsive phase; the ER consists of a strong expiration, to prevent aspiration of material into the lungs. They have different sensory pathways, central nervous circuits, and physiological and pharmacological modulations. In practice, coughing often consists of a combination of the two reflexes, a cough bout, epoch or attack. Articles on cough usually do not distinguish between the two reflexes, or whether the coughs are single events or epochs; they usually only measure frequency of expiratory efforts, and neglect other aspects. Current methods for measuring and assessing cough are described, with indications of when the use of these methods may be important.

### Translating cough mechanisms into better cough suppressants [^88e108e5]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a significant problem, and in many patients cough remains refractive to both disease-specific therapies and current cough-suppressing medicines, creating a need for improved antitussive therapies. Most patients with chronic cough also display heightened sensitivity so that they experience a persistent sense of the need to cough, and often innocuous stimuli can trigger their coughing. This hypersensitivity underpins the newly described concept of cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS), a term that encapsulates the notion of common underlying mechanisms producing neuronal activation, sensitization and/or dysfunction, which are at the core of excessive coughing. Understanding these mechanisms has been a focus of recent research efforts in the field in the hope that new therapies can be developed to selectively target sensitized unproductive cough while maintaining the reflexive cough essential for airway protection. However, efforts to achieve this have been slower than expected, in part because of some significant challenges and limitations translating current cough models. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the sensory circuits innervating the respiratory system that are important for cough, how cough sensory pathways become hypersensitive, and some of the recently described neural targets under development for treating chronic cough. We present the case that better use of current cough models or the development of new models, or both, is ultimately needed to advance our efforts to translate the discovery of basic cough mechanisms into effective medicines for treating patients with chronic cough.

### Cough and itch: common mechanisms of irritation in the throat and skin [^b9659b4a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough and itch are protective mechanisms in the body. Cough occurs as a reflex motor response to foreign body inhalation, while itch is a sensation that similarly evokes a scratch response to remove irritants from the skin. Both cough and itch can last for sustained periods, leading to debilitating chronic disorders that negatively impact quality of life. Understanding the parallels and differences between chronic cough and chronic itch may be paramount to developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this article, we identify connections in the mechanisms contributing to the complex cough and scratch reflexes and summarize potential shared therapeutic targets. An online search was performed using various search engines, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1983 to 2024. Articles were assessed for quality, and those relevant to the objective were analyzed and summarized. The literature demonstrated similarities in the triggers, peripheral and central nervous system processing, feedback mechanisms, immunologic mediators, and receptors involved in the cough and itch responses, with the neuronal sensitization processes exhibiting the greatest parallels between cough and itch. Given the substantial impact on quality of life, novel therapies targeting similar neuroimmune pathways may apply to both itch and cough and provide new avenues for enhancing their management.

Neurophysiologic substrates of the cough reflex—Coughing is directly evoked by stimulation of a subset of bronchopulmonary C-fibers and a mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive subtype of myelinated airway mechanoreceptors, and their activation may result directly in coughing while coincident activation greatly increases responsiveness to tussive stimuli; cough can also be modulated by other bronchopulmonary vagal afferent nerve subtypes and by afferent nerves in extrapulmonary locations including the upper airways, pharynx, and esophagus.

Cough hypersensitivity and time-based definitions—The notion that the cough reflex may be sensitized is central to clinical cough, and this hypersensitive state may exist transiently with a respiratory viral infection where the accompanying cough is termed “acute” if it diminishes in < 3 weeks; for the majority of patients with cough, cough and associated sensitivity last > 8 weeks, termed “chronic” by definition, and irrespective of mechanism, resolution of this sensitization is critical to the improvement of the cough.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^819aecb9]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Organization of the brainstem control system—a network including the ventrolateral medulla, raphe nuclei, and pons is responsible for controlling the duration of the inspiratory, compressive, and expulsive phases of coughing as well as the magnitude of motor activation of the respiratory muscles, and this network also regulates respiratory muscles to produce breathing. Evidence supports an anatomically distributed, but shared, network for both cough and breathing, with synaptic connections that can explain motor drive to respiratory muscles during both behaviors; the process by which selected populations alter their activities for both behaviors is known as reconfiguration.

### What causes cough in pulmonary fibrosis, and how should we treat it? [^5cef82f8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT CAUSES COUGH IN PULMONARY FIBROSIS?

Cough reflex

Cough is a physiological defensive response to irritations to the airways, and the cough reflex can be diminished or heightened in diseases and lead to pathological cough.

Pulmonary afferent sensory neurones can be categorised by their conduction speeds to myelinated Aδ-fibres and unmyelinated C-fibres. Aδ-fibres include the rapidly adapting receptors (RAR), and in vitro observations suggest that Aδ-fibres respond to mechanical stimulations and hypertonic saline, but not chemical stimuli. C-fibres, on the other hand, are polymodal and are sensitive to both chemical and mechanical stimuli, including capsaicin and bradykinin. Interestingly, Aδ-fibres do not appear to obey the selectivity with stimuli described above in vivo, and appear to respond to chemical stimuli. It is believed that such Aδ-fibre activations are in fact secondary to the effects of C-fibres activation in vivo. Taken together, multiple receptors and sensory afferent neurones are likely responsible for the mechanisms of cough through intricate interactions. These sensory neurons travel via the vagus nerve to the brainstem and stimulate the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and neurokinin which in turn act on neurons within the brainstem which trigger cough via efferent nerves within the vagus, phrenic and spinal nerves. The pivotal role of the vagus nerve in the sensory pathway of cough is highlighted by the fact that cough is abolished by bilateral vagotomy in both animals and humans.

The central cough mechanisms remain largely enigmatic. Recently, functional neuroimaging had yielded novel insight to the central cough neural pathways for urge-related cough (anterior insula and primary sensory cortex) and voluntary suppression of cough (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus).

Peripheral mechanisms of cough—dual-sensory neuron model indicates that extensive studies in animals and humans support the concept that at least two subtypes of primary sensory neurons can induce coughing when stimulated; C-fiber nociceptors have terminals in and around the mucosal surface of the airways and are sensitive to a wide variety of inhaled or locally produced chemical mediators, whereas mechanically sensitive cough receptors are positioned beneath the epithelium in the large airways, appear insensitive to most chemical mediators (with the exception of low pH), and are exquisitely sensitive to punctate stimuli delivered to the mucosal surface.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^361aa7bc]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Central cough pathway interactions—vagal and trigeminal influences on sensitivity and inhibition—are described as follows: convergence of vagal afferents in the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) enables synergistic regulation, and in anesthetized guinea pigs C-fiber activation does not evoke cough but greatly sensitizes cough evoked by activating cough receptors. Comparable central interactions may contribute to enhanced cough responsiveness with allergic inflammation, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway diseases. However, activation of a subset of pulmonary C-fibers has been shown to inhibit coughing in animals with circumstantial evidence in patients, coinciding with pulmonary chemoreflexes and likely depending on inhibitory interactions between respiratory pattern generators and central pattern regulators of cough. Cough may also be inhibited by activation of cold-sensitive/menthol-sensitive trigeminal afferent nerves innervating the upper airways and nose. Hypoxia depresses cough in animal models and increases capsaicin thresholds in humans, while repetitive coughing induces profound hyperventilation and metabolic alkalemia with central arterial CO2 falling well below apneic threshold, yet these low CO2 levels do not depress cough efforts during breathing.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^697a3bbd]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Brainstem processing of afferent information—vagal afferent fibers enter the brainstem via the nTS and synapse on second-order interneurons; the nTS circuit has been proposed to have a relay function to brainstem populations that regulate breathing, and the core cough network is located in the ventrolateral medulla and hypothesized to participate in breathing and rhythm regulation for cough. There are no studies of the response patterns and functional interactions of nTS neurons during cough, but transneuronal tracing with herpes simplex virus has mapped central circuits from the extrathoracic trachea. These studies showed that a broad nTS network participates in central processing of tracheal afferent information, supporting that the role of the nTS in generating cough has been significantly underestimated and that this area does not simply relay vagal sensory afferent information.

### The clinical approach to chronic cough [^3158405c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough remains a significant clinical challenge, affecting approximately 10% of the population and leading to significant impairment in psychological, social, and physical quality of life. In recent years, efforts have intensified to elucidate the mechanisms underlying chronic cough and to focus on investigating and treating refractory chronic cough (RCC). A "treatable trait" approach, which focuses on identifying and addressing the specific associated causes of chronic cough, has gained traction. In some patients, RCC is likely driven by a neuropathic mechanism due to dysregulation of the neuronal pathways involved in the cough reflex, often clinically described as cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Although the initial treatment of underlying conditions remains central to managing treatable traits, the therapeutic options for RCC have expanded to include targeting cough hypersensitivity. First-line treatments now include neuromodulators and speech therapy with one P2X3 receptor antagonist (gefapixant) recently licensed in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Japan. Despite these advances, patient responses remain variable, underscoring the ongoing need for research into the pathophysiology and treatment of RCC. This article reviews current investigations and management options in treating chronic cough and RCC.

### COUGH (...) [^6438bc13]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cough may be either a voluntary or an involuntary act; perhaps most often it is an involuntary act reinforced by volition. Semicough, 1 commonly called "clearing the throat" and expressed in lay literature as "ahem, " is always voluntary, though nerve-cell habit may make it an almost subconscious act. It is only the involuntary cough of purely reflex character that will be considered here. The following brief and clear statement of the physiologic mechanism of cough by my colleague Prof. Albert P. Brubaker is authoritative: "The cause of the cough is an irritation in the area of distribution of the glossopharyngeal, the trigeminal and perhaps other sensory nerves as well. In the unconditioned or purely reflex cough, the local irritation develops nerve impulses which are transmitted by the vagus from the air passages. ". My colleague Dr. F. J. Kalteyer, in a personal communication, calls my attention to the fact that MacKenzie JACKSON C.

Airway afferent nerve subtypes—anatomy and neurochemical attributes relevant to cough are described as bronchopulmonary vagal afferent nerves arising bilaterally from the inferior (nodose) and superior (jugular) vagal ganglia, differing in chemical and mechanical responsiveness and in anatomic, embryological, and physiologic attributes; when combined, clear patterns of anatomy and physiology emerge that help distinguish specific nerve subtypes, which is critical to understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of cough.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^3fa018ca]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Nasal afferent nerve regulation of the cough reflex—upper airway disease and trigeminal mechanisms—notes that rhinosinusitis and other upper airway conditions are common comorbidities in chronic cough, yet the reason is unclear and direct stimulation of the nasal mucosa does not initiate cough. Speculation that postnasal drip is responsible is tempered by considerable variance in its prevalence among chronic cough patients. An alternative explanation is a sensitizing effect of upper airway afferent nerves leading to enhanced cough responsiveness and coughing in a subset of individuals. This hypothetical mechanism assumes trigeminal afferent pathways lower the threshold of the central cough pattern generator to subsequent vagal afferent input so even innocuous or physiologic lower airway stimuli could promote coughing. Thus, cough reflex sensitivity is enhanced by upper airways disease and an additional lower airway trigger produces a presentation responsive to aggressive medical therapy targeting upper airway disease, and there is precedent in animals and in patients for enhanced cough sensitivity evoked by upper airway irritation.

Cough reflex neurophysiology—airway afferent remodeling and therapeutic targets: Evidence for extensive remodeling of airway afferent innervation in cough-related disease is conflicting, and chronic coughing may reflect increased triggers rather than hyperinnervation, with inflammatory mediators elevated in BAL fluid of patients with asthma and chronic coughers without asthma; while therapeutics targeting identified triggers or inflammation have proven effective, the precise terminal locations of afferents driving chronic cough are not yet known. Despite animal data, it is unknown whether meaningful changes in afferent nerve excitability or ion channel expression occur in human cough patients. Viable therapeutic strategies for cough suppression include targeting interactions between nerves regulating cough at the level of the central nervous system, mechanisms underlying action potential generation, and encoding mechanisms of cough; emerging approaches include selective sodium channel blockers (e.g., voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7) in airways sensory nerves, N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor/channel blockers, and other methods aimed at altering afferent nerve excitability within the airways.

Higher brain processing systems and behavioral modulation in cough—Coughing has higher (cortical and subcortical) control, with higher brain control manifesting as inhibition and as voluntary cough; the urge to cough evoked by capsaicin inhalation in healthy volunteers is encoded in a network including the primary sensory, insula, prefrontal, and posterior parietal cortices, while voluntary cough suppression involves the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior mid-cingulate cortex, insula cortex, and supplementary motor area, and voluntary cough is associated with activity in premotor and motor cortices and in the cerebellum. In chronic cough, behavioral and psychologic factors are relevant: Vertigan and Gibson reported that 49% of a patient cohort diagnosed with chronic refractory cough reported coughing deliberately in response to perceived irritations in the throat; placebos can have a profound effect on coughing, and any study of a novel or existing cough treatment should include a blinded (preferably double-blinded) placebo arm; speech therapy is proving beneficial in a subset of chronic coughers; cough may be unrelated to a physiologic disease and thus a psychologic issue needs to be considered (“psychogenic cough”); and addressing the psychologic impact of coughing on a patient's sense of well-being should therefore be a component of any treatment regimen for chronic cough.

Cough versus breathing regulation and chemosensory influences—cough and breathing can be differentially regulated by primary afferent inputs to the brainstem, indicating regulation of cough is customized to the function of the behavior. During cough, ventilation increases significantly and this alteration is necessary to prevent a loss of respiratory muscle excitability as CO2 falls; the depression of cough induced by hypoxia is less well understood and may reflect a shift in priority of the respiratory muscle control system. The permissive/facilitatory effect of SARs on cough is also not well understood but may help optimize respiratory muscle performance and facilitate expulsive airflows when cough is elicited at higher lung volumes.

### The physiology of cough [^0c9f7214]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Cough is comprised of three phases (inspiratory, compressive and expiratory) and serves as a vital defensive mechanism for lung health. It prevents pulmonary aspiration, promotes ciliary activity and clears airway debris. The importance of an intact cough mechanism is reflected in the occurrence of pulmonary problems when cough is inefficient. Cough efficiency is dependent on physical/mechanical aspects (respiratory muscles, mucus, airway calibre and larynx) and integrity of the neurophysiological pathway of cough. The understanding of the latter has progressed significantly (albeit mostly in animals) with the discovery of vanniloid receptors (and subtypes) and, more recently, by the characterisation of distinct cough receptors. However, the relative contributions of previously described airway afferents/receptors to cough are still disputed. Plasticity of the peripheral and central afferent pathways in cough has recently been shown to be important in pathological states associated with increased cough. To date, little is known of the developmental aspects of cough.

### Translational review: neuroimmune mechanisms in cough and emerging therapeutic targets [^75de7090]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Cough is an essential defensive behavior for maintaining airway patency and to protect the lungs from potentially harmful agents. However, inflammatory pathologies can sensitize and activate the neural pathways regulating cough, leading to excessive and nonproductive coughing that serves little protective utility. Problematic cough continues to be one of the most common reasons for seeking medical advice, yet for many patients, it can be refractory to disease-specific treatments and currently available antitussive therapies. The effect of inflammation on cough neural processing occurs not only at the level of the bronchopulmonary sensory nerve terminals but also within the nervous system at multiple peripheral and central sites. Sensory nerves also actively regulate inflammation, and it is therefore a complex interplay between the immune and nervous systems that contributes to chronic cough and the associated sensory hypersensitivities. In this review we provide a brief overview of cough neurobiology in health and disease and then explore the peripheral and central nervous system sites at which neuroimmune interactions can occur. We present advancements in the development of effective antitussive therapies and suggest novel targets for future consideration.

Brainstem cough network and antitussive pharmacology—Centrally active antitussive drugs suppress cough in a dose-dependent manner at doses that have no effect on breathing, and familiar brainstem areas such as the nTS could participate in the actions of antitussive drugs; studies support that there may be no single anatomic brainstem area or “center” that is susceptible to antitussive drugs but that these compounds may act at multiple sites when administered systemically, with the phenotype of response to cough-suppressive drugs first shown by May and Widdicombe > 50 years ago.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^f4959a0d]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex.

Methods

A review of the literature was carried out using PubMed and the ISI Web of Knowledge from 1951 to 2004. Most of the referenced studies were carried out in animals

Conclusions

Studies carried out in animals provide suggestive but inconclusive evidence that C-fibers and rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) arising from the vagus nerves mediate coughing. Recent studies also have suggested that a vagal afferent nerve subtype that is not readily classified as a RAR or a C-fiber may play an important role in regulating cough. Afferent nerves innervating other viscera, as well as somatosensory nerves innervating the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal musculature also likely play a less essential but important accessory role in regulating cough. The responsiveness and morphology of the airway vagal afferent nerve subtypes and the extrapulmonary afferent nerves that regulate coughing are described.

### Prevalence, pathogenesis, and causes of chronic cough [^f6f0cd36]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cough is a reflex action of the respiratory tract that is used to clear the upper airways. Chronic cough lasting for more than 8 weeks is common in the community. The causes include cigarette smoking, exposure to cigarette smoke, and exposure to environmental pollution, especially particulates. Diseases causing chronic cough include asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, postnasal drip syndrome or rhinosinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Doctors should always work towards a clear diagnosis, considering common and rare illnesses. In some patients, no cause is identified, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic cough. Chronic cough is often associated with an increased response to tussive agents such as capsaicin. Plastic changes in intrinsic and synaptic excitability in the brainstem, spine, or airway nerves can enhance the cough reflex, and can persist in the absence of the initiating cough event. Structural and inflammatory airway mucosal changes in non-asthmatic chronic cough could represent the cause or the traumatic response to repetitive coughing. Effective control of cough requires not only controlling the disease causing the cough but also desensitisation of cough pathways.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^10afa281]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Cough initiated from the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)—evidence is mixed: animal studies and some human studies do not show cough evoked by esophageal distension or luminal acid/capsaicin, yet other human reports do; chronic cough is clearly associated with GERD and reduction of coughing with effective anti-reflux therapy in at least a subset of patients supports reflux as a driver of cough. Studies using cough monitoring with impedance measurements implicate reflux, with one explanation being aspiration that directly activates airway vagal afferents; however, pH/impedance monitoring provides little evidence that refluxate must reach the proximal esophagus or airways to initiate coughing, and available evidence suggests locally or centrally mediated airway reflexes can be initiated directly from the stomach or esophagus, with neuronal projections capable of producing airway mucus secretion or bronchoconstriction that could promote cough.

Cough is a common and troublesome symptom that can be difficult to treat. New therapeutic options that are safe and more effective than those currently available are needed. In this article, the authors offer opinion on future directions in the treatment of cough, with a particular emphasis on the clinical syndrome associated with cough reflex hypersensitivity. In addition, the article provides an overview of some of the diagnostic technologies and promising drug targets likely to emerge from current clinical and scientific endeavor.

### The heterogeneity of chronic cough: a case for endotypes of cough hypersensitivity [^4f06fd3e]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Cough is a troublesome and difficult-to-treat symptom that accompanies a diverse range of pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions. Although considerable advances have been made over recent years in basic cough biology, this has not translated into improved clinical management. A major challenge has been in understanding the heterogeneity underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough in different patients. We present evidence that such heterogeneity begins with the multiple peripheral and central neural pathways capable of eliciting cough and associated respiratory behaviours, and extends to incorporate the diversity of diseases that underlie cough and the clinical phenotypic and pathological endotypic presentations that can vary substantially between individual patients with cough. A better understanding of how these sources of heterogeneity are expressed across individual patients with chronic cough is needed to better predict the efficacy of clinical management strategies and of specifically targeted therapies, which will facilitate the development of more personalised clinical approaches to treat patients with chronic cough.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^cb618f35]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Peripheral interactions between afferent nerve subtypes—reflex and autonomic effects modulate cough: SARs and RARs regulate tidal volumes and the timing of inspiration and expiration, and peak expiratory flows during cough are directly related to inspiratory volumes so lung stretch receptors will modulate cough; anticholinergics have been shown to modulate cough responsiveness and at least partially reduce cough severity in some patients, and airway sympathetic nerves may regulate cough by modulating mucosal blood flow to reduce excitatory irritants; axonal reflexes from afferent C-fibers are unlikely to regulate human coughing given the paucity of neuropeptide-containing sensory nerves in human airway mucosa, yet administered exogenously ATP evokes coughing and a clinical study described a profound reduction in chronic cough rates with a potent purinergic/P2X3 receptor antagonist in patients with chronic cough.

### Cough reflex hypersensitivity as a key treatable trait [^338f7717]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Cough reflex hypersensitivity is emerging as a key treatable trait in chronic cough and other cough-associated respiratory conditions. This review examines the neurological basis of cough, highlighting the complex interplay between peripheral and central mechanisms. The concept of cough hypersensitivity aims to address unmet clinical needs by recognizing chronic cough as a distinct disorder rather than merely a symptom. Evidence from clinical trials supports cough hypersensitivity as a treatable trait in chronic cough, with opiates, gabapentinoids, and novel P2X3 antagonists showing efficacy. Cough hypersensitivity is also relevant in conditions presenting with persistent cough, such as asthma, bronchiectasis, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, though more research is needed. Recognizing cough reflex hypersensitivity as a treatable trait offers new avenues for management, particularly for patients with persistent cough despite etiology-targeted therapies. We propose redefining chronic cough as a distinct disease entity in which cough hypersensitivity is a common feature and key therapeutic target, potentially leading to better patient care and the development of novel therapies.

Airway cough receptor terminations—distribution and morphology are described as abundant in the airway mucosa with a stereotypical position in the airway wall and complex dendritic arbors arranged along the circumferential axis; terminations are confined to the space between the smooth muscle and the epithelial cell layers, a location that may explain relative insensitivity to epithelium removal or airway smooth muscle contraction and that is a site of extensive remodeling in several chronic diseases in patients, with comparable structures identified in other species including humans.

Developmental and aging influences on cough—Maturational and developmental factors have important clinical implications: genetic and intrauterine conditions at birth can affect innate protective reflexes in the newborn, which become less pronounced as the infant matures; the age at which the cough reflex becomes fully matured in children is not known, but aging can impact cough as respiratory muscle strength decreases with age reducing the efficacy of coughing, while the threshold for initiating coughing does not change; in the elderly, capacity to suppress cough and the sensation of the urge to cough after airway irritation are diminished, and although the implications are unclear, aspiration pneumonia is more common in old age.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^dba7e13c]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Gaps in knowledge in cough neurophysiology—developmental maturation, sex and age differences, and neuroimaging—are highlighted as priorities for research that could aid clinical management. The authors identified several knowledge gaps which if filled could help improve clinical management, including an improved understanding of cough reflex maturation from infancy to adulthood to help protect children from silent and recurrent small volume aspiration. Linked needs include understanding how integration between the peripheral and central nervous systems is impacted by sex, aging, or acute and chronic neurologic disease. A preliminary functional MRI assessment demonstrated sex-related differences in somatosensory cortex activity during inhaled capsaicin challenges, and similar imaging strategies could distinguish between central sensory and motor neural changes that accompany altered coughing seen clinically. The perception of pain, which shares neurologic similarities with cough, differs with respect to sex and age and shows changes with acute and chronic neurologic disease, and brain imaging has offered insights into putative mechanisms contributing to pain plasticity.

### Chronic cough: from a complex dysfunction of the neurological circuit to the production of persistent cough [^2b8b71fa]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic cough or cough that lasts more than 8 weeks, once a chest x-ray and spirometry are confirmed normal, is caused by an alteration in a section of the route between peripheral receptors, mainly in the upper and lower airway and oesophagus, spinal cord and the cough centre in the brain stem involving the cortex. These mechanisms of cough have their homology in the circuit of chronic pain, and on that basis, should expand future research of chronic cough. Clinically chronic cough is easy to diagnose by an excessive response or hypertussia to low-intensity stimuli or banal stimuli, which we now call hypersensitivity cough syndrome, quantified by a positive reflex cough with capsaicin or citric acid. However, hypersensitivity cough syndrome can be impossible to quantify in the laboratory when the hyper-responsiveness originates in the central nervous system. This is normally caused by excessive peripheral input or convergence of stimuli from different sources. Once central hypersensitivity is acquired, peripheral input is not as important for activation of the cough.

### Management of cough [^fc18addb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

People with chronic cough can experience significant quality-of-life impairment. New concepts based around cough reflex hypersensitivity are leading to improved management strategies and showing promise in relieving the distress from persistent cough. The clinical cough assessment seeks to classify patients on the basis of symptom duration, and to identify and manage exposures and diseases that activate the afferent limb of the cough reflex. Cough hypersensitivity is also addressed by managing laryngeal dysfunction with speech pathology therapy and managing central cough reflex sensitization with neuromodulators. There are prospects for novel therapies based around several new treatment targets.

### Branching out in chronic cough: evidence for increased airway nerve density [^01c80dea]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is believed to affect up to 12% of the general population and most commonly occurs as a consequence of cigarette smoking and chronic respiratory diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchiectasis). In patients presenting to specialist cough clinics, the cause is often less obvious, and the cough is more likely to be associated with nasal disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or asthma. In some patients, the chronic cough may not improve with the treatment of these conditions and is termed “refractory” or if no cause can be identified, “unexplained.” Patients attending cough clinics mainly describe a dry/minimally productive cough triggered by trivial exposures to innocuous stimuli such as changes in temperature, environmental irritants (e.g. perfumes and cleaning products) and use of their voice. Coughing occurs typically hundreds of times per day and has significant quality of life impacts, especially if treatment of associated conditions is not beneficial. Currently there are no licensed therapies for chronic cough, and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that a hyperexcitability of the neuronal pathways controlling cough is likely to be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology. Indeed, heightened cough reflex responses have been demonstrated in patients with chronic cough in studies experimentally evoking cough. However, the precise nature of this hyperexcitability remains unclear, and the extent to which this may reflect changes in activation/function of the airway nerves responsible for initiating cough and/or their connections in the central nervous system is unknown.

Bronchopulmonary C-fibers—several subtypes have been described across species and are differentiated by ganglionic origin, airway and lung termination sites, chemical sensitivity, neurochemistry, and reflexes; they are activated somewhat selectively by capsaicin, bradykinin, TRPA1 activators, and protons, and each of these stimuli initiate coughing in patients and awake animals; in animals, cough from these stimuli is prevented by prior capsaicin desensitization and inhibited by neurokinin receptor antagonists; neurokinins such as substance P are uniquely expressed by airway C-fibers in animals, and collectively these observations provide compelling evidence for an essential role of C-fibers in cough.

### The role of vagal afferent nerves in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^788b1ed6]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that the vagal nervous system is dysregulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This dysregulation can lead to an increased sensitivity of the cough reflex such that the coughing becomes, at times, "nonproductive" or inappropriate. Vagal dysregulation can also lead to an increase in the activity of the parasympathetic reflex control of the airways, which contributes to greater mucus secretion and bronchial smooth muscle contraction. Indirect evidence indicates that lung disease is accompanied by substantive changes to the entire reflex pathways, including enhanced activity of the primary afferent nerves, increases in synaptic efficacy at secondary nerves in the central nervous system, and changes in the autonomic nerve pathways. Drugs aimed at normalizing neuronal activity may, therefore, be beneficial in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Experimental tussive challenge observations—Coughing in response to physical and chemical irritants including cold air and aerosols of capsaicin, citric acid, histamine, and charcoal dust has been reported in healthy subjects and patients with disease, with subjects often describing a “tickle” at the top center of the chest and an “urge” to cough; female subjects exhibit heightened cough responses to chemical tussive stimuli, and patients typically report triggering by low-level physical and chemical stimuli, a feature that can be the most troublesome cough-associated occurrence and contributes to impaired health status.

Bronchopulmonary C fibers and acid-sensitive, capsaicin-insensitive mechanoreceptors innervating the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi regulate the cough reflex. These vagal afferent nerves may interact centrally with sensory input arising from afferent nerves innervating the intrapulmonary airways or even extrapulmonary afferents such as those innervating the nasal mucosa and esophagus to produce chronic cough or enhanced cough responsiveness. The mechanisms of cough initiation in health and in disease are briefly described.

### Cough due to reflex irritation in the upper air-passages (...) [^cde1a3ec]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the daily routine of practice, probably there is no affection more frequently met with by physicians than coughs, and in many cases they are puzzling, harassing and stubborn. Even after nearly the whole range of indicated pharmacopeial medicines have been applied, the cough still remains as before, excepting with temporary relief. The patient becomes alarmed, fearing pulmonary complications, although assured by the physician that no lesions or symptoms exist in that region. Mayo Collier1 says that "cough as a symptom or indication of some irritation in the upper or lower respiratory tract or other parts, is the commonest affection the human frame is subject to. " Such cough, however, is oftener extrapulmonary in origin and quite innocent in its nature, and a highly commendable service is rendered and the dignity and scientific value of medicine exhibited when, by thorough and accurate examination, the extraneous cause is discovered, skilfully removed.

Cough demographics—children: The previous and current CHEST guidelines recommended using pediatric-specific cough pathways when managing children with chronic cough, and the cough reflex first becomes evident at 1 to 2 months of age but is weak in premature infants; in some people, stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve can elicit the Arnold ear-cough reflex, which can be evoked by mechanical stimulation of the ear canal with insertion of a cotton-tip applicator 3 to 5 mm for 2 to 3 s; data suggest similar prevalence of this reflex in children with chronic cough and healthy individuals but an 11-fold higher prevalence in adults with chronic cough compared with healthy adults and those with respiratory disease without cough; exercise modulates the cough reflex, with one study finding that exercise reduced capsaicin cough sensitivity in all healthy adults.

Regional airway chemosensitivity—Cough can be initiated with chemical stimuli, and distal airway stimulation evokes stronger responses: in cats, chemical stimulation delivered to distal bronchi produced a more vigorous response than in the trachea or proximal larger airways, and in healthy humans, coughing was more readily stimulated by small droplet particles deposited more distally than by large droplets deposited more proximally; the presence of “chemosensitive” receptors in distal airways provides a rationale for prominent cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchiolitis with peripheral airway involvement.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ed0c107d]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Widdicombe cough receptors—myelinated vagal afferents critical to cough are described as a subset of myelinated, mechanically sensitive, capsaicin-insensitive vagal afferent nerves that plays an essential role in cough; they are differentiated by axon conduction velocity (5 m/s), faster than C-fibers (< 1 m/s) but slower than lung stretch receptors (≥ 15 m/s); they do not normally express TRPV1 or TRPA1 and are thus insensitive to capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanate, yet are activated by protons; in guinea pigs, their cell bodies are located in the nodose ganglia whereas C-fiber bodies are in the jugular ganglia; cough receptor terminals do not synthesize neuropeptides but use glutamate as their primary transmitter; their terminations are found exclusively in extrapulmonary airways (larynx, trachea, mainstem bronchi), and they are utterly unresponsive to a wide variety of irritants and spasmogens that otherwise activate RARs and do not reliably evoke cough in animals or patients.

### Chronic cough as a neuropathic disorder [^adeb3b51]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is a common symptom that can be a daunting challenge for clinicians since treatment of the underlying cause does not always provide adequate relief, an obvious cause can remain elusive, and current antitussives have fairly poor efficacy and undesirable side-effects. Patients with chronic cough typically describe a range of sensory symptoms suggestive of upper-airway and laryngeal neural dysfunction. Additionally, patients often report cough triggered by low-level physical and chemical stimuli, which is suggestive of cough-reflex hyperresponsiveness. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying peripheral and central augmentation of the afferent cough pathways have been identified, and compelling evidence exists for a neuropathy of vagal sensory nerves after upper-respiratory viral infections or exposure to allergic and non-allergic irritants. In this Personal View, we argue that chronic cough is a neuropathic disorder that arises from neural damage caused by a range of inflammatory, infective, and allergic factors. In support of this idea, we discuss evidence of successful treatment of chronic cough with agents used for treatment of neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin and amitriptyline. Regarding cough as a neuropathic disorder could lead to new, more effective antitussives.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^1246c42e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Even though the symptom-driven treatment of cough-associated symptoms almost invariably resulted in a marked decrease of symptoms other than cough itself in both SPC+ and SPC− patients, the cough scores only improved in SPC− patients. To explain this, it can be hypothesised that in SPC+ patients peripheral stimuli activating the cough reflex also generate a state of central hypersensitivity that may persist over time irrespective of the disappearance of the peripheral stimulus initiating cough. It has been shown that synaptic plasticity taking place in sensory pathways, from the spinal dorsal horn to cortical areas, contributes to chronic pain.Potentiation at synapses of nociceptive nerve fibres constitutes a powerful model for pain amplification following trauma, inflammation and nerve injury.Since cough can be considered a defensive response to nociceptive stimulation, it is not surprising that mechanisms underlying nociception and cough may share similar features leading to the development of pain and cough hypersensitivities.These mechanisms might constitute the neurophysiological basis of clinical forms of chronic cough - conventionally referred to as refractory or unexplained chronic cough - of which SPCs may represent a clinical hallmark.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d020a4be]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Extrapulmonary modulation of cough—Arnold nerve (auricular branch of the vagus) stimulation—indicates that afferent nerves innervate the external auditory meatus and, in a small subset of individuals (< 5%), mechanical stimulation of the ear may evoke cough; tracing studies show Arnold nerve afferent cell bodies are in the jugular ganglia with central terminations including the nTS, and in guinea pigs the nociceptors that modulate cough also have cell bodies in the jugular ganglia and terminate in the same region of the nTS. It seems likely that ear-initiated cough involves integration of ongoing airway vagal afferent input with additional afferent input arising from the ear.

### Reflex mechanisms in gastroesophageal reflux disease and asthma [^b4ebf144]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This article presents a brief description of the reflex mechanisms responsible for cough and bronchospasm, and identifies several potential mechanisms by which gastroesophageal reflux (GER) may precipitate these reflexes. Airway and esophageal reflexes related to various mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors have been elucidated, primarily in animal studies. Central nervous system (CNS) reflex pathways as well as local axon reflexes may each contribute to the pathogenesis of both asthma and GER disease (GERD). When activated, airway nociceptors precipitate defensive reflexes such as cough, bronchospasm, and mucus secretion. Nociceptors innervating both the airways and the esophagus respond to similar stimuli with defensive manuevers. The pathways of some esophageal and airway sensory nerves terminate in the same regions of the CNS. It appears possible that synergistic interactions between esophageal nociceptors and airway sensory nerves may precipitate the asthma-like symptoms associated with GERD.

### Cough hypersensitivity and chronic cough [^1be83309]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2022). High credibility.

Chronic cough is globally prevalent across all age groups. This disorder is challenging to treat because many pulmonary and extrapulmonary conditions can present with chronic cough, and cough can also be present without any identifiable underlying cause or be refractory to therapies that improve associated conditions. Most patients with chronic cough have cough hypersensitivity, which is characterized by increased neural responsivity to a range of stimuli that affect the airways and lungs, and other tissues innervated by common nerve supplies. Cough hypersensitivity presents as excessive coughing often in response to relatively innocuous stimuli, causing significant psychophysical morbidity and affecting patients' quality of life. Understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to cough hypersensitivity and excessive coughing in different patient populations and across the lifespan is advancing and has contributed to the development of new therapies for chronic cough in adults. Owing to differences in the pathology, the organs involved and individual patient factors, treatment of chronic cough is progressing towards a personalized approach, and, in the future, novel ways to endotype patients with cough may prove valuable in management.

### A vagal reflex evoked by airway closure [^dc828377]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Sensory neurons that constitute the interoceptive nervous system relay information to the brain from vital organs in the body. Within the airways, sensory neurons provide essential feedback to control breathing, promote gas exchange, protect the airways through cough and laryngeal guarding reflexes, detect pathogens to induce sickness, and elicit perceptions of breathlessness, also known as dyspnoea or air hunger,,–. Neuronal surveillance of the airways enables the detection of life-threatening inefficiencies in gas exchange, which can be a characteristic of cardiopulmonary disease. In response, neural circuits trigger compensatory reflexes such as gasps (quick and deep inspirations also called augmented breaths or sighs) to reopen closed airways, bring air into the lungs and relieve respiratory distress –. Gasps are triggered by many airway threats, including hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary congestion and thoracic compression, precede voluntary behaviours such as speaking and singing, and are often the first and last breaths of life. Neural circuits in the brain have been identified that coordinate the gasping motor response, but sensory pathways that lead to gasping, and their mechanisms of action, require additional exploration.

### Bradykinin sensitizes the cough reflex via a breceptor dependent activation of TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels through metabolites of cyclooxygenase and 12-lipoxygenase [^2d1f195b]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is a poorly understood and managed clinical problem with a high prevalence rate. Recently, sensitization of the cough reflex has been identified as an important mechanism in chronic cough, where cough can result from low level stimulation by chemical, mechanical, or thermal stimuli. The term cough hypersensitivity syndrome (CHS) has been coined to describe this phenomenon. The mechanisms underlying the CHS are not yet fully understood but there is evidence to suggest that sensitization takes place at both peripheral and central levels. The evidence for the involvement of peripheral sensory nerves in CHS is substantial. Numerous studies have demonstrated, using both ex vivo nerve set-ups and in vivo animal models of cough, that exposure to agents such as allergens, ozone and several inflammatory mediators result in both increased airway nerve activity  and enhanced cough. Given that cough is predominantly vagally mediated and that the same agents which enhance afferent vagal nerve activity also sensitize the cough reflex, the role of peripheral sensitization in cough is now well established.

The role of the central nervous system (CNS) in cough is not well understood, mainly due to the limited access and the complexity of CNS, and possibly due to focus on the airways as the primary site for sensitization of cough. Strong evidence shows that pain, which shares many similarities with cough in terms of neuronal pathways and neurophysiology, has a strong central component. Furthermore, drugs, both old and new ones, that effectively target pain pathways, are mainly centrally acting. Of relevance is that centrally acting analgesic drugs have been shown to be effective cough suppressants. In addition, some mediators involved in pain pathways, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) can sensitize the cough reflex by both peripheral and central mechanisms.

Bradykinin (BK) is a well-established inflammatory mediator of both acute and chronic pain. BK has also been reported to be involved in cough. For example, inhalation of BK or pretreatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to induce cough and/or sensitize the cough response following challenge with tussigenic agents-an effect that can be blocked by pretreatment with a B 2 receptor antagonist. However, whether BK can sensitize the cough reflex via a central mode of action is not well established.

### Coughs and sneezes: their role in transmission of respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 [^ac776cc1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cough

Stimulation of sensory nerve fibers (branches of the vagus nerve) located in the ciliated epithelium of the upper airways and cardiac and esophageal branches from the diaphragm by infection, inflammation, or irritation provokes cough. Afferent impulses from these sensory fibers travel to the medulla where they are coordinated in the cough center. The efferent pathway of the reflex arc involves impulses that travel from the cough center via the vagus, phrenic, and spinal motor nerves to the diaphragm, abdominal wall, and muscles. Afferent inputs to the brain stem are also relayed to higher brain regions, where inputs are integrated in pontine, subcortical, and cortical nuclei. The motor and premotor cortical brain regions can voluntarily initiate a cough by descending pathways that may bypass brainstem integrative centers.

The cough maneuver includes an initial deep inhalation followed by a compression phase, in which contraction of the muscles of the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal wall along with closure of the glottis produces a rapid rise in intrathoracic pressure. In the subsequent expiratory phase, the glottis suddenly opens, and the high intrathoracic pressure generated during compression promotes an initial high expiratory airflow (up to 12 L/s) that breaks up mucus into smaller droplets and is accompanied by the sound of coughing.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^c2e7de01]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Esophageal stimuli and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)—studies in patients with GERD provide evidence that airway reflex may also sensitize the cough reflex; acid challenges to the esophagus markedly reduce the concentration of inhaled capsaicin required to evoke cough or directly result in coughing. The sensitizing effect of the esophageal challenge could be prevented by inhalation of atropine, suggesting a CNS-dependent reflex from the esophagus that resulted in bronchospasm and/or mucous secretion initiating coughing. Medical treatment of GERD has been reported to greatly reduce sensitivity to tussive stimuli, and this sensitizing effect of refluxate or experimental acid challenges likely depends on CNS integration and sensitization of parallel vagal sensory inputs controlling cough.

Pulmonary stretch receptors—physiology is characterized by responses to sustained lung inflation; both RARs and slowly adapting receptors (SARs) are activated by sustained inflation but RARs are active primarily during the dynamic phase whereas SARs continue firing throughout distension and differ from RARs in their responses to lung deflation or collapse; SARs are highly sensitive to mechanical forces, increase activity sharply during inspiration and peak just prior to expiration, are believed to be the primary afferent fibers in the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex, and have terminal structures identified in the intrapulmonary airways and lungs of rabbits.

### Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on cough reflex and urge-to-cough in healthy young adults [^bc61a08b]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technology, which applies mild direct current to the scalp to modulate cortical excitability. Previous studies have reported that tDCS (2 mA, 20 min, electrode size: 3 × 5 cm) can produce an analgesic effect by stimulating the left DLPFC. A randomized controlled study also showed that after tDCS intervention in the swallowing motor cortex, the swallowing function of stroke patients was significantly improved. Notably, pain, swallowing reflex, and cough reflex mechanisms overlap in the central regulatory pathway. When painful stimuli were applied to the volunteers, fMRI showed the activation of several brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, similar to the brain regions activated when individual coughs. Thus, tDCS stimulation of the cerebral cortex might also influence the cough reflex sensitivity. Our results showed that individuals’ cough reflex and urge-to-cough threshold were significantly increased after the anodal tDCS stimulation of the rDLPFC activity, indicating the possibility of modulating cough reflex through the regulation of the central nervous system (CNS).

In addition, our results further supported the active role of the rDLPFC upon anodal tDCS stimulation in the cough inhibition pathway. On the other hand, cathodal tDCS reduced rDLPFC neural activity but did not affect individuals’ cough reflex and urge-to-cough sensitivity. A systematic meta-analysis has revealed that following the cathodal tDCS intervention, the behavioral results related to cognitive function may not change significantly. Several studies on the motor and a few studies on cognition have found that the inhibition can rarely be caused by the cathode tDCS. One possible interpretation for the findings is that the bilateral interactions support the contralateral compensation. When cathodal tDCS inhibits the neural activity in the stimulated cerebral hemisphere, corresponding brain regions in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere may be activated to maintain the stability of physiological functions. Furthermore, brain regions in the cough activation pathway should be targeted for patients who need to improve urge-to-cough sensitivity, such as elderly patients with aspiration pneumonia, and the rDLPFC may be a potential target of central antitussive therapy in the future.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to chronic cough [^80707e59]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Although cough is a protective reflex, it can occur in the absence of any physical need to clear the airway. In chronic cough, cough can be triggered by innocuous stimuli and persist despite medical treatment. Nonpharmacological interventions such as cough control therapy, provided by speech pathologists, have gained popularity in recent years. Intervention targets refractory or unexplained chronic cough, and efficacy has been studied in randomized controlled trials. Key elements of cough control therapy include education, anticipation, and control of the urge to cough, reducing laryngeal irritation and psychoeducational counseling. Our understanding of the mechanisms behind the success of nonpharmacological treatment is developing. It is likely the mechanisms of action are multifactorial across peripheral, central, and higher cortical regions. Nonpharmacological cough control therapy interventions are now included in international cough guidelines. However, approach to service delivery is not standardized and varies between regions and countries.

### Efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for refractory or unexplained chronic cough: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^065fefd0]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are abundantly present in the airways. Among particular interest to cough are members of the vanilloid (TRPV1, TRPV4), ankyrin (TRPA1), and melastatin (TRPM8) families.There are different profiles of cough hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPV4, and TRPM8 in patients with chronic cough, suggesting that selective or combined antagonists therapy targeting TRPV1, TRPA1, or other cough receptors might be effective.Previous studies suggested that patients with RCC may not benefit from present medications. Also, the pharmacologic modulation of TRP channels should be further investigated as a potential target for CC.

Hence, clinical trials with the TRPV1 and TRPV4 were terminated, mainly due to the following reasons: first, it has become clear in recent years that while evoked cough models are important for elucidating mechanisms and confirming target engagement in both animals and humans, they are poorly predictive of impact on pathological cough in a real-life clinical population. Second, although Khalid et al. reported that treatment with SB-705498 significantly reduced experimentally produced cough responses to capsaicin, there was no discernible improvement in the frequency of spontaneous cough.They argued that increased cough responses to capsaicin might result from neuroplastic changes anywhere along the cough reflex pathway (central or peripheral), rather than as a direct result of changes in TRPV1 expression or activity. The differential sensitivity of cough to antitussive therapies implies the existence of heterogeneity in cough hypersensitivity. The above data suggest that the cough pathway is heterogeneous and that a single type of TRP receptor agonist may only affect a portion of the pathway in the cough neural reflex, as reported by Khalid et al. Although current clinical trials did not indicate the efficacy of TRP modulators in the treatment of RCC/UCC, Tnernesten et al. found that capsaicin powder taken orally could decrease cough sensitivity and symptoms.This effect may due to the reduction of peripheral sensitization of cough via the depletion of TRPV1 receptor in the airway. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. In order to effectively treat the cough as a neural reflex as a whole, a combination of multiple TRP receptor antagonists may be necessary. Indeed, the involvement of a complex suite of neurobiological processes involving the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system (CNS) in the cough as a reflex.The treatment of cough as a neural reflex may have a potential therapeutic effect if peripheral receptor blockers are combined with drugs that affect the CNS component of cough hypersensitivity. After all, there is substantial preclinical evidence for the involvement of TRPV1, TRPA1, and now TRPV4 in the cough mechanism.

### Prostaglandin esensitizes the cough reflex centrally via EP3 receptor-dependent activation of NaV 1.8 channels [^2d49e1dd]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough, particularly that of a chronic nature, continues to be a challenging clinical condition with a high global prevalence leading to a significant economic expenditure and utilization of health care resources. Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome (CHS) is a recently coined term to describe a chronic  exaggerated cough response, to numerous stimuli, which may exist as a distinct clinical entity. The lack of effective cough therapy in the market, to date, reflects our incomplete understanding of cough mechanisms and related pathways that underlie CHS.

The role of the brainstem and higher brain regions in cough is particularly poorly understood, compared to that of the airways, possibly due to difficulty of access, complexity of the neuroanatomy and lack of appropriate animal models. Notwithstanding, progress has been made recently in identifying some of the neuromediators, pathways and neuroplastic changes involved in cough, at both peripheral and central levels.

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that airway and central neuroplastic changes, driven by inflammation, are important drivers of cough. Interestingly, many of the inflammatory mediators involved in hyperalgesia, such as substance P (SP), nerve growth factor (NGF) and bradykinin (BK) also induce and/or sensitize the cough reflex partly via activation and/or upregulation of ion channels. In particular, transient resistant potential (TRP) channels such as TRPV1 and TRPA1 have been reported to play key roles in sensitizing the cough reflex both peripherally and centrally. More recently, voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs), mainly NaV 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9, which are expressed in airway sensory neurons, have been reported to be involved in the regulation of peripheral cough.

### Targeting primary afferent nerves for novel antitussive therapy [^6ee59d60]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

The best available data support the hypothesis that there are at least two types of vagal nerves responsible for initiating coughing reflexes. One type of nerve conducts action potentials in the A-range and is characterized by rapidly adapting responses to mechanical probing or acidification of the large airway epithelium. Stimulation of these nerves can evoke cough in unconscious experimental animals and humans. These nerves are important in immediate cough evoked by aspiration and as such perform a critical role in airway defense. The other type of primary afferent nerve involved in cough is the vagal C-fiber. Inhalation of selective C-fiber stimulants leads to cough only in conscious animals. In clinical studies, inhalation of a low concentration of a C-fiber stimulant causes an irritating, itchy urge-to-cough sensation that mimics the urge-to-cough sensations associated with respiratory tract infection, post-infection, gastroesophageal reflux disorders, and inflammatory airway diseases. Here we discuss the recent advances in sensory neurobiology that allow for the targeting of vagal C-fibers for novel antitussive therapy. No attempts are made to be all-inclusive with respect to the numerous possible molecular targets being considered to accomplish this goal. Rather, two general strategies are discussed: decreasing generator potential amplitude and decreasing the efficiency by which a generator potential evokes action-potential discharge. For the first category we focus on two targets, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and transient receptor potential A1. For the latter category we focus on recent advances in voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channel biology.

### Methods of cough assessment [^5ef884de]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

The accurate and consistent assessment of cough is essential not only for optimum standards of clinical care but also to drive forward advances in our understanding of cough. A range of tools for the subjective and objective measurement of cough exists, and their ongoing development has coincided with growth in clinical and preclinical research in cough, resulting in novel findings and promising new treatments. The most widely used and most fruitful approaches to assessing cough are discussed, along with some newer and preliminary techniques and directions for the future. These include methods for measuring cough-specific quality of life, subjective severity, cough frequency, intensity, and sensitivity of the underlying cough reflex. Ongoing development and more widespread adoption of cough assessment tools should help describe the heterogeneity of cough phenotypes, and may better guide treatment by enabling prediction of responses to pharmacological and nonpharmacological antitussive therapies. More detailed assessments of cough may also bring benefits in measuring the transmission of respiratory infections, or in managing reduced airway protection in neuromuscular disease. Population-wide assessments should also help understand the epidemiology of cough and assist in screening for disease.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^6a67db86]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Novel therapeutic agents—there are now numerous targets for novel therapeutic agents in UCC, including peripheral targets, the brainstem, and the cerebral cortex, but the optimal site to target is not known; in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), a TRPV1 antagonist produced a significant reduction in capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity without changes in cough severity or quality of life.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^5d23f2f1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

CC is a burdensome condition that is thought to be characterized by dysregulation of the vagal sensory neurons that mediate cough. Several molecular targets have been investigated on the basis of their potential roles in the underlying pathophysiology of RCC and UCC. Although results to date have varied between investigative approaches and there are currently no new approved treatments with indications for these conditions, promising results have been reported for some investigated pharmacologic treatments. Owing to the heterogeneity underlying chronic cough, it is likely that the best therapeutic approach will vary by patient and further multidisciplinary research is needed to establish the best treatment pathways for this patient population.

### A register-based study: cough-a frequent phenomenon in the adult population [^2023117c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is one of the most common reasons for contact with the primary health sector. Cough may be present as an acute, subacute or a chronic condition, where the latter may be very disturbing for the patients and difficult to treat for the medical staff.

Coughing is a normal physiological process; it is a protective reflex that clears debris and secretions from the airways. The cough reflex consists of an afferent sensory limb and the central processing centre, activating the efferent limb. The afferent nerves involved are the vagal nerve and it’s sensory branches. These cough important sensory nerves are found from the pharynx to the terminal bronchioles; most are located in the larynx, carina and bifurcation of the larger bronchi. The signal that irritants are present in the bronchial system is mediated to the cough centre in the brainstem. The efferent pathways are then mediated back to the respiratory tract through the vagal, phrenic and spinal motor nerves. This causes activity in the respiratory muscles, with closure of the vocal cords and activation of the bronchial smooth muscles. This mechanism is present in cough as a protective mechanism, in cough as a symptom of underlying conditions, and as a reflex which has become dysregulated. Chronic cough is often, but not always, associated with different co-morbidities both in the respiratory area, but also outside the thorax. The most common underlying conditions in patients with chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome, chronic eosinophilic bronchitis, asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Coughing is a well-known side effect of treatment with ACE-inhibitors as up to 20% of the patients treated with an ACE-inhibitor reported coughing as a side effect, which can lead to treatment termination.

The true prevalence of chronic cough in the clinical setting, either as an unexplained symptom or as a refractory symptom in relation to a co-morbidity, is not known, since cough seldom is registered in a patient registry as a secondary diagnosis or a co-morbidity, when other diseases are present.

Cough in population studies is often registered as part of the questionnaire based respiratory symptoms of chronic bronchitis, where cough might be the only symptom present. In a Danish population survey, self-reported chronic cough has been found to have a prevalence of 4% among never-smokers and 8% in a subgroup of current smokers. The frequency of cough in a European study was estimated to be 12.7%, indicating geographic differences but possibly also a difference in methodology of recording and definition of cough).

Bronchopulmonary C-fibers—key properties include that the majority of bronchopulmonary vagal afferent nerves are unmyelinated C-fibers; in addition to their conduction velocity (< 2 m/s), airway vagal afferent C-fibers are distinguished from lung stretch receptors by relative insensitivity to mechanical stimulation and lung inflation; they are sensitive to bradykinin and activators of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and other inflammatory mediators and environmental irritants that somewhat selectively activate bronchopulmonary C-fibers include prostaglandin E2, ozone, nicotine, adenosine, and serotonin.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^690a284e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the clinical relevance of somatically evoked cough or UTC in a real-life population of adult patients with chronic cough referred to a tertiary care centre in Italy. These results confirm previous observations,,regarding a high percentage of SPC+ individuals among chronic coughers (particularly females), the anatomical distribution of SPCs in the upper trunk and neck, and the characteristics of the evoked responses. More importantly, symptom-driven treatments of cough-associated symptoms almost invariably resulted in a marked reduction of symptoms other than cough itself in both SPC+ and SPC− patients. However, SPC+ patients failed to display a consistent reduction in cough score over the 6-month follow-up period. Furthermore, in the latter the percentage of non-responsive patients turned out to be almost three times higher than in the SPC− subgroup.

Sensitisation of peripheral and central neural pathways mediating cough is considered the fundamental mechanism underlying the cough hypersensitivity syndrome. Previous clinical studies in patients with chronic cough have implicated sensitisation of the vagal sensory pathway for coughing evoked by maximal expulsive respiratory efforts,,and probing of the external acoustic meatus.Our finding of a large prevalence of SPCs among patients with chronic cough suggests the role of a central sensitisation mechanism also facilitating the cough reflex.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a preponderance of females complaining from chronic cough in the general population.In addition, females have a heightened sensitivity of the cough reflex in response to tussigenic challenges with variable chemical agents.Objective recordings of cough frequency in outpatients also point to a lower threshold for the cough reflex in females. In addition, females also display lower pain thresholds and are more likely to develop chronic pain than males. In keeping with the findings, recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown greater activation of the somatosensory cortex in response to low-intensity tussigenic stimuli in healthy females.We found an even more marked prevalence of females among patients who are SPC, suggesting higher degrees of central cough facilitation in this subgroup of female chronic coughers. We also observed a high proportion of patients who reported reflux and nasal symptoms; of note, these were similarly distributed in both the SPC+ and SPC− subgroups.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f13c81fd]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Bronchopulmonary C-fibers and a subset of mechanically sensitive, acid-sensitive myelinated sensory nerves play essential roles in regulating cough. These vagal sensory nerves terminate primarily in the larynx, trachea, carina, and large intrapulmonary bronchi. Other bronchopulmonary sensory nerves, sensory nerves innervating other viscera, as well as somatosensory nerves innervating the chest wall, diaphragm, and abdominal musculature regulate cough patterning and cough sensitivity. The responsiveness and morphology of the airway vagal sensory nerve subtypes and the extrapulmonary sensory nerves that regulate coughing are described. The brainstem and higher brain control systems that process this sensory information are complex, but our current understanding of them is considerable and increasing. The relevance of these neural systems to clinical phenomena, such as urge to cough and psychologic methods for treatment of dystussia, is high, and modern imaging methods have revealed potential neural substrates for some features of cough in the human.

NEUROBIOLOGY OF PROTECTIVE AND PATHOLOGIC COUGH

Protective cough

Cough is needed to prevent aspiration and facilitate the clearance of foreign bodies, irritants, and excess secretions from the airways. 16, 17 This typically occurs reflexively by activation of airway sensory fibers that arise from the nodose (inferior) or jugular (superior) ganglia of the vagus nerve and terminate peripherally near the epithelium in the larynx, trachea, and large intrapulmonary bronchi and centrally in the brain stem (Figure 1a–c). 16, 17, 18 Two distinct subtypes of vagal afferent fibers are thought to be the primary mediators of the cough response. Aδ‐fibers, originally referred to as “cough receptors,” are axons of myelinated neurons that are sensitive to punctate mechanical stimulation (touch) and rapid acidification but relatively insensitive to other chemical stimuli. 16, 17, 18 Because of this responsiveness to mechanical stimuli, Aδ‐fibers are thought to play a critical role in mediating the protective cough reflex in response to foreign body aspiration and excessive secretions. In contrast to Aδ‐fibers, C‐fibers are unmyelinated and express receptors that enable them to respond to a wide array of chemical stimuli, including capsaicin, bradykinin, ozone, allyl isothiocyanate, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), adenosine, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotine, and many cytokines. 17 Characterization of airway Aδ‐fibers and C‐fibers has predominantly been performed in preclinical species (e.g. guinea pigs and mice), though immunohistochemical research using biopsies from humans have revealed comparable nerve terminal structures in the airway mucosa. 19 Additionally, the ability of humans to functionally respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli suggests that functionally equivalent receptors are most likely also present in human airways. 20

### Pharmacology of airway afferent nerve activity [^46e23ff9]. Respiratory Research (2001). Low credibility.

Afferent nerves in the airways serve to regulate breathing pattern, cough, and airway autonomic neural tone. Pharmacologic agents that influence afferent nerve activity can be subclassified into compounds that modulate activity by indirect means (e.g. bronchial smooth muscle spasmogens) and those that act directly on the nerves. Directly acting agents affect afferent nerve activity by interacting with various ion channels and receptors within the membrane of the afferent terminals. Whether by direct or indirect means, most compounds that enter the airspace will modify afferent nerve activity, and through this action alter airway physiology.

Upper airway TRPM8 activation and menthol—cough modulation is characterized by soothing, counterirritant effects localized to upper airway afferents, with little TRPM8 expression in lower airway nerves, and activation that reduces cough responsiveness in animals and humans and may reduce cough frequency in acute cough. Menthol and related compounds may act by activating transient receptor potential M8 (TRPM8); unlike TRPV1/TRPA1 nociceptors, TRPM8 activation is soothing. Molecular analyses show prominent TRPM8 expression in trigeminally innervated upper airways and that some TRPM8+ nasal afferents do not coexpress TRPV1 or TRPA1.

### Occupational, environmental, and irritant-induced cough [^cb329c87]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Occupational and environmental irritants play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic cough. An irritant is a non-corrosive chemical, which causes a reversible inflammatory change on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The clinical and pathologic spectrum of chemically induced respiratory tract irritation ranges from neurogenically mediated alterations in regional blood flow, mucus secretion, and airway caliber to the initiation of cough. In an evolutionary perspective, two types of cough reflexes were created for different protective purposes, but each type used the same anatomic and physiologic neural and muscular structures. The mechanosensory type evolved as human ancestors adapted phonation over olfaction and the larynx moved in close proximity to the esophageal opening. The chemosensory type evolved to protect against an injured lung from a respiratory tract infection or after inhaling high levels of irritant gases and particulates that accumulated in confined quarters of early times. For this latter type of cough reflex, normally quiescent transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels TRPV1(vanilloid) and TRPA1 (ankyrin) become activated or hyperactivated after lung injury, with lung inflammation, or in response to chemicals. Although animal and laboratory investigations support the possibility of human TRPpathies, further investigations are essential for the further elucidation of the role of TRP cationic channels in instigating chronic cough in humans.

### Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on cough reflex and urge-to-cough in healthy young adults [^64f97a62]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

At present, antitussive therapy includes both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. The traditional antitussive drugs mainly include codeine, morphine, gabapentin, pregabalin, amitriptyline, but the efficacy is poor and exhibits adverse effects. Although several studies have focused on identifying new targeted antitussive drugs for the peripheral pathway, however, these new antitussive drugs are mostly in the pre-clinical stage, and their clinical efficacies need to be further confirmed. The existing nonpharmacological therapies mainly include health education, cough suppression, breathing training, vocal hygiene and hydration, psychological counseling, and laryngeal massage. Unfortunately, patients need long-term persistence to have effective therapeutic benefits, and only about half of those patients finally adhered to the treatment. Hence, this study demonstrated a short-term therapeutic intervention strategy by applying anodal tDCS to the rDLPFC to inhibit cough reflex. Moreover, tDCS therapy is cheaper, portable, well-tolerated, and safer. Therefore, this technique may be clinically used as a new therapy to treat chronic cough in the future.

Despite these therapeutic advantages, there are also certain limitations in the study. (1) The subjects were all healthy young adults. Belvisi et al. showed that the reduction in experimentally evoked cough might not reliable to predict the antitussive effects. Hence, whether tDCS can be applied to patients with chronic cough and cough hypersensitivity need further study. (2) Only one cough reflex inhibitory targeted brain region was investigated. Whether other brain regions are involved in cough reflex should be investigated further. (3) The long-term effects of treatment should be investigated.

### Attentional modulation of reflex cough [^d31237e9]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Reflex cough is a defensive response generated in the brainstem in response to chemical and mechanical stimulation of the airways. However, converging evidence shows that reflex cough is also influenced by central neural control processes. In this study, we investigate whether reflex cough can be modulated by attentional focus on either external stimuli or internal cough-related stimuli.

Methods

Healthy volunteers (N = 24; seven men; age range, 18-25 years) completed four blocks of citric acid-induced cough challenges while, simultaneously, auditory stimuli were presented. Within each block, four concentrations were administered (30, 100, 300 and 1,000 mM, randomized). During two subsequent blocks, participants focused their attention externally (counting tones). During the other two blocks, participants focused their attention internally (counting coughs). The order of attentional focus was counterbalanced across participants. Ratings of the urge to cough were collected after each challenge. Cough frequency was determined by audio recording.

Results

Cough frequency was higher when participants focused their attention internally vs externally (P < .05). Also urge to cough was greater during internal vs external focus (P < .05), but the effect was smaller in later blocks of trials.

Conclusions

Reflex cough can be modulated by attentional focus. Internally focused attention may be a mechanism involved in excessive (idiopathic) cough, while an external focus may be introduced as part of treatments targeting excessive cough.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^26024378]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we have shown how SPCs reflect a condition that is commonest among patients whose cough is little responsive or unresponsive to symptom-driven treatments, i.e. those who are currently diagnosed as suffering from difficult-to-treat forms of chronic cough, such as refractory or unexplained chronic cough.Consequently, the assessment of SPCs could help to identify patients eligible for treatments specifically conceived for these forms of chronic cough. Future studies, also involving brain function imaging techniques, would help to clarify the neural substrates implicated in the genesis of the somatic points for cough.

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^d82af6a4]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chemical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli can trigger the opening of specific ion channels expressed by the terminals of vagal sensory nerves, which in turn induces a membrane depolarization known as a “generator potential.” 21 Generator potentials of sufficient magnitude stimulate the opening of voltage‐gated sodium channels, leading to action potentials and sensory nerve activation. The majority of chemical mediators that evoke generator potentials act via ionotropic receptors (e.g. transient receptor potential vanilloid‐1 (TRPV1) and P2X receptors), which consist of ion channels that are opened in response to binding specific ligands such as capsaicin or ATP. 21, 22 Sensory nerve excitability can also be affected by ligands binding to G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which then gate ion channels or increase or decrease the responsiveness to ionotropic‐receptor activation through complex signaling pathways. 21, 22

Experiments in preclinical species have demonstrated that airway sensory nerve activation results in an action potential being carried along the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS) via projections to the brain stem nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) and paratrigeminal nucleus. 23, 24 Release of neurotransmitters at synapses between these projecting neurons and second‐order brain stem neurons can lead to activation of projections to other brain stem nuclei involved in cough generation or higher brain regions involved in cough perception and descending modulatory control (Figure 1a,c). 16, 17, 24, 25, 26 Central neurotransmission by vagal afferent neurons is predominantly mediated by glutamatergic signaling through non– N ‐methyl‐‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, although other transmitters (e.g. substance P, neurokinin A, γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), and ATP) and NMDA receptors can also play a role. 17, 23, 25 Ultimately, activation of these pathways can lead to involuntary cough reflexes, an urge to cough that may evoke voluntary cough, or behavioral controls that may lead to cough facilitation or suppression. 24, 26

### Mechanisms and rationale for targeted therapies in refractory and unexplained chronic cough [^9d5888b9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
The anatomical and molecular mediators of cough. (a) The cough cascade can be triggered in the airway by activation of vagal sensory neurons originating from the jugular and nodose ganglia. Airway sensory nerve activation results in an action potential being carried along the vagus nerve to the central nervous system via projections to the brain stem, specifically at the nTS and the Pa5. Release of neurotransmitters by these primary afferents can activate reflex pathways controlling respiratory muscles to evoke involuntary cough and/or second‐order neurons projecting to higher brain regions that evoke behavioral cough or sensations of an urge to cough. (b) Stimulation and activation of airway sensory neurons. Ion channels expressed by vagal sensory nerves respond to various chemical and mechanical stimuli to trigger depolarization of the plasma membrane. Influx of calcium may trigger sensory nerves to release neuropeptides. One action of neuropeptides may be to bind to receptors on epithelial cells (e.g. NK‐1), inducing release of proinflammatory mediators. Ion channels can also be found on airway epithelial cells, where stimulation can lead to calcium influx that triggers release of inflammatory mediators that may perpetuate further sensory nerve activation. Although the underlying mechanisms are not precisely known, ATP can be released through pannexin channels and activate P2X3 channels, leading to cell depolarization. Cumulative depolarization of a sufficient magnitude can trigger the opening of NaVs expressed by sensory nerves, leading to generation of an action potential carried through the vagus nerve to the central nervous system. (c) Action potentials carried by vagal afferents can trigger the release of glutamate to activate postsynaptic brain stem neurons via NMDA receptors. These afferent neurons may also release substance P, which can bind to NK‐1 receptors and propagate the signal leading to cough. α7 nAChR agonists may play a role in cough via expression on separate neurons which, when activated, release GABA to inhibit the postsynaptic brain stem neuron, thereby halting the cough cascade. The actual CNS sites of action of therapies for chronic cough may be different and more complex than depicted, and the mechanism of action in chronic cough for some therapies (e.g. gabapentin, amitriptyline/nortriptyline) are not currently well known.

### Prostaglandin esensitizes the cough reflex centrally via EP3 receptor-dependent activation of NaV 1.8 channels [^2ffb4d8c]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study we show, using a conscious guinea pig model of cough, that acute exposure to PGE 2, via the central route, results in sensitization of the cough reflex which is mediated via EP3 receptor-dependent activation of NaV 1.8 channels but independently of TRPV1, TRPA1 or TTX-sensitive channel activation.

Inflammatory mediators have been reported to play a role in the sensitization of cough, at both peripheral and central levels. Elucidating the mechanism by which this is achieved will not only result in better understanding of the cough mechanisms but will also result in identification of novel targets for cough therapy.

Our data show that acute exposure to PGE 2, via the i.c.v route, resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the citric acid-induced cough. The enhancement effect of PGE 2 was observed shortly after its administration and occurs over the same time frame seen with other inflammatory mediators such as NGF and BK. These findings show that PGE 2 plays a role in the central sensitization of the cough reflex, in agreement with both clinical and preclinical studies which show that PGE 2 (peripheral) can sensitize the cough reflex/airway vagal nerves. Our findings are also in line with studies in the pain field where PGE 2 is reported to be involved in the central mechanisms that underlie the sensitization of pain pathways leading to hyperalgesia. For example, both intrathecal (i.t.) and i.c.v. administration of PGE 2 result in a dose-dependent enhancement of the sensitivity to pain in mice and rats.

The specific site in the brainstem where PGE 2 acts to enhance the cough reflex has not been determined in this study. However, several studies have previously identified the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS) as a likely site. For example, the enhanced release of several excitatory mediators of the synaptic transmission in the nTS such as glutamate and SP is proposed to result in synaptic plasticity and central sensitization of the cough reflex [,–]. Conversely, the injection of neurokinin1 (NK1) or glutamate receptor antagonists, AP-5 and CNQX, into this brain region has been reported to inhibit cough. Nuclei such as paratrigeminal nucleus (Pa5) may also be involved, not only as a relay point for the airway nerves, but also as a site for sensitization of the airway input signal.

### Allergen challenge increases capsaicin-evoked cough responses in patients with allergic asthma [^894ff2ff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is a common and troublesome symptom in asthmatic patients, but little is known about the neuronal pathways that trigger cough. The mechanisms by which airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and variable airflow obstruction cause cough are unclear.

Objective

We sought to investigate the effects of allergen exposure on cough reflex sensitivity.

Methods

We performed a 9-visit, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study comparing cough responses to inhaled capsaicin in patients with mild atopic asthma after allergen challenge compared with diluent control. Full-dose capsaicin challenge was performed at screening to determine the capsaicin dose inducing a half-maximal response, which was subsequently administered at 30 minutes and 24 hours after inhaled allergen/diluent challenge. Spontaneous coughing was measured for 24 hours after allergen/diluent. Methacholine challenge and sputum induction were performed before and after allergen/diluent challenge.

Results

Twelve steroid-naive subjects completed the study (6 female subjects; mean age, 34.8 years). Allergen inhalation caused both an early (mean ± SD, 38.2% ± 13.0%) and late (mean ± SD, 23.7% ± 13.2%) decrease in FEV 1 and an increase in sputum eosinophil counts 24 hours later (after diluent: median, 1.9% [interquartile range, 0.8% to 5.8%]; after allergen: median, 14.9% [interquartile range, 8.9% to 37.3%]; P = .005). There was also an increase in capsaicin-evoked coughs after allergen exposure compared with diluent at both 30 minutes (geometric mean coughs, 21.9 [95% CI, 16.5-29.20] vs 12.1 [95% CI, 8.3-17.7]; P < .001) and 24 hours (geometric mean coughs, 16.1 [95% CI, 11.3-23.0] vs 9.8 [95% CI, 6.1-15.8]; P = .001). Allergen exposure was also associated with an increase in spontaneous coughs over 24 hours.

Conclusion

Allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway eosinophilia result in increased cough reflex sensitivity to capsaicin associated with an increase in 24-hour spontaneous coughing.

Neuroplasticity and changes in central transmission (central sensitization)

It has also been proposed that changes in central transmission, rather than peripheral transmission alone, may promote CC. 17, 36 Imaging in humans has revealed differences in central processing, particularly in the midbrain, in these patients in response to chemical stimuli. 36 Patients with CC exhibit some features consistent with central sensitization, a process also observed in patients with chronic pain. 16, 24 Central sensitization may underly the chronicity of CC, as central sensitization can persist long beyond the original injury and inflammation that induced the sensitization. However, the exact role of central sensitization and any underlying mechanisms in humans with CC are currently unclear. Substance P is thought to play a role in the increased excitability of CNS neurons in airway disease, including pathologic cough. 35 However, it is unlikely that a single CNS target underlies this central dysregulation, as evidence in chronic pain indicates more complex changes in central glial cells, second‐order neuron sensitivity, and altered descending central pathways may all be involved. 37, 38

Pathologic cough responses

Chronic cough is thought to arise from dysregulation of the vagal sensory nerves that mediate cough. The causative factors that contribute to this dysregulation are the subject of intense investigation and could include both pathologic processes and genetic risk factors. Here, we focus our discussion on the pathologic processes as the potential roles of genetic factors that may influence this dysregulation are not currently well understood and are considered outside the scope of the current review.

The clinical characteristics of patients with CC have been previously described. Many patients with CC may exhibit features of hypersensitivity that are analogous to mechanisms that underly chronic pain. 17, 24, 27 For example, many patients with CC exhibit laryngeal paresthesia, often reported as an abnormal sensation or irritability in the throat. 27, 28, 29 Hypertussivity, which could be analogous to hyperalgesia, is characterized by stronger cough reactions in response to tussive agents. 24, 27 Allotussia occurs when low‐level stimuli that do not usually evoke cough (e.g. talking, singing, and laughing) lead to a strong urge to cough, a feature similar to allodynia. 27, 28, 29 Such features are sufficiently typical in CC that the term “cough hypersensitivity syndrome” has been endorsed to describe this condition. 24

Multiple interrelated mechanisms have been hypothesized to contribute to cough hypersensitivity syndrome, although direct evidence for neural dysfunction in humans is currently limited. 24, 29 These mechanisms include increased activation or excitability of sensory neurons to chemical stimulation in the periphery or the heighted responsivity of CNS cough networks to peripheral inputs, respectively termed peripheral and central sensitization. The current state‐of‐the art mechanistic understanding of these two processes are described below.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f25f96bc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Cough physiology and pathophysiology—conclusions emphasize that chronic cough is more often encountered as a clinical problem in older women and that physicians should recognize comorbidities when managing troublesome cough. Conditions associated with impairment in the nervous or muscular systems may contribute to deficits in cough mechanics, the consequences of which in some cases can be predicted by assessing cough peak flow (CPF) and other measures, and airway secretion properties may impact cough efficiency. Respiratory maneuvers and devices can augment CPF, whereas medications can modify the physical properties of secretions, and these approaches may be of particular help with cough efficiency in some patients, especially with neuromuscular weakness or with difficulty in sputum expectoration. Cough testing approaches vary greatly in the type of cough measured and reported measures, with most studies reporting CPF only, and in populations with ineffective cough there is reduced cough output as opposed to the hypersensitive, increased output seen with chronic cough. The focus with these populations is evaluating the ability to effectively clear the airways, there is critical need to develop therapeutic techniques with this goal, yet despite many airway clearance devices and medications there are few well-controlled randomized controlled trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness, and the design and delivery of such trials remain a priority. A heightened cough reflex sensitivity in women is widely reported but poorly understood, and creating normative values and a standardized methodology for CPF and other clinically meaningful cough metrics represent important knowledge gaps.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^672bb63e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting longer than 8 weeks, is a common condition that affects 4–10% of adults worldwide.Patients with chronic cough who have never smoked are often diagnosed as having asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway cough syndrome.Although the majority of patients can benefit from treatment of the associated conditions, it is increasingly recognised that cough does not improve with such treatments in a large percentage of patients; these patients are commonly classified as having refractory chronic cough. In a minority of patients with chronic cough, no clear cause can be established, and these patients are considered to be suffering from unexplained chronic cough.

Patients with chronic cough typically report an irritating sensation in the throat and experience cough peals provoked by stimuli such as laughing, strong smells and changes in external temperature that are innocuous for the normal population.These clinical features point to a sensory dysregulation that some authors have considered as a separate clinical condition and termed “cough hypersensitivity syndrome”.Sensitisation of peripheral and/or central neural pathways involved in cough mediation may account for the diverse clinical presentations of chronic cough.Sensory dysregulation may also explain another clinical feature of chronic coughers which often makes patients complain of an urge-to-cough (UTC) or overt coughing in response to mechanical stimuli that operate on discrete areas of the neck and upper trunk.While this form of sensory dysregulation is frequent,, to ascertain this, we set out to investigate, in an unselected population of chronic coughers, the prevalence and clinical relevance of somatically evoked cough,, i.e. the cough and/or the sensation of an UTC triggered by mechanical stimuli, namely finger pressure, on regions of the upper chest and neck. We have hypothesised that chronic coughers with somatically evoked cough present different clinical outcomes compared to patients who are devoid of this sensory dysregulation.

### Internal senses of the vagus nerve [^1d1e0c98]. Neuron (2022). Medium credibility.

The vagus nerve is an indispensable body-brain connection that controls vital aspects of autonomic physiology like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and gut motility, reflexes like coughing and swallowing, and survival behaviors like feeding, drinking, and sickness responses. Classical physiological studies and recent molecular/genetic approaches have revealed a tremendous diversity of vagal sensory neuron types that innervate different internal organs, with many cell types remaining poorly understood. Here, we review the state of knowledge related to vagal sensory neurons that innervate the respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. We focus on cell types and their response properties, physiological/behavioral roles, engaged neural circuits and, when possible, sensory receptors. We are only beginning to understand the signal transduction mechanisms used by vagal sensory neurons and upstream sentinel cells, and future studies are needed to advance the field of interoception to the level of mechanistic understanding previously achieved for our external senses.

### Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 and airway sensory afferent activation: role of adenosine triphosphate [^83b3ad83]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sensory nerves innervating the airways play an important role in regulating various cardiopulmonary functions, maintaining homeostasis under healthy conditions and contributing to pathophysiology in disease states. Hypo-osmotic solutions elicit sensory reflexes, including cough, and are a potent stimulus for airway narrowing in asthmatic patients, but the mechanisms involved are not known. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 (TRPV4) is widely expressed in the respiratory tract, but its role as a peripheral nociceptor has not been explored.

Objective

We hypothesized that TRPV4 is expressed on airway afferents and is a key osmosensor initiating reflex events in the lung.

Methods

We used guinea pig primary cells, tissue bioassay, in vivo electrophysiology, and a guinea pig conscious cough model to investigate a role for TRPV4 in mediating sensory nerve activation in vagal afferents and the possible downstream signaling mechanisms. Human vagus nerve was used to confirm key observations in animal tissues.

Results

Here we show TRPV4-induced activation of guinea pig airway–specific primary nodose ganglion cells. TRPV4 ligands and hypo-osmotic solutions caused depolarization of murine, guinea pig, and human vagus and firing of Aδ-fibers (not C-fibers), which was inhibited by TRPV4 and P2X3 receptor antagonists. Both antagonists blocked TRPV4-induced cough.

Conclusion

This study identifies the TRPV4-ATP-P2X3 interaction as a key osmosensing pathway involved in airway sensory nerve reflexes. The absence of TRPV4-ATP–mediated effects on C-fibers indicates a distinct neurobiology for this ion channel and implicates TRPV4 as a novel therapeutic target for neuronal hyperresponsiveness in the airways and symptoms, such as cough.

### Neurokinin-1 receptor inhibition and cough [^8b4acdf1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a need for better treatment for cough. Unexplained or chronic refractory cough (CRC) is the focus of several recent and ongoing large drug trials, with particular interest in antagonists of ATP-stimulated P2X receptors. Although such drugs appear very promising, there are nonresponders, and side effects may be unacceptable to some. Hence, a requirement for alternative approaches, not only for CRC but also for cough associated with chronic and incurable diseases of the lung, such as lung cancer, is needed. In this issue of the Journal, Smith and colleagues (pp.) present their findings on aprepitant for cough in non–radically treatable lung cancer, which, considering the current need, are very welcome.

Aprepitant is an antagonist of NK1 (neurokinin 1), a G protein–coupled receptor triggered by the ligand Substance P (SP). NK1 receptors are present in the central and peripheral nervous system as well in other tissues, with apparently varied physiological functions. Of note is the possible involvement of SP in sensory disorders, including overactive bladder and chronic itch. An important role of NK1 in cough has also been postulated. Within the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brain stem, there have been repeated observations in animal models of the activity of SP and NK1 inhibition on the cough reflex. Vagal afferent C fibers in the airway appear to produce SP, and selective NK1 antagonism specifically blocks C fiber–dependent coughing in guinea pigs. In humans with respiratory disease, inhaled SP can induce cough.

### Neural correlates of cough hypersensitivity in humans: evidence for central sensitisation and dysfunctional inhibitory control [^1bf9315a]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic non-productive coughing is a major complication of pulmonary disease and can also occur in many individuals without identifiable underlying pathology. The common clinical link in patients with cough is an enhanced sensitivity of the respiratory system to stimuli that subsequently evoke excessive coughing. The aetiology of this 'cough hypersensitivity syndrome' is unclear but believed to involve hypersensitivity of the sensory neural pathways that innervate the airways and lungs.

Methods

In the present study, we used functional brain imaging to compare central neural responses to airway stimulation using inhaled capsaicin in healthy people and patients with cough hypersensitivity.

Results

Hypersensitivity in response to inhaled capsaicin coincided with elevated neural activity in the midbrain in a region encompassing the nucleus cuneiformis (left: p<0.001; right: p<0.001) and periaqueductal gray (p=0.008) in comparison to normal sensitivity in controls. The enhanced activity noted in the midbrain is similar to that occurring in patients with chronic pain, thus providing empirical evidence to support the notion that cough and pain share neurobiological similarities. Furthermore, patients with cough hypersensitivity displayed difficulty controlling their cough, which manifested as a failure to suppress cough during capsaicin challenge (ie, reduced cough frequency) in controls compared with patients with cough hypersensitivity (p=0.046). Cough suppression was associated with reduced activity in a forebrain network that included the dorsomedial prefrontal and anterior mid-cingulate cortices. Additionally, cough frequency was correlated with activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus (R(2)=0.6, p<0.001) and right anterior insula (R(2)=0.6, p<0.001), regions previously implicated in voluntary cough suppression.

Conclusions

These findings provide insight into the central neurobiology of cough hypersensitivity and suggest that both central amplification of cough sensory inputs and reduced capacity to suppress cough motor behaviours define patients with problematic cough.

### Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on cough reflex and urge-to-cough in healthy young adults [^29a07226]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique to regulate the activity of cerebral cortical neurons. It can modulate neural plasticity and regulate cerebral cortex function by applying mild direct current to the scalp through one or two electrodes placed thereon. Anodal stimulation can induce neuronal depolarization, thus improving the excitability of the cortical neurons, while cathodal stimulation exerts exactly the reverse effects. tDCS has been broadly used in various clinical fields. For example, Bornheim et al. applied tDCS to stroke patients by inducing anodal stimulation at stroke lesions in the primary motor cortex. Therapeutically, the patient receives tDCS intervention (2 mA, 20 min) 5 times per week for 4 weeks, combined with traditional rehabilitation treatment. It has been found that the motor and somatosensory functions of stroke patients significantly improve after tDCS therapy. Moreover, Suntrup-Krueger et al. applied tDCS, with a current intensity of 1 mA for 20 min each time, to the contralesional motor cortical areas in stroke patients with acute dysphagia. The results showed significant improvement in swallowing function after tDCS intervention for four consecutive days.

Whether the cough reflex and urge-to-cough sensitivity of subjects can be modulated by tDCS intervention remains unclear to date. Studies have shown that tDCS can significantly improve swallowing dysfunction and pain, since the cough reflex, swallowing reflex, and pain mechanism operate under the same central regulatory hub in the brain. Thus, we speculated that tDCS might influence individual’s cough reflex. Furthermore, studies have shown that right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) brain activity is simultaneously induced when the individual’s urge-to-cough decreases, suggesting that rDLPFC may play a vital role in the inhibitory pathway of cough symptoms. Similarly, the placebo analgesia studies reported elevated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting an essential role the region may play in regulating sensorimotor responses in the brain. To date, there is no study exploring the effects of tDCS on rDLPFC stimulation related to cough reflex sensitivity. In this study, two stimulation protocols, anodal and cathodal stimulation, were followed to conduct the investigation on the rDLPFC with sham stimulation used as a control to reveal the effects of the two different tDCS modes on the cough reflex and urge-to-cough sensitivities.

### Risk of aspiration pneumonia and hospital mortality in parkinson disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e0c018fb]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, PD increases the risk of AP through respiratory muscle weakness and an impaired cough reflex. PD patients often experience respiratory muscle weakness, which is attributed to the accumulation of alpha‐synuclein in the medulla oblongata, leading to dysfunction of the respiratory centre. This weakness can result in inadequate control of respiratory muscles and impaired airway protection, especially during swallowing. Additionally, PD patients may have an impaired cough reflex, which is thought to be due to expiratory muscle weakness secondary to a reduction in central neural drive. This reduction in neural drive can affect the cough reflex before progressing to involve sensory pathways, resulting in an airway that is less well protected from aspirates entering the conducting system of the respiratory system.

Other key factors that could lead to PD patients having greater risk of AP include postural instability, poor mobility, and side effects of PD medications. Postural instability in PD patients is caused by deficits in dopaminergic neurons, degeneration of the cholinergic system, and comorbid white matter disease. This instability can make it difficult for patients to sit or stand upright, increasing the risk of aspiration when lying down, as lying down alters the position of the larynx and epiglottis, reducing the effectiveness of the epiglottis valve. PD medications, such as anticholinergics, can also contribute to the risk of aspiration with increased sedation and cognitive impairments, which has been linked to a higher risk of AP. All of these are further compounded by the effects of aging. Another potentially preventable factor includes inappropriate assisted feeding and/or poor habits in executing swallowing, where food particles get pooled at the back of the tongue or the posterior pharyngeal space.

### Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on cough reflex and urge-to-cough in healthy young adults [^aa1513af]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic cough is prevalent in the clinic. The existing therapies are mostly limited to medical treatment, with poor curative effects and serious side effects. Studies have suggested that the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) may play an active role in the inhibitory pathway of cough elicitation. Thus, this study explored the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the rDLPFC activation in relation to cough reflex and urge-to-cough sensitivity.

Methods

Twenty-three healthy young adults completed the experiment. Participants randomly received tDCS anodal stimulation, cathodal stimulation, and sham stimulation, and the interval between every two stimuli was at least one week. The tDCS (2 mA, 30 min) stimulated brain rDLPFC region. After tDCS intervention, cough reflex threshold and urge-to-cough were evaluated immediately by inhalation of citric acid-saline solution.

Results

Compared with sham stimulation, the cough reflex thresholds logC 2 and logC 5 have increased under tDCS anodal stimulation (1.78 ± 0.55 g/L vs. 1.57 ± 0.57 g/L, p < 0.05; 1.92 ± 0.53 g/L vs. 1.67 ± 0.56 g/L, p < 0.05), accompanied by the increase of the urge-to-cough threshold LogC u (0.76 ± 0.53 g/L vs. 0.47 ± 0.44 g/L, p < 0.05). In contrast, the urge-to-cough sensitivity expressed as UTC slope was not significantly changed (1.21 ± 0.86 point·L/g vs. 1.00 ± 0.37 point·L/g, p > 0.05), and there were no apparent changes in cough reflex thresholds Log C 2 and logC 5, urge-to-cough threshold LogC u, and urge-to-cough sensitivity UTC slope under tDCS cathodal stimulation, compared with sham stimulation.

Conclusions

This study found that anodal tDCS stimulation of rDLPFC could significantly decrease cough reflex sensitivity, accompanied by the increase of urge-to-cough threshold. Further investigations targeting different brain regions using multiple central intervention techniques to explore the underlying mechanisms are warranted.

Trial registration The study protocol was registered for the clinical trial in China (registration number: ChiCTR2100045618)

### Heterogeneity of cough hypersensitivity mediated by TRPV1 and TRPA1 in patients with chronic refractory cough [^277edab2]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The heterogeneity of cough hypersensitivity responses has been reported previously, highlighting differences between chronic refractory cough and other airway conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Thus, patients with COPD exhibited an enhanced cough response to capsaicin with a diminished cough response to PGE 2, while patients with asthma demonstrated an enhanced response to citric acid, and patients with chronic cough showed a heightened response to both capsaicin and citric acid. Our study indicates that there is also heterogeneity of cough hypersensitivity to TRP receptors, even within chronic refractory cough patients. This heterogeneity of cough hypersensitivity might form the basis for various phenotypes of chronic cough.

There is increasing evidence indicating that the pathways underlying the development and persistence of chronic cough are heterogeneous with multiple neural pathways capable of eliciting cough. The adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated P2X3-containing receptors have recently gained attention as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic refractory cough. P2X3 forms homotrimeric P2X3 receptors (consisting of three P2X3 subunits) or P2X2/P2X3 receptors (consisting of two P2X3 subunits and one P2X2 subunit). Selective antagonists of homotrimeric P2X3 receptors seem more promising given that growing evidence suggests that homotrimeric P2X3 receptors are responsible for the hypersensitization of the cough reflex, while inhibition of P2X2/P2X3 receptors are responsible for taste-related side-effects. There is also evidence supporting a role of TRPV4 in physiological and pathophysiological processes of cough. The TRPV4-ATP-P2X3 interaction is a possible contributor to the abnormally upregulated cough reflex since it has been reported that TRPV4 can cause the release of ATP, which in turn acts on sensory nerves expressing P2X3. In addition, a P2X3 receptor antagonist, gefapixant, blocks both P2X3-mediated and TRPV4-mediated cough in patients with chronic refractory cough. We speculate that those patients who did not present hypersensitivity to TRPV1 or TRPA1 agonists might be sensitive to other receptor agonists or antagonists. Further investigations are needed to define the pathways of cough hypersensitivity, particularly in those who are not hypersensitive to both TRPA1 and TRPV1 agonists.

### Cough: new pharmacology [^b50d284b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic coughing has a significant impact on the sufferer's quality of life. Despite this, licensed therapies are currently lacking, and until recently novel efficacious therapies for the treatment of chronic cough have remained elusive. In recent years, a first in class P2X3 antagonist has been found to be efficacious in patients with refractory chronic cough, stimulating much interest in the development of therapies for this problem. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of development of novel therapies acting both in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Most programs are focused on treating patients with refractory chronic cough, but chronic coughing is also a problem in common respiratory diseases in spite of standard care. However, unraveling of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cough will ultimately be needed to identify the relevant drug targets, better characterize patients, and match them to the most appropriate treatments.

### Global physiology and pathophysiology of cough: part 1: cough phenomenology-CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f1e8c94c]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Parkinson disease and cough—motor and sensory changes contribute to disordered cough: underlying causes include slowed and stiff movement of respiratory muscles or obstruction of the upper airway; in early stages, peak airflow of voluntary coughing is reduced compared with healthy control subjects; as disease progresses, sensory changes develop with higher thresholds of irritants required to evoke a cough and reduced perception of urge to cough, potentially due to impaired afferents or disordered integration of sensory and motor signals.
