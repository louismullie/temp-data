## Question

Aortic insufficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about aortic insufficiency (aortic regurgitation). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its pathophysiology. Then, I should classify severity and stage the disease. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including echocardiography and adjunct imaging. After that, I need to appraise medical therapy and its limitations. Then, I will examine surgical indications and timing, including special scenarios like acute AR and mixed lesions. I should also consider transcatheter options and their constraints. Finally, I will integrate surveillance, multidisciplinary care, and synthesize a practical decision framework with attention to controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Aortic regurgitation is retrograde flow from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, causing volume overload, eccentric hypertrophy, and progressive remodeling; over time, afterload mismatch and myocardial fibrosis emerge, culminating in heart failure if unchecked [^1132VAx1] [^115u3umQ]. Hold on, I should verify the staging framework: ACC/AHA stages A through D map risk, progressive, severe asymptomatic, and symptomatic disease, integrating valve anatomy, hemodynamics, LV size and function, and symptoms, which guides timing of intervention [^1132VAx1].

> Next, I should review severity grading and staging. Severe AR is typically defined by qualitative and quantitative echocardiographic criteria, including vena contracta width, regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and effective regurgitant orifice area; I need to ensure I anchor these to guideline thresholds and remember that discordance between visual and quantitative measures warrants confirmatory imaging or catheterization [^1159qKWX]. Wait, let me verify the LV size triggers: indexed LV end-systolic dimension greater than 25 mm/m² or absolute LVESD greater than 50 mm are key surgical thresholds in asymptomatic patients with preserved EF, reflecting adverse remodeling and worse outcomes if surgery is delayed [^114ZN6kQ] [^111pSPpf].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy. Transthoracic echocardiography is first-line to define etiology, severity, LV size and function, and aortic dimensions; I should double-check that TTE also informs prognosis and timing of intervention, and that serial assessments are recommended when AR is moderate to severe or LV size is changing [^113VukMx] [^112jYumU]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if TTE is suboptimal or findings are discordant, TEE, CMR, or invasive angiography can clarify severity, volumes, and aortic morphology; CMR is particularly helpful for quantifying regurgitant volume and detecting subtle LV dysfunction when echo is limited [^113VukMx] [^1159qKWX]. I should confirm that exercise testing can unmask symptoms in seemingly asymptomatic patients with severe AR and guide timing of surgery in borderline cases [^115dZmSf].

> Now, medical therapy. I need to ensure I distinguish what treats AR from what treats its consequences. There is no disease-modifying pharmacotherapy that reduces AR severity or slows progression in the absence of systemic hypertension; thus, therapy focuses on blood pressure control and guideline-directed medical therapy for LV dysfunction when present [^111Fn1My]. Wait, let me verify vasodilators: nifedipine and ACE inhibitors have been studied, but results are inconsistent for altering AR severity or delaying surgery, so they are not substitutes for timely intervention in severe AR; they may be used for hypertension control or HF management when surgery is not feasible [^115u3umQ] [^111Fn1My]. I should confirm that in truly prohibitive surgical risk patients with symptoms and/or LVEF 55% or less, GDMT for reduced EF is recommended, recognizing this is palliative rather than curative [^1123xwfE].

> Surgical indications and timing are the crux. Class I indications include symptomatic severe AR regardless of LV function, and asymptomatic severe AR with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55% or less) when no other cause is identified; I should double-check that these remain the backbone of guideline-directed care [^11555br7]. Class 2a indications include asymptomatic severe AR with normal LVEF but severe LV enlargement (LVESD greater than 50 mm or indexed LVESD greater than 25 mm/m²), and AR of any severity when undergoing other cardiac surgery; I need to ensure I cite these correctly [^111pSPpf] [^114ZN6kQ]. But wait, what if EF is drifting toward 55–60% on serial studies or LVEDD is progressively enlarging beyond 65 mm? In carefully selected low-risk patients, early surgery may be considered, though this remains a 2b recommendation and requires shared decision-making and close surveillance [^114ZN6kQ]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence signal: contemporary observational data suggest that waiting for classic triggers may confer an outcome penalty, with worse long-term survival when surgery is delayed until Class I thresholds are met, reinforcing the concept that earlier intervention in selected asymptomatic patients may improve outcomes [^116jnNeG].

> Special scenarios require nuance. In acute severe AR from infective endocarditis or aortic dissection, afterload reduction is temporizing, but surgery should not be delayed, especially with hypotension, pulmonary edema, or low output; I should confirm that intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated in acute severe AR and that beta-blockers must be used cautiously so as not to blunt compensatory tachycardia [^111EDqBx]. For mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation, I need to check that management is typically driven by the predominant lesion, but combined hemodynamic burden can accelerate LV dysfunction, and peak aortic velocity greater than 4.0 m/s suggests severe mixed disease; in such cases, earlier intervention may be reasonable even if individual lesions are not "severe" in isolation [^1132LDYB].

> Transcatheter options are expanding but remain limited for isolated native AR. I should confirm that TAVI for isolated chronic AR is challenging due to large, noncalcified annuli, elliptical root geometry, and high stroke volumes, leading to migration and paravalvular leak; thus, TAVI is not recommended for patients who are surgical candidates and is reserved for carefully selected high or prohibitive risk patients with suitable anatomy and calcification [^1163tGao] [^1157Aot7]. Wait, let me verify the evolving landscape: purpose-built AR devices with leaflet-engaging anchors are under study and have shown encouraging feasibility, but broad adoption awaits robust outcomes data and regulatory approval, so surgical AVR remains the gold standard for most candidates [^1157Aot7].

> Surveillance and multidisciplinary care are essential. I should confirm that asymptomatic severe AR warrants serial echocardiography every 6–12 months, with shorter intervals if LV size or function is changing, and that all patients under consideration for intervention should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary heart valve team to integrate anatomy, risk, and patient preferences [^112jYumU] [^115g18HB]. Hold on, I should verify that this team-based approach improves alignment with guidelines and may mitigate the underuse of indicated AVR seen in real-world cohorts, particularly when primary care providers manage care without cardiology input [^116DJhMH] [^114CPZhN].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, but I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. For symptomatic severe AR, proceed to surgery unless prohibitive risk. For asymptomatic severe AR, operate if LVEF is 55% or less or if there is severe LV enlargement by LVESD criteria. For asymptomatic severe AR with preserved LV function and modest LV size, continue surveillance with close follow-up and consider exercise testing to unmask symptoms or abnormal hemodynamics. For moderate AR, generally observe unless concomitant cardiac surgery is planned, in which case concomitant AVR may be reasonable [^11555br7] [^111pSPpf] [^114ZN6kQ]. I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary outcomes data suggesting excess mortality in conservatively managed asymptomatic moderate-to-severe AR, which supports vigilant surveillance and a low threshold to escalate care when remodeling progresses [^1151TJd1].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps. The optimal timing of surgery in asymptomatic patients with preserved LV function remains debated; while some observational data support earlier intervention before classic triggers, randomized evidence is limited, and guideline thresholds still reflect a conservative stance pending stronger trials [^116jnNeG] [^114g5iA6]. Let me reconsider the role of biomarkers and advanced imaging: CMR-derived volumes, speckle-tracking strain, and composite biomarker-imaging scores may refine risk stratification, but they are not yet incorporated into formal surgical indications, so I should frame them as adjuncts rather than substitutes for guideline criteria [^1157Aot7].

Aortic insufficiency (AI), or aortic regurgitation, is the backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, causing volume overload and progressive left ventricular remodeling [^1132VAx1]. It can be **acute or chronic**, with chronic AI often remaining asymptomatic for years until heart failure develops [^115u3umQ]. Diagnosis relies on **echocardiography** to assess severity, etiology, and ventricular size/function, with cardiac MRI or CT used when echo is inconclusive or to evaluate the aorta [^113VukMx] [^1159qKWX]. Medical therapy is limited to blood pressure control and heart failure management; **definitive treatment is surgical aortic valve replacement** for severe symptomatic AI or when ventricular dysfunction or severe dilation occurs, with transcatheter options reserved for high-risk patients with suitable anatomy [^11555br7] [^113WjqRX]. Prognosis depends on severity and timing of intervention; **early surgery before ventricular dysfunction improves outcomes** [^116jnNeG].

---

## Pathophysiology

AI causes **volume overload** of the left ventricle (LV), leading to eccentric hypertrophy and eventual systolic dysfunction [^1132VAx1]. Chronic AI allows compensatory LV dilation, maintaining stroke volume despite regurgitation; however, persistent overload causes myocardial fibrosis and failure [^115u3umQ]. Acute AI lacks compensation, causing abrupt pulmonary edema and shock [^notfound].

---

## Etiology

AI has diverse causes; **chronic AI** most often results from degenerative valve disease (bicuspid aortic valve, calcific aortic stenosis with regurgitation), aortic root dilation (aneurysm, Marfan, hypertension), or rheumatic heart disease, whereas **acute AI** typically results from infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, or trauma [^1132VAx1].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Chronic AI**: Often asymptomatic for years; when symptomatic, patients develop exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, angina, and palpitations. Physical findings include a widened pulse pressure, bounding pulses, and a high-pitched, decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left sternal border [^115u3umQ].
- **Acute AI**: Sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension, and shock. The murmur may be soft or absent due to rapid equalization of pressures [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: First-line to assess severity, etiology, and LV size/function; severe AI is defined by regurgitant volume ≥ 60 mL, regurgitant fraction ≥ 50%, or effective regurgitant orifice ≥ 0.30 cm² [^notfound].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Useful when echo is inconclusive or to quantify regurgitation and assess LV volumes [^1159qKWX].
- **CT angiography**: Evaluates aortic anatomy, aneurysms, or dissection [^notfound].

---

## Management

### Medical therapy

Medical therapy focuses on **blood pressure control** — using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or calcium channel blockers — and on **heart failure management** with guideline-directed therapy (ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics) for symptomatic patients or those with LV dysfunction [^111Fn1My] [^1123xwfE]. Vasodilators reduce regurgitant volume in chronic AI but do not alter disease progression [^115u3umQ].

---

### Surgical therapy

- **Indications**: Symptomatic severe AI, asymptomatic severe AI with LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 55%) or severe LV dilation (LVESD > 50 mm or indexed > 25 mm/m²), or AI requiring other cardiac surgery [^11555br7] [^111pSPpf].
- **Options**: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is standard; transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is emerging for high-risk patients with suitable anatomy [^1157Aot7] [^113WjqRX].
- **Timing**: Early surgery before irreversible LV dysfunction improves outcomes [^116jnNeG].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by severity and timing of intervention. Severe untreated AI carries **high mortality** and morbidity, whereas **early surgery** improves survival and ventricular function [^116jnNeG]. Acute AI has high mortality without urgent surgery [^notfound].

---

Aortic insufficiency is a valvular disorder causing LV volume overload; **early diagnosis and timely surgical intervention** are critical to preventing heart failure and improving survival [^1157Aot7].

### Management strategies and future challenges for aortic valve disease [^115qBjv9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The management of aortic valve disease has been improved by accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity by echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, efforts to elicit symptoms or objective markers of disease severity and progression, and consideration of optimum timing of aortic valve replacement, even in elderly patients. Prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis is growing in ageing populations. Conventional surgery remains the most appropriate option for most patients who require aortic valve replacement, but the transcatheter approach is established for high-risk patients or poor candidates for surgery. The rapid growth of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been fuelled by improved technology, evidence-based clinical research, and setting up of multidisciplinary heart teams. Aortic regurgitation can be difficult to diagnose and quantify. Left ventricular dysfunction often precedes symptoms, needing active surveillance by echocardiography to determine the optimum time for aortic valve replacement. Development of transcatheter approaches for aortic regurgitation is challenging, owing to the absence of valvular calcification and distortion of aortic root anatomy in many patients.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111uAopi]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The management of severe aortic stenosis mandates consideration of aortic valve intervention for symptomatic patients. However, for asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis, recent randomised trials supported earlier intervention. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate all the available data comparing the two management strategies.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception until 10 January 2022. The search key terms were 'asymptomatic', 'severe aortic stenosis' and 'intervention'.

Results

Meta-analysis of two published randomised trials, AVATAR and RECOVERY, included 302 patients and showed that early intervention resulted in 55% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.86; I² = 0%) and 79% reduction in risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96; I² = 15%). There was no difference in risk of cardiovascular death between the two groups (HR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.78; I² = 78%). Additionally, meta-analysis of eight observational studies showed improved mortality in patients treated with early intervention (HR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; I² = 77%).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis provides evidence that, in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis, early intervention reduces all-cause mortality and improves outcomes compared with conservative management. While this is very encouraging, further randomised controlled studies are needed to draw firm conclusions and identify the optimal timing of intervention.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117G5oCS]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation and family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (ie, asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee, where appropriate. Structure: Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. The is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### Aortic regurgitation: disease progression and management [^115u3umQ]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common valvular heart disease that unless appropriately managed is associated with morbidity and mortality. Left ventricular (LV) mechanics and aortic impedance are the main determinants of outcome in patients with AR and govern clinical management. Mild and moderate AR in individuals with normal LV dimensions are both generally benign. In the absence of symptoms and before LV dimensions increase, even severe AR is not generally associated with increased morbidity or mortality. Once LV enlargement occurs, however, symptoms and/or a decline in ejection fraction can develop, and both represent an indication for surgical intervention. Disease progression occurs at a variable rate, and is often insidious. Hence, symptoms do not correlate with objective evidence of ventricular dysfunction. Exercise testing can help highlight symptoms related to valve dysfunction. Asymptomatic patients with severe AR and preserved LV function can benefit from vasodilator drug therapy. Several agents from this class can reduce AR severity, but results are inconsistent. In this Review, we examine the epidemiology of AR in terms of the interplay between arterial and ventricular forces marking progression of disease over time, and analyze the practice guidelines regarding diagnosis and treatment.

### Surgery for chronic aortic regurgitation: when should it be considered? [^114MDTb7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Deciding when to operate on a patient with chronic aortic regurgitation may be extremely difficult. The timing of surgery requires consideration of the etiology and pathophysiology of the aortic regurgitation, because aortic valve replacement carries morbidity and mortality that must be weighed against the potential problems of continued medical management. Guidelines for the use of surgery in patients with valvular disease have been developed by a joint task force of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Practical recommendations based on these guidelines are presented.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114g5iA6]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

2020 ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — stage B medical therapy emphasizes that in early valvular heart disease (VHD) there are currently no therapies to prevent disease progression in the valve leaflets, so recommendations are directed toward patient monitoring with the intent to intervene once severe disease is present with symptoms or abnormal cardiovascular function. The document highlights inclusion gaps, noting that women and minorities often are underrepresented in clinical trials and calls for directed efforts to include all patient groups with numbers adequate to perform separate data analysis. It notes that, given the relatively low risk of intervention and improved options, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intervention for severe asymptomatic VHD are important and in progress for some conditions, such as severe aortic stenosis (AS), and that clinical equipoise exists for asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR) with normal LV function and a high likelihood of valve repair, and the role of intervention for tricuspid regurgitation (TR); long-term follow-up is needed to ensure the lifetime risks of a prosthetic valve or valve repair are balanced against any benefits attributable to earlier intervention.

Multidisciplinary aortic teams — formal recommendations and thresholds: For patients with acute aortic disease that requires urgent repair, a multidisciplinary team should determine the most suitable intervention (COR 1, LOE C-EO). For patients who are asymptomatic with extensive aortic disease, or who may benefit from complex open and endovascular aortic repairs, or with multiple comorbidities for whom intervention is considered, referral to a high-volume center (performing at least 30–40 aortic procedures annually) with experienced surgeons in a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team is reasonable to optimize treatment outcomes (COR 2a, LOE C-LD).

### Aortic valve and ascending aorta guidelines for management and quality measures: executive summary [^113tPgaJ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines are intended to assist physicians and other health care providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis, management, or prevention of specific diseases or conditions. These guidelines should not be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the same results. Moreover, these guidelines are subject to change over time, without notice. The ultimate judgment regarding the care of a particular patient must be made by the physician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112yjTzn]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelinesand has been submitted and registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022301037). We performed a focused review and meta-analysis of all the randomised trials in the literature comparing aortic valve intervention with conservative management in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis. The primary endpoints of this meta-analysis included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure. Additionally, using the same search results we separated the observational studies and performed a meta-analysis of all the published observational studies comparing outcomes, identified through the same search, between early intervention and conservative management in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, with all-cause mortality being the primary endpoint.

Search strategy

PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception until 10 January 2022. The terms used for the search were 'asymptomatic', 'severe aortic stenosis' and 'intervention'. After removing duplicates, two investigators independently screened the remaining studies at the title/abstract level (VT, CG-C). Randomised controlled studies comparing mortality and clinical outcomes in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis treated with early intervention versus conservative management were included in the meta-analysis. Observational studies that compared mortality between early intervention and conservative management in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis were evaluated separately. The selected studies underwent full-text screening, performed by two independent investigators (VT, CG-C). The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied:

Inclusion criteria

Studies published in English and limited to humans.
Studies with participants > 18 years old.
Randomised controlled studies and observational studies comparing mortality and clinical outcomes in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis treated with early intervention versus conservative management.

Exclusion criteria

Studies published in language other than English.
Studies including patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Conflicts were resolved by discussion with a third investigator (VSV), after which consensus was achieved. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure. The study selection process is shown in online supplemental figure 1.

### Management challenges in patients younger than 65 years with severe aortic valve disease: a review [^111w13ow]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The management of aortic valve disease, including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation (AR), in younger adult patients (age < 65 years) is complex, and the optimal strategy is often unclear, contingent on multiple anatomic and holistic factors.

Observations

Traditional surgical approaches carry significant considerations, including compulsory lifelong anticoagulation for patients who receive a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and the risk of structural valvular deterioration and need for subsequent valve intervention in those who receive a bioprosthetic AVR. These factors are magnified in young adults who are considering pregnancy, for whom issues of anticoagulation and valve longevity are heightened. The Ross procedure has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its adoption is limited to highly specialized centers. Valve repair is an option for selected patients with AR. These treatment options offer varying degrees of durability and are associated with different risks and complications, especially for younger adult patients. Patient-centered care from a multidisciplinary valve team allows for discussion of the optimal timing of intervention and the advantages and disadvantages of the various treatment options.

Conclusions and Relevance

The management of severe aortic valve disease in adults younger than 65 years is complex, and there are numerous considerations with each management decision. While mechanical AVR and bioprosthetic AVR have historically been the standards of care, other options are emerging for selected patients but are not yet generalizable beyond specialized surgical centers. A detailed discussion by members of the multidisciplinary heart team and the patient is an integral part of the shared decision-making process.

### Early aortic valve replacement of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111KTNfS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the one of the most common forms of valvular heart disease, affecting > 3% of adults in developed countries. Between one‐third and one‐half of patients with severe AS are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Previous perspective only supports the relationship between AS symptom onset and sharply decreased survival in untreated disease. However, more recent data have emerged to demonstrate that asymptomatic severe AS may lead to the progression to both symptoms and adverse outcomes if left untreated.

According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for managing valvular heart disease, aortic valve intervention is generally recommended for patients with severe AS presenting with symptoms or signs of ventricular decompensation. For asymptomatic AS, guidelines based on expert opinion and nonrandomized data recommend watchful waiting, with aortic valve intervention deferred until symptom onset or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%. Nevertheless, the appropriate timing of intervention for these patients remains controversial, and any decision requires careful assessment.

Several meta‐analyses have demonstrated the benefits of early intervention in patients with asymptomatic severe AS. However, the majority of included studies were observational or enrolled small numbers of relatively young and low‐risk patients. The primary aim of this study is to comprehensively review the available evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the optimal management strategy for patients with asymptomatic severe AS.

### Aortic stenosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^113t7TKR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of aortic stenosis increases with age, affecting up to 10% of the population by the eighth decade. Once symptoms develop, aortic stenosis is rapidly fatal. Proper management requires an understanding of the physiology and criteria used to define disease severity. There is no effective pharmacologic treatment. Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the gold standard treatment for decades. However, over the last 10 years transcatheter aortic valve replacement has emerged as an attractive, less-invasive option for appropriately selected patients. Refinements in valve design and delivery systems have led to widespread use of this breakthrough technology in selected patients. We review the pathophysiology, criteria for valve replacement, and the results of the trials comparing transcatheter aortic valve replacement with surgical aortic valve replacement.

### Early aortic valve replacement of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112xrbrB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis may lead to the progression to both symptoms and adverse outcomes if left untreated. The appropriate timing of intervention for these patients remains controversial, and any decision requires careful assessment.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing early aortic valve replacement with conservative management in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis until December 2024. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of all‐cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, stroke, and myocardial infarction. We expressed outcome data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs.

Results

We included 4 randomized controlled trials involving 1427 patients. Early aortic valve replacement significantly reduced the incidence of the composite outcome when compared with conservative management (29.2% versus 53.7%; RR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.49–0.64]; I² = 60%). Significant reductions were also detected in all‐cause mortality (10.0% versus 13.7%; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55–0.99]; I² = 58%), hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (14.6% versus 32.5%; RR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.39–0.58]; I² = 26%), and stroke (4.5% versus 7.2% RR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.40–0.95]; I² = 0%). No significant difference was observed in cardiac‐specific mortality (8.3% versus 16% RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.40–1.16]; I² = 65%) and myocardial infarction (0.6% versus 4.6%; RR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.04–1.19]; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that among patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, a strategy of early aortic valve interventions was superior to conservative treatments in reducing the primary composite outcome of all‐cause mortality, hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, stroke, and myocardial infarction. However, significant differences in the rates of cardiac‐specific mortality were not apparent.

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113vsYN7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

The present study examines whether improvements have reduced the negative impact of guideline triggers on postoperative outcomes.

Background

European and American guidelines for the management of severe aortic regurgitation (AR) define the triggers for AR surgery. These triggers are based on the results of studies performed in the 1990s analyzing outcomes of patients who underwent AR surgery in the 1980s. Although these triggers are used to indicate surgery, they have all been associated with poorer postoperative outcomes. In the meantime, innovations in operative techniques, including aortic valve repair, have allowed reducing the risk of surgery.

Methods

A total of 356 consecutive patients undergoing surgical correction of severe AR were included in this study. Among them, 204 were operated on for a Class I, 17 for a Class IIa, 49 for a Class IIb, and 86 without any guideline triggers. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to compare postoperative outcomes in the different groups. Inverse probability weighing was used to adjust for mismatched baseline characteristics.

Results

Adjusted 10-year survival was better among patients without operative triggers (89 ± 4%) or with Class II triggers (85 ± 6%) than in patients with Class I triggers (71 ± 4%, p = 0.010). Similar results were obtained for cardiovascular survival and hospitalizations for heart failure. Spline function analyses indicated that mortality started to increase for left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < 55% and LV end-systolic dimensions > 20 to 22 mm/m². LV end-diastolic dimensions did not influence outcomes.

Conclusions

Guideline-based Class I triggers for AR surgery carry major risks for long-term outcomes. This suggests that patients with severe AR should be operated on before the onset of these triggers; that is, at an asymptomatic stage, before LV ejection fraction falls below 55% or LV end-systolic dimensions exceeds 20 to 22 mm/m².

Chronic aortic regurgitation — timing of intervention: In symptomatic patients with severe AR (Stage D), aortic valve surgery is indicated regardless of LV systolic function. In asymptomatic chronic severe AR with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 55%) (Stage C2), aortic valve surgery is indicated if no other cause for systolic dysfunction is identified. In patients with severe AR (Stage C or D) undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, aortic valve surgery is indicated. In asymptomatic severe AR with normal LV systolic function (LVEF > 55%), aortic valve surgery is reasonable when LV is severely enlarged (LVESD > 50 mm or LVESD > 25 mm/m²). In patients with moderate AR (Stage B) who are undergoing cardiac or aortic surgery for other indications, aortic valve surgery is reasonable. In asymptomatic severe AR with normal LV systolic function at rest (LVEF > 55%) and low surgical risk, aortic valve surgery may be considered when there is a progressive decline in LVEF on at least 3 serial studies to the low-normal range (LVEF 55% to 60%) or a progressive increase in LV dilation into the severe range (LV end-diastolic dimension [LVEDD] > 65 mm). In patients with isolated severe AR who have indications for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and are candidates for surgery, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) should not be performed.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — class 1 (COR 1) indications for aortic valve surgery include the following: In symptomatic patients with severe AR (Stage D), aortic valve surgery is indicated regardless of LV systolic function (LOE B-NR). In asymptomatic patients with chronic severe AR and LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 55%) (Stage C2), aortic valve surgery is indicated if no other cause for systolic dysfunction is identified (LOE B-NR). In patients with severe AR (Stage C or D) who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, aortic valve surgery is indicated (LOE C-EO).

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^1154amLC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR). Management of severe AS in the absence of symptoms is, however, controversial and often challenging. Unselected premature AVR carries the risks of cardiac surgery; delayed AVR due to unrecognized symptoms can result in a dismal outcome. Echocardiography is the standard tool to evaluate and follow patients with AS. Nevertheless, most of the current echocardiographic parameters have limitations in predicting symptom onset and clinical outcome. The same applies to clinical parameters, exercise stress testing, and other imaging modalities used in AS evaluation and serial follow-up. Predictors of outcome could, however, help to identify asymptomatic patients who would benefit from expedited AVR with the goal to reduce mortality. This review will discuss the most relevant clinical studies and guidelines on management of asymptomatic severe AS, with an emphasis on providing concise information for identifying patients at high risk.

### Highlights and perioperative implications from the 2022 American college of cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of aortic disease [^111xLu3x]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

As the understanding of aortic diseases and their complications grow, increasing importance of uniformity in diagnosis and management is crucial for optimal care of this patient population. The 2022 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease discusses these considerations in detail. The purpose of this review is to highlight essential recommendations that are of relevance to the perioperative physician who manages these patients. A few notable points include, shared decision-making with patients, creation of multidisciplinary aortic teams, lower diameter thresholds for surgery in certain situations, and increased testing for patients with heritable aortic diseases. In addition to briefly reviewing basics of aortic diseases, the authors discuss changes to guidelines that are especially relevant to perioperative care.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1132VAx1]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) — stages of chronic AR reflect etiology and progression. The most common causes of chronic severe AR in the United States and other high‑income countries are bicuspid aortic valve disease and primary disease of the ascending aorta or sinuses of Valsalva, whereas rheumatic heart disease is the leading cause in many low‑ to middle‑income countries. With calcific valve disease, regurgitation often accompanies aortic stenosis and usually is mild to moderate. The disease course is chronic and slowly progressive with increasing LV volume overload and LV adaptation via dilation and hypertrophy. Staging spans patients at risk (Stage A), progressive mild to moderate AR (Stage B), severe asymptomatic (Stage C), and symptomatic (Stage D), with stages defined by valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics, severity of LV dilation, LV systolic function, and symptoms.

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^115mzAND]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

### Misconceptions and facts about aortic stenosis [^112muQtx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease leading to intervention, and it is typically a disease of the elderly. Recent clinical advances have expanded the role of transcatheter aortic valve intervention in patients with severe aortic stenosis, making aortic valve intervention feasible and effective even in patients at intermediate, high, and prohibitive surgical risk. With the rapid advances in treatment, proper diagnosis becomes crucial for a wide range of patients with aortic stenosis: from "concordant" high-gradient aortic stenosis to "discordant" low-gradient aortic stenosis. The latter group commonly presents a clinical challenge requiring thoughtful and comprehensive evaluation to determine eligibility for aortic valve intervention. Providers at all levels should be familiar with basic diagnostic caveats and misconceptions when evaluating patients with possible aortic stenosis.

Conclusions

Substantial country-specific differences in the presentation and management of severe AS were evident between three major European countries. Of note, patients in Germany had more advanced disease, the rate of intervention within 3 months was startlingly low in the UK, and asymptomatic patients without an appropriate indication often underwent an intervention in Germany and France.

### Diagnosis and management of aortic valve stenosis in patients with heart failure [^115ApVZX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent degenerative valvular heart disease in Western countries and its prevalence increases in parallel with the ageing process of the population. Heart failure (HF), defined by the presence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, may be present in up to a quarter of patients with severe AS, posing diagnostic and management challenges. The present article reviews the prevalence of HF in severe AS patients, discusses the diagnostic challenges and the advances in multimodality imaging to identify the patients that may benefit from surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and summarizes the current evidence on management for this group of patients.

Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) diagnostic testing is indicated as follows: In patients with signs or symptoms of AR, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is indicated for assessment of the cause and severity of regurgitation, left ventricular (LV) size and systolic function, prognosis, and timing of valve intervention. In patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) or with known dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta, TTE is indicated to evaluate the presence and severity of AR. In patients with moderate or severe AR and suboptimal TTE images or a discrepancy between clinical and TTE findings, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), or cardiac catheterization is indicated for the assessment of LV systolic function, systolic and diastolic volumes, aortic size, and AR severity.

Two men with Reiter's syndrome are described who developed aortic insufficiency with no evidence of syphilis or rheumatic heart disease. One patient, who had complete heart block and died of cardiac failure, was found to have mesoaortic disease and dilatation of the aortic valve with rolling of the free margins of the semilunar cusps. The other patient is living but has angina pectoris and exertional dyspnea. Cardiac catheterization in this case revealed severe aortic regurgitation. The clinical and pathological changes in these and other cases of Reiter's syndrome with aortic insufficiency appear to be similar to those described in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and aortic root and valvular disease.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — medical therapy: In asymptomatic patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR), treatment of hypertension is recommended when systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg, and in patients with severe AR who have symptoms and/or left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction but a prohibitive surgical risk, guideline-directed medical therapy for reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or sacubitril/valsartan is recommended.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) — intervention for acute severe AR from infective endocarditis or aortic dissection may include temporary afterload reduction, but surgery should not be delayed, especially with hypotension, pulmonary edema, or low flow. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated in acute severe AR. Beta blockers, though often used for aortic dissection, should be used very cautiously, if at all, for other causes of acute AR because they can block compensatory tachycardia and precipitate a marked reduction in blood pressure.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^113CSX1m]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present results illustrate that almost one-quarter of patients with symptomatic severe AS with guideline indications for AVR did not undergo valve replacement, despite the poor prognosis associated with a lack of intervention. In contrast, over one-third of asymptomatic patients were assigned to AVR, with very few specific characteristics associated with this choice. We conclude that there may be a considerable discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical practice decision-making in the treatment of AS. It appears as if guidelines may not fully capture the clinical spectrum of AS presentation and the individual patient need for an intervention or that unrequired AVRs may be being performed.

Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) — imaging confirmation and surveillance are emphasized. LVEDD, a marker of the severity of LV volume overload in chronic AR, is associated with clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients, and progressive LVEDD increases are associated with subsequent need for surgery. When EF falls or LV size increases, repeat imaging typically is performed at 3- to 6-month intervals unless there is clinical deterioration. Confirmation of severe regurgitation by quantitative measures with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), or, when needed, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides confidence that AR is the cause of LV dilation or decreased LVEF.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — class 2a (COR 2a) reasonable indications specify that in asymptomatic patients with severe AR and normal LV systolic function (LVEF > 55%), aortic valve surgery is reasonable when the LV is severely enlarged (LVESD > 50 mm or indexed LVESD > 25 mm/m²) (Stage C2) (LOE B-NR). Additionally, in patients with moderate AR (Stage B) who are undergoing cardiac or aortic surgery for other indications, aortic valve surgery is reasonable (LOE C-EO).

Regarding medical management for aortic regurgitation, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate guideline-directed medical therapy for reduced LVEF with ACEis, ARBs and/or sacubitril/valsartan in patients with severe AR having symptoms and/or LV systolic dysfunction (stages C2-D) but a prohibitive surgical risk.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of ageing, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this Review.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) — Updated May 2019 — define strength and evidentiary quality for clinical strategies. Class 1 (Strong) states "Benefit > > > Risk" with phrases such as "Is recommended", "Is indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", "Should be performed/administered/other", and comparative language "Treatment/strategy A is recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "Treatment A should be chosen over treatment B". Class 2a (Moderate) denotes "Benefit > > Risk", using "Is reasonable", "Can be useful/effective/beneficial", and comparative phrases "Treatment/strategy A is probably recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "It is reasonable to choose treatment A over treatment B". Class 2b (Weak) reflects "Benefit ≥ Risk", with "May/might be reasonable", "May/might be considered", and that "Usefulness/effectiveness is unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established". Class 3: No Benefit (Moderate) shows "Benefit = Risk (Generally, LOE A or B use only)" with "Is not recommended", "Is not indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", and "Should not be performed/administered/other", while Class 3: Harm (Strong) is "Risk > Benefit" with "Potentially harmful", "Causes harm", "Associated with excess morbidity/mortality", and "Should not be performed/administered/other".

### Natural history of asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic regurgitation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151TJd1]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The natural history of asymptomatic moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (AR) remains uncertain, with conflicting reports about its progression and surgical timing. We aimed to quantify adverse outcomes under conservative management and evaluate the association of aortic valve replacement/repair (AVR) with mortality.

Methods

Systematic searches (inception-July 2025) identified cohort studies of asymptomatic moderate/severe AR. Random-effects models estimated pooled incidence rates of adverse events; fixed-effects models were used for hazard ratios (HRs) of AVR vs conservative management.

Results

Twenty-seven studies (4720 patients; mean age 49 years; mean follow-up 3.9 years) were included. Pooled incidence rates per 100 person-years were 1.75 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.29 for cardiac death, 0.29 for sudden death, 4.30 for new symptoms and 7.01 for AVR. Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction occurred in only 0.9 per 100 person-years. Mortality rates were more than double those of the general population across age groups-2.45 (1.90 to 3.18) per 100 person-years for cohorts with mean age ≥ 50 years versus 0.59 (0.29 to 1.21) for younger cohorts. Early AVR was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.33; 95%CI 0.30 to 0.37).

Conclusion

Asymptomatic moderate/severe AR carries significant excess mortality irrespective of age, contradicting its historically benign reputation. Given the rarity of asymptomatic LV dysfunction, earlier intervention guided by more sensitive markers of LV damage may improve outcomes, although heterogeneity and study quality warrant cautious interpretation.

### Contemporary diagnosis and treatment of aortic regurgitation: a state-of-the-art review [^1157Aot7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is progressive and frequently underrecognized; without timely intervention it drives adverse left-ventricular remodeling and heart failure. Despite Class I guideline indications, many patients-especially older, frail individuals with multimorbidity-remain untreated. Advancements in high-fidelity multimodality imaging - including cardiac magnetic resonance, four-dimensional flow, and speckle-tracking echocardiography - have enabled earlier detection of remodeling and more accurate quantification of regurgitant burden. These techniques are redefining thresholds for treatment and may enable biomarker-imaging composite staging of disease. Surgery remains the gold standard of therapy for native AR. Contemporary surgical management is tailored to age, anatomy, and root pathology. While surgical aortic valve replacement remains the predominant therapy for most candidates, valve-sparing root procedures, the Ross operation, and aortic valve neocuspidization are increasingly offered at experienced centers for carefully selected lower-risk patients. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is expanding rapidly as a viable option that helps bridge the treatment gap for those at prohibitive or high risk for surgery. Yet, devices optimized for calcific aortic stenosis encounter technical obstacles in native AR - including large, non-calcified annuli, elliptical root geometry, and high stroke volumes - leading to suboptimal anchoring, residual paravalvular regurgitation, and device embolization. Purpose-built AR systems with leaflet-engaging anchoring and enhanced sealing have shown encouraging outcomes in feasibility and pivotal studies, and have obtained commercial approval in Europe, and U.S. authorization is anticipated. This state-of-the-art review synthesizes current insights into AR pathophysiology, diagnostic advances, and therapeutic innovations in surgical and transcatheter techniques, highlighting knowledge gaps and proposing research priorities to accelerate access to care for this historically undertreated population.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^115gPVdQ]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 2171 patients were enrolled in the registry, of which 1743 were symptomatic and 428 asymptomatic at presentation (figure 1).

Figure 1
Patient flow. AS, aortic stenosis; AVR, aortic valve replacement (surgical or transcatheter). *Symptomatic defined as having ≥ 1 of the following (presumed to be AS-related): chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness on exertion/syncope. † According to 2017 European guideline recommendations. SAVR, surgical aortic valve replacement.

Symptomatic patients who were assigned to medical treatment were slightly older and had a higher mean EuroSCORE II compared with those assigned to AVR, with a higher proportion being severely frail and assessed to have a reduced life expectancy at baseline (table 1). Renal insufficiency and COPD were also more common among those that did not undergo AVR. In symptomatic patients, shortness of breath was the most common symptom recorded with slightly higher rates in those with an AVR (92.7%) than in those without (86.2%). Other symptoms, such as dizziness/syncope and chest pain, were equally frequent in those with or without an intervention (figure 2A). Medically treated symptomatic patients had a larger indexed AVA, lower V max, lower mean AV gradient and higher LVEF; however, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation grade III/IV were more frequent among those that did not undergo AVR, as was the combination of an AVA < 1 cm² plus a mean AV gradient < 40 mm Hg (table 2). A definitive decision for either medical treatment or AVR was made in 1608 (92.3%) of symptomatic patients: 1225 of these patients were assigned to any AVR (810 TAVI and 415 SAVR) and the rest assigned to medical treatment (figure 1). The decisions not to perform AVR despite symptomatic AS were made by a cardiologist in 50.9% and requested by the patient in 15.4%. A heart team was involved in a 'no AVR' decision in 17.8% of cases (figure 2). Conversely, the decision to perform AVR in symptomatic patients was made by the heart team in the majority of cases (68.2%). The proportion of symptomatic patients with a class I (95.0% vs 94.4%) or class II (5.0% vs 5.6%) indication for AVR did not differ between those that did not undergo and those assigned to AVR (p = 0.168). In a multivariate analysis, the referral by a cardiologist, shortness of breath, NYHA class III/IV and indexed AVA ≤ 0.39 cm²/m², an LVEF ≤ 58% were associated with a reduced rate of AVR denial (table 3). On the other hand, age > 80 years, severe frailty, renal impairment, mitral regurgitation grade III/IV, tricuspid regurgitation grade III/IV and interventricular septum > 13.3 mm were all associated with an increased risk of AVR denial.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk and decision-making pathways — guided actions for aortic valve replacement (AVR) selection are organized as: No current indication for AVR lists periodic monitoring of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and symptoms and re-evaluation when AS is severe or symptoms occur. When AVR is indicated but surgical AVR (SAVR) is preferred over TAVR, the document states 'SAVR recommended in lower-risk patients', notes valve durability considerations in younger patients, and that a concurrent surgical procedure may be needed. For a TAVR candidate with expected benefit > risk, actions include discussion with patient and family and proceeding with TAVR imaging evaluation and procedure. For severe symptomatic AS but benefit < risk (futility), thresholds include life expectancy < 1 year and chance of survival with benefit at 2 years < 25%, with actions including discussion with patient and family, palliative care inputs, and palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty in selected patients.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Medium credibility.

Appropriate use criteria (AUC) process and themes for aortic stenosis are outlined. AUC are a blend of evidence-based medicine and clinical judgement, are meant to cover common clinical situations rather than all presentations, and the role of clinical judgement should not be undermined when applying ratings. After several rounds, the median score from the 17 panelists for each scenario became the final AUC rating, and the final scores reflect the evidence base at the time in a rapidly evolving field. Initial tables identify definitive intervention versus conservative management with valve replacement (TAVR and SAVR) as 1 choice, with surgical risk informing the choice of TAVR or SAVR. When the patient has reduced ejection fraction, intervention is generally considered Appropriate and based predominantly on surgical risk, except when stress testing suggests pseudosevere stenosis or when left ventricular systolic function is profoundly impaired without contractile reserve; in these cases, medical management is considered Appropriate.

### Actual management of patients with asymptomatic aortic valve disease: how practice fits with guidelines [^117XNN4S]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intervention is advised in selected asymptomatic patients with aortic valve disease. However, little is known regarding their actual management.

Methods

The Euro Heart Survey was designed to evaluate practices. Severe isolated aortic stenosis (AS) was defined by a valve area ≤ 0.6 cm²/m² body surface area or mean gradient ≥ 50 mm Hg. Severe aortic regurgitation (AR) was defined by a grade ≥ 3/4. Patients were classified as asymptomatic when they were in New York Heart Association class I and were without angina. Decision to operate was analyzed by comparing patient characteristics with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations.

Results

Of the 5001 patients, 136 had severe, isolated, and asymptomatic aortic valve disease (84 with AS and 52 with AR). Stress testing was performed in only 6 patients (4%). A decision to operate was taken in 45 patients (54%) with AS and 21 (40%) with AR. Indications for surgery were in accordance with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines in 57 patients (68%) with AS and in 41 (83%) with AR. However, the decision to operate was frequently based on class IIb recommendations in patients with AS. Intervention was "overused" in 18 patients with AS (21%) and in 5 (9%) with AR. Intervention was "underused" in 9 patients (11%) with AS and in 4 (8%) with AR.

Conclusions

In asymptomatic patients with severe aortic valve disease, a decision to operate is frequently taken; and it is most often in agreement with guidelines, although often based on low-level recommendations.

### Aneurysm of the ascending aorta with aortic valvular insufficiency… [^113q7KEW]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

ANEURYSM of the ascending aorta associated with aortic valve incompetence is a formidable pathologic entity. Progressive expansion of the aneurysm may result in both aortic dissection or rupture with fatal hemorrhage and increasing aortic valvular regurgitation. 1 Effective surgical therapy would relieve cardiac failure and chest pain due to valvular incompetence or compromised coronary artery perfusion and should prevent fatal consequences. The entire ascending thoracic aorta is often involved in the degenerative process which may extend into the aortic arch. In some cases the dilatation is confined to the proximal ascending aorta producing a "Florence flask" deformity. Accompanying annular dilatation, as in the cases with annuloaortic ectasia and cystic medial necrosis, 2, 3 will result in aortic valvular regurgitation without pathologic changes in the aortic leaflets.

Successful surgical management includes both correction of the aortic valvular insufficiency and excision of the aneurysm with restoration of aortic continuity.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Integrated benefit–risk of TAVR and shared decision-making — the final treatment decision should be individualized using clinical and imaging evaluation, risk category, patient goals and expectations, and futility considerations. If the evaluation indicates that AS is not severe or symptoms are not due to AS, it may be prudent to continue periodic monitoring of AS severity and symptoms, deferring intervention until guideline-based criteria are met. Alternatively, the Heart Valve Team evaluation may conclude that the SAVR is the best option if surgical risk is low, the durability of a mechanical or other tissue valve is preferable in a younger patient, or concurrent procedures such as aortic root replacement or coronary bypass grafting are needed. Even when severe symptomatic AS is present, TAVR is considered futile when the expected benefit from TAVR is less than the expected risk; in these patients, palliative care may be the best option in terms of both quality and length of life. In patients who meet guideline-based criteria for TAVR and whose evaluation indicates the benefit is greater than risk, discussion with the patient and family should again review the likelihood of symptom relief or improved survival, possible complications and the expected recovery process, and alignment of patient goals and expectations with possible procedural outcomes.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) selection in severe aortic stenosis (AS) when a bioprosthetic AVR is appropriate is specified as follows: For symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe AS and any indication for AVR who are < 65 years of age or have a life expectancy > 20 years, SAVR is recommended. For symptomatic patients with severe AS who are 65 to 80 years of age and have no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, either SAVR or transfemoral TAVI is recommended after shared decision-making about the balance between expected patient longevity and valve durability. For symptomatic patients with severe AS who are > 80 years of age or for younger patients with a life expectancy < 10 years and no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, transfemoral TAVI is recommended in preference to SAVR. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an LVEF < 50% who are ≥ 80 years of age and have no anatomic contraindication to transfemoral TAVI, the decision between TAVI and SAVR should follow the same recommendations as for symptomatic patients in Recommendations 1, 2, and 3 above. For asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an abnormal exercise test, very severe AS, rapid progression, or an elevated BNP, SAVR is recommended in preference to TAVI. For symptomatic patients of any age with severe AS and a high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI is recommended if predicted post-TAVI survival is ≥ 12 months with an acceptable quality of life. For symptomatic patients with severe AS for whom predicted post-TAVI or post-SAVR survival is < 12 months or for whom minimal improvement in quality of life is expected, palliative care is recommended after shared decision-making, including discussion of patient preferences and values. In critically ill patients with severe AS, percutaneous aortic balloon dilation may be considered as a bridge to SAVR or TAVI.

### Differences in the presentation and management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in different European centres [^111HhjZi]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are still diagnosed late and show advanced symptoms at the time of referral. Timely intervention is crucial to improve quality of life and survival. Once symptoms develop, the average survival of patients without appropriate intervention is 2–3 years. The only effective treatment for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR), using either surgical AVR (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines recommend SAVR for patients with symptomatic AS at low surgical risk, and TAVI for those who are at increased operative risk. However, data from the IMPULSE registry, which covers nine European countries, indicate that almost a quarter of patients with symptomatic AS meeting guideline recommendations for AVR do not undergo such treatment.

Despite accepted European guidelines, the practice of cardiovascular medicine differs between European countries. In the case of aortic valve disease, differences in the clinical features of patients undergoing intervention, time to intervention, implanted aortic valve sizes, type of anaesthesia and utilisation of TAVI have been reported. The rate of adoption of TAVI varies between countries, with Germany, as one of the earliest adopters, having the highest rate of usage; by 2015, TAVI accounted for 59% of all aortic valve interventions in Germany compared with 36% in France. The percentage of TAVI-eligible patients who actually receive TAVI also varies, ranging from 36.2% in Germany to 6.4% in Portugal in 2011. Between-country differences in the rates of short-term complications after TAVI, including 30-day mortality, stroke, pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leak, have also been reported.

Further evaluation of differences in the management of patients with severe AS between countries could provide impact for the various healthcare systems and help identify aspects of management that could be improved. To this end, an investigation into the potential differences between Germany, France and the UK with respect to the presentation and management of patients with severe AS was made based on two prospective, multicentre European registries, IMPULSE and IMPULSE enhanced with a virtually identical design.

### Decision making with imaging in asymptomatic aortic regurgitation [^115dZmSf]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The authors review the optimal sequence of multimodality imaging studies in patients with chronic asymptomatic aortic regurgitation (AR). The initial questions in evaluating such patients are: 1) is AR severe; and 2) does it significantly impact the left ventricle? Although transthoracic echocardiography is usually able to answer these questions, a cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging study might be necessary if the data from echocardiography are conflicting or inadequate. If AR is severe and the left ventricle is severely dilated, surgery is indicated. If AR is severe but the left ventricle is not significantly impacted, echocardiographic exercise testing might unmask symptoms. If aortopathy is suspected, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (in younger patients) or computed tomography (in older patients) is necessary. In cases where AR severity or mechanism are unclear and no additional tests are possible, or if there is a potential for aortic valve repair, transesophageal echocardiography is appropriate. Finally, it is good practice to define a follow-up plan with the patient and referring physician, with an explanation as to what can be expected in the future.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — diagnostic testing: In patients with signs or symptoms of AR, TTE is indicated for assessment of the cause and severity of regurgitation, LV size and systolic function, prognosis, and timing of valve intervention; in patients with a BAV or with known dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta, TTE is indicated to evaluate the presence and severity of AR; and in patients with moderate or severe AR with suboptimal TTE images or a discrepancy between clinical and TTE findings, TEE, CMR, or cardiac catheterization is indicated for assessment of LV systolic function, systolic and diastolic volumes, aortic size, and AR severity. TTE provides diagnostic information about the etiology and mechanism of AR, severity of regurgitation, morphology of the ascending aorta, and LV response to the increases in preload and afterload, and imaging with TEE, CMR, or aortic angiography provides additional information when needed. TTE and CMR are useful when there is discordance between clinical assessment and AR severity or when TTE images are suboptimal, and cardiac catheterization with LV and aortic angiography with quantitation of regurgitant severity is another option.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for isolated chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is limited by anatomic challenges and procedural risks. TAVI for isolated chronic AR is challenging because of dilation of the aortic annulus and aortic root and, in many patients, lack of sufficient leaflet calcification. Risks of TAVI for treatment of AR include transcatheter valve migration and significant paravalvular leak. TAVI is rarely feasible, and then only in carefully selected patients with severe AR and HF who have a prohibitive surgical risk and in whom valvular calcification and annular size are appropriate for a transcatheter approach.

Aortic stenosis — timing of intervention with aortic valve replacement (AVR) includes: In adults with severe high-gradient AS (Stage D1) and symptoms of exertional dyspnea, HF, angina, syncope, or presyncope by history or on exercise testing, AVR is indicated. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an LVEF < 50% (Stage C2), AVR is indicated. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage C1) who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, AVR is indicated. In symptomatic patients with low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with reduced LVEF (Stage D2), AVR is recommended. In symptomatic patients with low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal LVEF (Stage D3), AVR is recommended if AS is the most likely cause of symptoms. In apparently asymptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage C1) and low surgical risk, AVR is reasonable when an exercise test demonstrates decreased exercise tolerance (normalized for age and sex) or a fall in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline to peak exercise. In asymptomatic patients with very severe AS (defined as an aortic velocity of ≥ 5 m/s) and low surgical risk, AVR is reasonable. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS (Stage C1) and low surgical risk, AVR is reasonable when the serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is > 3 times normal. In asymptomatic patients with high-gradient severe AS (Stage C1) and low surgical risk, AVR is reasonable when serial testing shows an increase in aortic velocity ≥ 0.3 m/s per year. In asymptomatic patients with severe high-gradient AS (Stage C1) and a progressive decrease in LVEF on at least 3 serial imaging studies to < 60%, AVR may be considered. In patients with moderate AS (Stage B) who are undergoing cardiac surgery for other indications, AVR may be considered.

### Clinical outcomes according to aortic stenosis management: insights from real-world practice [^115qybBU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, affecting ≈5% of individuals aged > 65 year old. Untreated, symptomatic severe AS is associated with poor short‐term prognosis, significant rates of health care resource usage including frequent hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), and impaired quality of life. To date, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only effective therapy that has been proven to improve survival. Therefore, current guidelines strongly recommend to refer symptomatic patients with severe AS for AVR, whether surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR), depending on surgical risk and/or patient age.

Despite these recommendations, previous studies consistently reported an underuse of AVR in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS. Additionally, the question of more timely interventions in severe but also moderate AS emerges to reduce its burden, particularly at a time of low AVR‐related death even for those who were previously deemed to be inoperable. Importantly, most of the studies exploring the current management of patients with AS and its association with outcomes are restricted to severe AS, tertiary centers, report only limited follow‐up or may be biased by the cost or the availability of the selected therapy. Finally, the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines suggest different age thresholds (65 and 80) for choosing between SAVR or TAVR and highlight for the first time the importance of shared decision making with the patient. In this context, there are few data on patients who did not have an AVR (because they refused or in whom AVR was considered futile) despite a strong indication.

Given the growing interest in intervention in AS patients, a deeper understanding of the population risk profile and clinical course of the disease through contemporary and unbiased management may serve as a benchmark for future clinical studies. Based on a population of outpatients across the overall spectrum of AS (mild, moderate and severe AS), this study aimed to explore the mode of intervention, in the overall cohort and according to the age of the patients proposed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as well as the association between the initial therapeutic decision and long‐term outcomes, including patients in whom AVR was considered futile or patients who refused AVR.

Objectives

In this review, we will discuss aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and mitral stenosis. We will review the etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of aortic and mitral valve disease. Age and lesion specific treatments are outlined based on the severity of valve disease with an aim at long-term preservation of left ventricular function.

Data Source

MEDLINE and PubMed.

Conclusions

Mitral and aortic valve disease leads to unique hemodynamic burdens that can impact left ventricular function, quality of life, and longevity. The primary challenge in the management of mitral and aortic valve disease is to apply appropriate medical management and identify that point in time at which the surgery is necessary. Although guidelines have been established for the management of aortic and mitral valve disease in adults, the challenges of early presentation, maintenance of growth potential, and apparent increased tolerance of hemodynamic burden in children makes decision making challenging.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — medical therapy: In asymptomatic patients with chronic AR (Stages B and C), treatment of hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg) is recommended, and in patients with severe AR who have symptoms and/or LV systolic dysfunction (Stages C2 and D) but a prohibitive surgical risk, GDMT for reduced LVEF with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or sacubitril/valsartan is recommended. There is no evidence that vasodilating drugs reduce severity of AR or alter the disease course in patients with significant AR in the absence of systemic hypertension, and recommendations for GDMT for hypertension and HF apply to patients with chronic asymptomatic AR, as for the general population. In symptomatic patients who are candidates for surgery, medical therapy is not a substitute for AVR; however, medical therapy is helpful for alleviating symptoms in patients who are considered to be at very high surgical risk because of concomitant comorbid medical conditions.

Discussion

Among 6746 adults with newly diagnosed sAS, after adjustment for baseline patient characteristics and comorbidities, we found significantly lower rates of cardiac specialist follow‐up evaluation and AVR for patients managed by a PCP as compared with a cardiac specialist. PCP‐managed patients were less likely to undergo AVR even when the analysis was limited to patients with symptomatic sAS, which represents the most severe stage of sAS (Stage D) according to current 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines and for whom AVR is recommended with very few exceptions.PCP‐led management of sAS was also associated with higher risk of mortality, regardless of patients' symptom status.

Cardiac Specialist Follow‐Up and Aortic Valve Replacement

Primary care providers play a crucial role in patient care. Their initial clinical evaluation frequently is key to discovering underlying cardiovascular disease and it should be noted that 51% of cardiologist‐managed patients also saw a PCP in the year before echocardiogram confirmation of sAS. Meanwhile, follow‐up evaluation by a specialist provider represents an opportunity for in‐depth assessment of concerning findings by an expert in the field. Specialists usually receive years of additional training regarding identification and best practice management of diseases associated with their practice. A key component of this training is gaining familiarity with clinical management guidelines. According to current 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines, referral to a cardiac specialist is a critical step in the clinical management pathway for all patients with sAS (Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: C). Evaluation by a cardiac specialist provides the best opportunity for accurate assessment of patient disease severity and symptomatology, although variability in the management of patients with sAS among cardiologists has been described. As the guidelines for sAS management are largely based on these findings, accurate characterization of a patient's clinical presentation is key to appropriate management and good outcomes. Visiting with a cardiac specialist may also empower patients to participate in fully informed decision‐making regarding their condition, as specialists may have greater experience with issues warranting consideration, such as the natural history of untreated sAS and AVR procedural risks.

### Outcomes of watchful waiting strategy and predictors of postoperative prognosis in asymptomatic or equivocally symptomatic chronic severe aortic regurgitation with preserved left ventricular function [^1141sNxf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is characterized by the diastolic reflux of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle, resulting in left ventricular (LV) volume and pressure overload. Although patients with chronic AR generally remain asymptomatic for a long period, the left ventricle eventually fails to maintain a compensated state. Because of the relatively young onset and gradual progression of AR, a watchful waiting strategy is feasible in clinical settings until it is optimal to perform surgery for chronic severe AR. Considering this specific natural history, echocardiography cut‐off values for surgery in current guidelines have been based mainly on predictors of postoperative prognosis in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR). However, few studies have demonstrated the prognosis in patients who were managed under the watchful waiting strategy.

Strong evidence has shown that aortic valve surgery improves the prognosis of patients who have chronic severe AR with marked symptoms (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class ≥ III), or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; < 50%). However, the optimal timing for surgery in asymptomatic or equivocally symptomatic (NYHA class I or II) patients with chronic severe AR and preserved LVEF remains controversial. In this population, the LV end‐systolic diameter (LVESD) has been reported as a better criterion for surgery than LV end‐diastolic diameter (LVEDD). Several studies have revealed that a higher LVESD or LVESD index (LVESDi) indicates progression of LV remodelingand poor prognosis after AVR, despite minimal evidence of increased LVEDD. On the other hand, recent studies have recommended early surgery in conservatively managed patients with a low LVESDi (20–25 mm/m²) due to increased all‐cause mortality. However, these studies may have included patients who did not undergo aortic valve surgery because of high comorbidity, patient's will, or financial reasons. Moreover, considering the natural history of chronic AR and its low cardiovascular event rate, most patients may have died of noncardiovascular causes. The cut‐off values of echocardiographic parameters that indicate the need for surgery should be determined over cardiovascular events.

In order to elucidate the optimal treatment options for asymptomatic or equivocally symptomatic patients with chronic severe AR and preserved LVEF, we investigated (1) the actual management and treatment plans after initial diagnosis, (2) the prognosis of patients who were managed under the watchful waiting strategy, and (3) the optimal cut‐off values of echocardiographic parameters in terms of postoperative prognosis in patients who underwent AVR.

Severe aortic stenosis — stress testing, reduced ejection fraction, and very severe criteria: Reduced ejection fraction (< 50%) was recognized as carrying a Class I recommendation for intervention regardless of surgical risk, and intervention was rated Appropriate with no role for stress testing to inform decision making, with medical management considered to be Rarely Appropriate. When none of the predictive features were present, medical management was rated Appropriate, but intervention was rated May Be Appropriate regardless of surgical risk even in the absence of such features. Conversely, even with a normal stress test, in the presence of factors that are predictive of symptom onset and/or rapid progression but not of sudden death, raters considered intervention as Appropriate, particularly if the risk of surgery was low, with medical management as a May Be Appropriate alternative approach. Very severe aortic stenosis (defined as Vmax ≥ 5 m/sec or mean gradient ≥ 60 mmHg) led raters to consider intervention Appropriate, particularly when surgical risk was low, and medical management a May Be Appropriate alternative when surgical risk was higher. Intervention is Appropriate (and failure to intervene, Rarely Appropriate) when the patient with severe aortic stenosis undergoes cardiac surgery for another indication, and in settings in which syncope could be fatal and access to surveillance is limited, AVR was considered Appropriate in the low-surgical-risk patient with medical management as a May Be Appropriate alternative.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111QetAu]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis affects 3% of persons older than 65 years. Although survival in asymptomatic patients is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, it decreases rapidly after symptoms appear. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for most symptomatic patients with evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients. However, select patients may also benefit from aortic valve replacement before the onset of symptoms. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for patients at low to moderate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Patients should be educated about the importance of promptly reporting symptoms to their physicians. In asymptomatic patients, serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended every six to 12 months for severe aortic stenosis, every one to two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic moderate and severe aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medical management of concurrent hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease will lead to optimal outcomes.

### Mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation: a clinical conundrum [^1132LDYB]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Mixed aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR) is the most frequent concomitant valve disease worldwide and represents a heterogeneous population ranging from mild AS with severe AR to mild AR with severe AS. About 6.8% of patients with at least moderate AS will also have moderate or greater AR, and 17.9% of patients with at least moderate AR will suffer from moderate or greater AS. Interest in mixed AS/AR has increased, with studies demonstrating that patients with moderate mixed AS/AR have similar outcomes to those with isolated severe AS. The diagnosis and quantification of mixed AS/AR severity are predominantly echocardiography-based, but the combined lesions lead to significant limitations in the assessment. Aortic valve peak velocity is the best parameter to evaluate the combined haemodynamic impact of both lesions, with a peak velocity greater than 4.0 m/s suggesting severe mixed AS/AR. Moreover, symptoms, increased left ventricular wall thickness and filling pressures, and abnormal left ventricular global longitudinal strain likely identify high-risk patients who may benefit from closer follow-up. Although guidelines recommend interventions based on the predominant lesion, some patients could potentially benefit from earlier intervention. Once a patient is deemed to require intervention, for patients receiving transcatheter valves, the presence of mixed AS/AR could confer benefit to those at high risk of paravalvular leak. Overall, the current approach of managing patients based on the dominant lesion might be too reductionist and a more holistic approach including biomarkers and multimodality imaging cardiac remodelling and inflammation data might be more appropriate.

Objective

Contemporary data on patients with previously undiagnosed severe aortic stenosis (AS) are scarce. We aimed to address this gap by gathering data from consecutive patients diagnosed with severe AS on echocardiography.

Methods

This was a prospective, multicentre, multinational, registry in 23 tertiary care hospitals across 9 European countries. Patients with a diagnosis of severe AS were included using echocardiography (aortic valve area (AVA) < 1 cm², indexed AVA < 0.6 cm²/m², maximum jet-velocity (V max) > 4 m/s and/or mean transvalvular gradient > 40mm Hg).

Results

The 2171 participants had a mean age of 77.9 years and 48.0% were female. The mean AVA was 0.73 cm², V max 4.3 m/s and mean gradient 47.1mm Hg; 62.1% had left ventricular hypertrophy and 27.3% an ejection fraction (EF) < 50%. 1743 patients (80.3%) were symptomatic (shortness-of-breath 91.0%; dizziness 30.2%, chest pain 28.9%). Patients had a EuroSCORE II of 4.0; 25.3% had a creatinine clearance < 50mL/min, and 3.2% had an EF < 30%. Symptomatic patients were older and had more comorbidities than asymptomatic patients. Despite European Society of Cardiology 2017 valvular heart disease guideline class I recommendation, in only 76.2% a decision was made for an intervention (transcatheter 50.4%, surgical aortic valve replacement 25.8%). In asymptomatic patients, 57.7% with a class I/IIa indication were scheduled for a procedure, while 36.3% patients without an indication had their valve replaced.

Conclusions

The majority of patients with severe AS presented at an advanced disease stage. Management of severe AS remained suboptimal in a significant proportion of contemporary patients with severe AS.

### Mortality burden for patients with untreated aortic regurgitation [^114hqAaK]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a frequent valve disease, with up to 4.5% of patients older than 65 years having moderate or severe AR. AR is associated with left ventricle (LV) volume overload and, if left untreated, leads to LV enlargement, pulmonary congestion, decreased cardiac output, and decreased LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Retrospective data from small series have demonstrated increased mortality with chronic severe AR, especially if associated with symptoms, LV dilation, and reduced LVEF.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement (AVR) as a Class 1 recommendation for patients with severe AR associated with either symptoms or LVEF ≤ 55%, as a Class 2a recommendation for patients with systolic LV dilation (LV end-systolic diameter > 50 mm or indexed LV end-systolic diameter > 25 mm/m²), and as a class 2b recommendation when there is a progressive decline in LVEF on at least 3 serial studies to the low–normal range (LVEF 55%-60%) or a progressive increase in LV dilation into the severe range (LV end-diastolic dimension > 65 mm). AVR for moderate AR could be considered (class 2a) in the context where other open-heart surgery is needed, such as coronary artery bypass, mitral valve replacement, or root enlargement. Clinically, it is often challenging to determine the severity of AR, and especially to distinguish between moderate and severe AR. Similarly, patients with moderate AR may not tolerate the associated increase in LV volume and may become symptomatic or have LV enlargement while still being considered nonsevere. In the present study, we aimed to assess the rates of mortality across the spectrum of untreated AR severity and to identify the determinants of mortality from a contemporary, large, real-world database.

### Current management of calcific aortic stenosis [^112b5Npi]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a progressive disease with no effective medical therapy that ultimately requires aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe valve obstruction. Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic approach to define valve anatomy, measure aortic stenosis severity, and evaluate the left ventricular response to chronic pressure overload. In asymptomatic patients, markers of disease progression include the degree of leaflet calcification, hemodynamic severity of stenosis, adverse left ventricular remodeling, reduced left ventricular longitudinal strain, myocardial fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. The onset of symptoms portends a predictably high mortality rate unless AVR is performed. In symptomatic patients, AVR improves symptoms, improves survival, and, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, improves systolic function. Poor outcomes after AVR are associated with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, severe ventricular fibrosis, oxygen-dependent lung disease, frailty, advanced renal dysfunction, and a high comorbidity score. However, in most patients with severe symptoms, AVR is lifesaving. Bioprosthetic valves are recommended for patients aged > 65 years. Transcatheter AVR is now available for patients with severe comorbidities, is recommended in patients who are deemed inoperable, and is a reasonable alternative to surgical AVR in high-risk patients.

Descending TAA perioperative risk factors affecting threshold selection — In patients being considered for open or endovascular repair, high-risk clinical features portend poor outcomes after repair. For open surgical repair, advanced age, preoperative renal insufficiency of stage 3 or greater, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and forced expiratory volume in 1 second ≤ 50% predicted, and previous stroke have all been associated with increased risk of death, perioperative morbidity, or both. For endovascular repair of descending TAA, frailty indicators, pulmonary disease, as well as procedural complexity are predictive of poor outcomes after TEVAR.

### Excess mortality and undertreatment of women with severe aortic stenosis [^115K1jZh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease treated in developed countries, 1 and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. 2 Although the population burden of AS is similar in men and women and current guidelines do not distinguish between the sexes in regard to AS symptoms, cardiac repercussions, or management, 3, 4 there are increasingly recognized pathophysiological differences between men and women with AS. These involve the role of aortic valvular calcifications in relation to AS severity 5, 6 and the left ventricular (LV) response to AS hemodynamic burden. 7, 8 Conversely, the clinical differences between men and women with AS and their link to management and outcomes remain poorly defined.

Indeed, the mostly studied end point is clinical outcome after aortic valve replacement (AVR), surgical 9, 10 or transcatheter, 11, 12 reported alternatively as similar or different between the sexes although generally considered beneficial in both. 13 However, studies of the outcome after diagnosis have been more tenuous and contradictory. AS hemodynamic progression has been reported most generally similar in men and women 14, 15 but some studies are discordant and suggest a faster progression in women. 16 Conversely, very few data exist regarding clinical outcome after AS diagnosis. Studies in other valve diseases, although remaining quite limited, have suggested remarkable differences between the sexes. Among patients with mitral regurgitation, women tend to receive surgical treatment less frequently and later than men. 17, 18 In patients with AS, potential differences in cardiac surgery indications are undefined, but US national data compile many more cases of AVR in men than women 10 discrepantly from the AS prevalence. 1 Furthermore, potential differences between the sexes in survival after diagnosis have not been clearly analyzed in the major AS outcome studies. 19, 20, 21, 22 Prospective AS cohorts, 16, 19, 23 which enrolled mostly people with mild AS, were not geared toward routine clinical care and reported alternatively similar clinical progression 19, 23 or excess complications 16 in women and therefore did not resolve the issue of sex‐specific outcomes. Previous studies in aortic regurgitation emphasized the importance of accounting for differences between men and women 24, 25 in managing the disease, but in AS, although recent reviews attempt to attract attention toward sex differences, 26, 27 unavailability of sizable data specifically analyzing sex‐specific outcome after severe AS clinical diagnosis prevents evaluating potential gaps in clinical care and remedies.

Aortic disease — biomechanics of the aorta — emerging evidence suggests that aortic diameter alone is an insufficient predictor of risk for aortic dissection, and understanding biomechanical wall stress distribution and contributions of hemodynamic flow disturbances, including from aortic valve stenosis, regurgitation, or a well-functioning bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), may improve risk stratification strategies and patient outcomes.

Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) — comorbidities, natural history, and rupture risk are detailed. Additional common comorbidities include hypertension, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal insufficiency, and PAU can occur in younger patients but often in the setting of a connective tissue disorder, with men more commonly affected than women. The natural history of PAU is not well defined, as they can remain stable, enlarge, or progress to either IMH, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or aortic rupture. The risk of rupture has been reported to be up to 40%, and the optimal management strategy must be individualized considering the clinical presentation, imaging features, and the patient's comorbidities.

### Patient-and process-related contributors to the underuse of aortic valve replacement and subsequent mortality in ambulatory patients with severe aortic stenosis [^116DJhMH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in the Western world and is the most frequent indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Current clinical practice guidelines recommend deferring AVR until symptom onset or overt left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left untreated, 50% of patients with severe AS die within 1 to 2 years of symptom onset. Although potentially lifesaving, past studies have estimated that up to a third of patients with an indication for AVR do not undergo treatment; ultimately, these patients have a higher rate of hospitalization, are intensive users of health care resources, and cost the US Medicare program an estimated ≈$1.3 billion per year, all despite their limited long‐term survival.

Until recently, data on AVR use in patients with severe AS were primarily driven by surgical AVR (SAVR), because this was the sole treatment option for AS. With the advent of transcatheter AVR (TAVR), patients normally ineligible for SAVR because of high mortality risk, advanced age, or comorbid conditions can be eligible for a less‐invasive treatment option for AS with lower procedural morbidity and mortality. Because of this, TAVR was anticipated to improve adherence to guideline‐based use of AVR in patients with symptomatic severe AS. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that a substantial number of patients with symptomatic severe AS still do not undergo AVR.

The evaluation and management of patients with severe AS has become increasingly complex and heavily relies on provider referral upon detection of AS. The presence of discordant imaging measures of AS severity has been previously documented and is estimated to occur in up to 40% of patients with AS. Moreover, the rapid evolution of TAVR devices and procedural techniques mandates an intimate knowledge of the field to inform the difficult risk–benefit analysis that surrounds treatment decisions. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology practice guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease recommend that providers refer patients with severe valvular heart disease to a multidisciplinary heart valve team for further evaluation when intervention is being considered. However, recent data suggest that medically managed patients with an indication for AVR are not consistently referred to a multidisciplinary heart valve team or valve specialist for evaluation. Thus, factors beyond a patient's biology and more inherent to the patient referral process may affect AVR usage rates and, in turn, postprocedural outcomes in patients with severe AS.

Narrative considerations for operative approach in acute type A aortic dissection. A nonresected primary tear is a risk factor for reoperation. A more extensive replacement that involves the aortic root, arch, or both adds operative complexity, ischemic time, and potentially circulatory arrest time but may reduce the risk of future aortic dilation, aortic insufficiency, or repeat dissection. Open distal anastomosis allows direct inspection for intimal tears and resection of the lesser curve of the arch (ie, hemiarch technique) without increased operative death, and in-hospital death is lower with hemiarch repair than with total arch replacement. Antegrade stenting of the proximal descending thoracic aorta may promote false-lumen thrombosis and positive remodeling, but long-term aorta-related data are scarce. To reduce the risk of late aortic complications, surgical resection should include the tear site, any aneurysmal aorta, and the proximal-most extent of the dissection.

Aortic valve replacement (AVR) prosthesis selection — mechanical versus bioprosthetic — is guided by shared decision-making and age-specific recommendations as follows: The choice of prosthetic valve should be based on a shared decision-making process that accounts for the patient's values and preferences. For patients of any age requiring AVR for whom vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, cannot be managed appropriately, or is not desired, a bioprosthetic AVR is recommended. For patients < 50 years of age who do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation and require AVR, it is reasonable to choose a mechanical aortic prosthesis over a bioprosthetic valve. For patients 50 to 65 years of age who require AVR and who do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation, it is reasonable to individualize the choice of either a mechanical or bioprosthetic AVR with consideration of individual patient factors and after informed shared decision-making. In patients > 65 years of age who require AVR, it is reasonable to choose a bioprosthesis over a mechanical valve. In patients < 50 years of age who prefer a bioprosthetic AVR and have appropriate anatomy, replacement of the aortic valve by a pulmonary autograft (the Ross procedure) may be considered at a Comprehensive Valve Center.

### Impact of managing provider type on severe aortic stenosis management and mortality [^116A59we]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common form of valve disease that demonstrates increasing prevalence with advancing age. Of adults ≥ 65 years, the incidence rate of severe AS (sAS) was 4.4% per year. Symptoms were present in 68% of patients with sAS, for whom aortic valve replacement (AVR) is generally recommended. When left untreated, only one third of patients with sAS will survive 5 years. Despite the association of untreated sAS with poor long‐term survival, prior research indicates that a considerable proportion of patients with sAS do not receive appropriate therapeutic intervention. Deficient or delayed care can have severe consequences, including increased rates of hospitalization, worsening heart failure, and death. The reasons for this deficit are not entirely understood, especially because the advent of transcatheter AVR has made AVR more accessible, even for patients who are considered high risk and unsuitable for surgical AVR. Among potentially appropriate candidates for AVR, common reasons for surgery not being performed include patient refusal, misinterpretations of symptom or lesion severity, patient raceand sex, perception of excessive surgical risk, and challenges to local accessibility of treatment. The type of provider managing a candidate for AVR may also influence whether a patient undergoes valve intervention. According to current 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, referral to a cardiac specialist is a critical step in the management pathway for all patients with sAS (Class 1 recommendation, Level of Evidence: C). However, recent studies suggest that certain types of managing providers, such as primary care providers (PCPs), may be less familiar with guidelines regarding referral for cardiac specialist follow‐up. We performed a retrospective analysis based on electronic health record (EHR) data to understand how managing provider type might affect the clinical management and survival of patients with newly diagnosed sAS. Distinguishing patients by managing provider type, we evaluated differences in rates of follow‐up evaluation by a cardiac specialist, AVR (transcatheter AVR or surgical AVR), and 1‐year mortality. We also assessed the independent association of follow‐up and AVR with 1‐year mortality. We hypothesized that PCPs and cardiac specialists might have different approaches to sAS management that could ultimately affect patient outcomes.

Conclusions

In studying a nationwide, US‐based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed sAS, we found significant variability in rates of sAS management practices and risk of mortality based on managing provider type. Patients managed entirely by PCPs, as compared with cardiac specialists, were less likely to receive follow‐up evaluation by a cardiac specialist and AVR (key components of ACC/AHA guidelines for sAS management) and demonstrated higher mortality at the end of the 1‐year follow‐up period. Considering the independent association found for both cardiac specialist follow‐up and AVR with reduced risk of 1‐year mortality, this study highlights the critical importance of appropriate follow‐up care in achieving optimal clinical outcomes for patients with sAS. Our findings underscore the importance of a collaborative approach to sAS patients, including partnership between PCPs and cardiac specialists to optimize patient care and evaluation, as well as initiatives to align clinical practices more closely with ACC/AHA management guidelines. Further studies are warranted to examine if these results are generalizable to other populations.

### Progress in mitral and aortic regurgitation [^114s8BE4]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past 15 years there has been rapid and dramatic change in the therapy for valvular heart disease. When mitral and aortic regurgitation are severe, they inevitably cause left ventricular damage, eventually resulting in death. However, when surgical correction of these lesions is timed appropriately, longevity can approach that of a normal population after surgery. As surgical techniques have improved, surgery is now indicated earlier in the course of these diseases. It is clear that some patients with mitral and aortic regurgitation require surgery even though they are entirely asymptomatic. However, it must be emphasized that mitral and aortic regurgitation are quite different from one another. These different lesions result in different loading conditions, different pathophysiologies, and have different means for surgical correction. All of these issues impact on the proper timing of surgery and are discussed.

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) appropriate use criteria introduction — transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) use and selection are outlined, including scenarios where no intervention may be reasonable. TAVR is described as ushering in a new era for symptomatic severe AS and providing options for patients with advanced disease and extreme surgical risk when no effective definitive therapy had been available, and it has been shown to be a safe alternative to SAVR in patients for whom surgery is feasible but who are intermediate or high risk. The document emphasizes that selecting patients for TAVR or SAVR and identifying cases where aortic valve replacement (AVR) is futile remains a work in progress, and decision points include when to select TAVR versus SAVR, when surgery is preferable, when balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a reasonable diagnostic or treatment option, and when no intervention is reasonable at the extremes of illness. The project was initiated to ensure effective referral for SAVR, TAVR, or conservative management with no intervention and notes the need for timely updates as technology and outcomes evolve.

Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common and most serious valve diseases. The prevalence of AS increases with age, affecting approximately 0.2%, 1.3%, 3.9% and 9.8% of patients aged 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years and 80–89 years, respectively. In Europe, it is estimated that there are approximately 4.9 million patients over 75 years with AS and 1.0 million patients with severe AS.

AS is characterised by a narrowing of the aortic valve opening, restricting blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and potentially affecting pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation. Eventually, with progression of stenosis severity, patients will develop symptoms of angina (35% of patients), syncope (15% of patients) or dyspnoea and/or heart failure (50% of patients), which without timely surgical intervention, result in an average survival of 2–3 years and are associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Treatment options for patients with severe AS include surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

In 2017, the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) published guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease (VHD), which recommend intervention with SAVR or TAVR in patients with severe AS, with the exception of patients with severe comorbidities where intervention is unlikely to improve either their quality of life or their chances of survival. For asymptomatic patients with severe AS, intervention with SAVR is recommended if the patient has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, is physically active, or have the presence of risk factors (very severe AS, relevant progression, markedly increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or severe pulmonary hypertension attributed to AS) and a low individual surgical risk.

Several studies have reported non-adherence to guidelines in clinical practice and cite discrepancies between treatment decisions and the current scientific recommendations occurring in 23%–42% of patients with AS. Non-adherence to guidelines involved 'overuse' and 'underuse' of interventions for AS, as well as insufficient diagnostics to make an informed treatment decision.
