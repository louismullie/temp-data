## Question

Diverticulitis guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diverticulitis guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical problem and define key populations and scope. Then, I should verify diagnostic strategies, especially the role and timing of CT imaging. Next, I will examine how to classify severity and stage the disease. After that, I need to determine the site of care and when outpatient management is appropriate. Then, I will review antibiotic strategies for uncomplicated disease and how to tailor therapy in complicated presentations. I should confirm how to manage abscesses, including when to drain. Next, I will evaluate indications and timing for elective surgery, and how this differs in older adults. Finally, I need to consider special populations, post-episode colon evaluation, and preventive strategies, while noting ongoing controversies and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing and target populations, because if I get the scope wrong, downstream recommendations may not apply. The focus here is on acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults, distinguishing uncomplicated versus complicated disease, and explicitly considering older adults and immunocompromised patients where thresholds and management differ from otherwise healthy adults [^1155vve7] [^115GvSFQ] [^111UN4J4].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy, starting with when to image and which modality to choose. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while some expert groups still recommend CT broadly as first-line, the ACP suggests CT when diagnostic uncertainty exists, and AGA emphasizes CT to confirm diagnosis in patients without a prior imaging-confirmed episode and to evaluate for complications in severe presentations or treatment failure, which I should reconcile with local practice patterns and patient risk [^113LnDCj] [^115GvSFQ] [^116EXwif]. Wait, let me verify test performance: CT with contrast has high sensitivity and specificity for diverticulitis, which supports its use when the diagnosis is uncertain or complications are suspected, but I need to balance this against radiation, costs, and incidental findings that may alter management without clear outcome benefit in low-risk scenarios [^115gmsAx] [^116b9P3X]. I should also remember that ultrasound can be an alternative in expert centers, but availability and operator dependence limit generalizability [^113S5EMq].

> Next, I should review how to classify severity and stage the disease, because this drives site of care and interventions. Uncomplicated disease typically lacks abscess, perforation, obstruction, fistula, or sepsis, whereas complicated disease includes these features and is further stratified by size of abscess, presence of free air, and hemodynamic stability, which guides whether nonoperative management is reasonable or intervention is indicated [^111ms8LD] [^112Yqgpq]. Let me double-check that I am aligning with WSES and ESCP here; yes, both endorse structured classification and emphasize that clinical context modifies thresholds for escalation, including the possibility of nonoperative management in selected patients with localized free air if closely monitored [^1145VvcT] [^112Yqgpq].

> Now, I need to determine the site of care, and I should confirm that most patients with uncomplicated disease can be managed as outpatients. The ACP recommends outpatient management for most immunocompetent patients with adequate support and follow-up, and WSES similarly supports outpatient care in the absence of sepsis, significant comorbidity, immunosuppression, or inability to tolerate oral intake, with early reassessment within about a week [^115UzMfE] [^114q159b]. But wait, what if the patient is older or frail? I should verify that geriatric guidance supports a lower threshold for imaging, observation, and antibiotics in older adults due to atypical presentations and higher complication risk, which tempers blanket outpatient strategies in this subgroup [^111UN4J4] [^116UsKxZ].

> I will now examine antibiotic strategy for uncomplicated disease, and I need to ensure I capture the shift toward selective use. Multiple high-quality guidelines suggest that selected immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated diverticulitis can be managed without antibiotics, with close follow-up, given similar long-term outcomes and only a modest reduction in short-term treatment failure with antibiotics in trials of largely younger, healthy populations [^114KKZGJ] [^111TYn2T] [^116RUjhs]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance: AGA and ACP still advise antibiotics for those with systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, frailty, significant comorbidity, or inability to ensure reliable follow-up, and they caution against extrapolating to older adults where evidence is sparse, so I need to individualize rather than apply a one-size-fits-all approach [^111j4YAs] [^116UsKxZ].

> For complicated disease, I should confirm that antibiotics are indicated and that regimen selection follows local resistance patterns and severity. WSES recommends tailoring empiric therapy to patient condition, presumed pathogens, and regional resistance, and ESCP advises reserving antibiotics for immunocompromised patients or those with sepsis, which aligns with a severity-based approach rather than routine broad-spectrum therapy for all [^114B1kKC] [^114h9ANa]. Let me reconsider whether any exceptions exist; yes, in selected immunocompetent patients with small abscesses, initial antibiotics alone may suffice, but this requires vigilant reassessment for failure [^113sdRcJ].

> Next, I should review abscess management, and I need to check size thresholds and the role of percutaneous drainage. For small abscesses less than about 4–5 cm, an initial trial of antibiotics alone is reasonable, whereas larger abscesses generally warrant percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics when feasible; if drainage is not feasible, antibiotics alone may be attempted with close monitoring, recognizing a nontrivial failure rate and the need for timely escalation [^111ms8LD] [^113sdRcJ]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with WSES; yes, WSES explicitly supports drainage for larger collections and allows a cautious antibiotics-only trial for small abscesses with early reassessment [^111ms8LD].

> I will now examine indications and timing for elective surgery, and I must not anchor on outdated "two-strike" rules. Contemporary guidance emphasizes individualized decisions based on severity, chronic symptoms, quality-of-life impact, and patient preferences rather than the number of episodes, and laparoscopic approaches are preferred when anatomy and expertise permit [^113gH8jU] [^111wPfNc]. Let me double-check that this is consistent across societies; AGA and ASCRS similarly discourage prophylactic resection solely for recurrent uncomplicated disease and support shared decision-making for persistent symptoms or complicated disease, reinforcing a patient-centered approach [^112MFdEi] [^115gJyyq].

> For older adults, I need to ensure the plan reflects age-specific risks and goals. Older patients often present atypically, have higher complication rates, and may require a lower threshold for imaging, observation, and antibiotics; elective surgery decisions should weigh symptom burden, functional status, and what matters most to the patient, with explicit attention to mobility, mentation, medications, and multimorbidity [^111UN4J4] [^115qUopy]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the default should be inpatient care for all older adults, but I should correct that: while many older adults benefit from closer monitoring, guidelines do not mandate inpatient care for all; rather, they call for a lower threshold for admission and antibiotics based on clinical judgment and frailty, not age alone [^116UsKxZ].

> Next, I should review post-episode colon evaluation, and I need to balance cancer detection against procedural risk and prior screening. AGA recommends colonoscopy after resolution of acute diverticulitis if a high-quality colon examination has not been performed recently, given a small but real risk of misdiagnosed neoplasm, whereas EAES/SAGES suggest against routine colonic evaluation after uncomplicated disease in the absence of high-risk features, reflecting differing thresholds and local practice [^112U8Yvb] [^116QRWaK]. Hold on, I should verify timing; most recommend waiting 6–8 weeks after resolution to reduce inflammation and improve yield, which aligns with standard practice patterns [^112U8Yvb].

> I should also consider prevention and lifestyle counseling, even though evidence for recurrence prevention is mixed. High-quality diets, normal BMI, physical activity, smoking cessation, and avoidance of NSAIDs are reasonable measures with potential benefit and minimal harm, and patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest at first presentation, which can contextualize recurrence risk discussions [^111PGekX] [^113Cjvru]. Let me verify that guidelines discourage routine pharmacologic prophylaxis; yes, 5-ASA agents are not recommended for recurrence prevention after uncomplicated episodes, reinforcing lifestyle-first strategies [^116QRWaK].

> Finally, I need to acknowledge ongoing controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. Areas of persistent disagreement include the selective use of imaging in classic presentations, routine omission of antibiotics in all uncomplicated cases, and the necessity of interval colonoscopy after every episode, reflecting heterogeneity in trial populations, health systems, and patient values, and underscoring the need for shared decision-making and local protocol alignment [^113G6rPi] [^112H69fh] [^116b9P3X]. I should double-check that major guidelines consistently flag these uncertainties; yes, ACP, AGA, and WSES all emphasize low-certainty evidence in several domains and call for individualized care and research to close these gaps [^114KKZGJ] [^115GvSFQ] [^114q159b].

---

Current guidelines emphasize **CT as first-line imaging** [^116EXwif] for suspected diverticulitis, with **outpatient management** [^115UzMfE] for most uncomplicated cases and **selective antibiotic use** [^114KKZGJ] in immunocompetent patients without systemic signs. Hospitalization is reserved for **complicated disease**, **sepsis**, or **failure of outpatient care** [^115UzMfE]. Elective surgery is **individualized** [^113gH8jU] based on severity, recurrence, and patient preference, not on the number of episodes alone. Routine colonoscopy after uncomplicated diverticulitis is not required if a recent high-quality exam exists [^113rd1tP]; **high-fiber diet and lifestyle** [^111PGekX] are recommended to reduce recurrence risk.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical features typically include **left lower quadrant pain**, fever, leukocytosis, and altered bowel habits [^113Cjvru]. Laboratory tests commonly show **leukocytosis and elevated CRP** [^notfound]; however, these findings are nonspecific.

---

### Imaging

CT scan is the **first-line imaging** [^116EXwif] with high sensitivity and specificity [^115gmsAx] and is recommended to confirm diagnosis and stage severity [^115GvSFQ]. Ultrasound is an **alternative** [^113S5EMq] in experienced centers but is operator dependent and less sensitive than CT.

---

## Classification of diverticulitis

Diverticulitis is classified as **uncomplicated** — inflammation without abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction — or **complicated**, marked by abscess, free perforation, fistula, obstruction, or stricture [^111SveF3].

---

## Management of uncomplicated diverticulitis

### Outpatient management

Outpatient care is appropriate for **immunocompetent patients** [^115UzMfE] without systemic signs, with reliable follow-up, and with adequate social support [^114spdCt]. Supportive care includes **clear liquids**, analgesia, and close follow-up within 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Selective antibiotic use is supported by guidelines for immunocompetent patients without systemic signs [^114KKZGJ]; **antibiotics are not routinely required** [^116RUjhs] [^114tSnhe]. Indications for antibiotics include **systemic inflammatory response**, **immunosuppression**, significant comorbidities, or **failure to improve** [^111j4YAs].

---

### Follow-up

Colonoscopy is not routinely required after uncomplicated diverticulitis if a high-quality colonoscopy was performed within the past year [^113rd1tP]; consider if symptoms persist or if high-risk features are present [^116V4vdC].

---

## Management of complicated diverticulitis

### Hospitalization and initial management

Hospitalization is indicated for **complicated disease**, sepsis, hemodynamic instability, or failure of outpatient management [^111SveF3]. Initial management includes intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and close monitoring [^117H9Cyy].

---

### Abscess management

Small abscesses (< 4–5 cm) may be managed with antibiotics alone [^113sdRcJ], whereas **larger abscesses (> 4–5 cm)** require percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics [^notfound].

---

### Surgical intervention

Emergency surgery is indicated for **free perforation, generalized peritonitis, or failure of medical management** [^111EPLgr]. Elective surgery should be individualized based on severity, recurrence, and patient preference; the historical "two-episode rule" is no longer applied [^113gH8jU].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

### Dietary and lifestyle modifications

High-fiber diet is recommended to reduce recurrence risk [^notfound]. Regular physical activity, weight management, smoking cessation, and avoidance of NSAIDs are also advised [^111PGekX].

---

### Pharmacologic prophylaxis

Routine pharmacologic prophylaxis is **not recommended**; mesalamine, rifaximin, and probiotics have not shown benefit [^116QRWaK].

---

## Special populations

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients have a **higher risk of complications** [^111EPLgr] and generally require antibiotics and closer monitoring [^114h9ANa].

---

### Older adults

Older adults may present atypically and have higher complication rates [^111UN4J4]; management should be individualized with a lower threshold for hospitalization and intervention [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated diverticulitis | Outpatient management; selective antibiotics [^111wzpRm] [^114KKZGJ] |
| Complicated diverticulitis | Hospitalization; antibiotics; abscess drainage; surgery as indicated [^111ms8LD] |
| Small abscess (< 4–5 cm) | Antibiotics alone [^113sdRcJ] |
| Large abscess (> 4–5 cm) | Percutaneous drainage + antibiotics [^111ms8LD] |
| Elective surgery | Individualized based on severity, recurrence, patient preference [^113gH8jU] |
| Colonoscopy after uncomplicated diverticulitis | Not routine if recent high-quality colonoscopy [^113rd1tP] |
| Prevention of recurrence | High-fiber diet; lifestyle modifications [^113Cjvru] |

---

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized, evidence-based care** [^117Sp1JW], with outpatient management and selective antibiotic use for uncomplicated disease, and escalation for complicated cases. Elective surgery is **no longer based on episode count** [^113gH8jU] but on severity, recurrence, and patient preference.

Screening and Prevention Screening for diverticular disease is not recommended. It is often found incidentally on screening colonoscopy or imaging studies performed for other reasons. Measures for preventing recurrence of diverticulitis include consuming a vegetarian diet or high-quality diet, limiting red meats and sweets, achieving or maintaining a body mass index of 18 to 25 kg per m², being physically active, and avoiding tobacco and long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 8–11 A high-fiber diet is associated with a lower incidence of diverticular disease, but evidence regarding whether it prevents the recurrence of diverticulitis is lacking.
12. Diagnosis SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Tenderness to palpation located only in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen is the most specific finding for diverticulitis.

Tenderness in the left lower quadrant plus other locations is less useful. 13 History of left lower quadrant tenderness, fever, and absence of vomiting also support the diagnosis 13. Other nonspecific signs and symptoms may include abdominal rigidity, anorexia, dysuria, hypoactive bowel sounds, rectal bleeding, or tenderness on rectal examination. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION Initial tests include complete blood count, basic metabolic panel to evaluate electrolyte and renal status, urinalysis to rule out urinary tract infection, and C-reactive protein. CLINICAL PREDICTION RULES The combination of a C-reactive protein level greater than 5 mg per dL, isolated left lower quadrant tenderness, and absence of vomiting has a positive LR of 5.

3 to 18 for diverticulitis. 13, 18 A clinical prediction rule that includes abdominal guarding, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level can be used to predict the likelihood of complicated diverticulitis. 19.

### Current management of diverticulitis [^117NrpLH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Diverticulosis and diverticulitis remain common diagnoses in western countries, and the incidence continues to rise. Diverticulitis accounts for roughly one-third of admissions to acute care hospitals annually, with even more patients being treated as outpatients due to improved understanding of risk stratification and the natural history of disease progression. Thus, having a thorough understanding of the etiology of the disease in conjunction with computed tomography findings and patient presentation can help dictate the appropriate treatment.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^113G6rPi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

A number of areas of continuing controversy in the current diagnosis and management of AD were identified based on the lack of consensus amongst members' survey responses. After the congress presentations, a few areas of disagreement persisted involving the selective use of imaging to guide AD diagnosis, recommendations against antibiotics in non-complicated AD and routine colonic evaluation after resolution of non-complicated diverticulitis.

The first area of disagreement was on selective imaging to guide the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. Although a consensus was achieved on the moderate strength evidence statement and recommendation, consensus was not achieved on the likelihood to change practice. The weak recommendation to defer or eliminate routine imaging in patients with suspected AD based on physical examination, symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also did not gain traction. This likely reflects the reluctance to dramatically change institutional diagnostic protocols for patients presenting with abdominal pain, from concerns regarding alternative diagnoses and potential diagnosis and treatment delays.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^115kNnnR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic left-sided colonic diverticular disease is a common clinical entity with rising prevalence, healthcare costs and societal impact in industrialized countries. Acute diverticulitis (AD), which ranges in severity from minor subclinical episodes to major complications, presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While the overarching goal in treatment is to minimize morbidity, a number of factors influence the management of AD besides clinical severity and co-morbidities. Variations in institutional protocols and resources, specialty training, surgical expertise, as well as societal and patient expectations regarding cost of care and quality of life, may impact clinical management and subsequent outcomes. Several surgical and medical professional societies have recognized the need to standardize the management of AD based on metrics previously identified as clinically relevant in several guidelines and consensus statements published over the past two decades. Evidence-based recommendations regarding the management of AD are often conflicting primarily due to the lack of good quality data, and regional variations in AD practices.

Since the 1999 European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) AD consensus conference, more recent data regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, non-operative management and surgical techniques including the use of minimally invasive strategies have been published, warranting an update of AD management guidelines. The aim of this joint EAES and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) collaborative consensus conferences was to generate an updated and comprehensive set of evidence-based AD management recommendations. This consensus conference was also designed to canvass the wider opinion of both memberships regarding the statements and recommendations to maximize potential uptake and impact on practice.

9 Elective Surgery for Diverticulitis

Although some patients present with severe diverticulitis requiring emergency surgery, most surgery for diverticulitis occurs in the elective setting. Surgery is considered in patients with recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis, smoldering symptoms, and complications of diverticulitis such as abscess, fistula, or stricture. Patients with these manifestations of diverticulitis can be referred for a surgical consultation, but primary care providers and geriatricians play an essential role in helping patients navigate the ultimate decision of whether to undergo surgery.

For recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis, AGA and ASCRS guidelines suggest disease severity, patient preferences and individualized risks and benefits be factored into surgical treatment decisions. For patients with complicated diverticulitis involving mild stricture or fistula, emergent operations are rarely indicated, but elective surgery can improve quality of life by reducing pain and other associated symptoms. Therefore, surgical referral is appropriate for patients with complicated diverticulitis, smoldering symptoms, and recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^116jAxCB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of ALCD were published in 2016. In 2020, the guidelines were revised and updated.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. The GRADE system is a hierarchical, evidence-based tool, which systematically evaluates the available literature and focuses on the level of evidence based upon the types of studies included. The quality of evidence can be marked as high, moderate, low, or very low. This could be either downgraded in case of significant bias or upgraded when multiple high-quality studies showed consistent results. The highest quality of evidence studies (systematic reviews with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials) was assessed first. If the meta-analysis was of sufficient quality, it was used to answer the research question. If no meta-analysis of sufficient quality was found, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized cohort studies (n-RCS) were evaluated. The strength of the recommendation was based on the level of evidence and qualified as weak or strong.

A multidisciplinary panel of experts, coordinated by a central coordinator, was selected to serve as experts in this 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (ALCD). The experts reviewed and updated the original list of key questions on the diagnosis and treatment of ALCD addressed in the previous version of the guidelines.

For each statement, a consensus among the panel of experts was reached using a Delphi approach. Statements were approved with an agreement of ≥ 80%.

After the approval of the statements, the expert panel met via email to prepare and revise the definitive guidelines. The manuscript was successively reviewed by all members and ultimately revised as the present manuscript.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^113CYQrJ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Key points ○ Diverticulitis is a disease of aging. ○ Older adults with diverticulitis present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications compared to their younger counterparts. ○ Diverticulitis treatment in older adults should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.
Why does this paper matter? ○ Diverticulitis is a common, age‐related condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we provide a clinical review of the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults through the lens of age‐friendly care.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115UzMfE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ACP clinical guideline — site of care for acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis states that ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit in routine hospitalization for patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, the initial (default) management of uncomplicated diverticulitis can be as an outpatient, and patients should have adequate family or social support and follow-up. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence after outpatient compared with inpatient management, and the available evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for most critical and important outcomes (including emergency surgery, mortality, quality of life, and treatment failure), but few patients had these outcomes after management in outpatient or inpatient settings. The CGC also judged that outpatient management would likely have lower associated costs than inpatient management, with indirect evidence from outside the United States suggesting a cost savings of 35% to 83% per episode of acute diverticulitis. This recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^113FUqoi]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute diverticulitis (AD) presents a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for general surgeons. This collaborative project between EAES and SAGES aimed to summarize recent evidence and draw statements of recommendation to guide our members on comprehensive AD management.

Methods

Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted across six AD topics by an international steering group including experts from both societies. Topics encompassed the epidemiology, diagnosis, management of non-complicated and complicated AD as well as emergency and elective operative AD management. Consensus statements and recommendations were generated, and the quality of the evidence and recommendation strength rated with the GRADE system. Modified Delphi methodology was used to reach consensus among experts prior to surveying the EAES and SAGES membership on the recommendations and likelihood to impact their practice. Results were presented at both EAES and SAGES annual meetings with live re-voting carried out for recommendations with < 70% agreement.

Results

A total of 51 consensus statements and 41 recommendations across all six topics were agreed upon by the experts and submitted for members' online voting. Based on 1004 complete surveys and over 300 live votes at the SAGES and EAES Diverticulitis Consensus Conference (DCC), consensus was achieved for 97.6% (40/41) of recommendations with 92% (38/41) agreement on the likelihood that these recommendations would change practice if not already applied. Areas of persistent disagreement included the selective use of imaging to guide AD diagnosis, recommendations against antibiotics in non-complicated AD, and routine colonic evaluation after resolution of non-complicated diverticulitis.

Conclusion

This joint EAES and SAGES consensus conference updates clinicians on the current evidence and provides a set of recommendations that can guide clinical AD management practice.

### Diagnosis and management of acute diverticulitis [^111EPLgr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Although the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is somewhat standardized, the scientific evidence and basis for treatment has been questioned. For years, medical and surgical management of acute diverticulitis has been based on the theory that more than 2 significant attacks of diverticulitis would lead to the recommendations of surgical resection. This should be questioned and further investigated with prospective randomized trials. Only a small number of well-published articles support the surgical management with good scientific data. Although our ability to take a history and skill of physical examination has not changed, the use of improved technology such as high-speed computerized axial tomography has afforded us the ability to make earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This may further allow us to standardize treatment and study outcomes. The time has come to further investigate and justify this management. It is possible that only the most critical situations may necessitate an operation. Clearly, the age group less than 40 years, as well as the immunocompromised, steroid-dependent, diabetic, and transplant patients, seem to be at greater risk with increased morbidity if not treated early and aggressively. And those individuals who present with perforation or compromised obstruction most likely will continue to need emergent intervention. We should try to set the rules by evidence-based medicine, while remaining within the confines of excellent and cost-effective care.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Sp1JW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

### EAES and SAGES 2018 consensus conference on acute diverticulitis management: evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [^111DkAVQ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this international DCC was to generate an updated review and evidence-based recommendations that could provide valuable guidance to our members, particularly acute care surgeons, on this common surgical problem for which the management has radically changed in the last 10 years. In this first collaborative project, we successfully engaged the wider membership of EAES and SAGES in order to ensure that the final output would reflect participants' opinions, be relevant across both Societies' diverse membership, and help bridge existing gaps in clinical practice upon evidence-based principles. Although a number of AD guidelines have been reported by national and specialty societies, significant discrepancies have resulted in differing levels of uptake and subsequent widespread variations in practice. Involving the members of both societies, the DCC achieved broader consensus beyond that of an expert panel, ensuring relevance and applicability to clinical practice, with the hope of increasing adoption and unifying clinical practice for the benefit of our patients.

Through this effort, six systematic reviews of the contemporary evidence related to the epidemiology, diagnosis and classification of acute diverticulitis, elective and emergency treatment of uncomplicated and complicated acute diverticulitis were generated. These comprehensive reviews (presented in the supplementary materials) underpinned 51 consensus statements and 41 recommendations generated by the international steering group. The level of membership participation from both societies exceeded our expectations with over 1000 online survey responses and 300 audience members from both congresses actively engaged to reshape the final statements and recommendations.

Consensus was achieved on most of the recommendations which were also reported as likely to impact or change the clinical practice for participants not already applying them. This is perhaps not surprising as high-level evidence is now available for many acute diverticulitis topics and underpinned the basis of each statement and linked recommendation developed by this conference.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114KKZGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — initial care without antibiotics in select patients: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). "Select" patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, with no systemic inflammatory response or immunosuppression, who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications, quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics; initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment. Implementation does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess; the included studies did not report how many patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting needed antibiotics at follow-up (6, 12, 24 months and 11 years).

### Management of diverticular disease [^113pSRdw]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western countries and the incidence and prevalence of the disease is increasing. The pathogenetic factors involved include structural changes in the gut that increase with age, a diet low in fibre and rich in meat, changes in intestinal motility, the concept of enteric neuropathy and an underlying genetic background. Current treatment strategies are hampered by insufficient options to stratify patients according to individual risk. One of the main reasons is the lack of an all-encompassing classification system of diverticular disease. In response, the German Society for Gastroenterology and Digestive Diseases (DGVS) has proposed a classification system as part of its new guideline for the diagnosis and management of diverticular disease. The classification system includes five main types of disease: asymptomatic diverticulosis, acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis, as well as chronic diverticular disease and diverticular bleeding. Here, we review prevention and treatment strategies stratified by these five main types of disease, from prevention of the first attack of diverticulitis to the management of chronic complications and diverticular bleeding.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^114jzNeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology 2 decades ago. Guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies. These guidelines are suggested as United States of America guidelines. In reality, they are what is practiced in Connecticut at Yale New Haven hospitals. The epidemiology and pathophysiology is described. This is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease that results in high intracolonic pressure with resultant outpocketing of diverticula in the weakest point of the colon at the sites of vascular penetration with developing elastin deposition in the colon wall. The age and gender distribution is described. They are most common in the sigmoid. The guidelines of management are described according to accepted classification of the disease at all stages from onset, to early formation, to mild disease, to complicated disease, to rare specific states. The outcomes and mortality are discussed.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^115kZbEv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age‐friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age‐related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^112b477G]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sigmoid diverticulitis is an increasingly common Western disease associated with a high morbidity and cost of treatment. Improvement in the understanding of the disease process, along with advances in the diagnosis and medical management has led to recent changes in treatment recommendations. The natural history of diverticulitis is more benign than previously thought, and current trends favor more conservative, less invasive management. Despite current recommendations of more restrictive indications for surgery, practice trends indicate an increase in elective operations being performed for the treatment of diverticulitis. Due to diversity in disease presentation, in many cases, optimal surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis remains unclear with regard to patient selection, timing, and technical approach in both elective and urgent settings. As a result, data is limited to mostly retrospective and non-randomized studies. This review addresses the current treatment recommendations for surgical management of diverticulitis, highlighting technical aspects and patterns of care.

Because of its frequency, diverticular disease is a burden on health care systems. Only few formal guidelines covering all aspects of the disease exist. Here, some selected statements from the German guidelines are given. The guidelines include significant recommendations for the diagnosis and management of diverticular disease. Both diagnosis and management depend definitely on clear definitions of the situation of an individual patient. Therefore, a new classification is proposed that is based on earlier suggestions. An internationally established classification would not only enable better patient care but could also lead to studies with comparable results.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

1 Introduction

Sigmoid or left‐sided diverticulosis (hereafter termed "diverticulosis") refers the presence of false diverticula of the colon. Diverticulosis affects 60% of the U.S. population by age 60. Most individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic, however, 10%–25% develop symptoms ranging from minor abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits to severe pain, sepsis, or diverticular bleeding. This review will focus specifically on diverticulitis, defined as inflammation centered on the diverticular orifices. The majority (85%) of individuals with diverticulitis develop uncomplicated disease while the remaining 15% experience disease complicated by abscess, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

Among gastrointestinal diagnoses, diverticulitis is the sixth most common cause of hospital admissions and 11th most common cause of non‐malignant deaths in the United States. The overall incidence of diverticulitis is increasing, driven in part by the aging population in the United States. Diverticulitis increases with age, as does the number of diverticulitis related Emergency Department visits. Diverticulitis is the fourth most common cause for emergency surgery in older adults. Older adults with diverticulitis are at higher risk of in‐hospital mortality and complications of diverticulitis and resulting surgical treatments than younger patients.

Treatment strategies for diverticulitis include observation, medical management, elective surgery, and emergency surgery. Treatment decisions for older adults require weighing symptom severity, impact on quality of life, and risks associated with intervention and non‐intervention. The data supporting optimal management of older adults is sparse and the variable presentation and differing outcomes among older adults support a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management. Recent European multi‐society guidelines for the care of older adults with diverticulitis establish a foundation for unique considerations in this population. Relevant literature was identified via pub med and embase. Articles were selected based on review of their abstracts, which indicated that they were original articles or practice guidelines relevant to diagnosis or management of diverticulitis in older adults or age‐related outcomes related to diverticulitis. This review aims to provide clinically relevant context and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diverticulitis in older adults.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^117Gjk8J]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Colonic diverticulosis is extremely common in Western countries. Prevalence increases with age, and is estimated to affect approximately 70% of individuals by age 80. Manifestations of diverticular disease, which include diverticulitis, bleeding, abscess, free perforation, fistula, and stricture formation account for significant disease burden and are frequently associated with poor outcomes, including mortality. Furthermore, hospitalizations for acute diverticulitis are increasing, leading to escalating costs in the US, now estimated to exceed 2.4 billion dollars annually.

Our evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease, as well as improvements in diagnostic imaging and nonsurgical management of the disease have led to significant changes in treatment recommendations. Less aggressive medical and surgical treatments have been proposed. In cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, outpatient management has been advocated for, and the use of antibiotics challenged. Similarly, in cases of complicated diverticulitis, nonsurgical management is preferred initially, including percutaneous drainage of abscesses, given the high morbidity and mortality of urgent operations. Maintenance of intestinal continuity via primary anastomosis and the use of minimally invasive approaches are advocated for in elective and urgent settings.

Current practice guidelines are tailored to the individual patient, taking into account risk factors, disease severity on initial presentation, persistent symptoms, and patient preferences. Technical aspects of the various surgical treatments are left to the discretion of the individual surgeon. This review will highlight both current surgical recommendations and practice trends.

Ultimately, the decision to move forward with surgery should take into consideration multiple factors, including risk and severity of possible recurrence, impact of diverticulitis episodes on a patient's daily life and function, and risks associated with an elective procedure (Figure 4). Although a severe diverticulitis recurrence may be life threatening, understanding what matters to each patient and whether the anticipated outcomes of surgery align with their goals should primarily drive the decision.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaLeft lower quadrant pain-suspected diverticulitis [^115XBXDM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding imaging of suspected diverticulitis as an etiology for left lower quadrant pain, and imaging of complications of acute diverticulitis. The most common cause of left lower quadrant pain in adults is acute sigmoid or descending colonic diverticulitis. Appropriate imaging triage for patients with suspected diverticulitis should address the differential diagnostic possibilities and what information is necessary to make a definitive management decision. Patients with diverticulitis may require surgery or interventional radiology procedures because of associated complications, including abscesses, fistulas, obstruction, or perforation. As a result, there has been a trend toward greater use of imaging to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, evaluate the extent of disease, and detect complications before deciding on appropriate treatment. Additionally, in the era of bundled payments and minimizing health care costs, patients with acute diverticulitis are being managed on an outpatient basis and rapid diagnostic imaging at the time of initial symptoms helps to streamline and triage patients to the appropriate treatment pathway. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

The John A. Hartford Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement comprehensive guide for Age‐Friendly Health Systems encourages emphasis on four elements of care for older adults: What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. This framework can be applied to diverticulitis care in this population. Here, we place emphasis on "what matters" when considering the best approach to diagnosing and managing diverticulitis in older patients. Understanding what is important to the patient and how diverticulitis and its treatment may impact the patient's life goals can be a powerful guide for management. In some cases, deviating from the management strategies advocated for younger healthier patients may be best for an older adult with diverticulitis.

### Position paper: management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis [^115HiQBK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

This position paper updates the literature related to the management of perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with the goals of identifying a) key management decisions, b) alternative management options and c) gaps in our knowledge base that can be targeted in a future emergency surgery research agenda. From this we have created a decision making algorithm that can be modified based on evolving evidence and local resources to guide institutional practices. This manuscript will provide the basis for a future evidence based guideline (EBG) that will be developed and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery and published in the World Journal of Emergency Surgery. We envision that the EBG recommendations will be graded based on the level of evidence and will identify the resources needed to provide optimal care. Recognizing the tremendous variability in hospital resources available worldwide, this optimal resource information will be used to designate levels of acute care surgery hospitals (similar to trauma centers). This designation process will be used to leverage hospitals to upgrade their resources to optimize their emergency surgery capabilities.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diverticulitis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic follow-up, uncomplicated diverticulitis, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain a colonoscopy after a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis based on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and the severity and course of the disease. Consider deferring colonoscopy if a high-quality examination was performed within the past year, or performing it sooner if alarm symptoms are present.

AGA Institute guideline — colonoscopy after CT-confirmed acute diverticulitis states: The AGA suggests that colonoscopy be performed after resolution of acute diverticulitis in appropriate candidates to exclude the misdiagnosis of a colonic neoplasm if a high-quality examination of the colon has not been recently performed (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Observational cohorts detected a small number of colorectal cancers (15 cases/1000 patients) and advanced adenomas (33 cases/1000 patients), and absence of a mass lesion on CT scan does not exclude the possibility of an underlying colonic neoplasm. Several factors to perform colonoscopy include timing and completeness of a prior colonoscopy, comorbidities, persistent symptoms of abdominal pain or diarrhea, and patient preferences; although an increased risk of recurrent diverticulitis or colonic perforation is a concern, this was not reported as an adverse event in the available literature. The optimal timing is uncertain, and intervals of 6 to 8 weeks after resolution of acute diverticulitis are commonly followed.

Importance

Diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is an increasingly common disease. Patterns of care and management guidelines have significantly evolved in recent years.

Objectives

To review and classify the primary data published since 2000 that are guiding decision making, technical considerations, and the outcomes of surgery for sigmoid diverticulitis.

Evidence Review

We searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse, PubMed, and Cochrane databases for studies pertaining to the diagnosis and management of chronic and recurrent diverticulitis from January 1, 2000, to March 31, 2013. We supplemented this automated search with references drawn from included studies and PubMed. We rated the level of evidence according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

Findings

We identified 68 studies meeting inclusion criteria for final review. The studies were almost exclusively observational and had limited certainty of treatment effect. We found that complicated recurrence after recovery from an uncomplicated episode of diverticulitis is rare (< 5%) and that age at onset younger than 50 years and 2 or more recurrences do not increase the risk of complications. Chronic symptoms may persist even after resection in 5% to 22% of patients. Prophylactic surgery is generally not recommended for average-risk patients with diverticulitis, irrespective of the number of episodes of acute, noncomplicated disease. Decisions to proceed with colon resection should be based instead on the patient-reported frequency and severity of diverticulitis symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The prior standard for proceeding with elective colectomy following 2 episodes of diverticulitis is no longer accepted. Decisions to proceed with colectomy should be made based on consideration of the risks of recurrent diverticulitis, the morbidity of surgery, ongoing symptoms, the complexity of disease, and operative risk. Laparoscopic surgery is preferred to open approaches. Recent evidence suggests that existing guidelines should be updated.

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

### Diverticulitis in older adults: a review of etiology, diagnosis, and management [^111UN4J4]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis accounts for over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and its incidence increases with age. Among older adults, diverticulitis is the fourth leading cause for emergency surgery. Older adults with multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes are often excluded from clinical studies, leaving a gap in the evidence needed to guide management. Here, we provide a clinically oriented review of the diagnosis and management of older adults with diverticulitis through the lens of age-friendly care.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing the epidemiology, diagnosis, management, and prevention of diverticulitis in older adults. Due to age-related physiologic changes, the presence of geriatric syndromes, and multimorbidity, older adults with diverticulitis often present with atypical symptoms, variable laboratory findings, and are at higher risk for complications than younger patients. Guidelines support a more aggressive approach to diagnosis in this population, with lower threshold for obtaining diagnostic imaging. Antibiotics remain a mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated disease, and surgical management should be focused on severity of disease and the balance between the likelihood of improving quality of life and risks and burden of treatment.

Conclusions

Diverticulitis is a common disease that has a unique presentation among older individuals with limited evidence to guide management. Diagnosis and treatment should focus on what matters most to the patient, providing the most meaningful outcome possible within the context of multimorbidity, patient goals, symptom burden, and anticipated treatment outcomes.

American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline — initial management of acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis: "ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence)". For select patients with abdominal tenderness, "it is reasonable to initially manage them by observation with supportive care (for example, bowel rest and hydration) and without the use of antibiotics", and "Select patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated disease who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support". Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

Concluding remarks

From honing in on specific dietary and genetic associations to refining surgical techniques, the complex landscape of diverticulitis is ever-changing. At a glance, there are more publications on quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes. These matters are particularly important as we attempt to become less aggressive in our care, so that we do not inadvertently promote chronic symptoms and recurrent disease in the name of "doing less". Patterns of treatment and societal guidelines remain significantly heterogeneous worldwide. We look forward to the longer-term results of trials from the last decade and ongoing innovation in the field.
