## Question

What is the first line treatment for CAP in the hospital? what labs should I trend?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the hospital and which labs to trend during management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity stratification because it drives empiric therapy. Then, I should verify the recommended empiric regimens for nonsevere versus severe CAP and when to add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage. Next, I will review which diagnostic tests to obtain before antibiotics and why. After that, I need to check which labs to trend, including vitals-based clinical stability criteria and biomarkers like procalcitonin and CRP, and clarify their roles. Finally, I will confirm duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and stewardship principles, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: CAP management is severity-based, so I need to classify the patient as nonsevere or severe using validated criteria. The IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria remain the standard, with one major criterion (mechanical ventilation or vasopressors) or three minor criteria (e.g., respiratory rate ≥ 30, PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion/BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypothermia, hypotension requiring fluids) indicating severe disease and a need for ICU-level care and broader empiric therapy [^a0ac65d5] [^d274d507].

> For nonsevere inpatient CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk factors, I should confirm the first-line options. The ATS/IDSA guideline gives a strong recommendation for either a beta-lactam plus a macrolide (e.g., ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy (e.g., levofloxacin), with the caveat that beta-lactam monotherapy is not recommended routinely for inpatients, so I need to avoid that pitfall [^f30cc1d7] [^cd7a0556].

> For severe CAP, I need to ensure combination therapy is used. The guideline recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and importantly, it advises against fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline for severe disease, so I should not substitute those alternatives in this context [^1388daf3] [^34776dc5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage. I should verify risk factors and local epidemiology before extending therapy. The HCAP category has been abandoned; instead, I should cover MRSA or Pseudomonas only if there are locally validated risk factors such as prior respiratory isolation of the organism, recent hospitalization with parenteral antibiotics, or other institutional risks, and if I start extended-spectrum therapy, I should obtain cultures and de-escalate at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving [^990c32f7] [^b411b928].

> Next, I should review which diagnostic tests to obtain before antibiotics. I need to check for influenza and COVID-19 when circulating, and I should obtain blood and sputum cultures in severe CAP or when empirically treating for MRSA or Pseudomonas, while avoiding routine blood cultures in nonsevere CAP without those risk factors because yield is low and results rarely change management in that subgroup [^f63e1697] [^daeb8b71] [^36968bfb].

> I will now examine which labs to trend. Wait, let me verify the role of procalcitonin. The ATS/IDSA guideline recommends initiating antibiotics regardless of initial procalcitonin and does not endorse procalcitonin to decide whether to start antibiotics; however, serial procalcitonin can be considered to support earlier discontinuation in select contexts, such as when bacterial infection is unlikely and the patient stabilizes early, though this is not a blanket rule and should be integrated with clinical judgment and local protocols [^2d1e9e45] [^b77190f8] [^70ecc6b6].

> Let me consider CRP as a trending tool. Serial CRP can help visualize the inflammatory response trajectory, with a typical rise within 4–6 hours, peak around 36–50 hours, and a half-life near 19 hours; a downward trend after initial rise supports response, whereas a persistent elevation or secondary rise may signal nonresponse or complications, so I should trend CRP daily in hospitalized patients, especially with severe disease, while correlating with clinical status [^51771730].

> I should confirm the clinical stability criteria that guide duration and step-down decisions. The validated stability parameters include temperature ≤ 37.8°C for 48 hours, heart rate ≤ 100, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, respiratory rate ≤ 24, oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air or baseline, ability to eat, and normal mentation; achieving stability within 48–72 hours is expected, and therapy should continue for a minimum of 5 total days, with most patients ready for oral switch at 2–3 days if clinically stable and tolerating oral intake [^37eb851a] [^760f62a6].

> But wait, what if the patient tests positive for influenza or COVID-19? I should double-check that guidance. Even with a positive viral test, standard antibacterial therapy is recommended initially for CAP because bacterial coinfection is common, and if no bacterial pathogen is identified and the patient achieves early clinical stability, antibiotics can be stopped early, typically within 48–72 hours, in collaboration with stewardship and clinical judgment [^70ecc6b6] [^e912a650].

> Next, I should review duration and IV-to-oral transition. The minimum duration is 5 days, with therapy anchored to clinical stability; patients can switch to oral therapy once stable and able to take medications, ideally using the same class or agent when possible, and for suspected or proven MRSA or Pseudomonas, extending to 7 days is reasonable, with de-escalation based on cultures whenever possible [^760f62a6] [^37eb851a].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship principles to avoid overtreatment. Abandoning HCAP-driven broad-spectrum therapy, obtaining cultures when extending coverage, reassessing at 48 hours, and de-escalating if cultures are negative and the patient is improving are key steps; rapid MRSA nasal testing can safely support withholding MRSA therapy when negative in nonsevere CAP, and I should avoid routine corticosteroids unless there is refractory septic shock or another compelling indication [^990c32f7] [^809bf9ca] [^88dd7966].

> Let me reconsider any conflicting statements. Earlier I almost said procalcitonin should not be used at all; wait, that overstates the guidance. While procalcitonin should not be used to withhold initial antibiotics, serial measurements may be considered in select inpatient scenarios to support earlier discontinuation when bacterial infection is unlikely and the patient stabilizes, so I should frame procalcitonin as an adjunct, not a gatekeeper, and always integrate with clinical stability criteria and local protocols [^2d1e9e45] [^b77190f8].

> In summary, I need to ensure my plan aligns with severity: for nonsevere inpatient CAP without resistant risks, use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy; for severe CAP, use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone; add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only with validated local risk factors and de-escalate at 48 hours if cultures are negative; obtain influenza/COVID-19 testing and cultures when indicated; trend CRP daily and apply clinical stability criteria to guide duration and oral step-down; and treat for at least 5 days, extending to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas, with all decisions integrated with clinical judgment and stewardship principles [^f30cc1d7] [^1388daf3] [^990c32f7] [^f63e1697] [^51771730] [^37eb851a] [^760f62a6].

First-line therapy for hospitalized CAP is **beta-lactam plus macrolide** (e.g. ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) [^f30cc1d7] or **beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone** (e.g. ceftriaxone plus levofloxacin) [^cd7a0556] for nonsevere cases, and **beta-lactam plus macrolide** (preferred) [^34776dc5] or **beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone** for severe CAP [^1388daf3]. Beta-lactam monotherapy is not recommended for inpatients [^f30cc1d7]. Trend **CRP daily** to assess response [^notfound]; procalcitonin can be considered to support de-escalation or earlier discontinuation when clinical stability is achieved [^notfound]. Routine WBC trending is not required, but serial clinical stability criteria (vital signs, mental status, oxygenation) should guide duration and step-down decisions [^37eb851a].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy for hospitalized CAP

Empiric therapy should cover **typical and atypical pathogens**, with regimen selection based on severity and local resistance patterns [^f30cc1d7].

| **Severity** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Nonsevere CAP | - Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam, or ertapenem) + macrolide (azithromycin) [^f30cc1d7] [^cd7a0556] <br/> - Or beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) [^f30cc1d7] [^cd7a0556] |
| Severe CAP | - Beta-lactam (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam) + macrolide (azithromycin) (preferred) [^34776dc5] <br/> - Or beta-lactam + respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) [^1388daf3] |

---

Beta-lactam monotherapy is **not recommended** for inpatients with CAP [^f30cc1d7].

---

## Laboratory tests to trend during hospitalization

Serial laboratory monitoring helps assess treatment response and guide decisions on duration and de-escalation. The most informative tests are **CRP and procalcitonin**, while WBC is less specific and not routinely trended.

- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Daily CRP is recommended to monitor response; a downward trend indicates clinical improvement, whereas a persistent rise suggests nonresponse or complications [^notfound].

- **Procalcitonin (PCT)**: Not required, but serial PCT can support earlier discontinuation or de-escalation when clinical stability is achieved and bacterial infection is unlikely [^notfound].

- **White blood cell (WBC) count**: Not routinely trended; use clinical judgment if the initial WBC was markedly abnormal or if the clinical course is atypical.

---

## Clinical stability criteria

Clinical stability should guide **antibiotic duration and step-down** [^37eb851a]. Achieving stability within 48–72 hours supports a 5-day total course and transition to oral therapy [^760f62a6].

- **Temperature**: ≤ 37.8°C for ≥ 48 hours
- **Heart rate**: ≤ 100 beats per minute
- **Respiratory rate**: ≤ 24 breaths per minute
- **Blood pressure**: Systolic ≥ 90 mmHg
- **Oxygen saturation**: ≥ 90% on room air or baseline oxygen
- **Mental status**: Normal
- **Oral intake**: Ability to eat

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **minimum duration is 5 days**, ensuring at least 48 hours of clinical stability before discontinuation [^37eb851a]. Extend to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage or if clinical stability is delayed [^760f62a6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Beta-lactam plus macrolide or beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone, tailored to severity and local resistance [^f30cc1d7] [^cd7a0556].
- **Trend CRP daily** to assess response; consider procalcitonin to support de-escalation or earlier discontinuation when clinically stable [^notfound].
- **WBC is not routinely trended**; use clinical judgment.
- **Minimum 5 days of therapy**, ensuring 48 hours of clinical stability before stopping [^37eb851a].

---

First-line therapy for hospitalized CAP is **beta-lactam plus macrolide** or **beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone**, with regimen choice based on severity and local resistance patterns [^f30cc1d7]. Trend **CRP daily** to monitor response; consider procalcitonin to support de-escalation or earlier discontinuation when clinically stable [^notfound].

### Patient information: community-acquired pneumonia… [^ec512335]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the US, CAP results in about 1. 4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 108 deaths each year. Mortality after hospitalization for CAP is 2. 8% for adults younger than 60 years and
26. 8% for those aged 60 years or older who have multiple medical conditions.

1. Symptoms of CAP may include fever, chills, cough with or without sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, and fatigue. Patients are diagnosed with CAP if they have signs and symptoms of CAP and chest imaging findings consistent with pneumonia. All patients with suspected CAP should have chest imaging. Chest x-ray is often the initial type of imaging, and if it does not reveal CAP, chest computed tomography should be considered. All patients with CAP should be tested for influenza and COVID-19 if these viruses are circulating in the community.

Additional testing of sputum and blood cultures should be performed only in patients with severe CAP or those with risk factors for resistant bacteria. For outpatients, suspected bacterial CAP is typically treated with a 3-day course of oral antibiotics or combination oral antibiotics for those with multiple medical conditions. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP should receive intravenous antibiotics for at least 3 days. Hospitalized patients with severe CAP should also receive steroids. Patients with severe CAP should be closely monitored and treated in an intensive care unit. Those who develop respiratory failure may need mechanical ventilation. Medications to increase blood pressure should be used for patients with CAP who develop shock. People with a prior episode of CAP are at increased risk of CAP and should be advised about smoking and alcohol cessation and relevant vaccinations.

Vaccination for pneumococcal pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus can help prevent or decrease the severity of CAP, especially in older adults or those with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, asthma, COPD, HIV, or cancer. People with prior CAP should also be advised to brush their teeth daily and have routine dental cleanings. Patients with swallowing problems should be counseled about behaviors to decrease the risk of aspiration, such as taking small bites of food and sitting upright while eating and for 30 minutes after meals.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^760bdc66]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Clinical end points of therapy for patients with mild community-acquired pneumonia [^3d9837da]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Approximately 80% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia receive treatment as outpatients. The question is what are valid, reproducible, and quantifiable clinical end points that can be used in prospective clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of antibacterials. Patient-reported outcomes and measurements of time to end point are reasonable methods that, according to the limited data available, appear to work in clinical trials of therapy for mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia among outpatients.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1fb53be2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^8d887f20]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^7763a431]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^9fac0986]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — procalcitonin as a decision aid is limited; a recent study in hospitalized patients with CAP failed to identify a procalcitonin threshold that discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens, and the reported sensitivity of procalcitonin to detect bacterial infection ranges from 38% to 91%, underscoring that this test alone cannot be used to justify withholding antibiotics from patients with CAP; although some patients with low procalcitonin levels have CAP and have been safely treated without antibiotics, these represent small subgroups, raising concerns about the safety of widely using such a strategy.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^11ed24ed]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^f2e2362f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

Procalcitonin to guide initiation of antibiotics in adults with CAP — empiric therapy is recommended regardless of initial procalcitonin. "We recommend that empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated in adults with clinically suspected and radiographically confirmed CAP regardless of initial serum procalcitonin level (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)."

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^37eb851a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — antibiotic duration and oral step-down: We recommend treating for a minimum of 5 days, with most patients achieving clinical stability within 48 to 72 hours such that a total duration of therapy of 5 days will be appropriate for most patients; when switching from parenteral to oral antibiotics, either the same agent or the same drug class should be used, and for CAP due to suspected or proven MRSA or P. aeruginosa, therapy should be 7 days.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^a9e3f29a]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^b8c7536c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the current literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent Findings

Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

The cost, morbidity and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk-stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy, so that the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity of CAP may be minimized.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa," and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa." Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels." Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy," and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock." The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative." For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination," and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated."

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^4e48abe2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^83a95687]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

The guideline states, "We recommend the 2007 IDSA/ATS severe CAP criteria over other published scores," with performance data: "one major or three minor criteria had a pooled sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 78% for predicting ICU admission," while "a threshold of three or more minor criteria… had a pooled sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 91%." For SMART-COP, there was "pooled sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 64%… but also uses PaO2, and pH, which are not universally available for real-time clinical decision-making," and comparisons reported "equivalence… and another reported a significantly greater performance of the IDSA/ATS minor criteria," with "No randomized studies" evaluating illness-severity tools as decision aids for inpatient intensity of treatment.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^f63e1697]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^b411b928]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation." Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Recent advances in community-acquired pneumonia: inpatient and outpatient [^664f75a5]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness, with the majority of patients treated out of the hospital, yet the greatest burden of the cost of care comes from inpatient management. In the past several years, the management of these patients has advanced, with new information about the natural history and prognosis of illness, the utility of serum markers to guide management, the use of appropriate clinical tools to guide the site-of-care decision, and the finding that guidelines can be developed in a way that improves patient outcome. The challenges to patient management include the emergence of new pathogens and the progression of antibiotic resistance in some of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Few new antimicrobial treatment options are available, and the utility of some new therapies has been limited by drug-related toxicity. Ancillary care for severe pneumonia with activated protein C and corticosteroids is being studied, but recently, inpatient care has been most affected by the development of evidence-based "core measures" for management that have been promoted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which form the basis for the public reporting of hospital performance in CAP care.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^ff4c7b0c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^30247ffd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^33eae90e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2–3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^24babb34]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Early versus later response to treatment in patients with community-acquired pneumonia: analysis of the REACH study [^acccca3d]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

REACH was a multinational, multicentre, observational, retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with CAP (NCT01293435). A total of 2,039 patients, aged 18 years or older, hospitalized and treated with IV antibiotics were enrolled in 128 sites in 10 participating countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK). The study was performed according to Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. All local ethics committees approved the study protocol. Local legislation relating to written informed consent for non-interventional studies was followed in each country; in Germany and Portugal, where this information is mandatory, written informed consent was collected. The list of ethics committees and health authorities that approved the study is available to the public at: All patients included in the analysis were hospitalized between March 2010 and February 2011. Study design and patient inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in the REACH primary publication. In brief, the study collected data regarding patient demographics, disease characteristics and diagnosis, management, clinical outcomes (including modification of initial antibiotic treatment for any reason and TCS) and healthcare resource use, via an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) completed by the investigator at each site.

'Initial antibiotic treatment modification' was defined as a change in initial antibiotic treatment due to insufficient response, adverse reaction, interaction with other drugs, non-suitability of the initial antibiotic based on the results of microbiological tests, or changes to or additions of new agents in a subsequent line (alone or in combination). The eCRF also allowed a response of 'other' or 'unknown'. Several antibiotic treatment modifications in the same patient were counted as a single case. Changes in dose or frequency of an existing antibiotic (considered as dose escalation or adaptation), removal of an antibiotic from a combination and adaptation of the dose or frequency of the remaining antibiotic, were not considered as treatment modification. TCS was recorded on the eCRF in response to the question 'What was the time to clinical stability?' Available options were 'based on the Halm criteria for clinical stability' (specifically, the first day that the following clinical variables are stable: systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg; heart rate ≤ 100 beats/min; respiratory rate ≤ 24; temperature ≤ 38.3°C; oxygen saturation ≥ 90%; ability to eat; normal mental function). Alternative options were 'based on the change from IV to oral therapy', 'based on other criteria' and 'other'.

### Monotherapy versus dual therapy for community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients [^78929dab]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Several medical-specialty professional societies have suggested that combination therapy with a beta -lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline or monotherapy with a "respiratory quinolone" (i.e., levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gemifloxacin) are optimal first-line therapy for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. These recommendations are based predominantly on retrospective studies that suggest improved rates of morbidity and mortality and hospital length of stay among patients treated in such a fashion. Well-designed, prospective, randomized studies confirming this tenet of therapy have not been published, although numerous prospective studies have provided indirect confirmation. The biological rationale for such a differential response (i.e., favoring combination therapy or fluoroquinolone therapy) includes the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides or more-optimal treatment of primary infection or coinfection with atypical pathogens. Well-designed, prospective, randomized trials are required to best define the effectiveness of combination therapy with a beta -lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline or with a respiratory quinolone in hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Improving outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia [^ae0e3425]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a pervasive disease that is encountered in outpatient and inpatient settings. CAP is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease and accounts for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. This update reviews current advances that can be used to promote improved outcomes in CAP.

Recent Findings

Early recognition of CAP and its severe presentations, with appropriate site of care decisions, leads to reduced patient mortality. In addition to traditional prognostic tools, certain serum biomarkers can assist in defining disease severity and guide treatment and management strategies. The use of macrolides as part of combination antibiotic therapy has shown beneficial mortality effects across the CAP disease spectrum, especially for those with severe illness. When treating community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, use of an antitoxin antibiotic is likely to be valuable. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids may prevent delayed clinical resolution in selected patients with severe CAP. Recent data expand on the interaction of CAP with comorbid disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, and its impact on mortality in CAP patients.

Summary

Improved diagnostic tools, optimized treatment regimens, and enhanced understanding of CAP-induced perturbations in comorbid disease states hold promise to improve patient outcomes.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnostic microbiology — sputum testing yield and challenges: The overall poor yield of sputum evaluation for detecting organisms causing CAP limits its impact on management and patient outcomes, and obtaining a valid sputum specimen can be challenging because of patient-related characteristics. Performance characteristics of tests also vary by organism, receipt of prior antibiotics, and setting; for example, in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia who have not received antibiotics, a good-quality sputum sample detects pneumococci in 86% of cases.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^f4441452]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^596f0b89]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the USA. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

Conclusions

In this study, among patients with CAP who met the criteria for stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, age and sex but not comorbidities or severity of disease were associated with an increased risk of failure. Surveillance of clinical signs (ie, stability criteria) is of paramount importance. These results should be taken in account for the treatment of patients with CAP.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^3d1c7e5d]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^e907035a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — site-of-care decision support recommends a validated clinical prediction rule for prognosis, preferentially the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) over the CURB-65 (tool based on confusion, urea level, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65) (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence), to determine the need for hospitalization in adults diagnosed with CAP; both the PSI and CURB-65 were developed to predict 30-day mortality, and when compared with CURB-65, PSI identifies larger proportions of patients at low risk and has a higher discriminative power in predicting mortality; two multicenter, cluster-randomized trials demonstrated that use of the PSI safely increases the proportion of patients who can be treated in the outpatient setting, and these trials and one additional randomized controlled trial (RCT) support the safety of using the PSI to guide the initial site of treatment without worsening mortality or other clinically relevant outcomes; when used as a decision aid, the PSI should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment; in comparison to the PSI, there is less evidence that CURB-65 is effective as a decision aid, with one pre–post, controlled before–after study using an electronically calculated version of CURB-65, PaO2/FiO2 < 300, absence of pleural effusion, and fewer than three minor ATS severity criteria observing no significant increase in the use of outpatient treatment of adults with CAP; providing a conditional recommendation to use CURB-65 considers its greater simplicity of use relative to the PSI, and the PSI may underestimate illness severity among younger patients because, for example, all systolic blood pressures < 90 mm Hg are considered abnormal regardless of baseline and actual measurement.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Blood biomarkers for personalized treatment and patient management decisions in community-acquired pneumonia [^60cbbbef]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), blood biomarkers can help to substantially improve individual decisions involving initiation, (de-)intensification, and cessation of antibiotics, and initial risk stratification, site-of-care assignment (outpatient versus ward versus ICU), and discharge. To illustrate these processes, this review summarizes recent findings from trials investigating the use of two hormokines, procalcitonin (PCT) or proadrenomedullin (ProADM), in personalized treatment and management decisions in CAP patients.

Recent Findings

Many biomarkers from distinct pathophysiological pathways have been evaluated in observational studies. However, only few analytes have been tested for efficacy and safety in numerous, large observational studies or in prospective, randomized, interventional trials. Among the latter, PCT has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and highly effective for monitoring and de-escalating antibiotic therapy. ProADM has shown higher accuracy for short-term and long-term adverse outcome prediction and improves prognostic accuracy when combined with current clinical risk scores, that is, Pneumonia Severity Index, the CURB65 (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age at least 65 years) score, and Risk of Early Admission to ICU, compared to applying the respective score alone. ProADM use has - in a pilot interventional study - improved site-of-care decisions and tended to shorten length hospitalization.

Summary

Inclusion of biomarker data in clinical algorithms improves individual decision-making in CAP patients. Interventional trials should be conducted to determine these markers' ultimate utility in patient management.

### Nonresponses and treatment failures with conventional empiric regimens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^158eee85]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with suspected CAP respond to empiric therapy, a small number of patients do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians carefully should observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Testing strategies in the initial management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^4f98e4af]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of patients suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia is challenging because of the broad range of clinical presentations, potential life-threatening nature of the illness, and associated high costs of care. The initial testing strategies should accurately establish a diagnosis and prognosis in order to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The diagnosis is important in determining the need for antibiotic therapy, and the prognosis is important in determining the site of care. This paper reviews the test characteristics of the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, individually and in combination, in diagnosing community-acquired pneumonia and predicting short-term risk for death from the infection. In addition, we consider the implications of these test characteristics from the perspective of decision thresholds. The history and physical examination cannot provide a high level of certainty in the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, but the absence of vital sign abnormalities substantially reduces the probability of the infection. Chest radiography is considered the gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis; however, we do not know its sensitivity and specificity, and we have limited data on the costs of false-positive and false-negative results. In the absence of empirical evidence, the decision to order a chest radiograph needs to rely on expert opinion in seeking strategies to optimize the balance between harms and benefits. Once community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed, a combination of history, physical examination, and laboratory items can help estimate the short-term risk for death and, along with the patient's psychosocial characteristics, determine the appropriate site of treatment.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Usefulness of C-reactive protein in monitoring the severe community-acquired pneumonia clinical course [^51771730]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a common and serious illness, with an estimated incidence of 2–12 cases/1,000 population per year. The majority of cases are managed outside hospital, but approximately 20% require hospital admission. Out of this group of patients, around 10% develop severe CAP requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The largest numbers of deaths occur in the first few days of hospitalization, so the early recognition of patients with severe CAP not only aids in the early initiation of antibiotic therapy but also in adequate supportive care.

It has been estimated that approximately 10–25% of patients with CAP do not resolve within the anticipated time. Treatment failure can result from a lack of response by the host or from the development of an infectious complication, such as postobstructive pneumonia, empyema, or lung abscess. In addition, treatment failure may be wrongly presumed when radiologic infiltrates are resolving slowly but the patient has a superimposed problem, such as drug fever, malignancy, inflammatory conditions, heart failure, or a hospital-acquired infection from another source. In such clinical situations, it is very difficult to identify the cause of the presumed treatment failure, since clinical and radiological evaluation is insufficient to differentiate an infectious complication from a noninfectious complication. Some studies evaluated the value of some serum markers of infection, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukins, in monitoring the response to antibiotic treatment. In the present study we hypothesize that daily monitoring of plasma CRP can recognize patients with bad outcome and patients with good outcome early in the course of antibiotic treatment.

Plasma CRP is an acute phase-protein synthesized only by the liver largely under transcriptional control of IL-6. CRP levels rise rapidly in response to several inflammatory stimuli, bacterial infection being one of the most potent. The secretion of CRP begins within 4–6 hours of the stimulus, doubling every 8 hours, and peaking at 36–50 hours. After the disappearance of or removal of the stimulus, the CRP concentration decreases rapidly with a half-life of 19 hours.

The aim of the present study was to assess the value of serial CRP determinations after prescription of antibiotics in the evaluation of the resolution of severe CAP, in order to recognize, early in the clinical course, patients with good outcome and patients with bad outcome, as well as to identify the individual patterns of the CRP response to antibiotics.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
