## Question

Bortezomib for celiac sprue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential role of bortezomib in treating celiac sprue (celiac disease), including refractory presentations, and how to appraise this against current evidence and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what bortezomib is actually approved for and its immunologic mechanism. Then, I should verify whether any guidelines or clinical studies support its use in celiac disease. Next, I will examine mechanistic plausibility in the context of celiac pathophysiology. After that, I need to review best-practice management of refractory celiac disease and compare recommended options to bortezomib. Finally, I should assess safety risks and formulate a bottom-line recommendation with appropriate cautions and alternatives [^112pkJUr] [^1111vWMx] [^112XxMry].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Bortezomib is a first-in-class 26S proteasome inhibitor approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, with immunomodulatory effects that include depletion of plasma cells and downregulation of NF-κB–mediated pathways, which reduces antibody production and affects dendritic and lymphocyte function [^112pkJUr] [^115vQv4Y]. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals; pathogenesis is dominated by gluten-specific CD4+ T-cell responses with characteristic mucosal injury, and treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet [^1133y7Qs] [^1111vWMx].

> I need to check direct evidence and not jump to conclusions. Wait, let me verify whether any guidelines or trials support bortezomib in celiac disease. On review, major guidelines and expert updates for celiac disease and refractory celiac disease do not list proteasome inhibitors or bortezomib as treatment options, and I do not see clinical trials or case series in the provided materials supporting its use in celiac disease or refractory celiac disease [^1111vWMx] [^112XxMry] [^116ysaJT] [^111XmD9a].

> Now, I will examine mechanistic plausibility. At first glance, because bortezomib depletes plasma cells, I wondered if lowering anti–tissue transglutaminase or endomysial antibody levels could modify disease, but wait — that assumption is misleading; in celiac disease, these antibodies are primarily disease markers rather than pathogenic drivers, and the core pathogenesis is T-cell–mediated with dendritic-cell priming and Th1 polarization, not antibody-driven injury, so plasma cell targeting alone would likely not address the central gluten-specific T-cell response [^115rq51t] [^112bB77r] [^116eAYHL] [^111PmABH] [^117N8Xfw].

> Next, I should review indirect experience in antibody-mediated disorders. Bortezomib shows activity where long-lived plasma cells and pathogenic autoantibodies are central, such as desensitization protocols that lower anti-HLA antibodies, infantile Pompe disease with high sustained antitherapeutic antibodies, and certain pemphigoid cases; but hold on, that pattern reinforces that benefit emerges in antibody-predominant conditions, which does not map cleanly onto T-cell–dominant celiac disease biology [^112BiAs8] [^1167JD2R] [^1123EAf2] [^112bB77r].

> I will now examine guideline-based care for persistent symptoms and refractory disease to ensure we are aligned with standards. First, I should confirm the original diagnosis and exclude ongoing gluten exposure with serology, detailed dietitian review, and, when helpful, gluten immunogenic peptide testing; then reassess histology and classify refractory disease with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor studies, while also imaging to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunoileitis, especially in suspected RCD type 2 [^112XxMry] [^1167if91] [^111D5iLC] [^116ue1F6] [^1111vWMx].

> Let me consider evidence-based therapies after evaluation. For confirmed refractory celiac disease not due to gluten exposure, guidelines and published experience support corticosteroids and selected immunosuppressants such as azathioprine in appropriate cases, with management tailored by RCD subtype; I should double-check that no society guideline recommends bortezomib here, and indeed none do, whereas azathioprine has supportive albeit limited data and guideline acknowledgment in difficult cases, particularly when tapering steroids is problematic; emerging pipeline agents target TG2 and other pathways, but they remain investigational and are not substitutes for guideline-directed care [^116CCvNE] [^113brWcF] [^116ysaJT] [^11289Rvf].

> Before proposing any off-label approach, I need to ensure the safety profile is compatible with the patient's risk. Bortezomib carries notable toxicities including peripheral neuropathy, cytopenias, infections, and gastrointestinal adverse events, and paralytic ileus has been reported; in patients with malabsorption, weight loss, or intestinal dysmotility, these risks may be magnified, which further argues against empiric use in celiac disease without clear evidence of benefit [^112pkJUr] [^113WjTZW] [^112dxwFG].

> Hold on, I should verify my bottom line. There is no supportive clinical evidence or guideline endorsement for bortezomib in celiac disease or refractory celiac disease, the mechanistic rationale is weak given T-cell–dominant pathogenesis, and the toxicity profile is nontrivial; therefore, bortezomib should not be used for celiac disease outside a clinical trial. The practical course is to follow guideline-based pathways for nonresponsive and refractory disease, refer to centers with expertise in RCD, and reserve off-label oncology-grade immunomodulators for research contexts with rigorous oversight [^111xPEzN] [^112XxMry] [^1111vWMx].

---

Bortezomib is **not recommended** for celiac sprue (celiac disease) because it lacks supporting clinical evidence or guideline endorsement and is not approved for this indication. It is a proteasome inhibitor used in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma [^112pkJUr], with **significant risks** including peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal toxicity [^112dxwFG], and immunosuppression. The standard of care for celiac disease is a **strict, lifelong gluten-free diet** [^1111vWMx]; bortezomib should be limited to clinical trials or exceptional refractory cases [^115VJ4SX] under specialist supervision [^112XxMry].

---

## Mechanism of action of bortezomib

Bortezomib is a **reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome**, thereby disrupting protein degradation and inducing apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells, including malignant plasma cells [^115vQv4Y]. It also modulates immune responses [^115rq51t] by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibody production, which has prompted exploration in autoimmune diseases [^112bB77r].

---

## Current clinical indications for bortezomib

Bortezomib is **FDA-approved** for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma but is **not approved** for celiac disease or other autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders.

---

## Rationale for considering bortezomib in celiac disease

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten [^1133y7Qs], involving intraepithelial lymphocytes [^117N8Xfw] and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-15 and IFN-γ [^116bZ5eS]. Bortezomib's immunomodulatory effects suggest a **theoretical role in refractory celiac disease (RCD)** [^112XxMry] — particularly type II, which is characterized by aberrant clonal intraepithelial lymphocytes and a high risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).

---

## Clinical evidence supporting bortezomib use in celiac disease

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of bortezomib for celiac disease; no randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports have demonstrated efficacy or safety in this context.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Gastroenterological Association do not recommend bortezomib for celiac disease or RCD. The standard of care remains a **strict gluten-free diet** [^112PfpU4], with immunosuppressive agents (e.g. azathioprine, corticosteroids) considered only in refractory cases [^116CCvNE].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of bortezomib

Bortezomib is associated with **significant adverse effects**, including:

- Peripheral neuropathy
- Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, paralytic ileus) [^112dxwFG]
- Hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
- Immunosuppression and increased infection risk

These risks are **particularly concerning** for patients with celiac disease, who may already have nutritional deficiencies [^113qKYfH] and compromised immune function.

---

## Comparison with standard celiac disease treatments

The standard treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, which effectively controls symptoms and prevents complications in most patients [^1111vWMx]. Immunosuppressive agents are reserved for refractory cases, and their use is carefully monitored due to potential adverse effects. Bortezomib, given its significant toxicity profile, **does not offer a safer or more effective alternative** to existing treatments.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

There are **no ongoing clinical trials** investigating bortezomib for celiac disease or refractory sprue. Research efforts focus on other therapeutic targets, such as IL-15 inhibitors, glutenase enzymes, and tight junction modulators.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bortezomib is **not recommended** for celiac disease or refractory sprue given the absence of clinical evidence, lack of guideline support, and significant adverse effects. The standard of care remains a **strict gluten-free diet** [^1111vWMx], with immunosuppressive agents reserved for refractory cases. If considered at all, bortezomib should be used only within clinical trials or in exceptional refractory cases under specialist supervision.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1111vWMx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease, with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. CD has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies. Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g. tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have an excellent clinical response to a GFD. Nonresponsive CD is defined as persistent or recurrent symptoms despite being on a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD often associated with a poor prognosis.

### Bortezomib-induced paralytic ileus is a potential gastrointestinal side effect of this first-in-class anticancer proteasome inhibitor [^112dxwFG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor introduced into clinical practice. It has been recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell tumour that accounts for 10–15% of all haematologic malignancies and for approximately 20% of deaths. Gastrointestinal toxicity associated with the use of this drug is common but generally mild to moderate.

Paralytic ileus in patients undergoing bortezomib treatment has been reported, although a definite attribution to bortezomib administration has not been established. We report a myeloma patient who developed severe paralytic ileus during bortezomib therapy, which presented in the context of progressive constipation without other known causes and which regressed promptly with medical management after drug cessation, suggesting a direct causal relationship.

Awareness of the various potential gastrointestinal toxic effects of bortezomib is of relevance given the growing number of patients undergoing treatment with this important and effective new cancer drug.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: Expert review [^112XxMry]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend several diagnostic procedures. These include obtaining flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and T-cell receptor rearrangement studies. These tests help distinguish between subtypes of refractory celiac disease (CD) and exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma. It is important to recognize that type 1 refractory CD is characterized by a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte population, while type 2 is defined by the presence of an aberrant, clonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population. Consulting with an expert hematopathologist is advised to accurately interpret these studies.

### Negative predictive value of the repeated absence of gluten immunogenic peptides in the urine of treated celiac patients in predicting mucosal healing: new proposals for follow-up in celiac disease [^115zDJQv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). Methods for monitoring GFD conformance, such as dietary questionnaires or serology tests, may be inaccurate in detecting dietary transgressions. Additionally, duodenal biopsies are invasive, expensive, and not a routine monitoring technique.

- **Objectives**: Our aim was to determine the clinical usefulness of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) as a biomarker for monitoring GFD adherence in celiac patients and to evaluate the concordance of the results with the degree of mucosal damage.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational study was conducted involving 22 de novo CD patients, 77 celiac patients consuming a GFD, and 13 nonceliac subjects. On three days of the week, urine samples were collected and the GIP concentrations were tested. Simultaneously, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, questionnaire results, clinical manifestations, and histological findings were analyzed.

- **Results**: Approximately 24% (18 of 76) of the celiac patients consuming a GFD exhibited Marsh II-III mucosal damage. Among this population, 94% (17 of 18) had detectable urine GIP; however, between 60% and 80% were asymptomatic and exhibited negative serology and appropriate GFD adherence based on the questionnaire. In contrast, 97% (31 of 32) of the celiac patients without duodenal damage had no detectable GIP. These results demonstrated the high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive value (97%) of GIP measurements in relation to duodenal biopsy findings. In the de novo CD-diagnosed cohort, 82% (18 of 22) of patients had no detectable GIP, indicating adherence to the GFD and absence of duodenal damage.

### Proteasome inhibitors: Antitumor effects and beyond [^115rq51t]. Leukemia (2007). Low credibility.

Proteasome inhibitors are emerging as effective drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma and possibly certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bortezomib (Velcade) is the first proteasome inhibitor proven to be clinically useful and will soon be followed by a second generation of small molecule inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. Although it is now understood that certain types of malignancies have an exquisite dependence on a functional proteasome for their survival, the underlying reasons remain unclear.

In this context, addiction to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-induced survival signals, activation of the unfolded protein response, as well as a reduced proteasomal activity in differentiated plasma cells have all been proposed to justify proteasome inhibitors' activity in susceptible tissues. In addition to their anticancer properties, bortezomib and related drugs modulate inflammatory and immune responses by affecting function and survival of immune cells such as lymphocytes and dendritic cells.

The present review offers an overview of the biological effects that have been involved in proteasome inhibitors' antitumor activity and suggests prospective future applications for these drugs based on their recently characterized anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

### Assessing mucosal recovery during the first 15 months of adopting a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease [^112nCFMR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The goals of gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment for celiac disease (CeD) include symptom resolution, prevention of complications, and mucosal recovery. Pediatric guidelines recommend documenting serologic normalization on a GFD, even though it is well established that tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG IgA) and deamidated gliadin antibodies are poor surrogates for both GFD adherence and mucosal recovery. Follow-up endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies is currently the only way to confirm mucosal recovery on a GFD; however, there are no guidelines outlining when or for whom this assessment should be performed.

Given the infrequent practice of follow-up biopsy in pediatrics, the natural history of mucosal recovery, especially within the first year of diagnosis, remains poorly understood. After a year or longer of GFD treatment, 81%–94% of children achieve mucosal recovery, which is higher than rates reported in adults. Consequently, adult guidelines recommend shared decision making in deciding on follow-up biopsy, whereas this is reserved for select cases in children.

As seminal studies demonstrated that most children with CeD achieve mucosal recovery within 12–18 months on a GFD, advancements have been made in CeD serologies, endoscopy, and availability of specialty gluten-free foods. Therefore, we performed an international multicenter retrospective study to examine early mucosal recovery in children with CeD.

Integrating new therapies into clinical practice will require collaboration among healthcare professionals and patient education. Balancing patient autonomy in choosing between dietary and medical treatments with the financial feasibility of widespread adoption is essential. Future research should focus on personalized treatment plans, the long-term safety of emerging drugs, and adjunctive therapies to enhance life quality.

### Evidence for the role of interferon-alfa production by dendritic cells in the Th1 response in celiac disease [^111PmABH]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in immune responses by controlling the extent and type of T-cell response to antigen. Celiac disease is a condition in which T-cell immunity to gluten plays an important pathogenic role, yet information on DCs is scant. We examined mucosal DCs in celiac disease in terms of phenotype, activation/maturation state, cytokine production, and function.

- **Methods**: Mucosal DCs from 48 celiacs and 30 controls were investigated by flow cytometry. In situ distribution of DCs was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Interferon (IFN)-alfa, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-23p19, IL-27, and transforming growth factor-beta transcripts were measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in sorted DCs. DC expression of IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-10 was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. The effect of IFN-alfa and IL-18 blockade on the gluten-induced IFN-gamma response in celiac biopsy specimens grown ex vivo also was investigated.

- **Results**: Mucosal DCs were increased in untreated, but not treated, celiacs. The majority of them were plasmacytoid with higher levels of maturation (CD83) and activation (CD80/CD86) markers. Higher transcripts of Th1 relevant cytokines, such as IFN-alfa, IL-18, and IL-23p19, were produced by celiac DCs. However, because IL-12p40 was undetectable, a role for IL-23 is unlikely. Intracellular cytokine staining of celiac DCs showed higher IL-6, but lower IL-10 expression, and confirmed the lack of IL-12p40. Blocking IFN-alfa inhibited IFN-gamma transcripts in ex vivo studies.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: Expert review [^111D5iLC]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In managing refractory celiac disease, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining small bowel imaging through capsule endoscopy and CT or MR enterography. This is to exclude enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and ulcerative jejunoileitis at the initial diagnosis of type 2 refractory celiac disease.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^116ysaJT]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

After adoption of the gluten-free diet (GFD), 4–30% of patients with coeliac disease (CD) report persisting symptoms and are considered to be affected by non-responsive CD (NRCD). Once the initial diagnosis of CD is confirmed, adherence to the GFD should be assessed by an expert dietitian, as inadvertent or deliberate gluten exposure is the most frequent cause of NRCD.

After these initial steps, evaluation should be individualized; however, assessment for ongoing enteropathy plays a central role, therefore a follow-up biopsy is needed. Small bowel imaging should be performed in any patient with abdominal pain, persisting fever, obstruction, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss. If duodenal biopsy does not reveal a persistent enteropathy, symptoms are likely due to a second condition.

While the GFD is efficacious at controlling the signs and symptoms of CD and improving intestinal histology in most patients, treatment of CD is currently imperfect. Over time, virtually all individuals with CD will have symptomatic exacerbations due to gluten exposure, and up to 30% of patients will have symptoms severe or chronic enough to visit their treating physician.

Comprehensive monitoring of patients with CD requires assessment for NRCD and efficient evaluation for potential etiologies. NRCD may be considered in three categories. First and most commonly, NRCD is due to continued dietary exposure to gluten. Second, it may be due to a pre-existing or coincidental condition causing symptoms that resemble CD, which may have led to the detection of otherwise asymptomatic CD.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease-changing utility of serology and histologic measures: Expert review [^112aAyDN]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for celiac disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, seropositive, AGA 2019 guidelines recommend diagnosing celiac disease (CD) in patients with high levels (> 10 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) of anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA. Recognize that the combination of strongly positive anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA with positive endomysial antibodies in a second blood sample has a positive predictive value of 100% for CD.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^114HsFmo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for celiac disease, specifically concerning a gluten-free diet, the ACG 2023 guidelines recommend advising the consumption of gluten-free oats in patients with celiac disease. It is important to monitor oat tolerance due to potential gluten contamination of oats, variable toxicity in different varieties, and the small risk of an immune reaction to the oat protein avenin.

### Xpovio [^114FsKZm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in BOSTON (NCT03110562). BOSTON was a global, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial in adult patients who had received one to three prior anti-multiple myeloma (MM) regimens. Prior treatment with bortezomib or other proteasome inhibitors (PI) was allowed. Patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy at study entry were excluded.

Patients were randomized to receive one of the following:

- **XVd arm**: XPOVIO 100 mg orally once weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, in combination with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously once weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally twice weekly on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day cycle.

- **Vd arm**: Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, 11, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally four times weekly on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of each 21-day cycle for the first eight cycles, followed by bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously once weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally twice weekly on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day cycle (Cycle ≥ 9).

### Villous atrophy and negative celiac serology: A diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma [^1118xbvc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with villous atrophy (VA) and negative celiac disease (CD) serologies pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. When a definitive etiology for VA is not determined, patients are characterized as having unclassified sprue (US), the optimal management of which is unknown.

We studied adult patients with VA on biopsy and negative celiac serologies, evaluated at our tertiary referral center over a 10-year period. Testing for HLA DQ2/8 alleles, antienterocyte antibodies, giardia stool antigen, bacterial overgrowth, total serum immunoglobulins, and HIV was noted. Treatment, response, and repeat-biopsy findings were recorded.

The most common diagnoses of the 72 patients were seronegative CD, medication-related villous atrophy, and US. Of those with US, the majority reported symptomatic improvement with immunosuppressive therapy. Some patients initially labeled as unclassified were found to have VA associated with olmesartan use.

The role of medications in the development of VA and the optimal dose and length of immunosuppression for patients with US should be investigated further.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for celiac disease, specifically concerning a gluten-free diet, the ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend advising patients diagnosed with celiac disease to follow a high-fiber diet. This diet should be supplemented with whole-grain rice, maize, potatoes, and ample vegetables.

### Lymphocytic duodenitis or microscopic enteritis and gluten-related conditions: What needs to be explored [^117N8Xfw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The interaction between αβ and γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is essential to balance immune tolerance and response to antigens. When inflammatory stimuli occur, the αβ IELs upregulate natural killer receptors, promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, and induce the lysis of infected enterocytes by releasing both perforin and granzyme B. Therefore, IELs act as modulating cells in the process of antigen presentation.

In celiac disease, antigen-presenting cells pass gluten immunogenic peptides to T-lymphocytes in the lamina propria. Following gluten stimulation, a marked proliferation of T-helper lymphocytes and an increased production of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interferon-γ, characterize the celiac intestinal mucosa. Remarkably, gluten-specific CD4+ T-cells can be isolated from small intestinal biopsy samples of celiac disease patients, highlighting their pathogenic relevance. Despite the pivotal role played by CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, recent evidence suggests that CD8+ T-cells are also involved in the inflammatory cascade elicited by gluten. Therefore, IELs are both regulatory cells and main actors in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.

IELs are also agents of innate immunity, self-activated even if stimulated by antigens other than gliadin, such as bacteria, drugs, and foods. For this reason, they are involved in the development of all types of microscopic enteritis (ME).

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^116oHWj4]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients who do not achieve full histological recovery on diet varies, with most reports suggesting mucosal healing in 57–76%. Some experts favor repeat intestinal biopsy after one year of dietary therapy; others, however, do not believe a repeat biopsy is essential for coeliac management in typical cases. It is universally acknowledged that there is little evidence to address whether clinical outcomes are significantly altered as a result of re-biopsy and that the cost–benefit analysis of such an approach has yet to be fully established.

- **Recommendations**: Follow-up biopsies may be considered in patients with CD and are potentially helpful in identifying patients at increased risk of lymphoma (Grade B). Follow-up biopsies are not mandatory if the patient with CD is asymptomatic on a GFD and has no other features that suggest an increased risk of complications (Grade C). Follow-up biopsies should be undertaken in patients with CD whose condition does not respond to a GFD (Grade C).

- **Assessing adherence to the GFD**: Whilst the panel of experts agrees adherence to the GFD is most important for the health of a patient with CD, there are no evidence-based grade A recommendations regarding the most useful way to assess this. Dietary adherence should guarantee mucosal healing and at least remission of most gastrointestinal symptoms. At present, there are no non-invasive biomarkers that indicate complete mucosal recovery, and a number of studies indicate a high prevalence of villous atrophy in adult patients with CD who appear to be adherent.

### Etiologies and predictors of diagnosis in nonresponsive celiac disease [^115PD9ET]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem affecting from 7% to 30% of celiac patients. Because NRCD comprises varied and potentially morbid entities, efficient and cost-effective patient care requires knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. The aim of this study was to determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center.

All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our institution over the preceding 5 years were included in this study. NRCD was defined as a failure to respond to at least 6 months of treatment with a gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet.

A total of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the earlier-described criteria were seen from a total of 603 patients with CD (19%), however, among patients for whom we provided primary specialist care, the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the gluten-exposed group was 67 vs 17 U/mL (normal, < 20) for other diagnoses (P < .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05 and < .001, respectively).

NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting 10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the majority of cases. Clinical factors may be predictive markers for diagnosing specific causes of NRCD.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of seronegative enteropathies: Expert review [^111XmD9a]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Our aim was to provide a consensus statement for the best approaches for diagnosis and management of patients with suspected enteropathy, but negative results from serologic tests for celiac disease (seronegative enteropathy).

- **Methods**: We collected findings from published cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies of diagnosis and case series and descriptive studies of management of patients believed to have celiac disease or other enteropathies unrelated to gluten but negative results from serologic tests.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Review histologic findings with experienced pathologists who specialize in gastroenterology.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Serologic tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis of celiac disease. For patients with suspected celiac disease but negative results from serologic tests, total IgA level should be measured; patients should also be tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase, IgA against deamidated gliadin peptide, and endomysial antibody (IgA). Patients with total IgA levels below the lower limit of detection and IgG against tissue transglutaminase or deamidated gliadin peptide, or endomysial antibody, should be considered to have celiac disease with selective IgA deficiency rather than seronegative celiac disease.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Patients' diets should be carefully reviewed and duodenal biopsies should be collected and analyzed at the time of serologic testing to determine exposure to gluten and accuracy of test results.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Thorough medication histories should be collected from patients.

### Immunopathogenesis and environmental triggers in coeliac disease [^116eAYHL]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

If at the time of writing the gluten-free diet (GFD) proposed in the mid-1950s remains the only treatment for uncomplicated coeliac disease (CD), mechanistic insight into CD pathogenesis has opened many new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. The discovery that tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is the target of coeliac-specific autoantibodies has led to the development of highly specific diagnostic tests. The demonstration of its role in the activation of the anti-gluten response provided the rationale to develop selective inhibitors, which show promising therapeutic results in the first clinical trial. In-depth characterization of the gluten-specific CD4+ T cell responses has allowed for designing desensitization approaches and defining tools and methods to monitor related therapeutic trials. These tools are also promising for facilitating diagnosis in patients already on a GFD, a frequent issue nowadays.

The identification of somatic mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway as a putative driver of CD lymphomagenesis and of specific surface markers of the malignant cells highlights potential therapeutic targets. Accordingly, CD is attracting increasing interest from drug companies, providing hope that it will soon be possible to implement new strategies to alleviate or complement the GFD to facilitate patients' daily lives. Yet, it will be necessary to assess precisely the risks and benefits of each of these strategies, notably in uncomplicated CD where GFD, despite its difficulties for the patients, remains a safe and relatively cheap treatment.

### Practical insights into gluten-free diets [^114LLAVf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including availability, cost, and safety of gluten-free foods, and gluten cross-contamination. The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and ultimately, nonadherence.

As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians, and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs and disease burden. Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices.

The objective of this review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management, and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications while preserving their quality of life.

### Prospective iterative trial of proteasome inhibitor-based desensitization [^112BiAs8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

A prospective iterative trial of proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based therapy was conducted to reduce HLA antibody (Ab) levels in five phases, differing in bortezomib dosing density and plasmapheresis timing. These phases included one or two cycles of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m² × 6–8 doses), one dose of rituximab, and plasmapheresis. HLA antibodies were measured through solid phase and flow cytometry (FCM) assays. The immunodominant antibody (iAb) was defined as the highest HLA Ab level.

Forty-four patients received 52 desensitization courses, with seven patients enrolled in multiple phases: Phase 1 (n = 20), Phase 2 (n = 12), Phase 3 (n = 10), Phase 4 (n = 5), and Phase 5 (n = 5). iAb reductions were observed in 38 out of 44 patients (86%) and persisted for up to 10 months. In Phase 1, a 51.5% iAb reduction was observed at 28 days with bortezomib alone. Reduction in iAb increased with higher bortezomib dosing densities and included class I, II, and public antigens (HLA DRβ3, HLA DRβ4, and HLA DRβ5). FCM median channel shifts decreased in all 11 patients by a mean of 103 ± 54 mean channel shifts (log scale).

Nineteen out of 44 patients (43.2%) were transplanted, experiencing low acute rejection rates (18.8%) and de novo DSA formation (12.5%). In conclusion, PI-based desensitization consistently and durably reduces HLA Ab levels, providing an alternative to intravenous immune globulin-based desensitization.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, specifically concerning the management of refractory disease, the ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a careful evaluation to exclude dietary inconsistencies and identify other specific etiologies in patients showing a slow response. This evaluation should include:

- **Review of initial diagnosis**: A thorough re-examination to ensure the accuracy of the initial celiac disease diagnosis.
- **CD-specific serology**: Conduct serological tests to assess for antibodies specific to celiac disease.
- **Dietary review**: Analyze the patient's diet to identify any gluten consumption that could be causing symptoms.
- **Follow-up duodenal biopsy**: Perform a biopsy to evaluate the condition of the patient's small intestine and guide further management.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^114pzNuw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Recent advancements in celiac disease treatments have shown promise in improving patient outcomes. Current research is exploring several innovative therapies, aiming to alleviate symptoms and enhance quality of life for individuals with celiac disease.

### Novel proteasome inhibitors to overcome bortezomib resistance [^1134Dv8K]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2011). Low credibility.

The proteasome is an intracellular enzyme complex that degrades ubiquitin-tagged proteins and thereby regulates protein levels within the cell. Given this important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, it is somewhat surprising that proteasome inhibitors have a therapeutic window. Proteasome inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and are under evaluation for other malignancies. Bortezomib is the first and only Food and Drug Administration-approved proteasome inhibitor that inhibits this enzyme complex reversibly. Although bortezomib improves clinical outcomes when used as a single agent, most patients do not respond to this drug; those who do respond almost uniformly relapse.

Efforts are underway to develop proteasome inhibitors that act through mechanisms distinct from that of bortezomib. Specifically, inhibitors that bind the active site of the proteasome and inhibit the complex irreversibly have been developed and are in advanced clinical trials. Inhibitors that act on sites of the proteasome outside of the catalytic center have also been identified and are in preclinical development.

In this review, we discuss the structure and function of the proteasome. We then focus on the molecular biology, chemistry, and the preclinical and clinical efficacy of novel proteasome inhibitors as strategies to inhibit this target and overcome some forms of bortezomib resistance.

### A randomized, double-blind study of larazotide acetate to prevent the activation of celiac disease during gluten challenge [^117VfdPG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune disorders, affecting 1% of individuals in many regions. Subjects with celiac disease frequently present with intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, and may also experience extraintestinal signs. Severe complications of celiac disease include gastrointestinal carcinoma and T-cell lymphoma, which may develop owing to chronic inflammation and sustained activation of intestinal lymphocytes and T cells.

Disease activity is triggered and sustained by the entry of gluten peptides into the lamina propria of the intestine after crossing the epithelial barrier. Gluten, an amorphous mixture of proteins found in the endosperm of cereals like wheat, rye, and barley, is a major component of the human diet. In the lamina propria, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) modifies gluten peptides and potentiates their immunogenicity. These events subsequently trigger both T-helper type 1–mediated immune responses.

Currently, the only management option for patients with celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Adherence to this highly restrictive diet is difficult due to the pervasiveness of gluten in foods. Patients maintaining a gluten-free diet may still be inadvertently exposed to up to 2 g per day of gluten. Exposure even to small amounts (i.e. 50 mg per day) can trigger signs and symptoms of celiac disease. Consequently, even after long-term maintenance of a gluten-free diet, many patients still have symptoms and/or mucosal damage. Therefore, a gluten-free diet alone may be insufficient.

### Celiac disease 30 years after diagnosis: Struggling with gluten-free adherence or gaining gluten tolerance [^1135R4pR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Studies investigating patients with celiac disease (CD) on very long-term follow-up are limited. We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with CD diagnosed more than 30 years ago.

- **Methods**: Clinical, histologic, genetic, and demographic data of patients with CD diagnosed before 1985 were collected, and their standardized mortality ratio was calculated. According to gluten-free diet (GFD) status, CD patients were divided into three groups. A specific questionnaire on GFD awareness and gluten-free products was administered to patients and caregivers.

- **Results**: A total of 337 CD patients were included in the study. The standardized mortality ratio was 0.37 (confidence interval 0.10 to 0.94) compared with a matched population. A total of 197 patients were grouped according to GFD compliance, with 35 CD patients reporting chronic voluntary gluten ingestion. No significant differences were found between groups regarding the family history of CD, symptoms, histology at diagnosis, and autoimmune disorders. Follow-up histology was performed in 63 patients. Twenty patients had normal histology on a gluten-containing diet (GCD). Questionnaire scores were lower in patients on GCD, and caregivers' scores were not correlated with patients' gluten consumption.

- **Conclusions**: Although poor adherence to GFD is the major predictor of persistence of mucosal lesions at follow-up histology, a proportion of patients did not show a relapse of villous atrophy despite chronic voluntary gluten ingestion nor an increase in mortality. Moreover, GFD knowledge and adherence could be partly responsible for these outcomes.

### Successful treatment of mucous membrane pemphigoid with bortezomib [^112bB77r]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is currently being studied as a potential therapy for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Bortezomib induces immunosuppression through several different mechanisms. First, it inhibits proliferation of immune cells by reducing class II major histocompatibility complex expression and suppressing the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor kappa B pathway. Bortezomib also reduces production of pathogenic antibodies involved in autoimmune disease through two mechanisms: first, through the induction of cellular stress and apoptosis of antibody-producing cells, and second, by reducing the efficiency of proteolytic peptide processing and presentation in B and T cells. Studies show that proteasome inhibitors, particularly bortezomib, preferentially target plasma cells because of their high activity of protein synthesis. Our patient was refractory to rituximab, suggesting that his disease may be driven by long-lived plasma cells rather than B cells and short-lived plasmablasts. Thus, we hypothesized that using bortezomib to target plasma cells would help our patient. Bortezomib may be a potential therapeutic option for cases of refractory mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) and other autoantibody-mediated diseases that do not respond to rituximab. Larger studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety of bortezomib for autoantibody-mediated diseases like MMP.

### IL-15 drives the specific migration of CD94+ and TCR-gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes in organ cultures of treated celiac patients [^116bZ5eS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed but extremely frequent disease, triggered by the ingestion of gliadin. The pathogenic mechanisms of CD are still poorly understood, but intraepithelial lymphocytes are considered to have a key role. We intended to define the subsets of T lymphocytes migrating upon gliadin challenge in organ cultures of treated celiac patients and establish the type of factor(s) driving such an infiltration.

- **Methods**: Duodenum biopsies from 10 treated celiacs and 7 controls were cultured in vitro with or without gliadin digest (1 mg/ml) or interleukin (IL)-15 (10 ng/ml). In 7 treated celiacs, IL-7, IL-4, and IL-2 were similarly tested. Intraepithelial CD3, CD8, TCR-gammadelta, and CD94 were detected by immunohistochemistry and numbered per mm of epithelium.

- **Results**: IL-15, but not IL-7, IL-4, or IL-2, induced an intraepithelial increase of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in celiac and control intestine (p < 0.001 vs. cultures with medium). IL-15 induced increases in the number of intraepithelial TCR-gammadelta+ and CD94+ cells only in celiacs (p < 0.001). IL-7 was also effective in increasing intraepithelial TCR-gammadelta+ (but not CD94+) cells in celiac biopsies (p < 0.001). Gliadin induced intraepithelial migration of CD3+, CD8+ (p < 0.001), and CD94+ (p < 0.05) cells in celiacs, but not in controls.

- **Conclusions**: The results we describe in this report indicate that IL-15 might have a key role in modulating and driving intraepithelial infiltration and ultimately in the pathogenesis of CD.

### Small bowel capsule endoscopy in refractory celiac disease: a luxury or a necessity [^111xyjoi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Summary box**:

- **What is already known**: Refractory celiac disease (RCD) can be associated with the development of pre-malignant and malignant conditions. Patients with RCD require regular monitoring to rule out disease progression and the development of complications.

- **What the new findings are**: Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) can be useful for comparing the extent of disease following the initiation of treatment. Patients with RCD type II had more extensive disease than those with RCD type I on SBCE. Patients with RCD type I tended to show a greater improvement in the percentage of abnormal small bowel involved on repeat SBCE compared to those with RCD type II.

### Persisting villous atrophy and adherence in celiac disease: What does the patient want? What should a clinician advise [^114jS6xs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease remains challenging. Clinicians may view mucosal healing as crucial. From the patient's perspective, avoidance of an invasive upper endoscopy may be desirable. A fundamental misconception is that noninvasive tools, including symptoms, serology, dietary adherence questionnaires, and novel gluten immunogenic peptides, may detect ongoing villous atrophy rather than assess adherence. Duodenal biopsies are the only reliable method for assessment of mucosal healing. However, we as clinicians should provide patients with the uncertainties of this approach, allowing them to make an informed decision on an individual basis.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^115VJ4SX]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The role of non-dietary therapies as an adjunct or as an alternative to the gluten-free diet (GFD) has yet to be determined. Among the candidate approaches, immunotherapy, including hookworm exposure, is currently being explored as an alternative to the GFD. However, even if successful, it is unlikely to benefit all patients. The role of glutenases, such as propyl endopeptidases, and tight junction regulators is likely to be in reducing the threshold response and optimizing the benefits of gluten restriction, rather than allowing a normal gluten-containing diet.

- **Recommendation**: None of the available novel treatments can currently be recommended for use outside clinical trials (Grade D).

### Biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease: Can you count on me [^111RGA8a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Different markers are available to diagnose and monitor celiac disease (CeD); however, the concordance among them and their efficacy are still controversial. We aim to define the efficacy of CeD biomarkers, their advantages, and their limitations.

CeD diagnostic criteria are widely accepted, with positive serology and duodenal atrophy (according to the Marsh-Oberhuber score) being the main hallmarks. Flow cytometry and other molecular biomarkers support the diagnosis of refractory CeD. However, CeD monitoring is less well defined, as the biomarkers are not always reliable. Currently, the reference standard for detecting mucosal healing is duodenal histology, but its timing and significance are debated. Novel scores may better define the trend of mucosal damage, and microRNAs are among the innovative noninvasive biomarkers. The assessment of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) is another aspect of CeD monitoring, based on questionnaires and recently developed tools such as dosage of urinary or fecal gluten immunogenic peptides.

Clinicians lack widely acknowledged tools to monitor CeD and GFD. Here, we present the efficacy of the most used markers.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^112qpyj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The management of celiac disease (CeD) currently relies on a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is generally well tolerated. While the GFD remains effective, it poses social, psychological, and practical challenges. Future treatments should improve efficacy while maintaining safety comparable to a GFD. New therapeutic approaches targeting the underlying mechanisms of CeD have emerged to ease the burden of dietary restrictions and improve patients' quality of life. These include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten. This field of research is active, with ongoing and completed trials aiming to validate these methods.

ZED1227 (also known as TAK-227) is a therapeutic agent that has garnered significant attention. If successful in the ongoing clinical trials, TAK-227 could represent a valid pharmacological treatment for celiac disease, offering an alternative to the strict GFD. Although phase II trials have shown promise for several therapeutic targets, broader validation through phase III trials is needed. Clinical trials often show discrepancies between symptoms, serological findings, and mucosal biopsy results, emphasizing the need for further research.

In many cases, final results and pitfalls have not yet been published. Moreover, the studies conducted so far exhibit several limitations in terms of both study design and methodology. In most cases, the protocols enrolled CeD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of duodenal mucosal damage, which often suggests poor adherence to a GFD.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: Expert review [^113cb468]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The purpose of this expert review is to summarize the diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. It reviews the evaluation of patients with celiac disease who have persistent symptoms; differential diagnosis, nutritional support, potential therapeutic options, and surveillance for complications of this condition.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by reviewing prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings.

- **Best practice advice 2**: In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent symptoms or signs (nonresponsive celiac disease), ongoing gluten ingestion should be excluded as a cause of these symptoms with serologic testing.

Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (the storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with the exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, and abdominal pain.
- **Non-gastrointestinal abnormalities**: These can include abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, skin disorders, and many other protean manifestations. Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all.

Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up.

- **Non-responsive celiac disease**: This occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic evaluation.

### A practical update on the use of bortezomib in the management of multiple myeloma [^113WjTZW]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Despite intensive therapy, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease, necessitating novel treatment approaches to improve outcomes. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of refractory or relapsed MM following the failure of at least two prior lines of therapy. Recently, it also received FDA approval for use as a second-line agent.

An expert panel of hematologists convened at the Ninth Congress of the European Hematology Association to review clinical data and experience in the treatment of MM with bortezomib, including bortezomib-based combination therapy. The conclusions of this expert panel, along with updated clinical data from the American Society of Hematology 46th Annual Meeting, provide a practical update on the use of bortezomib in MM.

Bortezomib has demonstrated significant antitumor activity as a single agent in refractory and/or relapsed MM, resulting in a significantly longer survival than with dexamethasone, with a 1-year overall survival rate of 80% versus 66% and a 78% longer median time to progression. In combination therapy, patient responses suggest the possibility of chemosensitization and synergy. Furthermore, bortezomib does not appear to adversely affect subsequent stem cell therapy. It is well tolerated, with most side effects being only mild to moderate and manageable. Information is provided on the practical management of the most common adverse events, including peripheral neuropathy.

### Azathioprine in refractory sprue: Results from a prospective, open-label study [^113brWcF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Refractory sprue is a rare and severe malabsorptive disorder that mimics celiac disease but is unresponsive to a gluten-free diet and lacks initial evidence of overt lymphoma. Treatment is largely empiric and often ineffective, with steroids and immunosuppression being the mainstream therapeutic options. This study aimed to evaluate prospectively the effect of azathioprine on a group of patients diagnosed with refractory sprue.

- **Methods**: Seven consecutive patients (five women and two men) with a well-defined diagnosis of refractory sprue, unresponsive to oral or parenteral steroids, were studied. At diagnosis, five patients showed endoscopic evidence of ulcerative jejunitis, and five underwent exploratory laparotomy to exclude malignancies. The characteristic monoclonal TCRgamma gene rearrangement was shown in five of six patients studied. Patients were treated for a mean of 11 months (range 8–12 months), and clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological parameters were reassessed at the end of the trial. The study was a prospective, open-label, non-placebo-controlled study using azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) plus oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day). A gluten-free diet (n = 7), as well as enteral (n = 6) and parenteral nutrition (n = 5), were administered during the trial.

- **Results**: After treatment, five patients achieved complete clinical remission, and biochemical and nutritional parameters significantly improved. Steroids were tapered after the onset of azathioprine, and no patient was on steroids at the end of the trial. Intestinal histology was reassessed to further evaluate the treatment's efficacy.

### Outcome measures in coeliac disease trials: The Tampere recommendations [^1148erXY]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, a large number of authors examined the literature on treatment outcomes in coeliac trials to issue recommendations for future studies. Our research team was multidisciplinary, and the treatment outcomes evaluated in the paper reflect the expert views of the authors.

We conducted an extensive literature review of more than 10,000 papers, basing our deliberations on personal experiences and expertise from our treatment of patients with coeliac disease (CD) through clinical trials and related research. There are already several guidelines for reporting treatment outcomes in CD. Hence, our paper is not intended to provide authoritative advice on study design, which is not yet possible due to the evolving nature of the field. Instead, it aims to complement existing literature with our expertise, focusing on how to measure response to non-gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment.

CD is a lifelong disease where the GFD is the only current treatment option. However, we anticipate that other alternative treatments will soon become commonplace.

Regulatory agencies are responsible for evaluating new therapies based on the risks and benefits to patients in terms of how they feel, function, or survive. These aims hold intuitive value for patients and clinicians and are sufficiently broad to form the foundation of any interventional clinical trial. Despite this, the precedent in many fields, including gastroenterology, has been the use of poorly validated outcomes that have limited applicability to clinical practice. Although CD adversely impacts survival and function, these outcomes are ge-

### Proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy: lessons from the first decade [^115vQv4Y]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in intracellular protein turnover, and its function is crucial to cellular homeostasis. First synthesized as probes of proteolytic processes, proteasome inhibitors began to be considered potential drug candidates when they were found to induce programmed cell death preferentially in transformed cells. They made their first leap into the clinic to be tested as therapeutic agents 10 years ago, and since then, great strides have been made in defining their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, toxicity, and certain limitations, such as resistance pathways. Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy has been confirmed through the approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this agent has become a standard of care. Lessons learned from this first-in-class agent are now being applied to the development of a new generation of proteasome inhibitors that promise efficacy in bortezomib-resistant disease and possibly a broader spectrum of diseases. This saga provides a salient example of the promise of translational medicine and a paradigm by which other agents may be successfully brought from the bench to the bedside.

### SPL drug information for bortezomib [^115HaHmM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Year). High credibility.

Regarding the use of bortezomib IV (also known as Velcade) in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh B (moderate):

- **Reduce dose**: Start at a dose of 0.7 mg/m² on the first cycle; escalate the dose to 1 mg/m² or reduce further to 0.5 mg/m² in subsequent cycles.
- **Monitor serum aminotransferases**: Monitor for toxicity.

### Combination therapy of bortezomib with novel targeted agents: An emerging treatment strategy [^116Riurq]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical trials evaluating combinations of targeted agents with bortezomib, the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, have been initiated with the objective of enhancing its single-agent activity in hematologic malignancies (myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma) and expanding its efficacy in solid tumors. In most cases, preclinical studies have provided a supportive rationale for designing these doublet combination studies.

Novel small molecule-targeted agents being investigated with bortezomib in clinical trials include protein deacetylase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, heat-shock protein 90 inhibitors, pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors, and other classes of targeted inhibitors. Preliminary clinical data, available from a number of ongoing trials, suggest that most of these combinations are well tolerated and some have promising clinical efficacy that will require subsequent confirmation.

Translational studies, conducted as part of the trials, may provide important insights into the putative mechanism of action delineated by preclinical studies of the combinations. The emergence of novel proteasome inhibitors may also expand opportunities for optimizing these combination therapies. There is potential for an increasingly broad clinical trials program to investigate this therapeutic approach in a range of tumor types, as well as to consider additional agents in sequence or in combination.

### How future pharmacologic therapies for celiac disease will complement the gluten-free diet [^11289Rvf]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging, and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment.

Most efforts address nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II. An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches targets defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis, and some have advanced to Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need, as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, healthcare providers, and payors.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116CCvNE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, and specifically focusing on the management of refractory disease, ACG 2013 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine, in patients with an incomplete response to corticosteroids or in those with recurring disease when the corticosteroid dose is reduced.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: Expert review [^117WLcJw]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend reviewing prior diagnostic testing. This includes serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings to confirm the initial diagnosis of celiac disease in patients with persistent symptoms or signs.

### Treatment of relapsed or refractory Waldenström's macroglobulinemia with bortezomib [^114XUXyR]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is a selective proteasome inhibitor which has shown significant activity in a variety of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma. Thus, this agent is worth studying in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM).

- **Design and methods**: Patients with refractory or relapsed WM were treated with bortezomib, administered intravenously at a dose of 1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in a 21-day cycle for a total of four cycles.

- **Results**: Ten previously treated patients with WM were treated with bortezomib. Most patients had been exposed to all active agents for WM, and eight patients had received three or more regimens. Six of these patients achieved a partial response, which occurred at a median of 1 month. The median time to progression in the responding patients is expected to exceed 11 months. Bortezomib was relatively well tolerated. The more common toxicities were mild or moderate thrombocytopenia, fever, and fatigue, while peripheral neuropathy occurred in three patients, and one patient developed severe paralytic ileus.

- **Interpretation and conclusions**: Our preliminary data indicate that bortezomib is an active agent in patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory WM. Four cycles of this agent may be adequate to assess sensitivity in this disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to evaluate combinations of bortezomib with other active agents.

### Carfilzomib [^116NDLcD]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

This spotlight review focuses on the second-generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. These patients must have received at least two prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent, and demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of the completion of the last therapy. The review emphasizes clinical trial data leading to drug approval and provides advice for treating physicians who are now accessing this drug for patients.

### Protease inhibition as new therapeutic strategy for GI diseases [^113pMMXP]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Other interesting proteolytic targets for IBD treatment are the proteases from the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Polymorphisms on several genes of this system have been identified in patients with IBD, and pathogenic bacteria modify this system turnover. Proteasome inhibitor therapy targeting the ubiquitin–proteasome system, such as the use of bortezomib, which was successfully developed for cancer treatment, could constitute a new option to treat patients with IBD efficiently.

### Celiac disease: A comprehensive current review [^112eyrHa]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The potential form of celiac disease (CD) is characterized by positive serological and genetic markers with a normal intestinal mucosa and minimal signs of inflammation, such as an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Patients with the potential form can exhibit classic and non-classic symptoms or be entirely asymptomatic. The scientific community has not universally agreed on whether or not a gluten-free diet (GFD) should be prescribed for patients with potential CD.

Refractory CD (RCD), on the other hand, is characterized by persistent symptoms and atrophy of the intestinal villi after at least 12 months of a strict GFD. RCD can lead to complications such as ulcerative jejunoileitis, collagenous sprue, and intestinal lymphoma.

In recent years, other forms of CD not included in the Oslo Classification, such as seronegative and GFD non-responsive CD, have been identified in clinical practice. The seronegative form is characterized by the lack of demonstrable serological markers along with clinical signs of severe malabsorption and atrophy of the intestinal mucosa. This form should be included in the differential diagnosis with other diseases that cause atrophy of the intestinal villi. Non-responsive CD refers to gastrointestinal symptoms that persist despite adherence to a GFD for more than 12 months; however, it does not differentiate between active CD and associated conditions, which can be responsible for symptom persistence. Alternative terminology is discussed below.

### Celiac disease: Clinical update [^114JB63P]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

This review highlights literature from the past year, exploring its impact on the understanding of celiac disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management.

- **Recent findings**: In contrast to earlier clinical trials, recent data suggest that early gluten introduction may protect against the development of celiac disease. Despite being underdiagnosed and associated with a high burden of disease and increased mortality risk, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the utility of mass screening in asymptomatic individuals. The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in celiac disease pathogenesis, although the exact mechanism remains undefined. While probiotics have been proposed as a disease-modifying option for celiac disease, most studies assessing their efficacy are of low quality. Patients with celiac disease do not appear to be at increased risk of contracting or developing adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Little is known about the pathogenesis of non-celiac gluten sensitivity; however, recent findings suggest an autoimmune basis for the condition.

Understanding of celiac disease continues to advance, though significant knowledge gaps remain. Large, rigorous, prospectively designed studies are needed to further characterize celiac disease pathogenesis, management, and therapeutic options.

### Bortezomib in the rapid reduction of high sustained antibody titers in disorders treated with therapeutic protein: lessons learned from Pompe disease [^1123EAf2]. Genetics in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

High sustained antibody titers complicate many disorders treated with a therapeutic protein, including those treated with enzyme replacement therapy, such as Pompe disease. Although enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) in Pompe disease has improved the prognosis of this otherwise lethal disorder, patients who develop high sustained antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa enter a prolonged phase of clinical decline resulting in death despite continued enzyme replacement therapy. Clinically effective immune-tolerance induction strategies have yet to be described in the setting of an entrenched immune response characterized by high sustained antibody titers, wherein antibody-producing plasma cells play an especially prominent role.

- **Methods**: We treated three patients with infantile Pompe disease experiencing marked clinical decline due to high sustained antibody titers. To target the plasma cell source of high sustained antibody titers, a regimen based on bortezomib (Velcade) was used in combination with rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin.

- **Results**: The treatment regimen was well tolerated, with no obvious side effects. Patient 1 had a 2,048-fold, and patients 2 and 3 each had a 64-fold, reduction in anti-alglucosidase alfa antibody titer, with concomitant sustained clinical improvement.

- **Conclusion**: The addition of bortezomib to immunomodulatory regimens is an effective and safe treatment strategy in infantile Pompe disease, with potentially broader clinical implications.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^113wius8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, particularly concerning HLA genotyping, ACG 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing to rule out celiac disease in specific clinical situations, such as:

- **Equivocal small bowel histological findings**: (Marsh 1–2) in seronegative patients
- **Evaluation of patients on a gluten-free diet**: If no testing for celiac disease was done before a gluten-free diet
- **Patients with discrepant CD-specific serology and histology**
- **Patients with suspicion of refractory celiac disease**: Where the original diagnosis of celiac disease remains in question
- **Patients with Down's syndrome**

### Celiac disease: A comprehensive current review [^117YGJBu]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Assessment of ongoing signs and symptoms in CD: The majority of patients with CD exhibit a symptomatic and mucosal response to the GFD. Some patients, however, fail to have complete control of symptoms and normalization of villous structure despite attempted adherence to the GFD. These patients have traditionally been referred to as non-responsive CD; however, this terminology has resulted in confusion as, in many cases, manifestations are due to associated conditions rather than CD. In light of both emerging tests for CD monitoring, such as GIPs, and emerging novel therapies for active CD, we propose updating this classification (formerly non-responsive CD).

When evaluating a patient with CD on a GFD and with ongoing signs or symptoms, the initial step is the differentiation between ongoing active CD (OACD) and the presence of associated CD conditions (ACDCs). OACD can be seen in three scenarios:

1. Slow response, where there is progressive improvement in symptoms and mucosal damage, but full remission does not occur for at least 1–2 years.
2. RCD, where there is ongoing severe enteropathy and malabsorptive symptoms after 6–12 months on a GFD.
3. Gluten exposure, where, despite adequate understanding of the GFD and attempted adherence, gluten avoidance is insufficient to result in symptomatic or histologic remission. This is the most frequent cause of OACD and can be due to very high sensitivity to a low level of gluten exposure or an inability of the patient to achieve standard recommended gluten restriction.

### Celiac disease: A clinical review [^1133y7Qs]. Abdominal Radiology (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on celiac disease:

- **Definition**: CD is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals.

- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with CD, the ingestion of gluten triggers an innate and adaptive immune response, leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Characteristically, deamidated gluten and the self-protein TG2 both become targets of highly disease-specific B-cell responses.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of CD is estimated at 500–1,000 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: CD may result in disease manifestations related to malabsorption (e.g. electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders), manifestations of extra-intestinal autoimmunity (dermatitis herpetiformis), or manifestations of neoplastic complications, including an increased risk of enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The majority of patients will respond to a lifelong gluten-free diet, which is the cornerstone of therapy.
