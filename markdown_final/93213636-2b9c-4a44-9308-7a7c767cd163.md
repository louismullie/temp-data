## Question

35 y/o FM with a nail concern: the Right middle finger is painful next to the nail, appears a bit green, and a yellow liquid comes out when squeezed. I've been doing a lot of cleaning since we moved last weekend — could that be related? Ddx?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the differential diagnosis of a 35-year-old woman with a painful green discoloration and purulent drainage of the right middle finger, and whether recent cleaning could be related. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical features and the pathophysiology they suggest. Then, I should construct and prioritize the differential diagnosis, explicitly flagging must-not-miss entities. Next, I will outline immediate diagnostic actions, including targeted exam findings, point-of-care ultrasound, and when to obtain cultures. After that, I need to define evidence-based management pathways for the leading diagnoses, with procedure, antibiotic, and adjunctive care choices. Finally, I should review complications, follow-up triggers, and patient education, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence while I double-check for pitfalls like herpetic whitlow where I&D is contraindicated.

> Let me first confirm the salient features and their implications. Pain adjacent to the nail with purulent yellow drainage localizes the process to the paronychial tissues and strongly implies an abscessed acute paronychia requiring drainage; the green discoloration is classic for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pigment production (pyoverdine, pyocyanin), particularly in the setting of moisture exposure from intensive cleaning, which compromises the nail fold barrier and favors colonization and infection; these pathophysiologic links are well-described in paronychia and green nail syndrome literature, so I should keep Pseudomonas high on the list while not forgetting that acute paronychia is commonly polymicrobial with staphylococcal and streptococcal involvement [^1165Qx3J] [^111Gwbop] [^11371u7S] [^1134eVpc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should build a prioritized differential. Most likely is acute bacterial paronychia with Pseudomonas involvement given the green chromonychia, moisture exposure, and purulence, but acute polymicrobial paronychia without Pseudomonas remains plausible on first principles, especially if the green is subtle or mixed, though I need to be cautious here because, wait, I initially thought "green could be bile pigment or artifact", but I should correct myself: on the nail unit, green chromonychia is classically tied to Pseudomonas rather than bilirubin deposition, so the hue is actually a helpful clue toward Pseudomonas rather than a distractor [^111Gwbop] [^115pqtGw] [^1134eVpc].

> But wait, what if this is herpetic whitlow masquerading as a bacterial abscess; I need to check for grouped clear vesicles or a honeycomb of coalescing vesicles and any prior similar episodes or prodrome, because I&D is contraindicated in HSV lesions and can worsen outcomes. The BMC Pediatrics case, along with additional reports, underscores that whitlow can be misdiagnosed, that vesicular morphology can be subtle or confused with "minimal drainage", and that PCR confirmation should be obtained when suspected before any incision [^1128Qzqw] [^114x78s3] [^114kxL9v].

> I will now examine for other deep or adjacent space infections because management changes. Let me consider a felon if tenderness, swelling, and pain are centered in the volar pulp rather than the nail folds, as this requires a different drainage approach; and I should confirm the absence of flexor tenosynovitis by assessing Kanavel's signs (fusiform swelling, finger held in flexion, tenderness along the sheath, pain with passive extension), since that is a surgical urgency with parenteral antibiotics, not a simple office I&D; imaging may be needed if the exam is equivocal or if deep space spread is suspected [^114QvE1R] [^115az3qh] [^113DmfHc].

> Next, I should review immediate diagnostic actions. On targeted exam, if I find fluctuance limited to the proximal or lateral nail folds without vesicles, that supports proceeding to I&D as definitive therapy; however, if vesicles are present, I should halt any I&D, obtain HSV PCR, and pivot to antivirals. If the presence of an abscess is uncertain, point-of-care ultrasound can increase diagnostic confidence and has been shown to change management decisions and technique in a meaningful proportion of cases; I need to ensure I use it to distinguish cellulitis from drainable collection. Routine cultures are not typically necessary for uncomplicated superficial paronychia, but given the atypical green hue suggesting Pseudomonas, obtaining a pus culture before starting antibiotics is reasonable to guide therapy and confirm the organism [^114AQV9v] [^111nXPoM] [^116aPfHA] [^111XyN8H].

> If an abscess is confirmed and HSV is excluded, I should proceed with incision and drainage as first-line treatment. Let me verify technique: for paronychia, a simple incision along the affected nail fold margin is usually sufficient; I need to avoid extending beyond the distal interphalangeal joint, and I should remember that routine irrigation of the abscess cavity has not been shown to improve outcomes in general abscess care. I should also remind myself that after adequate drainage, oral antibiotics are often unnecessary in immunocompetent patients unless there is surrounding cellulitis, systemic features, or risk factors; however, I'll reconsider this below in light of possible Pseudomonas involvement and local patterns [^114QvE1R] [^1145H49K] [^1165Qx3J] [^114AQV9v].

> Now, regarding empiric antibiotics, I need to ensure my choice aligns with the most likely pathogens and the clinical signal of green chromonychia. If the green hue is convincing for Pseudomonas, a short course of an oral fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin is a reasonable empiric option while awaiting culture results, provided local resistance patterns and patient risk factors are acceptable; if the presentation is a typical non-green paronychia with staphylococcal or streptococcal coverage required, agents like cephalexin, with consideration of TMP-SMX or clindamycin when MRSA risk is present, are standard. That said, wait, I should confirm the principle again: adequate drainage is the primary therapy, and antibiotics can often be omitted after good I&D unless there is significant cellulitis, immunosuppression, or systemic illness, so I must individualize this decision and de-escalate based on the culture if obtained [^111Gwbop] [^114kxL9v] [^1165Qx3J].

> For adjunctive local measures, I should advise warm soaks several times daily, and I need to check the details: Burow's solution or dilute acetic acid soaks are supported for acute paronychia and may be particularly helpful against gram-negative organisms in a moist environment; after drainage, topical antibiotics can be applied, and adding a topical corticosteroid has been shown to shorten time to symptom resolution in acute paronychia. I should ensure the digit is kept clean and dry between soaks and that mechanical or chemical irritants are avoided during healing [^1165Qx3J] [^1128NtSx].

> If HSV is suspected at any point, I must stop and avoid incision and drainage, obtain PCR confirmation, and initiate oral antivirals such as acyclovir or valacyclovir promptly while providing analgesia; I should document the vesicular morphology, counsel on contagion reduction, and arrange close follow-up. This avoids the risk of worsening the viral infection and prevents unnecessary antibiotics which would not be effective against HSV [^1128Qzqw] [^114x78s3] [^114kxL9v].

> I should confirm risk stratification and surveillance for complications. In patients with diabetes or immunosuppression, my threshold for oral or even IV antibiotics is lower, and I need to monitor more closely. If there is a chronic course, severe pain out of proportion, or recurrent infections, I should double-check for osteomyelitis with radiographs and consider advanced imaging when indicated; I also need to keep a vigilant eye for necrotizing soft tissue infection red flags or remote spread, which, although rare, can be catastrophic and require aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A 48-hour re-evaluation is prudent to ensure clinical improvement and reassess the diagnosis if response is suboptimal [^1123W3Vh] [^1171kDo4] [^114AQV9v].

> Let me think about patient education and prevention because this affects recurrence. I should counsel on minimizing prolonged water exposure, using protective gloves during cleaning, avoiding harsh detergents, and refraining from picking at hangnails or manipulating the nail folds; these behavioral modifications reduce moisture-associated colonization and barrier disruption that predispose to paronychia and green nail syndrome. Setting expectations that nail discoloration may take weeks to fully clear as the nail grows out can improve adherence to care [^1165Qx3J] [^1134eVpc].

> Finally, integrating these steps into a coherent decision path, I should first inspect carefully for vesicles to exclude herpetic whitlow, then assess for fluctuance to decide on immediate I&D versus conservative care, using ultrasound if the exam is equivocal; obtain a culture if the green hue suggests Pseudomonas or the presentation is atypical; proceed with I&D as primary therapy when an abscess is present, avoid routine irrigation, and reserve oral antibiotics for selected cases, tailoring coverage toward Pseudomonas if green chromonychia is convincing; add warm soaks and consider a topical antibiotic plus corticosteroid to hasten symptom resolution; advise moisture avoidance and protective practices; and arrange close follow-up within 48 hours with a low threshold to reassess the diagnosis or look for deeper involvement if the patient is not improving as expected [^114AQV9v] [^111nXPoM] [^1128NtSx] [^1145H49K] [^1134eVpc].

The most likely diagnosis is **acute paronychia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa** [^11371u7S] (green nail syndrome) [^1134eVpc] due to recent water/cleaning exposure and green discoloration with purulent drainage. Other considerations include **Staphylococcus aureus paronychia** [^11371u7S], herpetic whitlow [^1128Qzqw], felon [^114QvE1R], onychomycosis [^1122j2LR], and rare entities like subungual melanoma [^112gn25E] or squamous cell carcinoma [^113Qj9y3]. Management is incision and drainage [^114AQV9v] with topical or oral antibiotics [^11371u7S] [^114nXAy1]; avoid antifungals unless fungal infection is confirmed [^113FqpoU].

---

## Infectious etiologies

### Bacterial infections

- **Acute bacterial paronychia**: Most common; typically Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species [^11371u7S]; recent water exposure and green discoloration suggest Pseudomonas aeruginosa (green nail syndrome) [^1134eVpc].

- **Felon**: Pulp-space abscess [^114kxL9v]; usually Staphylococcus aureus [^114QvE1R]; presents with severe fingertip pain, swelling, and erythema.

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis**: Infection of the flexor tendon sheath; characterized by Kanavel's signs [^115az3qh] (fusiform swelling, pain on passive extension, tenderness along the sheath, and flexed posture).

---

### Fungal infections

A fungal infection of the nail plate, **onychomycosis** [^1122j2LR] typically presents with nail thickening, discoloration, and subungual debris [^114hfjyV]; it is less likely to cause acute pain and purulent discharge.

---

### Viral infections

An HSV infection of the finger, **herpetic whitlow** [^1128Qzqw] presents with vesicular lesions, pain, and swelling; it typically contains clear fluid rather than purulent discharge.

---

## Non-infectious etiologies

Traumatic injury from recent cleaning and moving may have caused minor trauma leading to **secondary bacterial infection** [^11371u7S], whereas **inflammatory conditions** are less likely given the acute presentation and purulent discharge.

---

## Rare but serious conditions

A rare malignancy, **subungual melanoma** presents with pigmented nail lesions and a typically chronic course not associated with acute pain or purulent discharge [^112gn25E], whereas **squamous cell carcinoma** is a rare malignancy of the nail unit with a chronic presentation featuring nail dystrophy and mass formation [^113Qj9y3].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Clinical examination**: Assess for erythema, swelling, fluctuance, and Kanavel's signs [^115az3qh].

- **Ultrasound**: Consider to differentiate abscess from cellulitis or deeper infections [^112yiKox] [^111nXPoM].

- **Culture**: Obtain purulent discharge culture if atypical presentation or treatment failure [^111XyN8H].

---

## Management

The primary treatment for abscess formation is **incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v]. Topical or oral **antibiotics** may be used [^114nXAy1], targeting Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^1134eVpc]; avoid antifungals unless fungal infection is confirmed [^113FqpoU].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute bacterial paronychia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (green nail syndrome)** [^1134eVpc], given the green discoloration, purulent discharge, and recent water exposure. Other considerations include Staphylococcus aureus paronychia, herpetic whitlow, felon, and onychomycosis. **Management includes incision and drainage** [^114AQV9v], antibiotics, and ultrasound if needed [^111nXPoM].

### Chloronychia caused by infection [^1134eVpc]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Green nail syndrome is caused by an infection of the nails that leads to greenish discoloration of the nail plate with onycholysis. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, an aerobic gram-negative bacillus, is a common causative pathogen, and its pigments, pyoverdine and pyocyanin, produce the characteristic greenish hue in the nails. *P. aeruginosa* preferentially colonizes in moist environments, and thus affected patients usually have a history of prolonged exposure to water. Other predisposing factors include onycholysis, onychotillomania, microtrauma to the nail fold, chronic paronychia, long-term exposure to soaps or detergents, and associated nail disorders, such as psoriasis.

*Pseudomonas oryzihabitans* is a yellow-pigmented, gram-negative bacillus that can trigger sepsis, endophthalmitis, peritonitis, and bacteremia. It is an opportunistic pathogen, and thus individuals with major illnesses, including those undergoing surgery or with catheters, are vulnerable. At the time of writing, skin and soft tissue infections by *P. oryzihabitans* have been reported in the literature; however, nail infections have not been reported, to our knowledge. In the present case, the nail infection by *P. oryzihabitans* manifested as a yellowish-green discoloration, clinically consistent with green nail syndrome. However, unlike the dark green discoloration in typical green nail syndrome caused by *P. aeruginosa* infection, the patient's nail exhibited a light yellow-green hue, consistent with the yellow pigment production by *P. oryzihabitans*. Therefore, careful observation of the hue in discolored nails may aid in differentiating causative pathogens.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^11371u7S]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammation of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a toe or finger. It may be classified as either acute or chronic.

- **Acute paronychia**: The main factor associated with its development is direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold, which allows pathogens to inoculate the nail, resulting in infection. Treatment options include warm compresses; topical antibiotics, with or without corticosteroids; oral antibiotics; or surgical incision and drainage for more severe cases.

- **Chronic paronychia**: This condition is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. Patients should avoid exposure to contact irritants; treatment for underlying inflammation and infection is recommended, using a combination of a broad-spectrum topical antifungal agent and a corticosteroid. The application of emollient lotions may also be beneficial. Topical steroid creams have been found to be more effective than systemic antifungals in treating chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant cases, en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold is an option. Alternatively, an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail removal, may be performed.

### Case report: palmar herpetic whitlow and forearm lymphangitis in a 10-year-old female [^1128Qzqw]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Discussion and conclusion**: Here, we presented a case of a left palmar lesion caused by herpetic whitlow that was initially mistaken for a left palmar abscess caused by MSSA or MRSA. Classically, herpes infection of the hand in children is associated with finger sucking in asymptomatic salivary carriers. However, viral vesicles can involve any region of the hand. While reviewing her history, certain points hint at this eventual diagnosis, including prodromal symptoms (pain and itching in the affected area), the history of a previous occurrence, palm sucking and biting, lack of leukocytosis, and the absence of any significant or purulent drainage.

The palm sucking and biting behavior is unusual in a 10-year-old child, indicating that the patient may have had a behavioral disorder that contributed to this habit. However, no documented evaluation was present in the patient's chart. Our diagnosis was confirmed by PCR, though our results were complicated by the fact that antibiotics were started at the outside hospital prior to the drawing of wound cultures.

Although the initial diagnosis was a bacterial abscess secondary to MSSA or MRSA, other causes of palmar lesions include herpetic whitlow (as in this case), cellulitis, coxsackie viruses, erythema multiforme, sporotrichosis, syphilis, rat bite fever, impetigo, or trauma. In cases of herpetic whitlow, incision and drainage is contraindicated due to the risk of viremia, secondary bacterial superinfection, and HSV encephalitis. While our patient did not experience any of these secondary complications, it is important to carefully consider these possibilities in similar cases.

### Management of finger felons and paronychia: A narrative review [^114QvE1R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Finger felons and paronychias are common presentations to the emergency department, with significant morbidity and long-term pain if not managed appropriately.

- **Objective**: This narrative review provides a focused summary of the management of finger felons and paronychias for emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Finger felons consist of the accumulation of pus in the pulp space of the digit, which can lead to digital compartment syndrome if not adequately drained. Paronychias are an infection involving the proximal or lateral nail folds. Early felons and paronychia may be managed with antibiotics alone, whereas more advanced infections require incision and drainage. The preferred approaches for felon drainage are a longitudinal incision in the volar space if superficial, or lateral space if deep, with careful attention not to extend past the distal interphalangeal joint space. Extension to a hockey stick or fish mouth incision may be indicated in select cases. For paronychia, a simple incision approach is preferred for simple paronychia with abscess, while single or double incision technique along the nail is preferred for more complex cases.

- **Conclusion**: It is essential for emergency physicians to be familiar with the management of finger felons and paronychias. We review the different approaches to management, with the goal of providing a resource for those interested in expanding their knowledge of felon and paronychia management.

### "Hitting the nail on the head" [^112gn25E]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Subungual malignant melanoma is a rare form of malignancy that can present at an advanced stage. We describe a case that was diagnosed following a presentation to the emergency department for a traumatic injury to the affected area. Initial presentations of malignant disease and its complications form a relatively low proportion of the caseload of emergency doctors. In this case, a patient presented following a minor injury that had failed to recover; subsequent investigation of this injury led to the diagnosis of subungual malignant melanoma in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. This is a rare case that presented in an atypical fashion, with a confounding history of minor trauma. It is presented to highlight the differential diagnosis of destructive bone lesions.

### Rapidly enlarging growth of the proximal nail fold [^113Qj9y3]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail unit is a rare but often underappreciated neoplasm. Treatment can be delayed due to confusion with paronychia and verruca. Infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) has been associated with this malignancy.

- **Objective**: To describe the development of a superficially invasive SCC of the proximal nail fold in a patient infected with HIV, to report the association of a previously unrecognized HPV genotype, and to review key etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic points as related to SCC of the proximal nail fold.

- **Results**: This is the first report of HPV 26 coinfection in monogamous sexual partners, both of whom are HIV infected and have demonstrated lesions of malignant degeneration consistent with SCC.

- **Conclusion**: SCC must be considered in the differential diagnosis of nail fold neoplasm. An immunocompromised condition such as HIV/AIDS may predispose to malignant degeneration of lesions caused by infection with HPV.

### Onychomycosis: Treatment and prevention of recurrence [^1122j2LR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

The disease onychomycosis can be associated with a variety of factors, including prolonged exposure to wet environments, chronic venous insufficiency, and the presence of spores and hyphae on a KOH wet mount. It is also linked to conditions such as athlete's foot, tinea manuum, and age over 60 years. Additional associations include brittle nails, nail pain, onycholysis, tinea cruris, diabetes mellitus, and wearing tight-fitting shoes.

Symptoms such as nail thickening, nail discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, psoriasis, peripheral artery disease (PAD), tinea capitis, and hyperhidrosis can also be observed. Other related conditions may include yellow nail discoloration, tinea corporis, tinea pedis, and onychodystrophy.

### Acute paronychia in a neonate secondary to clindamycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^113wh6Qb]. Pediatric dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Paronychia is a common inflammatory condition of the nail fold that is often associated with infection. The causes can be fungal, viral, or, most commonly, bacterial. Neonatal paronychia is a rare presentation, with only one previously reported case in the literature of a patient younger than one month of age. This article details a case of an 8-day-old neonate with acute bacterial paronychia caused by clindamycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

### Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma presenting as finger infection [^116NH8jN]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma (ADPA) is a rare tumor of sweat gland origin that may present in a nonspecific manner on the finger. The authors report a case of ADPA that was treated initially as a chronic infection of the finger, leading to a delay in diagnosis and definitive treatment. Failure of the wound to heal led to a biopsy of the lesion, which revealed ADPA. Because of the potential for aggressive local growth and distant metastases, amputation was indicated. This case demonstrates the importance of considering ADPA in the differential diagnosis of nonhealing wounds of the finger that have not responded to other forms of treatment. Wide local excision with clear margins and close surveillance for signs of recurrence or metastasis are indicated for this rare sweat gland neoplasm.

### Subungual neuroma masquerading as green nail syndrome [^113uG7DE]. JAAD Case Reports (2022).

A 53-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of a green-colored right thumbnail. Examination revealed onycholysis and dark green chloronychia of the distal nail (Fig 1). There was no history of preceding trauma or manipulation. The patient worked in the food service industry. Previous treatment included oral fluconazole, oral terbinafine, and oral ciprofloxacin for 1 week, along with vinegar soaks, topical gentamicin ointment, and topical efinaconazole solution, all without improvement. Bacterial culture of the fingernail revealed heavy growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while fungal culture was negative at this time. The patient was started on oral ciprofloxacin for 5 weeks; however, she discontinued the medication prematurely due to concerns about tendonitis following wrist surgery.

Subsequently, the patient was treated with dilute bleach soaks of the fingernail biweekly and oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 2 months, resulting in partial improvement. Fungal culture at this time showed moderate growth of Candida species, and fungal polymerase chain reaction detected Candida parapsilosis. Over the next 2 years, the patient underwent several cycles of pulse itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for 1 week per month over 3 months, with minimal improvement.

Given the incomplete resolution of the green discoloration of the nail and persistent onycholysis, a punch biopsy of the distal nail bed was performed, including the most proximal lytic area of the nail bed. The distal half of the nail plate was avulsed for the biopsy.

### A hand surgeon's guide to common onychodystrophies [^112eTWej]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

The human fingernail contributes to the precise dexterity of the fingers, enhances sensibility, allows manipulation of fine objects, and shields the fingertip from traumatic injury. Nail abnormalities are a common incidental finding in the course of a hand surgeon's daily practice. These abnormalities may be clues to systemic, dermatologic, traumatic, and infectious processes that would benefit from further evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this review is to discuss common nail dystrophies and their related diagnoses.

### Complications of nail surgery: A review of the literature [^116BktFU]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The realm of nail unit surgery encompasses both dermatologists and hand surgeons. Nail surgery complications may include allergy to anesthetics, infection, hematoma, nail deformity, as well as persistent pain and swelling.

- **Objective**: To review the pertinent literature regarding nail unit surgery complications.

- **Methods**: A Medline literature search was performed for relevant publications.

- **Results**: Nail unit surgery complications appear to be relatively infrequent. The majority of postoperative nail deformity complications result from nail matrix damage.

- **Conclusion**: Complications may be minimized through preventive measures, such as careful patient selection, using sterile technique, and gentle treatment of the nail matrix.

### Calcium deposits in the hand and wrist [^1161Y1s1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Calcium, or calcific, deposition disease in the form of acute calcific periarthritis of the hand and wrist is an uncommon entity that may be confused with more common crystalline or inflammatory arthropathies as well as infections. It is important for the clinician to be aware of this disease process and to include it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acutely painful, focal inflammation of the hand or wrist. Nonsurgical management is often sufficient; however, considering the self-limited nature of the disease, accurate diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary antibiotic or surgical treatment.

### In brief: Kanavel's signs and pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis [^115az3qh]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2016). Low credibility.

Understanding the common presentations of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis allows for timely diagnosis of the condition to enable prompt treatment. A useful clinical tool would also assist the clinician in excluding the diagnosis of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis when it is not present, allowing for the correct identification of other disorders. These should be included in the initial differential diagnosis for a swollen or painful finger. Conditions that mimic acute pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis include abscesses, felons, herpetic whitlow (a cutaneous infection caused by the herpes simplex virus, often presenting in medical and dental professionals with clear, painful vesicles that coalesce into painful bullae over the fingertip), gouty arthritis, and septic arthritis involving the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joints.

### MDCT of hand and wrist infections: Emphasis on compartmental anatomy [^113DmfHc]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Hand and wrist infections can present with a spectrum of manifestations, ranging from cellulitis to deep-space collections. The various infectious processes can be categorized as superficial or deep infections based on their respective locations relative to the tendons. Superficial hand infections are located superficial to the tendons and include cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp-space infections, herpetic whitlow, and volar as well as dorsal subcutaneous abscesses.

Deep hand infections are located deep to the tendon sheaths and include synovial space infections, such as infectious tenosynovitis; deep fascial space infections; septic arthritis; necrotizing fasciitis; and osteomyelitis. Knowledge of hand and wrist compartmental anatomy is essential for the accurate diagnosis and management of hand infections. Although early and superficial infections of the hand may respond to non-surgical management, most hand infections are surgical emergencies.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), with its multiplanar reformation (MPR) and three-dimensional (3D) capabilities, is a powerful tool in the emergency setting for the evaluation of acute hand and wrist pathology. The clinical and imaging features of hand and wrist infections, as evident on MDCT, will be reviewed with emphasis on contiguous and closed synovial and deep fascial spaces. Knowledge of hand compartmental anatomy enables accurate characterization of the infectious process and localizes the extent of disease in the acute setting.

### Local and systemic nail plate abnormalities: A clinical review [^112pKEYW]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are often difficult to recognize and diagnose because of the subtlety of their presentation and their shared overlapping features that are common to several conditions. Experientially, this is further complicated by the fact that specific training on the diagnosis of nail pathologies varies substantially across most residency programs and for a majority of medical and surgical specialties. To distinguish these presentations from true, potentially deleterious nail disorders, clinicians should be familiar with the most commonly occurring nail pathologies and their associations, and use a systematic approach when examining or evaluating alterations in the nails. In the present study, we review the most common clinical disorders affecting the nail apparatus.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^114oMws9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically concerning systemic antifungals, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend offering terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks in fingernail infections and 12–16 weeks in toenail infections) as first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is advised to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC) in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### Unilateral Beau's lines associated with a fingertip crushing injury [^113unGM6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Beau's lines are transverse depressions or ridges on the nail surface that result from the temporary arrest of nail matrix formation. They can be caused by systemic diseases, local trauma, drugs, and infection. Typically, Beau's lines following a fingertip injury appear only on the affected finger rather than on one entire extremity. In this report, we discuss the case of a 36-year-old man who exhibited transverse ridges on the nail plates of all five fingers of the affected extremity after experiencing a thumb crushing injury.

During follow-up, the growth rate of the affected fingernails remained normal. The transverse ridges progressed with the linear growth of the nails and eventually disappeared. To our knowledge, no association between unilateral Beau's lines and fingertip injury has been documented in English literature.

### A snotty nose: More than just a cold [^116sWfcT]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A healthy 3-year-old girl presented with a 5-day history of right-sided cheek and eye swelling and pain, associated with right-sided green nasal discharge. Examination revealed diffuse erythematous swelling around the right cheek, jawline, and eye. Oral antibiotics for suspected periorbital cellulitis were ineffective. Blood inflammatory markers and ultrasound of her neck and parotid glands were normal. She was discharged as having viral parotitis. Antibiotics and nasal drops were later restarted for clinical sinusitis; however, she showed no improvement, now having 3 weeks of right-sided facial swelling with thick green and intermittently bloody nasal discharge. Further history revealed possible squint, mastication pain, and breathing difficulty through the right nostril.

Cranial imaging demonstrated a large central but predominantly right-sided nasopharyngeal tumour, extending into the ethmoid sinuses and orbits (with medial recti distortion), infratemporal fossa, pterygoid muscles, and anterior and middle cranial fossae. There was accompanying skull base destruction.

MRI axial T2-TSE (turbo spin echo) image showed the tumour filling the posterior nasal passages and nasopharynx, which erodes the anterior border of the clivus and extends into the anterior right middle cranial fossa. There is extension into the right orbit, distorting the medial rectus muscle.

Staging and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-metastatic parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS). Chemoradiotherapy ensued.

RMS is the most common type of childhood soft-tissue sarcoma.

### Subungual neuroma masquerading as green nail syndrome [^111Gwbop]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Traumatic neuromas are benign tumors of the peripheral sensory nerve tissue that develop secondary to injuries at sites such as the palmar aspect of the hand, upper and lower extremities, and the tongue. Their etiology may be explained by a disorganized repair of disunited nerve endings. Traumatic neuromas may also arise from chronic stimulation and friction. At the time of writing, only two cases of traumatic subungual neuromas have been reported. In both cases, subungual growth was suspected due to an obvious painful subungual nodule or band-like onychodystrophy. In our patient, the mass effect of the subungual neuroma led to chronic distal onycholysis, allowing for the development of persistent green nail syndrome and candidal onychomycosis.

Green nail syndrome, most commonly caused by P. aeruginosa, is a nail disease of infectious etiology that causes green chromonychia, onycholysis, and chronic paronychia. It is challenging to treat, and recommended therapeutic regimens vary. First-line treatment options consist of topical therapies, such as Dakin solution (0.5%-2% sodium hypochlorite) soaks, followed by two weeks of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, if these fail. Fungal and bacterial coinfections are common and may further complicate treatment. In a study by Ohn et al. in 2020, 65% of patients with green nail syndrome had fungal coinfection. In such cases, an extended course of antibiotics and antifungals has been used.

In cases of persistent green nail syndrome, a full spectrum of potential underlying causes of onycholysis should be considered. Examination of subungual lesions can…

### Non-healing arm wound with a discharging sinus in an elderly patient with diabetes [^111LDuFM]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old Filipino female presented with unilateral acute onset of a painful red eye, blurred vision, and yellow discharge. Upon examination, she had a corrected visual acuity of 6/5 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. There was left-sided periorbital swelling, with chemosis involving the bulbar conjunctiva on the temporal aspect. Ocular motility showed a limitation of left-sided abduction with mild limitation of laevoelevation and laevodepression. She was afebrile, and systemic examination was unremarkable.

Her medical history included a diagnosis of Crohn's disease since the age of 20. She was on oral mesalamine 1 g for mildly active colitis. The full blood count was normal, but erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were raised. Blood culture and conjunctival swab were negative. A contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrated enlargement of the lacrimal gland. She was managed conservatively with acetaminophen and codeine for pain and swelling. She recovered completely in 2 weeks with no sequelae.

### Primary care management of skin abscesses guided by ultrasound [^116aPfHA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Primary care providers often manage skin abscesses in the outpatient setting. Estimating the size and depth of an abscess, and distinguishing an abscess from cellulitis by clinical examination can be challenging due to surrounding firm tissue induration. Definitive treatment of an abscess requires incision and drainage, and the approach chosen may be altered by abscess size, depth, and surrounding neurovascular structures.

- **Methods**: For 31 consecutive patients seen in the primary care outpatient clinic, we prospectively compared the estimated size of skin abscesses by clinical examination with that determined by ultrasound. Prior to incision and drainage, a limited point-of-care ultrasound examination was performed, the abscess dimensions were measured, the depth was determined, and adjacent vascular structures were noted. Based on ultrasound findings, physicians reported whether the decision to perform the procedure or the techniques used to perform the procedure were altered by the scan.

- **Results**: The clinical examination was inaccurate for size estimation by more than 0.5 cm in 16 of 31 patients (52%). Ultrasound examination changed the physician's decision of whether or not incision and drainage should be performed in 7 patients (23%) and altered the technique/approach in an additional 10 patients (32%); thus, management was changed in 55% of cases. Physician confidence in performing the procedure was improved in 16 cases (52%).

### Flexor tenosynovitis of the hand caused by [^115JzJ5z]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The patient ultimately received a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis tenosynovitis and treatment was successful. Several factors likely contributed to the difficulty in identifying the correct etiology: (1) The patient had a medical condition, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), that offered a more probable explanation; (2) The progression of her symptoms was both mild and gradual, making infection, commonly caused by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, unlikely; (3) She had no personal history or exposure to M. tuberculosis; (4) The low prevalence of tuberculosis in developed countries such as the United States generally lowers its rank on the differential diagnosis; and (5) She denied an exposure history suggestive of a specific infectious agent, such as aquatic activities (Mycobacterium marinum).

As the overall annual incidence of tuberculosis has decreased in the United States, from more than 50 per 100,000 cases to less than 5 per 100,000 cases between the 1950s and early 2000s, the proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis infection has increased. Infections of the musculoskeletal system now account for 11.3% of extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases in the United States. The availability of effective and targeted treatments against M. tuberculosis and the potential morbidity associated with untreated infection make timely diagnosis critical.

### Bedside ultrasound in the diagnosis of complex hand infections: a case series [^112yiKox]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The red, swollen, infected hand can present a diagnostic challenge in the emergency department (ED). Hand infections are relatively uncommon in the ED, with diagnoses ranging from simple cellulitis to deep space abscess, and even to suppurative flexor tenosynovitis. Accurate differentiation of these clinical entities is crucial for healing and functional recovery.

In this case series, we review four patients with similar presentations of a red, swollen hand, but with different diagnoses and treatment strategies. We describe how ultrasound was used to assist in diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy. Techniques for the sonographic evaluation of the hand are reviewed, with imaging tips to enhance visualization and diagnostic accuracy provided.

Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Bedside ultrasound may allow for a more rapid and accurate diagnosis of various hand infections when diagnosis by physical examination is unclear.

### Onychoheterotopia: Pathogenesis, presentation, and management of ectopic nail [^111VBTJK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Onychoheterotopia is an extremely rare condition in which nail tissue grows outside the classic nail unit of the dorsal fingers and toes. It presents as either small outgrowths of a deviant nail or a complete double fingernail malformation. The histology of the onychoheterotopia matrix is oftentimes very similar to the normal nail matrix, although it plays a central role in diagnosis.

- **Objective**: We sought to review the literature on the clinical and histologic aspects of onychoheterotopia.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed to evaluate peer-reviewed articles on the topic.

- **Results**: Detailed reports have characterized many features of onychoheterotopia. The various etiology and treatment options are reviewed.

- **Limitations**: The study was limited to articles in the English-language literature.

- **Conclusions**: In this article, we provide a review of the literature based on the understanding of onychoheterotopia, its diagnosis, and its management.

### Draining dorsal hand pustules, nodules, and ulcers in a patient with immunosuppression [^1148j7xi]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: What is a potential treatment for this condition?
	- A. Topical corticosteroid
	- B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin
	- C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy
	- D. Meropenem
	- E. Supportive care

- **Answers**:
	- A. Topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Immunosuppression, including systemic corticosteroids, is a risk factor for cutaneous protothecosis. Further immunosuppression would likely exacerbate this condition.
	- B. Azole antifungal or amphotericin – Correct. Protothecosis can be difficult to treat and may require multiple agents or months of therapy; optimal treatment for cutaneous disease is unclear. Patients at risk for disease spread should be treated more aggressively. Surgical excision or debridement is often beneficial for local cutaneous disease. For deeper or persistent infections, surgical management is combined with azole antifungals or intravenous amphotericin with a tetracycline. Left untreated, the disease will persist and potentially spread, although systemic or disseminated infection is rare. The prognosis for cutaneous infection is generally positive.
	- C. Cytotoxic chemotherapy – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis is an infection and would not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy.
	- D. Meropenem – Incorrect. This patient was treated with multiple antibiotic courses without resolution. Protothecosis infection is not a bacterial infection and would not respond to conventional antibiotics alone.
	- E. Supportive care – Incorrect. Cutaneous protothecosis requires treatment to reduce the likelihood of dissemination.

### Pincer nails complicated by distal phalangeal osteomyelitis [^1123W3Vh]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Besides the known cosmetic implications, pincer nails are often complicated by pain, chronic inflammation, and resuppurative infections. We report two such cases of chronic paronychia of the thumb secondary to pincer nails. Both were complicated by osteomyelitis. Although both cases eventually healed after excisional debridement, one case required elective amputation because the significant loss of bony support resulted in a painful, floppy fingertip and poor pinch. Regular radiographic assessments may be useful in the management of patients with chronic inflammation or reparonychias secondary to pincer nails to detect osteomyelitis.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1165Qx3J]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. Acute paronychia is caused by polymicrobial infections after the protective nail barrier has been breached. Treatment consists of warm soaks with or without Burow's solution or 1% acetic acid. Topical antibiotics should be used, with or without topical steroids, when simple soaks do not relieve the inflammation.

The presence of an abscess should be determined, which mandates drainage. There are a variety of options for drainage, ranging from instrumentation with a hypodermic needle to a wide incision with a scalpel. Oral antibiotics are usually not needed if adequate drainage is achieved unless the patient is immunocompromised or a severe infection is present. Therapy is based on the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns.

Chronic paronychia is characterized by symptoms lasting at least six weeks and represents an irritant dermatitis to the breached nail barrier. Common irritants include acids, alkalis, and other chemicals used by housekeepers, dishwashers, bartenders, florists, bakers, and swimmers. Treatment is aimed at stopping the source of irritation while treating the inflammation with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More aggressive techniques may be required to restore the protective nail barrier. Treatment may take weeks to months. Patient education is paramount to reduce the recurrence of acute and chronic paronychia.

### Can paronychia cause a remote necrotizing soft tissue infection [^1171kDo4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Remote necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) resulting from paronychia is very unusual but potentially lethal. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman affected by this unusual infection. The paronychia completely resolved in less than two weeks; however, an NSTI involved the right chest and flank and the left thigh. The patient required intensive care and multiple surgical debridements. This recent experience, along with literature data, suggests that paronychia can cause a remote NSTI that can rapidly spread and become life-threatening. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement are essential to a successful outcome.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^113w4S4V]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The parents brought a 28-day-old male child to the Dermatology outpatient department of Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal, with complaints of yellowish discoloration of the nail, accompanied by slight swelling of the upper part of the middle finger on the left hand for one week. The mother reported that the baby had been suckling this finger since birth. The baby was well until two weeks ago when he developed a slight yellowish discoloration of the middle finger on the left hand, which spread proximally with increasing thickness of the nail. There was no family history of fungal infections, psoriasis, lichen planus, Darrier's disease, or yellow nail syndrome. Additionally, there were no other risk factors suggestive of HIV infection in the parents. The baby was delivered at 39 weeks of gestational age via normal vaginal delivery, weighing 3250 g, with no history of perinatal hypoxia. His developmental milestones were appropriate for his age.

On examination, the baby's physical activities were as expected for his age. There was noticeable yellowish discoloration of the nail of the middle finger on the left hand distally, with yellowish subungual hyperkeratotic debris. Neither pitting nor whitish deposits on the nail were evident. Examination of the skin revealed no lesions suggestive of fungal infections, psoriasis, lichen planus, or Darrier's disease. Scalp hairs were healthy. Oral and genital surfaces were normal without any lesions suggestive of mucosal candidiasis. Systemic examination was within normal limits. It was provisionally diagnosed as onychomycosis. The nail was trimmed.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^1163VHcB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig. 1 and after gentle washing in Fig. 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig. 3.

- **Question 1**: What is the diagnosis?
	- A. Acute paronychia
	- B. Onychomycosis
	- C. Retronychia
	- D. Squamous cell carcinoma
	- E. Ingrown nail

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Acute paronychia** – Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate, allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
	- **B. Onychomycosis** – Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
	- **C. Retronychia** – Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis include chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and a thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix, and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
	- **D. Squamous cell carcinoma** – Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
	- **E. Ingrown nail** – Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the nail edges and are not consistent with the described symptoms.

### The use of common salt for the treatment of pyogenic granuloma [^115qPcGF]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 53-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a rapidly growing tumor on the right middle finger accompanied by episodes of bleeding. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient reported that the swelling began after self-induced trauma approximately 20 days prior to her presentation and denied any recent changes in her medications or history of similar conditions.

Examination revealed a solitary, bright erythematous, dome-shaped nodule with yellowish crusting superimposed over the dorsal periungual area of the right middle finger (see Figure 1). Based on the history and clinical appearance, a diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma (PG) was made. Various treatment options were discussed, and the patient opted for treatment with sodium chloride (common salt). This involved covering the entire lesion with salt after protecting the perilesional skin with white soft paraffin, followed by a simple dressing. The patient was instructed to repeat the procedure daily at home.

After 3 weeks of daily salt application, the lesion resolved completely (see Figure 2), and the pain and movement restriction of the finger also subsided. The patient was satisfied with the result and reported no side effects.

### Common acute hand infections [^114kxL9v]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections.

- **Paronychia**: An infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks, and sometimes oral antibiotics.

- **Felon**: An abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks, while a more advanced felon requires incision and drainage.

- **Herpetic whitlow**: A painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing.

- **Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries**: More serious infections that often require surgical intervention. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath, with treatment consisting of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation. A clenched-fist injury usually results from an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Clinical presentations of soft-tissue infections and surgical site infections [^112ya68j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Skin and soft-tissue infections usually follow minor traumatic events or surgical procedures and are caused by a wide spectrum of bacteria. Less frequently, these infections occur spontaneously, which is often clinically confusing and leads to delays in diagnosis. Most of the infections are self-limited and can be easily treated with local measures and/or antibiotics. However, some are life-threatening, requiring prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement in addition to the wise choice of antibiotic agents to limit tissue loss and preserve life.

Many survivors experience critical tissue losses, necessitating changes in lifestyle and possibly major reconstructive cosmetic surgery. The involvement of antibiotic-resistant gram-positive microorganisms in these infections increases their treatment difficulty and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome.

### Clinical immunology review series: An approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses [^112cxETd]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients may be referred to the immunology clinic for investigation of recurrent superficial abscess formation. In the majority of adult patients, this clinical presentation does not equate with an underlying primary immune deficiency. Nevertheless, recurrent mucocutaneous abscesses can be associated with significant morbidity and long-term complications, including scarring and fistula formation, and may be associated with underlying immune-mediated disease. This review sets out an approach to the patient with recurrent superficial abscesses, focusing on the differential diagnoses, investigation, and management of both the common causes and those associated with specific immune deficiencies.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1144ueM7]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. Clinically, it presents as either an acute or a chronic condition. It is characterized as a localized, superficial infection or abscess of the paronychial tissues of the hands or, less commonly, the feet. Any disruption of the seal between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate can lead to acute infections of the eponychial space by providing a portal of entry for bacteria.

Treatment options for acute paronychias include warm-water soaks, oral antibiotic therapy, and surgical drainage. For chronic paronychia, it is crucial that patients avoid potential irritants. Treatment options involve the use of topical antifungal agents and steroids, as well as surgical intervention. Patients with chronic paronychias that do not respond to therapy should be evaluated for unusual causes, such as malignancy.

### Infection and panniculitis [^112aawFB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Infection-induced panniculitis may result from a number of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Viruses have also been implicated as a cause. This type of panniculitis can occur as a primary infection through direct inoculation of infectious microorganisms into the subcutaneous tissue or secondarily via microbial hematogenous dissemination, leading to subsequent infection of the subcutaneous tissue.

Panniculitis is rarely viewed solely in terms of infectious causes. Subcutaneous infections are infrequently seen as infection-induced panniculitis but rather as cutaneous infections with subcutaneous involvement. Little information exists specifically on the subject of infection-induced panniculitis outside the realm of case reports and case series.

This review addresses panniculitis from the vantage point of infectious causes, focusing on microorganisms with infection-induced panniculitis reports in the literature. Diagnosis and treatment are also discussed.

### Acute and chronic paronychia of the hand [^117Fh9Au]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic infections and inflammation adjacent to the fingernail, or paronychia, are common. Paronychia typically develops following a breakdown in the barrier between the nail plate and the adjacent nail fold and is often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens. However, noninfectious etiologies, such as chemical irritants, excessive moisture, systemic conditions, and medications, can cause nail changes. Abscesses associated with acute infections may spontaneously decompress or may require drainage and local wound care along with a short course of appropriate antibiotics. Chronic infections have a multifactorial etiology and can lead to nail changes, including thickening, ridging, and discoloration. Large, prospective studies are needed to identify the best treatment regimen for acute and chronic paronychia.

### Delusional infestation complicated by gangrene and osteomyelitis requiring finger amputation [^111Lh1UW]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Patients frequently attempt to extract the 'pathogen' or fibers and use a plethora of tools or agents to do so. Consequently, excoriations, prurigo nodularis, ulcerations, scars, and secondary infections develop. The manifestations may be asymmetrical due to the dominant hand effect. A large proportion of patients (25%-75%) tries to demonstrate proof of their illness by collecting specimens and bringing them to physician visits. This scenario is known as the 'specimen sign', 'matchbox sign', or 'baggies sign', as patients may use different containers.

Non-cutaneous manifestations include psychiatric issues (depression and hallucinations), neurological problems (cognition issues), and general symptoms (fatigue and myalgia). Patients develop complex stories to explain their illness. They are often reluctant to be stigmatized by a diagnosis of mental illness, resulting in social isolation, loss of employment, and loss of custody of children. Therefore, delusional infestation may be underdiagnosed. The duration of the symptoms varies from less than 1 year to decades, and many patients become anxious due to the chronicity of the condition, with some even developing suicidal behavior.

### Acute gout following dermofasciectomy in a patient with Dupuytren disease [^111XDmPF]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man underwent uncomplicated dermofasciectomy of the right little finger. In the week after surgery, he presented with erythema, tenderness, reduced range of movement, and a chalklike discharge from the suture line. Investigations revealed a raised serum urate level accompanied by a borderline rise in inflammatory markers. A diagnosis of acute gout was made, and the patient was managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of gout when patients present after surgery with redness, pain, and swelling. They should also consider measuring urate levels before surgery and initiating colchicine prophylaxis when there is a known diagnosis of gout prior to surgery. Accurate diagnosis may prevent unnecessary antibiotic use.

### Severe bacterial infections of the skin: Uncommon presentations [^116eCE3n]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although most bacterial infections of the skin are minor, a few dermatologic entities can be significant, even fatal. Their course can be extremely rapid, leading to dreadful complications. The mortality rate is usually between 30% and 50%, depending on the type of infection, underlying disease, and immune status. Patients affected often require hospitalization, sometimes in intensive care or burn units, and should be treated with appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy and aggressive supportive care.

The two life-threatening skin infections most commonly experienced are toxin-mediated staphylococcal and streptococcal disorders, which may overlap. Several other related entities are also discussed.

### Melanonychia and subungual papule in a middle-aged man [^1159Z4tC]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old man with no personal or family history of skin cancer presented with a growing lesion on his left thumbnail for the past year. The area was painful and gradually became larger and darker, causing elevation of the nail plate. Upon examination, there was a 4 mm dark brown longitudinal band with a subungual papule and distal onycholysis (Fig 1, A and B). A nail clipping was submitted for histopathology (Fig 2).

- **Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis**:
	- A. Dermatophytoma
	- B. Pigmented onychomatricoma
	- C. Pigmented onychopapilloma
	- D. Subungual melanoma
	- E. Subungual verruca

- **Answers**:
	- A. Dermatophytoma – Correct. Dermatophytoma are densely packed fungal masses in the subungual space in patients with distal onychomycosis. They commonly present as opaque yellow, orange, or white patches or streaks in the nail plate. Histopathology of the nail clipping showed confluent growth of fungal organisms, and culture identified Candida parapsilosis (Fig 2). This is a rare but established cause of black or brown pigmentation of the nail or longitudinal melanonychia. The patient had substantial clinical improvement with fluconazole 200 mg once weekly after 4 weeks of use.
	- B. Onychomatricoma – Incorrect. Onychomatricoma is a benign proliferation of fibroepithelial cells originating from the nail matrix. It is rare and usually presents as a thickened nail plate with a honeycomb-like appearance of the distal nail plate. It is diagnosed via histologic examination of a nail clipping and will show filiform epithelial projections lined with matrix epithelium.

### Bet 1: Is routine irrigation of a cutaneous abscess necessary [^1145H49K]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

A short cut review was conducted to determine whether irrigation of the abscess cavity improves outcomes following incision and drainage of a cutaneous abscess. One paper provided the best evidence to address this clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of this paper are detailed in a table. It was concluded that in adult patients with cutaneous abscesses, routine irrigation during incision and drainage does not enhance clinical outcomes.

### Sporanox [^112beuJu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given SPORANOX® Capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without SPORANOX®. This was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of SPORANOX® Capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated a mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent of patients were considered an overall success, and 47% of patients demonstrated a mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.

### Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist: Diagnosis and treatment options [^112N4H8u]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Low credibility.

Necrotizing infections of the hand and wrist are important clinical entities because of their rapidly progressive and potentially lethal nature. These infections encompass a spectrum of diseases with overlapping signs and symptoms, which can be subtle and nonspecific. If the brief prodromal period of these infections goes unrecognized, a local area of devitalized tissue can evolve into fulminant infection, multiorgan failure, and potentially death. Early recognition and treatment, including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical débridement, are paramount to improving patient outcomes.

### Nail changes, lymphedema, and respiratory symptoms [^116QkQbv]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 2.5-year history of progressive, painful yellow discoloration and deformation of the fingernails and toenails, accompanied by lower extremity lymphedema. The nail changes developed at the proximal nailfold and progressed distally. He concurrently had a history of sinusitis and a chronic cough. Immunologic workup and nail fungal cultures were unrevealing. The patient was started on therapy, with complete resolution of nail signs and symptoms at 2 years.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?

- **A. Chronic paronychia**: Incorrect. Chronic paronychia is a condition most likely caused by contact reaction to irritants and most commonly affects adult women. It is unlikely to affect all digits, as is the case in this patient.
- **B. Nail lichen planus**: Incorrect. Nail lichen planus presents with a distinct set of clinical findings, which include nail thinning, longitudinal ridging and fissuring, and dorsal pterygium. None of these findings were present in this patient.
- **C. Nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis**: Incorrect. Onychomycosis typically begins distally and spreads proximally, as opposed to this case in which nail symptoms began at the proximal nailfold. Proximal onychomycosis is uncommon and typically affects those with severely compromised immune systems.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment is taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one country.

### Diseases mimicking onychomycosis [^114hfjyV]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychodystrophy has increased in dermatology consultations. This rise may be attributed to its aesthetic impact, associated pain or disability, heightened physician awareness for detecting the condition in the context of dermatologic or systemic diseases, or an overall greater incidence. One of the primary differential diagnoses to consider when observing an onychodystrophic nail is onychomycosis, which accounts for 50% of cases.

### Posttraumatic unilateral perniosis: A case report [^1158RmQz]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old nonsmoking woman was referred to our hospital for a second opinion regarding slightly tender swelling, erythrocyanotic discoloration, and occasionally spontaneous ulceration of her right hand (Fig 1). The symptoms were present for six years, periodically during autumn and winter, and were slowly progressive. One year before the onset of her symptoms, the patient was bitten by a dog in her right hand, resulting in extensive soft tissue injury for which she underwent surgical reconstruction. The patient did not have symptoms or signs of cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus. She had a medical history of metacarpal fractures in the right hand about 20 years ago and Lyme disease 10 years ago. Her family history was negative for autoimmune diseases, in particular, lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. Before referral, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was suspected, for which she was treated unsuccessfully with antibiotics, highly potent topical steroids, and prednisolone. Later, IgG and IgM Borrelia antibodies were found to be negative. Arterial Doppler examination by a vascular surgeon found no abnormalities. A diagnosis of unilateral perniosis was considered, and the patient was referred to our hospital for confirmation.

- **Clinical presentation**: A, Unilateral erythrocyanotic swelling with ulcerations of the right hand. B, For comparison, the left hand is unaffected.

To exclude underlying diseases, we performed a punch biopsy from the dorsal side of the fourth of her right hand and additional laboratory tests. Histopathology findings are incomplete in the current text.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: A clinical practice guideline [^114nXAy1]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

What role do antibiotics have in the treatment of uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision and drainage? A recent study suggested that, for small uncomplicated skin abscesses, antibiotics after incision and drainage improve the chance of short-term cure compared with placebo. Triggered by this trial, the Rapid Recommendation team produced a new systematic review. Relying on this review and using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel makes a weak recommendation in favor of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, co-trimoxazole) or clindamycin in addition to incision and drainage over incision and drainage alone.

For patients who have chosen to initiate antibiotics, the panel issues a strong recommendation for TMP-SMX or clindamycin rather than a cephalosporin and a weak recommendation for TMP-SMX rather than clindamycin. The infographic presents the recommendations together with other pertinent information, including an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of candidate antibiotics in the standard GRADE format.

- **Shared decision-making**: The panel emphasizes shared decision-making in the choice of whether to initiate antibiotics and in which antibiotic to use, because the desirable and undesirable consequences are closely balanced. Clinicians using MAGICapp will find decision aids to support the discussion with patients.

- **New evidence**: Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged since the publication of this article.

### Isolated single or pauci-nail lichen planus, three cases [^116iWtd9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old female presented with persistent nail dystrophy of the right first toenail present for 4 months (Fig 2, A). Per patient history, the lesion began as a pink subungual papule without pain or discharge. Moderate longitudinal ridging and light tan hyperpigmentation were observed, extending up to 3 mm from the proximal nail fold. The remaining 1 cm of the distal nail plate was markedly thinned. The proximal nail fold appeared uninvolved.

- **Examination findings**: The lesion was initially monitored over the course of the next 10 months and eventually biopsied as nail dystrophy worsened. The pink subungual papule was reported to have grown. The lesion eventually involved almost the entire width of the nail with proximal nail plate thinning over the papule. Initial differential diagnosis included trauma, subungual fibroma, and squamous cell carcinoma. After partial nail plate avulsion and reflection of the proximal nail fold, a tangential shave biopsy of the nail matrix was performed. The biopsy demonstrated subepithelial patchy lymphocytic infiltrate supporting a diagnosis of nail lichen planus given clinical findings (Fig 2, C).

- **Figure 2 description**:
	- A: Presentation of right first (R1) toenail nail dystrophy in case 2, examined 6 months prior to matrix biopsy.
	- **B**: Presentation 2 years after matrix biopsy.
	- **C**: Histopathology of the nail matrix obtained by biopsy showing the presence of a band of lymphocytes near the dermal-epidermal junction (40×, H&E).

Healing after the nail biopsy was complicated by increased pain, erythema, and edema.

### Chronic hand infections [^112UUVKH]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic infections of the hand are uncommon, and a high index of suspicion is required for their early diagnosis. These infections can be grouped based on the microorganism.

- **Mycobacterial infections**: Include tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, and leprosy.
- **Other bacterial infections**: Encompass actinomycosis, cat-scratch disease, syphilis, tularemia, bacillary angiomatosis, and actinomycetoma.
- **Fungal infections**: May be classified as cutaneous (affecting the skin, the paronychia, or nail plate), subcutaneous (mainly lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis and dermatiaceous infections), and deep fungal infections. Each type of deep fungal infection has a "classic" presentation, and this is emphasized.
- **Chronic viral infections**: Common chronic viral infections of the hand include warts and orf.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^1111cyNt]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common nail plate infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophytic molds, and yeasts. The prevalence of this condition is lower in children compared to adults and is even rarer in newborns. Nevertheless, this diagnosis cannot be excluded in children, as neonates may present with nail plate disorders. Candida onychomycosis, most frequently caused by Candida albicans rather than any other Candida species, often clinically presents as paronychia, onycholysis, and onychorrhexis. In children, onycholysis as a pathological entity is more commonly caused by dermatophytes and usually presents with a single toenail infection with features of disto-lateral subungual onychomycosis. Distal lateral subungual onychomycosis due to Candida is extremely uncommon in neonates. Here, we describe a case of dorsal lateral onychomycosis of a fingernail due to C. albicans in a newborn baby. This is the first ever report of neonatal onychomycosis in Nepal, and the case is presented for its extreme rarity.

### Flexor tenosynovitis of the hand caused by [^111Y1Dze]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2018). High credibility.

In recent years, questions about the optimal surgical and medical management of mycobacterial tenosynovitis have been raised. The definitive diagnosis and extent of the infection are often assessed intraoperatively, making the condition de facto a surgical issue; however, the success of antibiotics alone has been documented in the literature. A series of 13 patients with tuberculosis of the hand found that all patients returned to full activity by an average of 4.8 months without surgical intervention. Antibiotic treatment in these patients, with or without surgery, typically includes quadruple antimicrobial drug therapy with isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 3 to 4 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin only for an additional period.

A recent review of the management of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis found similarly varied practices in treatment, ranging from surgery without antibiotics to antibiotics without surgery. This suggests that it may be time for the establishment of rigorous, evidence-based protocols for the management of mycobacterial tenosynovitis; however, this is extremely difficult because of the relative rarity of this condition. Our case highlights the importance of maintaining M. tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis of a subacute presentation of flexor tenosynovitis or carpal tunnel syndrome of the hand, even in nonendemic areas and in the absence of past tuberculosis infection or exposure.

### Atypical infections versus inflammatory conditions of the hand: The role of imaging in diagnosis [^111K5b42]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical infections may manifest when clinical suspicion is low, and due to their similarity to other inflammatory conditions regarding clinical and imaging findings, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is not infrequent. This can lead to an elevated risk of severe bone and joint destruction, as well as higher morbidity. This review addresses the challenging subject of discussing the imaging characteristics of atypical infections and a variety of inflammatory conditions of the hand. It emphasizes the key points that assist in differentiating between infections and inflammatory causes.

### Case report: Palmar herpetic whitlow and forearm lymphangitis in a 10-year-old female [^114x78s3]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

After transfer to our institution, the patient was initially evaluated by Orthopedic Surgery, who described an erythematous, edematous, tender left palmar abscess with associated erythematous streaking up her forearm. There was no numbness, tingling, fever, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She was afebrile, hemodynamically stable with normal mental status. Her left upper extremity had full range of motion and appropriate strength, with no lymphadenopathy, and radial pulses intact. Based upon these findings, no additional laboratory tests were performed.

X-rays of the left forearm and hand showed soft tissue edema with no acute osseous abnormalities. The lesion was surgically managed with an incision and drainage, during which "minimal drainage" was noted. Wound cultures were also obtained. After admission to the General Pediatrics hospitalist service, the lesion was noted to appear vesicular from photos taken prior to surgical management. Thus, HSV infection was suspected, and PCR samples were obtained from an unroofed left palmar vesicle. These samples confirmed the presence of HSV type 1, resulting in her diagnosis of herpetic whitlow. The initial wound cultures had no growth after 5 days, further confirming that the palmar lesion was not due to a bacterial infection. However, the associated erythematous streaking up her forearm was identified as lymphangitis, indicating a possible bacterial infection secondary to HSV.
