## Question

What type of food is recommended for patients with gastric reflux?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dietary recommendations for patients with gastric reflux. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strength of evidence and guideline consensus for lifestyle and dietary measures. Then, I should verify which meal-pattern strategies have the strongest support. Next, I will examine macronutrient guidance, especially fat and carbohydrates, and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to check individualized trigger identification and beverage guidance. Finally, I will integrate weight management, special populations, and a practical implementation plan, while double-checking where the evidence is weak and where it is strong.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: dietary advice is foundational but must be individualized because triggers vary and the certainty of evidence for many food-specific restrictions is low, even though major societies still recommend lifestyle measures given their low risk and potential benefit [^1114M9DL] [^1139Ckjd] [^115uy9sv].

> I will now examine meal timing and patterning, since these consistently carry the strongest consensus. Avoiding meals within 2–3 hours of bedtime is recommended by ACG and ASGE, and a Delphi consensus reached 100% agreement to advise patients not to overeat, reflecting pathophysiology of gastric distension, transient LES relaxations, and the postprandial acid pocket; I should confirm that this is framed as high-strength advice despite low-to-moderate direct evidence, which it is [^1114M9DL] [^116Ns2Aq] [^114Q3Fcf] [^114sPY4V].

> Wait, let me verify the role of fat in GERD before jumping to a low-fat prescription. Historically, clinicians advised reducing fat to mitigate delayed gastric emptying and presumed LES effects, but contemporary controlled studies show no consistent difference in LES pressure or acid exposure between isocaloric high- and low-fat meals, and a randomized trial found no basis for recommending a low-fat diet. However, observational data still associate high saturated fat and processed-food patterns with more reflux symptoms, so I should reconcile this as "avoid excess fat if it worsens symptoms", not a blanket low-fat mandate [^113nxyML] [^113dbnpr] [^111JNx6y].

> Next, I should review carbohydrates, because newer randomized data suggest a different lever. A 9-week RCT showed that reducing simple sugars and modifying carbohydrate type significantly reduced esophageal acid exposure time and symptom burden, with the most pronounced AET reduction in the high-total/low-simple-sugar arm. Mechanistically, simple sugars may increase gastric fermentation, gas, and transient LES relaxations, so advising patients to cut added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages is reasonable and evidence-aligned [^113nxyML] [^112EpPPP] [^114as97y].

> Hold on, I should verify individualized trigger identification rather than impose a universal elimination list. ACG suggests avoiding "trigger foods", and a Delphi consensus strongly supports identifying and avoiding personal dietary triggers such as citrus, tomatoes, highly spiced foods, fried foods, chocolate, onions, and carbonated beverages; importantly, some studies show symptom improvement when patients systematically eliminate perceived triggers, reinforcing a personalized, trial-and-error approach rather than broad restriction for all [^1114M9DL] [^115bUKyZ] [^114NHFpY].

> Let me consider beverages next, and I need to ensure I separate strong from weak signals. Limiting carbonated beverages has 100% Delphi consensus due to distension and reflux promotion, and substitution with water is associated with lower reflux risk. Alcohol and coffee are commonly cited triggers, and while data are mixed, expert consensus supports advising moderation or avoidance if symptoms occur, with tea showing no consistent association overall, though regional variability exists, so I should tailor advice to patient experience and timing of intake [^114Q3Fcf] [^111JNx6y] [^113ND44T].

> I should double-check the weight-loss recommendation because it often yields the largest net benefit. Multiple guidelines and systematic reviews show that weight loss improves GERD symptoms and reduces acid exposure, with a dose–response relationship. Even a modest BMI reduction of about 3.5 kg/m² can reduce reflux risk substantially, so pairing dietary changes with caloric restriction and physical activity is a high-yield, evidence-based strategy [^116SkUtB] [^1131C2ZY] [^113ZZxzt].

> But wait, what about special populations? I need to ensure pediatric advice is distinct. For infants, thicken feeds for visible regurgitation, avoid overfeeding, and consider a 2–4 week trial of extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid–based formula if nonpharmacologic measures fail. For older children, emphasize conservative measures, weight control if overweight, and meal timing, aligning with NASPGHAN/ESPGHAN and AAFP guidance [^113TwhF2] [^115uyfwK] [^116RTATc] [^113fbVtY].

> Next, I should review how to implement this at the bedside. Shared decision-making with education on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, and the brain–gut axis improves adherence. A practical approach is to keep a 2–3 week food-and-symptom diary, trial elimination of suspected triggers, adopt smaller, earlier evening meals, reduce added sugars and carbonated drinks, pursue weight loss if overweight, and layer in behavioral sleep and stress strategies, with rescue options like alginate for breakthrough symptoms [^116svTKG] [^112Lwzxx] [^111bZVP5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that avoiding all "acidic" foods is mandatory; I should correct that. Evidence gaps exist for universal avoidance of citrus or spicy foods, and guidelines emphasize tailoring to patient-reported triggers rather than imposing broad bans, so I need to ensure my counseling remains individualized and revisited over time as symptoms and context change [^1143FLXt] [^1114M9DL].

> In summary, I need to ensure the hierarchy is clear: prioritize meal timing and avoiding late meals, avoid overeating, personalize trigger elimination, reduce added sugars and carbonated beverages, consider moderating alcohol and coffee if symptomatic, and pursue weight loss when appropriate, recognizing that while the certainty of evidence varies, these strategies are low risk, guideline-endorsed, and often effective when implemented collaboratively with patients [^1114M9DL] [^1139Ckjd] [^111JNx6y].

For patients with gastric reflux, **eat smaller, frequent meals** [^111c8Wch] and **avoid late meals within 2–3 hours of bedtime** [^116Ns2Aq] to reduce reflux. Limit **fatty foods** [^111c8Wch], **citrus**, **tomatoes**, **chocolate**, **coffee**, **alcohol**, **carbonated drinks** [^114Q3Fcf], and **spicy foods** if they trigger symptoms [^1114M9DL]. Emphasize **lean proteins**, **complex carbohydrates**, **non-citrus fruits**, and **vegetables**. If overweight, **weight loss** [^116SkUtB] significantly improves symptoms. Use a **personalized approach** [^116svTKG] by identifying and avoiding individual triggers, and consider a **low-carb diet** [^112jFE4A] if symptoms persist.

---

## General dietary principles

Several **general dietary principles** can help manage GERD symptoms:

- **Smaller, frequent meals**: Eating smaller, more frequent meals (4–5 per day) can reduce gastric pressure and reflux episodes [^111c8Wch].

- **Avoid late meals**: Avoid eating within 2–3 hours of bedtime to minimize nocturnal reflux [^1114M9DL] [^116Ns2Aq].

- **Weight management**: Weight loss is strongly recommended for overweight or obese patients, as it significantly reduces GERD symptoms [^116SkUtB] [^113ZZxzt].

---

## Foods to avoid or limit

Certain foods are commonly associated with **increased reflux symptoms** and should be limited or avoided based on individual tolerance:

| **Food category** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| High-fat foods | - Fried foods <br/> - Fatty meats <br/> - Full-fat dairy | - Delay gastric emptying <br/> - Relax LES <br/> - Increase reflux [^114Q3Fcf] [^113dbnpr] |
| Acidic foods | - Citrus fruits <br/> - Tomatoes <br/> - Vinegar | - Lower esophageal pH <br/> - Irritate esophagus [^115YGY6a] |
| Caffeinated beverages | - Coffee <br/> - Tea <br/> - Energy drinks | - Relax LES <br/> - Increase acid secretion [^notfound] |
| Alcohol | - Beer <br/> - Wine <br/> - Spirits | - Relax LES <br/> - Increase acid secretion [^notfound] |
| Carbonated beverages | - Soda <br/> - Sparkling water | - Increase gastric pressure <br/> - Promote reflux [^114Q3Fcf] |
| Chocolate | - Chocolate bars <br/> - Cocoa products | - Relax LES <br/> - Increase reflux [^115bUKyZ] |
| Spicy foods | - Chili peppers <br/> - Hot sauces | - Irritate esophagus <br/> - Trigger symptoms [^114NHFpY] |

---

Individualized **trigger identification** is essential, as not all patients respond similarly to these foods [^111JNx6y].

---

## Foods to include

Certain foods may help **reduce reflux symptoms**:

- **Lean proteins**: Chicken, turkey, fish, and plant-based proteins (tofu, legumes) are less likely to trigger reflux.

- **Complex carbohydrates**: Oatmeal, brown rice, quinoa, and whole-grain bread can help absorb stomach acid and reduce symptoms.

- **Non-citrus fruits**: Bananas, melons, apples, and pears are generally well tolerated.

- **Vegetables**: Broccoli, green beans, leafy greens, and root vegetables are low in fat and acid.

- **Low-fat dairy**: Skim milk, yogurt, and low-fat cheese can be included in moderation.

---

## Special dietary considerations

### Low-carbohydrate diets

Recent evidence suggests that **reducing carbohydrate intake**, particularly simple sugars, may significantly reduce esophageal acid exposure and improve GERD symptoms [^112jFE4A] [^112EpPPP]. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate diet (20 g/day) reduced acid exposure time and improved symptoms in patients with GERD and obesity [^notfound].

---

### Mediterranean diet

The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (olive oil), has been associated with a **lower risk of GERD symptoms** [^114Q3Fcf]. This dietary pattern emphasizes anti-inflammatory foods and may benefit patients with GERD.

---

## Lifestyle modifications

In addition to dietary changes, the following **lifestyle modifications** are recommended:

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: Elevate the head of the bed by 6–8 inches to reduce nocturnal reflux [^116SkUtB] [^1111Kr6A].

- **Avoid tight clothing**: Tight clothing can increase abdominal pressure and reflux [^notfound].

- **Smoking cessation**: Smoking weakens the LES and increases reflux symptoms [^116SkUtB] [^1111Kr6A].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized dietary counseling** and lifestyle modifications as first-line management for GERD [^111c8Wch] [^111JNx6y]. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommend weight loss, avoiding late meals, and identifying individual trigger foods [^116SkUtB] [^112Lwzxx].

---

## Conclusion

Dietary management of gastric reflux involves **personalized dietary counseling**, identifying and avoiding trigger foods, and adopting lifestyle modifications. Weight loss, smaller frequent meals, and avoiding late meals are key strategies. Emerging evidence supports the role of low-carbohydrate diets and the Mediterranean diet in reducing GERD symptoms.

Weight loss

For assessing the impact of weight loss on objective GERD improvement, our search identified an existing systematic review from Ness-Jensen et alwith data from the 15 studies it examined. According to the AMSTAR-2 scale, quality of the existing systematic review was moderate. There were 3 RCTs, in severely obese individuals (n = 57) that compared weight loss by gastric balloon distension with sham treatment combined with dietary guidance, physical exercise, and behavioral therapy. These showed reduced esophageal acid exposure with weight loss ranging between 11 and 44 kg over variable follow-up time from the intervention (13 weeks to 4 months).

For assessing the improvement in GERD symptoms and related symptom scores, 1 RCT of 332 obese patients randomized to a structured weight loss program (n = 167) or a telephone-based group conference on weight management (n = 165) demonstrated improvement of reflux disease questionnaire scores from a mean 5.5 to 1.8 (P < .01), with 81% of subjects showing reduction of GERD symptom scores after 6 months of weight loss (BMI decease from 34.7 to 30.2). The prevalence of reflux symptoms also decreased (37% to 15%, P < .01). In a large observational cohort study of 10,545 women, it was noted that there was a dose-dependent decreased risk of reflux symptoms among women who had decrease in BMI by > 3.5 units compared with women with no BMI change (OR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P for trend < .001). Another large prospective population-based cohort study of 29,610 patients also showed a dose-dependent relationship of weight loss and reduction of GERD. Patients with BMI decrease of > 3.5 units had an adjusted OR of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.45–2.72) for loss of any reflux symptoms when on no or less than weekly antireflux medication and an OR of 3.95 (95% CI, 2.03–7.65) when on at least weekly antireflux medications.

Discussion

GORD and dyspepsia management guidelines, such as the recently updated American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, generally include lifestyle recommendations as a first approach for symptomatic patients, but they are not always implemented in practice. This Delphi-style process builds on the published recommendations by providing greater analysis of the published evidence combined with clinical experience, with the goal of developing education for providers and patients. Consensus was achieved for 21 statements according to the prespecified criteria (67% voting either 'strongly agree' or 'agree with minor reservation'). Eleven statements achieved the strongest (100%) agreement; five are related to diet and include identification and avoidance of dietary triggers, limiting alcohol, coffee and carbonated beverages, and advising patients troubled by postprandial symptoms not to overeat. The remaining six statements with 100% consensus concern advice around smoking cessation, weight loss, raising the head-of-the-bed, avoiding recumbency after meals, stress reduction and alginate use.

The wording of the consensus statements regarding food and beverage advice reflects the fact that dietary risk factors are highly individualised, which is often not emphasised in guidelines and patient brochures. Even for a given individual, the ability of dietary factors to trigger symptoms may depend on other factors, such as sleep disturbance or stress, which have the potential to increase symptom perception. A statement on tea drinking was not included based on the findings of a meta-analysis suggesting no overall relationship with GORD. However, the amount and type of tea drunk worldwide is highly variable and stratification by geographical region suggests that it may be a more important risk factor in Eastern Asia.

Advising patients not to overeat was given 100% consensus, even though the evidence is sparse and no interventional study to assess smaller meal sizes was identified. Rather, the confidence in this statement is based on clinical experience and the known pathophysiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux, whereby the gastric distention associated with a large meal stimulates acid secretion, triggers transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, and makes reflux from the proximal postprandial acid pocket more likely. The efficacy of alginate-antacid combinations for reflux-like symptoms also gained 100% consensus. Alginate formulations are especially suited as a treatment for postprandial symptoms owing to their mode of action which physically displaces the acid pocket further from the oesophagus while the meal empties from the stomach.

### Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux clinical practice guidelines: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^114JPxBD]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

This document serves as an update of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) 2009 clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in infants and children and is intended to be applied in daily practice and as a basis for clinical trials. Eight clinical questions addressing diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic topics were formulated. A systematic literature search was performed from October 1, 2008 (if the question was addressed by 2009 guidelines) or from inception to June 1, 2015 using Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials. The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was applied to define and prioritize outcomes. For therapeutic questions, the quality of evidence was also assessed using GRADE. Grading the quality of evidence for other questions was performed according to the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS) and Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tools. During a 3-day consensus meeting, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. In cases where no randomized controlled trials (RCT; therapeutic questions) or diagnostic accuracy studies were available to support the recommendations, expert opinion was used. The group members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. With this approach, recommendations regarding evaluation and management of infants and children with GERD to standardize and improve quality of care were formulated. Additionally, 2 algorithms were developed, 1 for infants < 12 months of age and the other for older infants and children.

Methodology

Overview

This document was prepared by the SOP Committee of the ASGE and is a continuation of our society's effort to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach as previously described. In summary, GRADE is a standardized and transparent process for assessing and presenting summaries of evidence with the goal of informing evidence-based clinical practice recommendations. The recommendations in this guideline document were based on up-to-date meta-analyses of the available literature for each clinical question. The quality or certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were based on the GRADE approach and followed the evidence-to-decision framework.

Evidence profiles were created with the help of GRADE methodologists (M.D. B.Q.), and a guideline development panel was held on March 10, 2023, in which the evidence was reviewed and recommendations were generated. In developing our recommendations, we took into consideration the certainty of the evidence, beneﬁts and risk of harm of different management options, patient values and preferences, resource use including direct costs, cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

The ﬁnal wording of the recommendations including direction and strength were approved by all members of the panel and the ASGE Governing Board. Strong recommendations are typically stated as "we recommend… " whereas conditional or more closely balanced recommendations are indicated by the phrase "we suggest… " The meanings and interpretations of various qualities of evidence and the implications of corresponding recommendations are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of recommendations

Formulation of clinical questions

Six clinical questions were conceptualized by the authors of the documents and members of the ASGE SOP committee. These were then approved by the ASGE Governing Board. The questions followed the PICO format: P, population in question; I, intervention; C, comparator; and O, outcomes of interest. For all clinical questions, potentially relevant patient-important outcomes were identiﬁed a priori and rated from "critical" to "important" through a consensus process. A detailed list of the PICO questions and outcomes is provided in Table 2.

### Gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children: diagnosis and treatment [^112ZoWNH]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, dietary modifications, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering a 2–4 week trial of extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula in formula-fed infants with suspected GERD if other nonpharmacologic treatments have failed. Consider offering a trial of eliminating dairy from the maternal diet to achieve similar results in breastfed infants.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116bdjhC]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD — lifestyle modification scope includes elevation of the head of the bed for selected patients who are troubled with heartburn or regurgitation when recumbent, and other lifestyle modifications that should be tailored to the circumstances of the individual patient; however, Grade Insuff: no recommendation, insufficient evidence to recommend for or against broadly advocating lifestyle changes for all (as opposed to selected) patients with GERD. Broadly speaking, lifestyle modifications recommended for GERD fall into 3 categories, including adoption of behaviors that may reduce esophageal acid exposure such as weight loss, smoking cessation, raising the head of the bed, and avoiding recumbency for 2–3 hours after meals.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^111jdZFt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with reflux-like symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) are often not well advised on implementing individualised strategies to help control their symptoms using dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, behavioural changes or fast-acting rescue therapies. One reason for this may be the lack of emphasis in management guidelines owing to 'low-quality' evidence and a paucity of interventional studies. Thus, a panel of 11 gastroenterologists and primary care doctors used the Delphi method to develop consolidated advice for patients based on expert consensus. A steering committee selected topics for literature searches using the PubMed database, and a modified Delphi process including two online meetings and two rounds of voting was conducted to generate consensus statements based on prespecified criteria (67% voting 'strongly agree' or 'agree with minor reservation'). After expert discussion and two rounds of voting, 21 consensus statements were generated, and assigned strength of evidence and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) rating. Eleven statements achieved the strongest (100%) agreement: five are related to diet and include identification and avoidance of dietary triggers, limiting alcohol, coffee and carbonated beverages, and advising patients troubled by postprandial symptoms not to overeat; the remaining six statements concern advice around smoking cessation, weight loss, raising the head-of-the-bed, avoiding recumbency after meals, stress reduction and alginate use. The aim of developing the consensus statements is that they may serve as a foundation for tools and advice that can routinely help patients with reflux-like symptoms better understand the causes of their symptoms and manage their individual risk factors and triggers.

Certainty of the evidence

Overall quality of evidence was very low when considering all of the outcomes together. This was due to either one or combinations of the following: risk of bias, imprecision (low sample size, varying CIs), indirectness, and inability to pool the data because of varying outcome definitions.

Discussion

Overall, the certainty in evidence was very low. The panel acknowledged that while there is lack of robust data, there is benefit of weight loss and smoking cessation from overall health improvement and cancer reduction. Data regarding other dietary interventions may be weak but these are low-risk interventions that can be incorporated as GERD-related lifestyle measures. Given the low cost to these interventions as well as the potential for other health benefits of these lifestyle interventions, the panel agreed that these lifestyle modifications should be recommended to decrease GERD symptoms based on the evidence available.

Question 4: In patients with GERD, does proton pump inhibitor compared with placebo reduce symptoms?

Recommendation 4:
- In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)
- In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and selection accordingly. (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)

Best practice advice:

- Patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management.
- Providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use for patients with GERD.
- Providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is a need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

Consensus procedure

The literature searches identified 406 articles. After the removal of 50 duplicates and the exclusion of nonrelevant studies, a total of 135 references were reviewed and used by the steering committee to develop 27 pilot statements around risk factors and interventions for reflux-like symptoms (Supplemental digital content 1). The pilot statements and supporting articles were shared with the expert panel together with the level of supporting evidence for each study which had been assigned by the steering committee using the scale (1–6), as described previously (Table 1). In the first consensus meeting, statements and evidence were reviewed and, based on panel discussion and agreement, three statements were added and four were eliminated (Supplemental digital content 1). The revised pilot statements were then used as a basis for the steering committee to develop a set of 21 directive statements, which were shared (with supporting evidence) for anonymous voting using the Qualtrics online platform. For each statement, the experts, including the steering committee, indicated their level of agreement on a scale from 1 to 6 (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree with major reservation; 3 = disagree with minor reservation; 4 = agree with major reservation; 5 = agree with minor reservation; and 6 = strongly agree). Results were analysed by the meeting facilitator. The consensus threshold was set a priori as agreement (level 5 or 6) by at least 67% of respondents.

Table 1.
Strength of evidence

During the second meeting, round one voting results were reviewed. Statements that did not reach consensus were discussed and revised and an additional statement was added ahead of a second round of voting. After the second round of voting, each of the consensus statements was assigned strength of evidence (A–D) by the steering committee and were rated using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (high, moderate, low, very low, see Table 1).

### Dietary guideline adherence for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115YGY6a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study, to our knowledge, is the first population or community-based study to assess whether patients with GERD adhere to dietary guidelines that are often recommended as a part of non-pharmacological, lifestyle modification to reduce their symptoms. Patients with severe or frequent GERD symptoms were less likely to consume citrus and beer and more likely to consume tea, soft drinks, total fat, and possibly liquor. There was no association between portion size, tomato products, coffee and GERD severity or frequency.

Our study extends the existing knowledge regarding the relationship between GERD symptoms and dietary intake. First, our data demonstrate that patients with more severe or frequent reflux symptoms are less likely to consume citrus. Citrus and other acidic foods such as tomatoes are often considered reflux-triggering. A previous clinical study reported that acid-sensitive patients were sensitive to intraesophageal infusion of orange or tomato juice, even when the pH of juice was adjusted to neutral, suggesting that some other component in citrus or tomato beside acidity may affect the symptoms. We cannot assess from our data whether the patients in our study avoided citrus (but not tomato products) because they actually worsened their symptoms or because of perceived stronger recommendations to avoid citrus than tomato products.

### Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and children: recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition [^116uFFji]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), defined as passage of gastric contents into the esophagus, and GER disease (GERD), defined as symptoms or complications of GER, are common pediatric problems encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers. Clinical manifestations of GERD in children include vomiting, poor weight gain, dysphagia, abdominal or substernal pain, esophagitis and respiratory disorders. The GER Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric GER. The GER Guideline Committee, consisting of a primary care pediatrician, two clinical epidemiologists (who also practice primary care pediatrics) and five pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on an integration of a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee examined the value of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities commonly used for the management of GERD, and how those interventions can be applied to clinical situations in the infant and older child. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, including evaluation, initial treatment, follow-up management and indications for consultation by a specialist.

### Dietary habits and obesity indices in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease: a comparative cross-sectional study [^114Eptyf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common disorders of the upper digestive tract worldwide. The prevalence of GERD is estimated within the range of 18.1% to 27.8% in North America, 8.8% to 25.9% in Europe, and 8.7% to 33.1% in the Middle East. In Iran, prevalence of GERD is estimated within the range of 1.9 to 52%. GERD is characterized primarily based on typical symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation. In addition to the esophageal manifestations of GERD, its effect on quality of life as well as extra-esophageal presentations such as dry cough, chest pain, sleep difficulties, and teeth decays, have been increasingly recognized among gastroenterologists. Up to now, a combination of lifestyle modifications and anti-reflux medications are recommended for the management of GERD symptoms.

There is evidence that several socio-demographic and lifestyle factors are predictors of GERD development. The roles of some risk factors such as obesity are well known in epidemiological studies. However, evidence on other variables particularly dietary habits are still inconclusive. Current guidelines recommend that reflux-triggering foods such as coffee, chocolate, spicy foods, and citrus fruit should not be routinely eliminated in management of GERD. However, some studies revealed that specific dietary choices were related to higher risk of GERD development or the severity of the disease. In recent years, increased awareness of the side effects of medication on the general population shifted attention gradually, from pharmacological therapies to dietary modifications as the first-line management for GERD. Besides, it is proposed that eating habits may contribute to GERD risk through their effect on body weight. Unfavorable eating patterns, which are mainly characterized by frequent consumption of carbonated drinks, fast foods, and large portion-size meals are positively associated with development of obesity which in turn, may contribute to increased GERD risk.

### Objective ambulatory pH monitoring and subjective symptom assessment of gastroesophageal reflux disease show type of carbohydrate and type of fat matter [^115cWtvi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Historically, recommendations to avoid certain food items derive from anecdote or data from hospitalized patients with the most severe forms of GERD (erosive esophagitis and adenocarcinoma). – Thus, there remains little definitive evidence to support recommendations to avoid specific foods as a component of primary prevention or standard of care empiric treatment of GERD. More recent investigation of dietary factors has targeted macronutrient composition of the diet rather than specific food items. While results for the relationship between dietary fat intake and GERD symptoms have been inconsistent, – prospective trials show that lower carbohydrate intake is associated with decreased GERD symptoms and/or esophageal reflux, – whereas higher carbohydrate intake is associated with more GERD symptoms and number of reflux episodes. Although, a 2017 meta-analysis showed consuming more indigestible carbohydrate (dietary fiber) may reduce the risk of Barrett's esophagus in persons with GERD, investigation of dietary fiber as the mechanism driving the effect of dietary carbohydrates on GERD has yielded inconclusive results. Nevertheless, interpretation of the published data suggests that modifying either carbohydrate amount or type may be beneficial for treatment of GERD.

The purpose of this study is to determine relationships between dietary macronutrient intake, GI hormones, and GERD status in US veterans empirically treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recognizing that the pathophysiology of GERD is multifactorial, we hypothesized that both objective GERD status (determined by total acid exposure time (AET) and number of reflux episodes) and subjective symptoms would correlate most robustly with consumption of specific types of dietary carbohydrate and fat. We further hypothesized that relationships between dietary intakes and GERD status would be mediated by GI hormones that may affect GTT or LES pressure.

Question 3: In patients with GERD, should lifestyle interventions be recommended to reduce GERD symptoms?

Recommendation 3:

In patients with GERD symptoms, the ASGE recommends lifestyle modifications. These include
- weight loss for patients who are overweight or obese,
- smoking cessation,
- elevation of head of bed, and
- avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime. (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)

Evidence

We performed a systematic review of the published literature on this topic. We used Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane for studies published through December 2022. We used major search terms and subheadings including "Gastroesophageal reflux disease", "lifestyle changes", "weight loss", "diet", "smoking", "alcohol", "head of bed elevation", "late evening meal", "diet", "coffee", "beverages", and "modification". We examined the literature to evaluate the role of different lifestyle modifications (eg, weight loss, smoking cessation, head of bed elevation, and late evening meals) on reduction of GERD symptoms and decreasing GERD-related symptom scores or acid exposure time as an outcome. We also examined cost-effectiveness, equity, and patient values and preferences. A summary of outcomes and their assessment are found in Table 6.

### The effects of modifying amount and type of dietary carbohydrate on esophageal acid exposure time and esophageal reflux symptoms: a randomized controlled trial [^112jFE4A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION:

This is the first randomized controlled diet intervention trial to investigate both the amount and type of carbohydrate on symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

METHODS:

Ninety-eight veterans with symptomatic GERD were randomly assigned to high total/high simple, high total/low simple, low total/high simple, or low total/low simple carbohydrate diet for 9 weeks. The primary outcomes were esophageal acid exposure time (AET) and total number of reflux episodes derived from 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. Secondary outcomes were esophageal reflux symptoms rated using the Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GERDQ) and GERD Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS).

RESULTS:

Half of the subjects were White and half African American (mean age, 60.0 ± 12.5 years; mean body mass index, 32.7 ± 5.4 kg/m²). There was a significant main effect of diet treatment on AET (P = 0.001) and on the total number of reflux episodes (P = 0.003). The change in AET in the high total/low simple group (−4.3% ± 3.8%) differed significantly from the high total/high simple control group (+3.1% ± 3.7%), (P = 0.04). The reduction in simple sugar intake averaged 62 g less per day. Subjects' ratings of symptoms improved in all carbohydrate modification groups, including significant reductions in heartburn frequency, heartburn severity, acid taste in the mouth, lump/pain in the throat or chest, and sleep disturbance.

DISCUSSION:

A modification of dietary carbohydrate intake that targeted a substantial reduction in the intakes of simple sugars improved pH monitoring outcomes and symptoms of GERD that profoundly affect daily life. These findings provide a feasible and clinically applicable contribution to the limited objective data existing for efficacious dietary recommendations in the routine treatment and management of GERD.

### Are lifestyle measures effective in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease? [^113dbnpr]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Accordingly, the American College of Gastroenterology recommends the use of lifestyle changes, including elevation of the head of the bed; decreased fat, chocolate, alcohol, peppermint, and coffee intake; cessation of smoking; and avoiding recumbency for 3 hours postprandially, in addition to antireflux medical treatment. 1 However, the evidence to support such lifestyle modification recommendations has not been well substantiated. The purpose of this study is to apply an evidence-based approach to the literature to determine which lifestyle measures are most likely to benefit patients with GERD. One study65 found that in patients with GERD vs controls, onion intake increased the number of reflux episodes and the esophageal acid exposure time. The results of this study have not been confirmed by other larger trials.

Many patients who believe that spicy foods exacerbate their GERD symptoms may abstain from these foods although we found no published trials that studied the effect of abstinence on change in GERD symptoms. It has been postulated that fat increases not only reflux but also the sensitivity of the esophagus to acid exposure. In a randomized clinical trial, 70 8 patients with GERD and 11 controls received either an intragastric infusion of isotonic sodium chloride or a 20% lipid solution followed by an intraesophageal infusion of hydrochloric acid. Nebel and Castell73 evaluated the LES response to ingestion of fat and protein meals with equivalent caloric value in healthy individuals and found that fatty meals decreased LES pressure significantly compared with protein meals, which increased LESP. Becker et al74 studied esophageal acid exposure after high- and low-fat meals and found that the fat content was not significantly associated with esophageal pH abnormalities.

In a study75 of 20 healthy individuals in the supine position, those who consumed high-fat meals had significantly increased acid exposure compared with the low-fat group, but this study also found that acid exposure increased in patients who ingested a greater volume. Other randomized trials have found no difference comparing high- and low-fat meals with respect to LESP, transient LES relaxations, 76 number of reflux episodes, or esophageal exposure to acid. 77 There is conflicting evidence regarding whether caloric content of foods is more important than fat content. 76, 78. The HOB elevation, therefore, seems to be an effective measure to improve the symptoms and physiologic variables in some patients with GERD.

### Dietary guideline adherence for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114bwwrq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common illnesses in the United States. The prevalence of diagnosed GERD cases is estimated to be 13–19% worldwide and about 25% of the Western population suffers from heartburn or acid regurgitation at least once per month; 12% have symptoms at least weekly and 5% experience heartburn daily. Symptoms associated with GERD include heartburn, acid regurgitation, dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), and chest pain, as well as extraesophageal manifestations such as nausea, chronic cough, asthma, and hoarseness.

The financial burden of disease from GERD is high; much of this is for anti-acid medications. The cost of health care and lost productivity due to GERD is estimated at over $24 billion annually in the US alone, 60% of which is used for medication. The annual average medical costs and services for patients with GERD may be twice that of the non-GERD population due to additional outpatient visits, hospitalizations, emergency department utilization, and pharmacy costs. In addition, the quality of life in GERD patients is also compromised: the impact of GERD on quality of life measures is similar to that of other chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, or ischemic heart disease.

Newly recognized potential adverse effects of acid suppression have heightened the interest in nonpharmacologic approaches for GERD treatment in persons with nonerosive GERD. Although results conflict somewhat between studies, acid suppression has been recently associated with decreased absorption of dietary calcium and calcium supplements, an increased risk of hip fractures, food borne infections, and an increased risk of clostridium difficile infection. These findings led to a recent modification in the labeling of proton pump inhibitors to include concerns about an increased risk of hip fracture and a search for methods to decrease GERD patients' reliance on pharmacologic methods of acid suppression.

Dietary modification is a proposed first-line therapy for patients with GERD. The National Institutes of Health and the American College of Gastroenterology recommend that patients with GERD reduce their intakes of total fat, chocolate, alcohol, citrus and tomato products, coffee, tea, and large meals, and implement other lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and weight reduction. However, no previous population-based study has evaluated what proportions of GERD patients actually follow these dietary guidelines. Therefore, we evaluated, within a large community-based population, the associations between a GERD diagnosis, reflux symptoms and dietary intake. We hypothesized that patients with more severe or frequent symptoms were less likely to adhere to the dietary modification recommendations.

### Many pediatric patients with gastroparesis do not receive dietary education [^111vxZFv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Dietary modification is the first-line treatment for Gp and should be utilized by healthcare providers when working towards improving symptoms. However, a substantial minority of patients with Gp at our center (41%) did not receive any dietary education. Only 26% of patients had a consultation with a dietitian. We identified that clinical symptoms (e.g. weight loss, vomiting/nausea) and practice location (medical center vs suburban) were associated with whether dietary education was provided and the type of dietary recommendation given. Our findings suggest there appears to be a large need to increase the amount and type of dietary education provided to children with Gp if our findings reflect what is occurring nationally.

Clinical guidelines for managing Gp, focused on adults, start with dietary recommendations. In contrast, a large proportion of the children in our study were prescribed prokinetic medications before dietary education was provided. Use of dietary management has the potential benefit of providing patients and families with more autonomy by allowing them greater choice of food and food types to help address symptoms, while also avoiding potential significant side effects associated with medications. When and why dietary recommendations versus medications should be recommended based on symptoms requires further study.

The dietary recommendations, when they were provided, were in line with Gp treatment guidelines. Specifically, the guidelines recommend that meals be small, and patients eat more frequently (4–5 times a day) to reach their required caloric intake. The rationale behind smaller meals is that the stomach empties at a constant rate, estimated at 1–2 kcal/min, so larger size meals with more caloric content take longer to empty. Symptomatically, large meals also increase intragastric pressure, which can worsen the baseline symptoms patients are experiencing.

Foods that are blended, mashed, or ground as well as high calorie liquids are an encouraged alternative to solid meals. As an example, on a diet consisting of small particle-sized solids, reflux symptoms, fullness, nausea, vomiting and bloating (but not abdominal pain) improved in a randomized, controlled study in patients with diabetic Gp.

### Dietary guideline adherence for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111QrfNk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first large, community-based U.S. population to evaluate whether GERD patients adhere to the dietary guidelines commonly recommended for GERD patients. We found that while GERD patients, consistent with dietary recommendations, are less likely to consume citrus and certain types of alcohol, they were more likely to consume soft drinks, tea, and fatty foods than asymptomatic controls. The results suggest that GERD patients do avoid some, but not all, of the foods commonly thought to worsen GERD symptoms. Given the prevalence of GERD symptoms and the emergence of possible adverse effects of long-term gastric acid inhibition, more studies, particularly randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of dietary modification, are needed to better understand the role of nonpharmacologic approaches, such as dietary modification, in the treatment of GERD.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115p31Sp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to be among the most common diseases seen by gastroenterologists, surgeons, and primary care physicians. Our understanding of the varied presentations of GERD, enhancements in diagnostic testing, and approach to patient management have evolved. During this time, scrutiny of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has increased considerably. Although PPIs remain the medical treatment of choice for GERD, multiple publications have raised questions about adverse events, raising doubts about the safety of long-term use and increasing concern about overprescribing of PPIs. New data regarding the potential for surgical and endoscopic interventions have emerged. In this new document, we provide updated, evidence-based recommendations and practical guidance for the evaluation and management of GERD, including pharmacologic, lifestyle, surgical, and endoscopic management. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was used to evaluate the evidence and the strength of recommendations. Key concepts and suggestions that as of this writing do not have sufficient evidence to grade are also provided.

### Dietary guideline adherence for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113Rfm9e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common gastrointestinal disease, and the cost of health care and lost productivity due to GERD is extremely high. Recently described side effects of long-term acid suppression have increased the interest in nonpharmacologic methods for alleviating GERD symptoms. We aimed to examine whether GERD patients follow recommended dietary guidelines, and if adherence is associated with the severity and frequency of reflux symptoms.

Methods

We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population, comparing 317 GERD patients to 182 asymptomatic population controls. All analyses adjusted for smoking and education.

Results

GERD patients, even those with moderate to severe symptoms or frequent symptoms, were as likely to consume tomato products and large portion meals as GERD-free controls and were even more likely to consume soft drinks and tea [odds ratio (OR) = 2.01 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12–3.61; OR = 2.63 95% CI 1.24–5.59, respectively] and eat fried foods and high fat diet. The only reflux-triggering foods GERD patients were less likely to consume were citrus and alcohol [OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.35–0.97 for citrus; OR = 0.41 95% CI 0.19–0.87 for 1 + drink/day of alcohol]. The associations were similar when we excluded users of proton pump inhibitors.

Conclusions

GERD patients consume many putative GERD causing foods as frequently or even more frequently than asymptomatic patients despite reporting symptoms. These findings suggest that, if dietary modification is effective in reducing GERD, substantial opportunities for nonpharmacologic interventions exist for many GERD patients.

### The effects of modifying amount and type of dietary carbohydrate on esophageal acid exposure time and esophageal reflux symptoms: a randomized controlled trial [^113nxyML]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most frequent and most costly gastrointestinal disorder diagnosed in US healthcare systems, now affecting ∼30% of Americans. The role of foods and nutrients on the pathogenesis and management of GERD remains unclear because of a paucity of objective evidence. Historically, dietary recommendations have focused on avoiding foods that are perceived to trigger symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, acid taste in the mouth, nausea, and epigastric pain. Consumption of high-fat foods has long been considered a trigger, presumably either by delaying gastric transit time or reducing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, and thereby, increasing esophageal acid exposure time (AET). However, studies using ambulatory pH monitoring have shown no significant difference in LES pressure or the percentage of time that esophageal pH is less than 4.0 in persons with GERD after consuming isocaloric high-fat vs low-fat meals. Furthermore, a review of the evidence showed no basis for recommending a low-fat diet.

In contrast to the findings from studies targeting the amount of dietary fat intake, a 6-day trial of a very low-carbohydrate diet (20 g/d) showed significantly reduced percentage of time with pH < 4.0 in 8 women with GERD and obesity. The importance of focusing on the amount of carbohydrate consumed is best understood when considering that carbohydrates are the macronutrient that comprises the majority of calories consumed — typically 45%–60% of daily energy intake. Beyond the amount of intake, types of carbohydrates are categorized by their chemical structure: simple carbohydrates (often referred to as simple sugars) are monosaccharides such as glucose and fructose, which have only a single aldehyde or ketone unit, and complex carbohydrates are either oligosaccharides with up to 10 monosaccharide units or polysaccharides with very long chains of monosaccharides. Recently, we observed that the amount of total carbohydrate intake, intake of simple sugars, and overall glycemic load were associated with the cardinal GERD symptoms of heartburn and reflux in 144 women with obesity.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^111bZVP5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Two cross-sectional studies indicated an association between poor sleep quality and reflux-like symptoms. Three interventional studies (two small randomised controlled crossover studies and one before-after study) indicated that sleep deprivation may be hyperalgesic by demonstrating greater acid exposure and increased acid perfusion sensitivity score on the day following a night of disturbed sleep.

Statement 18: Alginate-antacid combinations are an effective treatment for reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 100% (6, 90.9%; 5, 9.1%; grade of evidence: A; strength of recommendation: high).

Alginates form a buoyant precipitate on top of gastric contents creating a physical barrier to reflux. Seven RCTs have demonstrated symptomatic relief with alginate formulations versus placebo and antacid alone, and one RCT suggested that alginate-antacids reduce night-time symptoms in PPI-treated patients. Three meta-analyses of RCTs confirmed alginates are more effective than placebo (relative benefit increase up to 60% versus placebo) or antacid alone for treating reflux-like symptoms and three studies suggested noninferiority to omeprazole.

Statement 19: Antacids are an effective treatment for reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 90.9% (6, 45.5%; 5, 45.5%; grade of evidence: A; strength of recommendation: moderate).

Most antacid research was conducted before the 2002 cut-off point for the current literature search. A meta-analysis of these RCTs reported an 11% relative benefit increase compared with placebo. Two randomised, controlled, crossover studies conducted more recently demonstrated that a calcium carbonate gum and hydrotalcite (aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and carbonate) chewable tablets effectively reduce heartburn.

Statement 20: Antacids and alginate-antacid combinations are an effective treatment option for reflux-like symptoms during pregnancy. Agreement 90.9% (6, 45.5%; 5, 45.5%; grade of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: high).

### Objective ambulatory pH monitoring and subjective symptom assessment of gastroesophageal reflux disease show type of carbohydrate and type of fat matter [^114as97y]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite a long history of providing dietary recommendations to avoid 'trigger foods' in routine clinical practice for GERD, little objective evidence exists supporting most recommendations. Interestingly, recent small studies have shown fewer reflux episodes, less esophageal acid exposure, and reduced AET, when consuming lower carbohydrate meals. In this cohort of veterans on PPIs for empiric treatment of GERD, one unique and remarkable finding was that the type (as opposed to amount) of carbohydrate associated with objective GERD status. Scientifically, the types of carbohydrate (the macronutrient typically comprising the majority of calories consumed) are categorized based on chemical structure: monosaccharides, often referred to as simple sugars, versus oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, referred to as complex carbohydrates. We observed that consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (sugar-sweetened tea, soda, and fruit juice) associated with total AET. Notably, sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of added simple sugars in the American diet. One typical 12-ounce serving of sugar-sweetened tea contains 5–6 teaspoons of added simple sugars, a typical 12-ounce can of soda contains nine teaspoons of added simple sugars, and a typical 10-ounce bottle of sweetened fruit juice contains 7–8 teaspoons of added simple sugars. National guidelines recommend limiting added simple sugar intake to 6–12 teaspoons per day due to the relationship with chronic diseases.

### Heartburn relief with bicarbonate-rich mineral water: results of the randomised, placebo-controlled phase-III trial STOMACH STILL [^1165Jmm2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

According to guidelines for the management of patients with GORD, symptoms including heartburn should be primarily managed by dietary and lifestyle changes — either as initial treatment in mild cases or in combination with pharmacological treatments. However, the evidence base for the effectiveness of lifestyle measures is limited, and management options for symptom relief with proven efficacy are rare. Recommended chemically defined pharmacological treatments mainly focus on the neutralisation of gastric acid, the reduction of acid secretion and/or the elimination of the acid pocket. These gastric-acid-directed medications include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as first-line option besides histamin-2 receptor antagonists, alginates and antacids.

Staatl. Fachingen STILL is a sodium bicarbonate-rich mineral water that has been used for decades for symptomatic treatment of GI disturbances. Its status as a so-called 'healing water' qualifies the mineral water as a medicinal product according to German drug law, however, so far, no controlled clinical trial had been available. Preliminary data of Staatl. Fachingen STILL and other bicarbonate-rich mineral waters showed positive effects on heartburn and associated complaints. The mineral water is expected to exert its beneficial effects by neutralising gastric acid (antacid effect), by accelerating oesophageal clearance and gastric emptying, by increasing gut motility (prokinetic effect) and — as a consequence — by protecting the mucosa of the oesophagus from damage caused by acid reflux. From a chemical perspective, such mineral waters have the same numerical capacity for neutralising gastric acid as chemically defined antacids. The neutralising capacity of the recommended daily dose of 1.5 L mineral water is equivalent to the neutralising capacity of the recommended daily dose of antacids (eg, three tablets/day of Rennie Kautabletten: calcium carbonate/magnesium carbonate).

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: expert review [^112Lwzxx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Patient education — initial visit guidance, during the initial clinic visit, it is essential that clinicians provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms (BPA 2). Patient education should emphasize that gastro-esophageal reflux is a physiologic process, commonly mediated through transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and controlled by protective factors such as the anti-reflux barrier, effective esophageal peristalsis and salivation, and downstream gastric motility. For patients with a known hiatal hernia and/or symptom burden following meals or during sleep, reduction of supine GERD by elevating the head of the bed and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime are useful. An introductory discussion about the brain/gut axis can also empower and encourage the patient to integrate stress-reducing activities such as mindfulness into their daily lives, and can open the door for future psychological interventions.

Since obesity is a risk factor for 13 different types of cancer, MBS patients also must continue to be screened for cancer postoperatively, in accordance with national guidelines. Nutritional intake, activity levels, adherence with multivitamin and mineral supplements, current weight, and both comorbidity assessments and blood tests should be done annually by the obesity management team.

Once a patient has undergone MBS, the center where the surgery was conducted needs to, thus, relay a comprehensive postoperative health management plan to primary care providers, which must include which procedures, blood tests, and long-term vitamin supplements are required, any medication changes and/or monitoring that may be necessary, and when patients should be referred back to the MBS center. Reasons for referral back to the MBS center or to a local specialist include persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, nutritional issues, pregnancy, a need for psychological support, appreciable weight regain, and other medical issues requiring bariatric care.

With respect to weight regain, it is crucial that patients and their primary health care providers understand that some degree of weight regain is typical, especially after 2 years postoperatively, and that even appreciable weight regain must never be considered treatment "failure", as such a perception can exert detrimental effects on patients' self-perception, motivation to continue treatment, compliance with further monitoring and treatment and, ultimately, their health outcomes. Instead, just like patients who experience disease recurrence after cancer therapy, patients presenting with significant weight regain after MBS require an extensive evaluation, including anatomical studies (eg, UGI endoscopy, UGI barium studies) and being assessed by the multidisciplinary team.

Finally, weight regain is not the only clinical outcome that can warrant investigation after MBS. For example, patients presenting with GERD symptoms, with or without weight regain after MBS, also require an objective assessment to identify or rule out GERD, including pH studies with or without manometry.

### How would you manage this patient with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^113tkEfx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common medical condition presenting with heartburn, regurgitation, cough, hoarseness, and/or wheezing. Patients with classic GERD symptoms often do not require diagnostic studies before empirical treatment is initiated. However, if atypical features are present, including alarm symptoms for malignancy, or if symptoms do not respond to conventional treatment, upper endoscopy may be necessary. The optimal management of GERD, which is the subject of debate, depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology published updated recommendations for diagnosis and management of GERD. In addition to histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton-pump inhibitor therapy, which may be prescribed as needed or continuously, lifestyle and dietary modification are often advised. Here, 2 physicians, a primary care practitioner and a gastroenterologist, debate how to manage a patient with GERD symptoms. They discuss the diagnosis of this condition, its initial management, indications for upper endoscopy, and how to care for the patient whose condition does not respond to empirical therapy.

Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux (CHEST guideline) — first-line management when reflux-cough syndrome is suspected: In adult patients with chronic cough suspected to be due to reflux-cough syndrome, we recommend that treatment include (1) diet modification to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; (2) head of bed elevation and avoiding meals within 3 hours of bedtime; and (3) in patients who report heartburn and regurgitation, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor antagonists, alginate, or antacid therapy sufficient to control these symptoms (Grade 1C). While it is expected that GI symptoms will respond within 4–8 weeks, the literature suggests that improvement in cough may take up to 3 months, and head of bed elevation is suggested based on its utility for improving GI GERD symptoms while acknowledging that it has not been demonstrated to be beneficial for cough.

Results

Consensus was achieved for 21 of the final 22 statements (Table 2). For each consensus statement, the result of the final vote and the grade of supporting evidence are given, followed by a discussion of key evidence. The statements have been separated into three categories of advice, (1) diet and exercise, (2) lifestyle and behaviour and (3) other interventions to target potential reflux-like symptom pathophysiology. The level of voting agreement achieved in each round is summarised in Figs. 2–4.

Diet and exercise advice

Statement 1: Identification and avoidance of specific dietary triggers (e.g. citrus, tomatoes, highly spiced foods, fatty foods, fried foods and chocolate) should be recommended to individuals with postprandial reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 100% (6, 63.6%; 5, 36.4%; grade of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: high).

Sixteen studies (one randomised crossover trial, one prospective cohort study, one before-after study, two case-control studies, eleven cross-sectional studies) and two systematic reviews supported the association of one or more dietary factors with reflux-like symptoms. The only study assessing a dietary intervention was a before-after study in patients presenting with reflux-like symptoms for the first time in primary care. Reflux-like symptoms decreased significantly from baseline when patients were helped to identify and fully/partially eliminate dietary triggers, and 45% of patients agreed to continue symptom management with dietary intervention alone. One cross-sectional study showing increased heartburn perception after ingestion of chili in patients with sleep disturbance (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Score score > 5) versus normal sleep, emphasizes how the impact of dietary triggers may be influenced by other lifestyle factors.

Gastroparesis is characterized by symptoms suggesting retention of food in the stomach with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction in the gastric outflow. This condition is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. These guidelines summarize perspectives on the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis in adults (including dietary, pharmacological, device, and interventions directed at the pylorus), and they represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology. The scientific evidence for these guidelines was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. When the evidence was not appropriate for Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, we used expert consensus to develop key concept statements. These guidelines should be considered as preferred but are not the only approaches to these conditions.

Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms. Clinicians should emphasize safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD. Clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms with a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy, with inadequate response allowing dosing to be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day, and adequate response prompting decrease of PPI to the lowest effective dose.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: an evidence-based consensus [^113QKyn6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms, experienced regularly by up to 20–50% of individuals. Individuals with mild heartburn frequently use over-the-counter antacids, while those with more severe symptoms often resort to long-term use of acid-suppressant medications. This acid-centred approach, which is highly effective for healing reflux oesophagitis, ignores the more complex aetiology of oesophageal symptoms, wherein dietary habits, reflux hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors and obesity, may also play a role. However, the impracticality of exploring this complex symptom aetiology compared with the pragmatic approach of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has led to widespread, open-ended PPI use. Unfortunately, this also means that reflux-like symptoms, the severity of which exhibits only a weak relationship with pathological oesophageal acid exposure, continue to impact the day-to-day lives of a large proportion of individuals.

The concept that dietary and lifestyle factors can influence the likelihood of reflux-like symptoms is well accepted. However, patients are generally given minimal (and inconsistent) advice about implementing diet, lifestyle and behavioural changes, despite these being low-harm, pragmatic approaches to self-management. One reason for this is a historical lack of emphasis in evidence-based clinical guidelines, which stems from a paucity of high-quality interventional studies. Ideally, guidelines and clinical advice should be based on rigorous evidence, for which randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard. However, a lack of RCT evidence does not negate the value of 'lifestyle' recommendations. Hence, the Delphi method, with greater emphasis on clinical experience and expert consensus, was used to develop a set of consensus statements of advice to help providers and patients target the physical and perceptual factors contributing to reflux-like symptoms. These statements can serve as a basis for facilitating doctor-patient communication as well as aiding the development of self-management tools to better support the wellbeing of patients with reflux-like symptoms.

Background & Aims

As many as one-half of all patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not derive benefit from acid suppression. This review outlines a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach to GERD symptoms.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented here were developed from expert review of existing literature combined with extensive discussion and expert opinion to provide practical advice. Formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was not the intent of this clinical practice update. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinicians should develop a care plan for investigation of symptoms suggestive of GERD, selection of therapy (with explanation of potential risks and benefits), and long-term management, including possible de-escalation, in a shared-decision making model with the patient. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should emphasize safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day. When there is adequate response, PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: If PPI therapy is continued in a patient with unproven GERD, clinicians should evaluate the appropriateness and dosing within 12 months after initiation, and offer endoscopy with prolonged wireless reflux monitoring off PPI therapy to establish appropriateness of long-term PPI therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: If troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain do not respond adequately to a PPI trial or when alarm symptoms exist, clinicians should investigate with endoscopy and, in the absence of erosive reflux disease (Los Angeles B or greater) or long-segment (≥ 3 cm) Barrett's esophagus, perform prolonged wireless pH monitoring off medication (96-hour preferred if available) to confirm and phenotype GERD or to rule out GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Complete endoscopic evaluation of GERD symptoms includes inspection for erosive esophagitis (graded according to the Los Angeles classification when present), diaphragmatic hiatus (Hill grade of flap valve), axial hiatus hernia length, and inspection for Barrett's esophagus (graded according to the Prague classification and biopsied when present). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Clinicians should perform upfront objective reflux testing off medication (rather than an empiric PPI trial) in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms and suspicion for reflux etiology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In symptomatic patients with proven GERD, clinicians should consider ambulatory 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring on PPI as an option to determine the mechanism of persisting esophageal symptoms despite therapy (if adequate expertise exists for interpretation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Clinicians should personalize adjunctive pharmacotherapy to the GERD phenotype, in contrast to empiric use of these agents. Adjunctive agents include alginate antacids for breakthrough symptoms, nighttime H2 receptor antagonists for nocturnal symptoms, baclofen for regurgitation or belch predominant symptoms, and prokinetics for coexistent gastroparesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Clinicians should provide pharmacologic neuromodulation, and/or referral to a behavioral therapist for hypnotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, diaphragmatic breathing, and relaxation strategies in patients with functional heartburn or reflux disease associated with esophageal hypervigilance reflux hypersensitivity and/or behavioral disorders. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with proven GERD, laparoscopic fundoplication and magnetic sphincter augmentation are effective surgical options, and transoral incisionless fundoplication is an effective endoscopic option in carefully selected patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with proven GERD, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is an effective primary anti-reflux intervention in obese patients, and a salvage option in non-obese patients, whereas sleeve gastrectomy has potential to worsen GERD. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Candidacy for invasive anti-reflux procedures includes confirmatory evidence of pathologic GERD, exclusion of achalasia, and assessment of esophageal peristaltic function.

### Diet and gastroesophageal reflux disease: role in pathogenesis and management [^117Pspyq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disease that presents with a variety of symptoms including heartburn and acid regurgitation. Although dietary modification is currently regarded as first-line therapy for the disease, the role of diet in the pathogenesis and management of GERD is still poorly understood. The present article aims to review recent literature that examines the relationship of diet and GERD.

Recent Findings

Increased awareness of medications side effects and widespread overuse has brought nonpharmacological therapies to the forefront for the management of GERD. Recent findings have established the important role of nutrition for the managements of symptoms of GERD. Increasing scientific evidence has produced objective data on the role of certain trigger foods, whereas population studies endorse decreased reflux symptoms by following certain diets. Obesity has been linked with increased symptoms of GERD as well. Furthermore, the importance of lifestyle techniques such as head of bed elevation and increased meal to sleep time may provide nonpharmacologic methods for effective symptom control in GERD.

Summary

We provide a comprehensive review on the association between diet and its role in the development and management of GERD.

Statement 6: Individuals with postprandial reflux-like symptoms should be advised not to overeat. Agreement: 100% (6, 81.8%; 5, 18.2%; grade of evidence: C; strength of recommendation: high).

One prospective cohort study supported overeating as a risk factor for reflux-like symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the habit of eating beyond fullness (continuing to eat beyond a sensation of fullness until unable to eat anymore) was a risk factor for reflux-like symptoms (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.18–3.73). Symptomatic patients were defined as those with a reflux disease questionnaire score ≥ 12 and either a positive oesophageal endoscopy or a positive PPI test (> 80% response to 2 weeks of PPI) suggesting acid-related aetiology was likely.

Statement 7: Moderate, regular exercise should be recommended to overweight and obese individuals with reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 90.9% (6, 72.7%; 5, 18.2%; grade of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: high).

One case-control study and five cross-sectional studies provided evidence that lack of physical activity is a risk factor for reflux-like symptoms. Nilsson et al. showed a linear association between increasing frequency of physical exercise sessions (e.g. running or swimming for at least 30 min) and reduced reflux-like symptoms (P value for linear trend 0.0001). Djärv et al. suggested that physical exercise once a week for at least 30 min can significantly reduce the risk of reflux-like symptoms, while Eslami et al. suggested that regular physical exercise for more than 2 h per week will reduce the risk of symptoms.

Despite recommendations in guidelines, evidence suggests that even simple dietary and lifestyle advice is not communicated in real-world practice. In physician surveys, 17.5% to 51% claim to recommend lifestyle modifications, while in a survey of patients in the UK, only 28% reported being advised in primary care to elevate the head of bed and/or avoid food and drink before going to bed. A retrospective chart review in the USA indicated lifestyle advice counselling, including smoking and alcohol cessation, dietary changes, head-of-the-bed elevation and postprandial avoidance of recumbency, was provided to just 12% of patients. This lack of doctor-patient dialogue regarding self-management of the potential causes of reflux-like symptoms may contribute to the well-recognised problem of PPI overuse. Thus, while some of the consensus statements may seem intuitive, the hope is that consolidation of this advice will help facilitate a shift in management to one that is more patient-centred, with routine counselling to help patients make associations between their symptoms and lifestyle/behaviours. One reason for the lack of advice may be the perceived difficulty in effecting a long-term change in patients' habits and behaviours. In a survey of general practitioners, half believed that only 10% or less of patients would be prepared to make lifestyle modifications. During focus group sessions of patients with obesity and GORD enrolled in a personalised health education and goal-setting programme(The Reflux Improvement and Monitoring Programme; TRIM), it was revealed that many patients did not independently recognise the link between weight and reflux-like symptoms before starting the programme. TRIM was associated with sustained loss of excess body weight, and improvements in patient-reported symptom severity and quality of life. Thus, better-informed patients may be more willing to accept referrals and engage with services for interventions such as weight loss, smoking cessation or increasing exercise. This will help improve overall health and wellbeing, while also supporting appropriate PPI prescribing and de-escalation practices.

Supporting evidence reported that weight loss was associated with a decrease in GERD symptoms and acid exposure time (3 RCTs) and improvement in reflux disease questionnaire scores (1 RCT); large population-based studies showed a linear relationship between body mass index and GERD symptoms; smoking cessation was associated with decreased reflux symptoms; elevating the head of the bed was linked to lower reflux episodes and decreased acid exposure; and a late evening meal was associated with increased reflux, while no data were identified to demonstrate that alcohol cessation improves GERD symptoms and overall certainty of evidence was low.

Statement 4: Individuals who experience reflux-like symptoms after consuming carbonated beverages should be advised to limit their intake of carbonated beverages. Agreement: 100% (6, 72.7%; 5, 27.2%; grade of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: moderate).

Eight studies (two prospective cohort, one case-control, and five cross-sectional) suggested that carbonated drinks are associated with an increase in reflux-like symptoms. The prospective cohort study conducted by Mehta et al. reported an increased risk of reflux-like symptoms (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05–1.58; P < 0.0001) for those with the highest intake of soda (more than 6 servings/day) compared with the lowest intake (0 servings/day). Substitution analysis showed a reduced risk (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.96) when 2 servings of soda were replaced with water. Two of the studies (one prospective cohort and one cross-sectional) found an association between carbonated beverage consumption and nocturnal reflux-like symptoms.

Statement 5: A low-fat diet should be recommended to individuals with reflux-like symptoms. Agreement: 90.9% (6, 63.6%; 5, 27.3%; grade of evidence: D; strength of recommendation: moderate).

Eight studies (one prospective cohort, one case-control and six cross-sectional) suggested that high dietary fat intake is associated with reflux-like symptoms and increased nocturnal reflux-like symptom severity. Three cross-sectional studies indicated that high saturated fat is an important risk factor, while a further cross-sectional study in an Albanian population, found that a predominantly non-Mediterranean diet (processed foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats) was positively related to reflux-like symptoms versus a Mediterranean diet (frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables, olive oil and fish) (adjusted OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.5). No interventional study assessing reflux-like symptoms after switching from a high-fat to a low-fat diet was identified.

Lifestyle modification and weight reduction

Whereas it is generally recommended to advise lifestyle changes, the evidence for efficacy of these recommendations in GORD management is mostly anecdotal. It therefore seems wise to limit these recommendations to a generally healthy diet and avoidance of (or moderation with) specific food items or activities that, in the experience of the patient, evoke symptoms. A much more relevant general focus is on weight control. A multitude of studies demonstrated a correlation between obesity and GORD and, as illustrated in figure 3, obesity, especially of the abdomen, is increasingly invoked in theories of pathogenesis. There is also evidence for the efficacy of weight reduction in reducing GORD symptoms. One of these studies reported that a decrease in BMI as little as 3.5 kg/m² leads to a nearly 40% risk reduction of GORD, even among women with a normal BMI. Hence, although the published evidence that weight loss leads to reduced reflux may not be abundant, it is sufficient to warrant recommending weight reduction as an important weapon in the battle against the GORD epidemic. Furthermore, in patients being considered for bariatric surgery, it is important to be aware of the differential effects of the various options on reflux. Gastric banding procedures generally decrease the prevalence of reflux symptoms (from 33% to 8%) but lead to de novo reflux symptoms in 23% of patients and to de novo oesophagitis in 23%. Likewise, the gastric sleeve resection increases the prevalence of oesophagitis from 18% to 45%. The only bariatric procedure that reduces reflux and reflux symptoms is the gastric bypass procedure with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Some practitioners go as far as to recommend this procedure for the treatment of GORD in morbidly obese patients.

### The risks and benefits of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association [^111YisHb]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), focusing on long-term use of PPIs for three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) bleeding prophylaxis.

Methods

The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we queried clinicaltrials.gov. To assess the quality of evidence, we used a modified approach based on the GRADE Working Group. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association has reviewed these recommendations. Best Practice Advice 1: Patients with GERD and acid-related complications (ie, erosive esophagitis or peptic stricture) should take a PPI for short-term healing, maintenance of healing, and long-term symptom control. Best Practice Advice 2: Patients with uncomplicated GERD who respond to short-term PPIs should subsequently attempt to stop or reduce them. Patients who cannot reduce PPIs should consider ambulatory esophageal pH/impedance monitoring before committing to lifelong PPIs to help distinguish GERD from a functional syndrome. The best candidates for this strategy may be patients with predominantly atypical symptoms or those who lack an obvious predisposition to GERD (eg, central obesity, large hiatal hernia). Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with Barrett's esophagus and symptomatic GERD should take a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 4: Asymptomatic patients with Barrett's esophagus should consider a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 5: Patients at high risk for ulcer-related bleeding from NSAIDs should take a PPI if they continue to take NSAIDs. Best Practice Advice 6: The dose of long-term PPIs should be periodically reevaluated so that the lowest effective PPI dose can be prescribed to manage the condition. Best Practice Advice 7: Long-term PPI users should not routinely use probiotics to prevent infection. Best Practice Advice 8: Long-term PPI users should not routinely raise their intake of calcium, vitamin B12, or magnesium beyond the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Best Practice Advice 9: Long-term PPI users should not routinely screen or monitor bone mineral density, serum creatinine, magnesium, or vitamin B12. Best Practice Advice 10: Specific PPI formulations should not be selected based on potential risks.

Algorithm 2 — diagnostic and therapeutic pathway for typical reflux symptoms in the older child — starts with a "Child with Typical Symptoms of GERD", proceeds to evaluate "Presence of Alarm Sign", and if present directs to "Tailor Testing to Address Alarm Signs and Refer Appropriately". Without alarm signs, initiate "Lifestyle and Dietary Education"; if symptoms persist, use "Acid Suppression for 4–8 weeks", and when improved "Continue for a total of 4–8 weeks and then attempt wean", otherwise "Refer to Pediatric GI". For "Persistent symptoms on PPI OR inability to stop PPI after wean attempts", mucosal disease is considered with branches including "Erosions or Eosinophilic Esophagitis", and in the absence of erosions either "No Erosions, PPI-responsive symptoms" (then "Continue PPI for responsive symptoms with periodic weaning attempts") or "No Erosions, Persistent symptoms despite PPI" leading to "pH-MII or pH-metry". Physiologic testing then classifies "Abnormal Acid Exposure" or "Normal Acid Exposure", where normal exposure with "Positive Symptom Correlation" indicates "Reflux Hypersensitivity", and with "Negative Symptom Correlation" indicates "Functional Heartburn".

### Fat and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [^117UZF4A]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2000). Low credibility.

It is common practice to prescribe avoidance of fatty foods to patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; however, there is no good evidence supporting the benefit of such a prescription. Several reports looking at gastro-oesophageal reflux after meals of different fat content have been controversial probably because of differences in caloric load, volume and osmolarity, factors which may independently influence reflux. Recent observations suggest that fatty meals do not promote gastro-oesophageal reflux nor alter the competence of the oesophagogastric junction in comparison to balanced meals, provided they contain the same energy load. The possibility that fat increases heartburn by modulating perception of acid reflux seems to have little relevance. It is concluded that, in the light of present evidence, there is no sound rationale for clinicians recommending that patients with GORD follow a low-fat diet.

Dietary intervention: reflux avoiding and soft foods

Patients with GERD are often advised to refrain from fatty foods, late evening meals, coffee, alcohol, carbonated drinks, and orange juice. In an Italian study, elimination of perceived trigger foods in 100 patients with heartburn reduced symptom severity and eliminated heartburn or regurgitation symptoms in most of them. A preliminary report of a placebo-controlled crossover treatment trial in 8 patients with nonerosive heartburn showed increased heartburn symptoms after a 6-week intake of capsules with capsaicin, the active ingredient of red chili pepper and an agonist at transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels, but a full study report has not been published to date. In a randomized open-label trial of a low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) diet versus usual dietary advice in 31 patients with symptomatic proton pump inhibitor-refractory GERD symptoms, no difference in control of GERD and dyspeptic symptoms was observed. In 38 GERD patients from Italy, an in vitro leukocyte reaction test (leukocytotoxic test) to food was used as a basis for randomization to a true or sham elimination diet for 4 weeks, which led to a lower GERD impact scale in the true diet group. No follow-up intervention studies have been published.

In patients with functional dysphagia, careful chewing and diet adaptations, ranging from avoidance of hard foods to semisolid, mixed, and liquid meals is advocated. The literature lacks case series and follow-up data documenting the efficacy of such interventions.

### Gastroesophageal reflux: management guidance for the pediatrician [^11593PV8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Recent comprehensive guidelines developed by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition define the common entities of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the physiologic passage of gastric contents into the esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as reflux associated with troublesome symptoms or complications. The ability to distinguish between GER and GERD is increasingly important to implement best practices in the management of acid reflux in patients across all pediatric age groups, as children with GERD may benefit from further evaluation and treatment, whereas conservative recommendations are the only indicated therapy in those with uncomplicated physiologic reflux. This clinical report endorses the rigorously developed, well-referenced North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines and likewise emphasizes important concepts for the general pediatrician. A key issue is distinguishing between clinical manifestations of GER and GERD in term infants, children, and adolescents to identify patients who can be managed with conservative treatment by the pediatrician and to refer patients who require consultation with the gastroenterologist. Accordingly, the evidence basis presented by the guidelines for diagnostic approaches as well as treatments is discussed. Lifestyle changes are emphasized as first-line therapy in both GER and GERD, whereas medications are explicitly indicated only for patients with GERD. Surgical therapies are reserved for children with intractable symptoms or who are at risk for life-threatening complications of GERD. Recent black box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration are discussed, and caution is underlined when using promoters of gastric emptying and motility. Finally, attention is paid to increasing evidence of inappropriate prescriptions for proton pump inhibitors in the pediatric population.

### Lifestyle intervention for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a national multicenter survey of lifestyle factor effects on gastroesophageal reflux disease in China [^116VCRgj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is characterized by abnormal gastric reflux into the esophagus at least once a week leading to heartburn and acid regurgitation. It is a common disease globally, with increasing prevalence, and, consequently, greater burden on healthcare systems. The prevalence rates of GERD in Western countries, where it is most prevalent, have been reported to be 10–20%. Meanwhile, recent modernization of living standards, and the accompanying lifestyle changes and acceleration of the pace of life, have led to an increasing prevalence of symptomatic GERD in China, which reached 3.8% in 2016. Because of repeated treatment and prolonged healing, GERD is associated with reduced health-related quality of life, substantial costs for patients, and increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

GERD has been reported to be alleviated, or even cured, with a combination of lifestyle interventions and medication. Moreover, poor lifestyle habits can worsen GERD and reduce treatment efficacy. A consensus of GERD treatment strategy has yet to be established due to the lack of a unified view of GERD-promoting behavior. For example, opposing effects of coffee or caffeine on GERD have been reported, questions remain about the potential relationship between esophageal acid exposure and meal times, as well as about whether GERD symptoms are related to body mass index (BMI). Because it is difficult for patients who lack awareness of what constitutes a high-risk lifestyle to correct unhealthful habits after the emergence of red-flag symptoms before irreversible damage has been done, such patients tend to have poor drug treatment outcomes.

Lifestyle changes for GERD recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology, in 2013, and the Chinese Medical Association Digestive Diseases Branch, in 2014, include weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, cessation of smoking and frequent alcohol use, avoidance of meals 2–3 h before bedtime, and reduced intake of coffee, chocolate, spices, acidic foods, and high-fat foods. The lifestyle interventions mentioned in the guide, however, are quite limited.

GERD may progress from reflux esophagitis to Barrett's esophagus (precancerous esophageal adenocarcinoma lesions), and, ultimately, to esophageal adenocarcinoma, a gravely serious outcome of GERD comorbidity with esophageal injury syndrome. In our prior investigation of 103 patients with esophageal cancer, we found that many patients with esophageal cancer had habits such as eating quickly, eating until very full, and consuming very hot foods, that are not addressed in GERD lifestyle intervention therapy guidance.
