## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code D50?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10 code D50. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10 category structure and where D50 sits. Then, I should verify the exact definition of D50 from authoritative sources. Next, I will check for subcategories and common synonyms. Finally, I will confirm any nuances that distinguish D50 from other anemias and summarize the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the category context. ICD-10 organizes diseases into chapters, and the D50–D89 range corresponds to diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs, which includes anemias. So D50 falls within the anemia section of that chapter, which aligns with how clinical studies and coding references group anemias in this block [^d2d51381] [^1befb94c].

> Now, I should verify the precise definition. Multiple high-credibility sources consistently define ICD-10 code D50 as iron deficiency anemia, often explicitly as dietary iron deficiency anemia, and they enumerate the subcodes D50.0 through D50.9 to capture specificity such as chronic blood loss, refractory iron deficiency, and other or unspecified iron deficiency anemia. This is the standard nomenclature used in epidemiologic and clinical coding contexts [^d2d51381] [^5b1129d6] [^1befb94c].

> Wait, let me verify the subcategories so I don't overgeneralize. The D50 block includes D50.0 for iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss, D50.1 for dietary iron deficiency anemia, D50.8 for other iron deficiency anemias, and D50.9 for unspecified iron deficiency anemia. These distinctions matter for both clinical documentation and research case definitions, and they are reflected in studies that operationalize iron deficiency anemia using D50 codes alongside related nutritional anemias in adjacent blocks [^d2d51381] [^1befb94c].

> Hold on, I should confirm how D50 differs from nearby anemia codes so we don't conflate them. D51 covers vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, D52 covers folate deficiency anemia, and D53 covers other nutritional anemias; D50 is specifically reserved for iron deficiency etiologies, which is why cohorts and guidelines that want isolated iron deficiency anemia restrict to D50 rather than the broader D50–D64 anemia range [^1befb94c] [^d2d51381].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing any coding nuance. In some administrative datasets, if the clinician documents "anemia" without specifying iron deficiency, coders may default to unspecified anemia codes like D64.9 rather than D50, so true iron deficiency anemia counts based on D50 can be underestimated if documentation is incomplete. This is a known limitation that researchers often acknowledge when defining iron deficiency anemia from claims [^4132e3f0].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my summary is precise. ICD-10 code D50 represents iron deficiency anemia, with subcodes detailing chronic blood loss, dietary causes, other specified causes, and unspecified presentations. It is the standard code used to identify iron deficiency anemia in epidemiology, clinical registries, and health services research, and it is distinct from other nutritional anemias coded in D51–D53 [^d2d51381] [^5b1129d6] [^1befb94c].

---

ICD-10 code D50 denotes **iron deficiency anemia**, encompassing dietary insufficiency, chronic blood loss, and other specified or unspecified iron deficiency states [^d2d51381] [^5b1129d6]. The subcodes D50.0–D50.9 provide specificity for etiology and clinical context, and accurate coding supports diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiologic tracking [^d2d51381] [^5b1129d6].

---

## Clinical definition and subcategories

Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by **microcytic, hypochromic anemia** due to insufficient iron for hemoglobin synthesis. The ICD-10 subcategories of D50 include:

| **Subcategory** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| D50.0 | Iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss |
| D50.1 | Iron deficiency anemia due to dietary insufficiency |
| D50.8 | Other iron deficiency anemias |
| D50.9 | Iron deficiency anemia, unspecified |

---

## Clinical significance

Iron deficiency anemia is common globally and has major clinical consequences, including fatigue, impaired cognitive function, and increased morbidity. It is especially relevant in **pregnant women, children, and chronic disease populations** [^00974b7b] [^d2d51381].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical documentation

Diagnosis relies on **hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP** to confirm iron deficiency and exclude other causes. Accurate ICD-10 coding requires clear documentation of the etiology (e.g. chronic blood loss, dietary insufficiency) to assign the appropriate subcategory [^4132e3f0].

---

## Epidemiology and public health implications

Iron deficiency anemia is a major public health concern, particularly in low-resource settings. ICD-10 coding enables surveillance, resource allocation, and evaluation of interventions [^d2d51381] [^5b1129d6].

---

## Clinical management and treatment

Management focuses on correcting the cause and restoring iron stores, using **iron supplementation, dietary modification, and treating underlying sources of blood loss**. Accurate ICD-10 coding supports appropriate treatment pathways and follow-up care [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and challenges in coding

Coding challenges include underdocumentation of etiology, leading to use of unspecified codes (D50.9), and variability in coding practices. These issues can **underestimate disease burden** and complicate surveillance efforts [^4132e3f0].

---

ICD-10 code D50 represents **iron deficiency anemia**, with subcategories that specify etiology. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for clinical care, epidemiologic surveillance, and public health planning.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Global burden and cross-country inequalities of nutritional deficiencies in adults aged 65 years and older, 1990–2021: population-based study using the GBD 2021 [^d2d51381]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Disease definitions

Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) includes moderate and severe acute malnutrition, commonly referred to as "wasting", and was defined in terms of weight-for-height Z-scores (WHZ) on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth standard for children. PEM was quantified in four categories: moderate wasting without oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), moderate wasting with oedema (WHZ < -2SD to < -3 SD), severe wasting without oedema (WHZ < -3SD), and severe wasting with oedema (WHZ < -3SD). The GBD team further uses the DisMod-MR 2.1 model to ensure consistent applicability of the assessment across all age groups. For PEM, ICD 10 codes are E40-E46.9, E64.0, and ICD 9 codes are 260–263.9. In the GBD 2021, the non-fatal burden of iodine deficiency includes estimates of only the subset of iodine deficiency associated with visible goitre (grade 2) and its associated sequelae, including thyroid dysfunction, heart failure, and intellectual disability, excluding sub-clinical iodine deficiency or non-visible goitre (grade 1) induced by iodine deficiency. For iodine deficiency, ICD-10 codes are E00-E02 and ICD-9 codes are 244.2. Vitamin A deficiency was defined as the prevalence of serum retinol concentration < 0.7 µmol/L, according to ICD 10 codes E50-E50.9, E64.1, and ICD 9 codes 264–264.9. Dietary iron deficiency is defined as mild, moderate, or severe anaemia that is the result of inadequate dietary intake of iron, but not due to other causes of inadequate absolute or functional iron availability to meet the body's needs. For dietary iron deficiency, ICD 10 codes are D50-D50.9, and ICD 9 codes are 280–280.9.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

### Burden of anemia in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in French secondary care [^1befb94c]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Patients admitted to a hospital were classified by primary diagnosis and then allocated a randomized code to maintain anonymity. Access to patient information thereafter was available only at the hospital admission or hospital stay level. The two study cohorts were identified from the PMSI database using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Arthritis, defined as RA and/or OA, included seropositive RA (ICD-10 code M05), other RA (M06), polyarthrosis (M15), coxarthrosis/hip arthrosis (M16), gonarthrosis/knee arthrosis (M17), arthrosis of first carpometacarpal joint (M18), and other arthrosis (M19). A diagnosis of anemia included iron deficiency anemia (D50.0, D50.1, D50.8, D50.9), vitamin B 12 deficiency anemia (D51.0-D51.3, D51.8, D51.9), folate deficiency anemia (D52.0, D52.1, D52.8, D52.9), other nutritional anemias (D53.0-D53.2, D53.8, D53.9), and acquired hemolytic anemias (D59.0-D59.6, D59.8, D59.9). Patients with alpha and beta thalassemia were not included.

### Trends and predictions of malnutrition and obesity in 204 countries and territories: an analysis of the global burden of disease study 2019 [^5b1129d6]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

The study included all cases of malnutrition and obesity within the GBD 2019 study. Malnutrition was defined based on the 10th revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for nutritional deficiencies, stratified based on protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 codes E40-E46.9, E64.0), iodine deficiencies (E00-E02), vitamin A deficiencies (E50-E50.9, E64.1), dietary iron deficiencies (D50-D50.9), and other nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin deficiency anaemias, thiamine, niacin, vitamin D, vitamin C, calcium, selenium, and folate deficiency (D51-D53.9, E51-E61.9, E63-E64, E64.2-E64.9), with the full definitions used reported in the original GBD 2019 report. Obesity was measured by body mass index (BMI) using metrics related to national and subnational estimates, and defined as a high BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m 2.

The Joinpoint Regression Model version 4.9.1.0was used to compare annual percentage changes (APC) in rates, through which trends in obesity and malnutrition, stratified by sex, geographical location, and SDI were observed. APCs of the age-standardised rates from 2000 to 2019 were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An APC value which is large in magnitude represents an increasing (worsening) or decreasing (improving) trend.

STATA version 17.0 was used to project the obesity and malnutrition-related burden of deaths and DALYs using historical data from 2000 to 2019 to test for linear and quadratic trends. Based on visual inspection and evaluation of the models, the most appropriate model with the best fit for each disease entity was chosen. Using the predictions from the regression models and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projectionof population counts for years 2020–2030, we projected the burden of mortality and DALYs through to year 2030 for obesity and malnutrition. We also stratified the projections by sex for comparison. To examine the percentage change for obesity and malnutrition, the following equation was used:

The methods used to project the GBD estimates have been described previously. No sensitivity or post-hoc analyses were performed.

Ethics

The study was exempted from IRB review as the publicly available data did not contain any confidential patient information.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^2c847ed5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Lifetime medical costs attributable to sickle cell disease among nonelderly individuals with commercial insurance [^5924a678]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Study population

We created a retrospective longitudinal cohort of individuals from the Truven database who fulfilled a previously validated case definition for SCD at any point between 2007 and 2018. Individuals had ≥ 1 inpatient claim or 2 outpatient or emergency department claims for SCD in any position using the International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th edition codes (ICD-9: 282.41, 282.42, and 282.6x; ICD-10: D57.0x, D57.1x, D57.2x, D57.4x, and D57.8x, excluding 282.5 and D57.3; sickle cell trait). This criterion has > 90% sensitivity and specificity in identifying pediatric SCD and has been widely applied to populations of all ages; however, its performance in older adults has not been specifically evaluated. Individuals were followed from the start of their first claim encounter (irrespective of when SCD was diagnosed) from January 1, 2007, until December 31, 2018, or any period of continuous enrollment exceeding 1 year therein. We excluded all observations of individuals ≥ 65 years to eliminate periods in which all patients were eligible for Medicare. Because only the year of birth was available, we assumed an individual's day and month of birth coincided with their date of enrollment.

We selected control individuals from MEPS who were surveyed between 2007 and 2018. We restricted this sample to those who reported their primary race as Black since the majority of individuals with SCD are Black, and without race/ethnicity information from the Truven database, we were unable to match more granularly. Individuals selected from MEPS also had private insurance covering hospital and physician services and did not have claims for blood disorders (ICD-9: 280 to 289; ICD-10: D50 to D89) during the study period. We refer to this cohort as "matched controls" to reflect the absence of blood disorders, including SCD.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^6663b705]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Because chronic pain has been poorly represented in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) despite its significant contribution to the burden of disease worldwide, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a classification of chronic pain that was included in the ICD-11 version as "MG30" and approved by the World Health Assembly in 2019. The objective of this field test was to determine how well the classification of chronic pain works in the context of the ICD-11. A web-based survey using the WHO-FiT platform recruited 177 healthcare professionals from all WHO regions. After a training on coding chronic pain hosted by the IASP Web site, participants evaluated 18 diagnostic codes (lines) of the 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 and 12 vignettes (cases) describing chronic pain conditions. Correctness, ambiguity, and perceived difficulty of the coding were compared between the ICD-11 and the ICD-10 and the applicability of the morbidity rules for the ICD-11 verified. In the line coding, 43.0% of correct chronic pain diagnoses assigned with the ICD-10 contrasted with 63.2% with the ICD-11. Especially in cases in which the chronic pain is regarded as the symptom of an underlying disease, the ICD-11 (63.5%) commanded more correct diagnoses than the ICD-10 (26.8%). The case coding was on average 83.9% accurate, only in 1.6% of cases any difficulty was perceived. The morbidity rules were applied correctly in 74.1% of cases. From a coding perspective, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 in every respect, offering better accuracy, difficulty, and ambiguity in coding chronic pain conditions.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Comparing the ICD-11 chronic pain classification with ICD-10: how can the new coding system make chronic pain visible? A study in a tertiary care pain clinic setting [^8463e321]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is a frequent reason for patients to ask for medical services. However, systematic information about the extent and impact of pain, especially in developing countries, has not been available up to now. We evaluated whether the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) can fill this gap by coding all electronic out-patient medical records of the pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital in Thailand in 2019 (8714 visits), using the ICD-10 and ICD-11 browsers referenced on the WHO websites. The 3 most frequent pain-related codes in ICD-10 were R52.2 "other chronic pain" (29%), M54.5 "low back pain" (18%), and M79.6 "pain in limb" (13%). In ICD-11, the 3 most frequent codes were MG30.31 "chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain associated with structural changes" (28%), MG30.51 "chronic peripheral neuropathic pain" (26%), and MG30.10 "chronic cancer pain" (23%). Thus, using the currently valid ICD-10 system, roughly one-third of patient encounters were coded as "other chronic pain", and the next 2 were specifying the pain region rather than any underlying cause. By contrast, ICD-11 coding of the same patients identified underlying causes (bones and joints, somatosensory nervous system, cancer, or surgery), which provide guidance towards differential patient management. In our pain clinic, most patients suffered from chronic cancer pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, which were poorly defined or nonexistent in the current ICD-10 coding system. Compared with the ICD-10, the ICD-11 provides more detailed diagnostic categories and is more informative for clinical use, research, and resource allocation for pain-related conditions.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f0ecb9a3]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36-T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%-76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%-88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%-98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%-99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%-81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%-66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%-14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%-40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

TABLE 1
Distribution of death certificates with COVID-19 diagnosis* across five mutually exclusive categories defined by presence and classification of co-occurring diagnoses, by demographic characteristics, setting of death, and manner of death characteristics — National Center for Health Statistics, United States, January–December 2020

* International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code U07.1.

Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g. pneumonia, respiratory failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrest, or sepsis), or significant contributing condition (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, dementia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or both. The most frequent chain-of-event ICD-10 diagnosis codes on 330,198 death certificates that listed COVID-19 on Part I of the death certificate were J18.9 (pneumonia) (45%) and J96.0 (acute respiratory failure) (20%) (Table 2); the most frequent significant contributing condition ICD-10 codes were I10 (essential hypertension) (18%) and E14.9 (diabetes mellitus) (10%). Nearly 75% of all death certificates had a chain-of-event condition, alone or in combination with a significant contributing condition; this finding was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural (Table 1).

CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Diagnostic work-up of anemia and associated health outcomes in people with heart failure [^ca9fb76f]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source

We used data from the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project, which contains healthcare utilization data from all residents of the region of Stockholm, Sweden. A single healthcare provider in the Stockholm region provides universal and tax-funded healthcare to 20–25% of the population of Sweden. SCREAM contains complete information on demographics, healthcare utilization, laboratory tests, dispensed drugs, diagnoses (captured by International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes from primary care, specialist care and inpatient care records) and vital status.

Study population

We included adults aged ≥ 18 years residing and accessing health care in Stockholm during 2016 to 2021 (last date available currently in SCREAM), with a diagnosis of HF and available subsequent hemoglobin tests. We excluded hemoglobin tests taken during an inpatient stay, or hemoglobin tests performed within 30 days after a bleeding event or a transfusion code and hemoglobin tests within 30 days from a hospitalization discharge, which could relate to the monitoring and/or resolution of an event. After these exclusions, we selected the date of the first hemoglobin test per patient as the index date for our study and the timepoint where baseline covariates were assessed, and follow-up began. At this point we further excluded patients who had conditions affecting the interpretation of hemoglobin values or of potential incident anemia-related outcomes, including recent pregnancy (within 2 years prior), ongoing or recent history of cancer (a clinical diagnosis of cancer in the previous 3 years, excluding diagnoses of melanomas), a hematologic disease, and chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus) (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Once the study population had been defined, we identified and excluded individuals with anemia at the index date (i.e. prevalent anemia cases, defined by having a low hemoglobin value according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition: < 12 g/dL for females or < 13 g/dL for males), or having received an anemia diagnosis (ICD-10 codes D50–D64) in the year prior to the index date or having received anemia treatment (erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) or iron) in the year prior to the index date (Additional file 1: Table S1). The resulting cohort was then a cohort of prevalent HF cases free from (recent) anemia and with a baseline hemoglobin value.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^e09309e9]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The overall cost of RDs is likely larger than the current HCUP utilization analysis. HCUP estimate charges likely underestimate the true costs of these conditions because they do not factor direct costs such as professional (e.g. physician, dentist, and other clinicians) fees, indirect costs (e.g. lost work productivity), and secondary downstream health-care effects.

HCUP databases are useful for giving estimates on a national scale. There are, however, several limitations of HCUP sample data: (1) the frequencies represent hospital discharges, and not patients, and thus, recurrent hospitalizations by the same patient appear as distinct observations; (2) the prevalence data may be affected by hospital coding; (3) databases do not capture outpatient encounters, and the full health-care utilization of patients suffering from RDs is underrepresented; (4) data do not represent the complete universe of all discharges in the United States since not all states participate; (5) hospital charges represent the bill that is sent to the payer, not the actual cost to the hospital which may vary, depending on reimbursement, if any; (6) the number of rare conditions included in this study primarily correspond to ICD-10 codes provided by Orphanet, which is far from the nearly 7,000–10,000 rare conditions currently described; (7) patients with undiagnosed rare conditions are not included in the RD cohort; (8) conditions are heterogeneous and genetic basis may affect only a disease subpopulation; (9) the ICD-10 codes used also include CC, which are unable to be separated from RDs, and thus are included in the health-care utilization and cost data reported here; and (10) we did not distinguish conditions in Table S3 that are indicated as having a genetic basis due to genetic susceptibility, genetic role in the phenotype, or disease-causing somatic mutation(s) from those with disease-causing germline mutation(s).

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association COVID-19 data standards — scope and special considerations: This document provides data standards for cardiovascular and other complications related to COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the intent is to provide data elements consistent with current practice guidance and to include updated terminology and attributes in compliance with Task Force methodology and ACC/AHA policies for harmonization. The document is intended for use by researchers, registry developers, and clinicians and is proposed as a framework for ICD-10 code development of COVID-19–related cardiovascular conditions. In this document, data elements were not differentiated for specific encounters such as for inpatients versus outpatients, dates of encounter, number of encounters, baseline or repeated data elements, and databases can be built and customized according to users' needs to capture such information. The intent was not to provide recommendations regarding COVID-19 treatment, and the writing committee recommends that readers follow prevailing COVID-19 management guidelines.

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Bone health, renal outcomes, and iron deficiency anaemia in proton pump inhibitor versus histamine-2 receptor antagonist users: a retrospective cohort study based on triNetX global collaborative network data [^06d689c1]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Definition of population and outcomes

PPI was defined as ATC code A02BC, and H2RA was defined as ATC code A02BA. Every patient should have been refilled for at least 12 times. Concerning shift medication, we only included pure and new users of PPI or H2RA.

To avoid reverse causality, we started to include outcomes 1 month after the event date. We excluded patients with previous outcomes, which means our outcomes were incidence outcomes. All the desired outcomes were prespecified based on the following codes:

Renal function: Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI eGFR; LOINC codes: 98979–8). We included mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45–60 mL/min/1.732 m 2, 30–45 mL/min/1.732 m 2, 15–30 mL/min/1.732 m 2, and < 15 mL/min/1.732 m 2.
Anaemia outcome: iron deficiency anaemia (IDA; ICD-CM-10 D50), blood haemoglobin (g/dL; LOINC code 718–7), blood ferritin (ng/mL; LOINC code 2276–4), and blood iron (μg/dL; LOINC code 2498–4).
Bone outcome: osteoporosis (ICD-CM-10 M81.0), major fracture (fracture of the spine, femur, pelvis, tibia, and arm; detailed ICD-CM-10 codes are provided in online supplemental table 2), blood magnesium (mg/dL; LOINC code 19123–9), blood calcium (mg/dL; LOINC code 17861–6), and blood phosphate (mg/dL; LOINC code 2777–1).

### Enhancing research and treatment of mental disorders with dimensional concepts: toward DSM-V and ICD-11 [^ede950b8]. World Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The current versions of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) and ICD (ICD-10) describe all mental disorders as polythetic-categorical concepts. Lists of symptoms are presented, and diagnostic category labels are assigned to patients based on observing specific patterns of symptoms. A number of notable conceptual problems emerge when using this strictly categorical system in research and in the clinic. When thorough structured diagnostic interviews are used, typical patients meet criteria for more than one specific diagnosis (a phenomenon termed "comorbidity"). In addition, groups of patients with the same putative categorical label are often heterogeneous with respect to key clinical features, such as severity and prognosis, and patients with symptomatology below diagnostic thresholds are often significantly impaired. Although categorical concepts will always be essential in official nosologies (e.g., in providing diagnostic labels for reimbursement purposes), many of the conceptual problems of a strictly categorical diagnostic system can be overcome by enhancing official nosologies with dimensional concepts. Specific dimensional approaches and directions that may be considered for upcoming revisions of both the DSM and ICD are discussed.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Global classification and coding of hypersensitivity diseases-an EAACI-WAO survey, strategic paper and review [^e7c2360a]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity diseases are not adequately coded in the International Coding of Diseases (ICD)-10 resulting in misclassification, leading to low visibility of these conditions and general accuracy of official statistics. To call attention to the inadequacy of the ICD-10 in relation to allergic and hypersensitivity diseases and to contribute to improvements to be made in the forthcoming revision of ICD, a web-based global survey of healthcare professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification was proposed to the members of European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (individuals) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) (representative responding on behalf of the national society), launched via internet and circulated for 6 week. As a result, we had 612 members of 144 countries from all six World Health Organization (WHO) global regions who answered the survey. ICD-10 is the most used classification worldwide, but it was not considered appropriate in clinical practice by the majority of participants. The majority indicated the EAACI-WAO classification as being easier and more accurate in the daily practice. They saw the need for a diagnostic system useful for nonallergists and endorsed the possibility of a global, cross-culturally applicable classification system of allergic disorders. This first and most broadly international survey ever conducted of health professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification supports the need to update the current classifications of allergic diseases and can be useful to the WHO in improving the clinical utility of the classification and its global acceptability for the revised ICD-11.

### Association of early hysterectomy with risk of cardiovascular disease in Korean women [^cbae6512]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Selection of Participants

We used diagnostic codes included in the claims that were classified as per the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), the surgical and treatment codes from the Health Insurance Medical Care Expenses (2016 and 2019 version) for selection of participants, extraction of variables, and assessment of outcomes. Participant flow and reasons for exclusion are provided in Figure 1. In this study, for the case and control groups, women aged 40 to 50 years in 2011 to 2014 were screened. The hysterectomy group included patients who underwent hysterectomy owing to uterine myoma or adenomyosis from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014. The date of hysterectomy was considered the inclusion day for these patients. The control group included women who visited a medical institute for health check-ups during the period. Among this population, patients with a history of hysterectomy after 2014 were excluded. The first visit date to a medical institute for health examination was considered the inclusion day of the control group. Patients with an ICD-10 code of cancer (any Cxx codes), CVD (codes I21-23, I60-64), and hematologic disease (codes D50-89) except for iron deficiency anemia (code D50), anemia after acute bleeding (code D62), anemia with chronic disease (code D63), and other anemia (code D64) before 180 days of inclusion were excluded from both groups. In the selected hysterectomy and control groups, 1:1 propensity matching was conducted for age at 5-year intervals, year at inclusion, socioeconomic status, region, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, menopause before inclusion, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) before inclusion, and adnexal surgery before inclusion. The accuracy of coding of menopause has not been well validated; however, a previous study reported that it is not overestimated compared with other studies. The CCI assigns constant weights from 1 to 6 for 19 diseases defined through medical record investigations, and then corrects the sum of these weights. Women were followed up from the inclusion day to death from any cause or to the end of the study (December 31, 2020).

Selection of Participants From the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service Data

Age per 5-year interval, year at inclusion, socioeconomic status, region, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, menopause before inclusion, menopausal hormone therapy before inclusion, and adnexal surgery before inclusion were used in propensity matching.

### Identifying older adults with serious illness: transitioning from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^0957438a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Identifying the seriously ill population is integral to improving the value of health care. Efforts to identify this population using existing data are anchored to a list of severe medical conditions (SMCs) using diagnostic codes. Published approaches have used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, which has since been replaced by ICD-10.

Objectives

We translated SMCs from ICD-9 to ICD-10 using a refined code list. We aimed to test the hypothesis that people identified by ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes would have similar Medicare costs, health care utilization, and mortality.

Methods

Using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study linked to Medicare claims, we compared samples from periods using ICD-9 (2014) and ICD-10 (2016). We included participants with six-month fee-for-service Medicare data before their interview date who had an SMC identified within that period. We compared the groups' demographic, functional, and medical characteristics and followed up them for six months to compare outcomes.

Results

Among subjects in the 2016 (ICD-10) sample, 19.9% were hospitalized, 24.6% used the emergency department, 7.2% died, and average Medicare spending totaled $9902.04 over six months of follow-up. We observed no significant differences between the 2014 and 2016 samples (P > 0.05); both samples represent 18% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

Conclusion

Identifying the seriously ill population using currently available data requires using ICD-10 to define SMCs. Routine measurement of function, quality of life, and caregiver strain will further enhance the identification process and efficiently target palliative care services and appropriate quality measures.

### Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with anemia in pregnancy [^00974b7b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cases of anemia were identified using third-trimester hemoglobin levels of less than 11 g/dL and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Canada codes for anemia (D50–D64 and O99.0) (Appendix 1, available online at). Cases of anemia that were identified using the O99.0 diagnosis code for anemia were restricted to patients who received the code as a predelivery admission diagnosis (to distinguish anemia in pregnancy from anemia due to intrapartum–postpartum hemorrhage). Cases of anemia included pregnant women with 1) a third-trimester hemoglobin level of less than 11 g/dL or 2) a diagnosis of anemia made during the delivery admission but before delivery (referred to as predelivery admission diagnosis of anemia [Appendix 2, available online at]). The reference group (no anemia) included pregnant women who 1) did not have a predelivery admission diagnosis of anemia and 2) had a third-trimester hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL or greater. Anemia severity was categorized into four groups: mild (9–10.9 g/dL), moderate (7–8.9 g/dL), severe (less than 7 g/dL) and unspecified (predelivery admission diagnosis of anemia with third-trimester hemoglobin value missing or at 11 g/dL or greater).

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Data consistency in the english hospital episodes statistics database [^66e488b4]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Spells were removed from the datasets if:

The only ICD-10 code present in the record was R69 (unknown and unspecified causes of morbidity) or there was no valid entry in the diagnostic code field.
The spell was a regular attendance for renal or liver dialysis (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 code X40 or X43; or other regular attendance with ICD-10 code N185 (chronic renal failure) present. Regular day-attendances are usually for a specific procedure, and in most cases only that procedure and the related diagnosis is coded. Inclusion of these spells would unduly bias the dataset.
Patients were in age bands where the initial coding diagnoses were most likely miscoded: we removed patients with PDD younger than 40 years, and patients with DMPC younger than 18 years. The data extraction and cleaning procedure for each dataset is summarised in online supplemental figures S1–S3.

Identification of data inconsistencies

All data inconsistencies are reported at the spell level. A subsequent spell was considered consistent with the first spell if at least one of its constituent episodes mentioned the ICD-10 codes listed below for that condition:

Autism: F84.0, F84.1 or F84.5.

DMPC (representing the broader disease category of diabetes mellitus): E10-, E11-, E14-.

PDD (representing the broader disease category of dementia): F00-, F01-, F02-, F03-, F05.1, G30.1, G30.8, G309.

Further details on the definitions of these codes are summarised in online supplemental table S1. In the case of DMPC and PDD, a broader definition of the condition was used for subsequent spells than for the first spell. This was in recognition of the fact that details may not be recorded regarding the diabetes subtype or its presentation or the exact role of Parkinson's disease in the development of dementia.

Covariates (patient baseline characteristics) used to calculate the propensity score were those considered related to influenza severity. Patient age was categorized as following: 1 to < 2, ≥ 2 to < 5, ≥ 5 to < 18, ≥ 18 to < 65, and ≥ 65 years. The age categories were consistent with those most widely used. Comorbidities were diagnosed by ICD-10 code (a receipt corresponding to the ICD-10 code was required within the 6 months prior to the month of day 1 or, if the receipt occurred in the month of day 1, then on a day prior to day 1) or by the administration of disease-related medication (corresponding drug was administered within 180 days before day 1). Covariates included age, gender, influenza virus type (ICD-10 codes J09–J11), and the presence or absence of the following (disease diagnosis was defined by the administration of disease-related medication; corresponding drug was administered within 180 days before day 1 [excluding day 1]): steroid administration (World Health Organization [WHO] ATC code H02), dialysis (defined by the presence/absence of a dialysis-related medical care activity), respiratory coinfection (ICD-10 codes J00–J06, J2) excluding pneumonia, asthma (corresponding drug WHO-ATC code R03), diabetes (corresponding drug WHO-ATC code A10), chronic obstructive lung disease (ICD-10 codes J41–J44), cardiovascular disease (ICD-10 codes I20–I25, Q20–Q28), cerebrovascular disease (ICD-10 codes I60–I69), mental illness including dementia (ICD-10 codes F00–F99), neurological disease (ICD-10 codes G00–G99), anemia (ICD-10 codes D50–D59, D60–D64), immune deficiency (ICD-10 codes D80–D89), liver disease (ICD-10 codes K70–K77), and malignant tumor (ICD-10 codes D00–D09, C00–C97).

Methods

Study populations and definition of CD and IMRDs

The dataset was prepared and pseudonymized by the Swedish government agency of statistics. All participants were identified using their personal identity number, which is a 10-digit number given to all Swedish residents at birth or immigration and used as personal identifier in medical records. Medical data were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and consisted of an extract from inpatient and outpatient medical registers used for the investigation of chronic diseases with inflammatory components between 1964 and 2017. The dataset included individuals who were themselves affected or who had parents, children or siblings affected by CD or diabetes. The International classifications of disease (ICD) codes used to identify these patients were 579A, 648A, 648W, 286, 269, 250, 260, K90.0 and E10-E14 O24. In total, approximately 3.3 million individuals or 30% of the total Swedish population were included.

Following exclusion of participants with diabetes, six sex- and age-matched reference individuals (RI) were randomly selected for each CD participant. There were 56 240 CD participants with 306 942 matched RI (Table 2). We then excluded those CD patients that died the same year they were diagnosed with CD and for who CD diagnosis occurred after 75 years of age. We further excluded RI that died the same year or before as their matching CD individual acquired CD diagnosis. This resulted in a main CD cohort of 42 355 participants, each with six matched RI (Table 2). Finally, we assessed medical records of CD patients and RI for diagnoses of IMRDs (outcomes) using relevant ICD codes. ICD N00-N06 cover all glomerular diseases except the hereditary forms. The code N08 was also included since it is a code that is used for the glomerular disease when the main disease is classified with another code. N10-12 covers the tubulointerstitial nephritis and the inflammatory forms of this disease. We also added M31, M35 and M32, which are vasculitis, Sjögren's syndrome and SLE with inflammatory kidney involvement respectively. In addition, D69.0 (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) and D59 (Acquired hemolytic anemia) have inflammatory components involving the kidney and were therefore also included (Table 1).

### Changes in hydroxyurea use among youths enrolled in medicaid with sickle cell anemia after 2014 revision of clinical guidelines [^321475b8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Our study population consisted of youths ages 1 through 17 years with SCA who were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 1 continuous year within the study period. Continuous enrollment was required to ensure complete capture of claims; this approach reduced the likelihood of underestimating adherence rates due to missing data. For data through September 2015, youths with SCA were identified as those with at least 3 claims with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code related to SCA (282.61 or 282.62). Compared with the criterion standard of newborn screening records, this case definition identified youths with SCA with a sensitivity of 91.4% and specificity of 80.0%. From October 2015 through December 2018, after the US transitioned to mandatory reporting using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), youths with SCA were identified as those with at least 1 outpatient visit with an ICD-10 diagnosis code of D5700, D5701, D5702, or D571. This case definition identified youths with SCA with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 92% compared with newborn screening records. For each year of eligibility, we restricted our analyses to youths with no other forms of health insurance (eg, private insurance) to maximize the completeness of claims available. Records of youths were eligible to contribute data across multiple, nonsequential years.

Outcome: Hydroxyurea Use

To identify filled prescriptions for hydroxyurea, a list of National Drug Codes was generated and verified using the RxNorm tool, which contains all medications available on the US market and is maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The number of days' worth of supply of hydroxyurea was obtained for each filled prescription. Hydroxyurea use was characterized as the count of the annual days' supply. Annual days' supply was capped at 365 days.

### Low hemoglobin A (1c) in nondiabetic adults: an elevated risk state? [^ebf3216c]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Outcomes

ARIC Study investigators conduct continuous surveillance for all hospitalizations and deaths among participants via annual phone calls to participants or proxies, and detailed information on deaths is obtained from family members, coroner reports, or health department death certificates. Methods for the ascertainment of death and its causes in ARIC have been published previously. We classified deaths according to underlying cause, on the basis of coding from the ICD-9 and -10. We divided causes of death into the following major diagnosis categories defined by the ICD codes: 1) cancers (ICD-10 codes of C00-D48, ICD-9 codes of 140–239); 2) cardiovascular system (ICD-10 codes of I00–I99, ICD-9 codes of 390–459); 3) respiratory system (ICD-10 codes of J00–J99, ICD-9 codes of 460–519); 4) digestive system and liver (ICD-10 codes of K00–K93, ICD-9 codes of 520–579); and 5) genitourinary system and kidney (ICD-10 codes of N00–N99, ICD-9 codes of 580–629). We also identified incident liver disease hospitalizations from hospital discharge records with an ICD-9 code for liver disease using the following ICD-9 codes (listed anywhere in the hospital discharge record): 570.0–573.9.

### Time since last intravenous bisphosphonate and risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw in osteoporotic patients [^30060676]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Outcome assessment and definition of variables

The primary outcome of the study was the occurrence of MRONJ after tooth extraction. The follow-up duration (days) spanned from the index date to the earliest of the following events: the onset of MRONJ, patient death, or the end of the study period in December 2020. MRONJ was defined as at least one claim from inpatient admission or two or more claims from outpatient services of the 10th revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes M87.1 (osteonecrosis due to drugs) or K10.2 (inflammatory conditions of the jaw), including Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes of surgical interventions indicated for MRONJ treatment (Supplementary Table 6). The date of MRONJ diagnosis was established as the date of the first claim of an MRONJ diagnosis code.

Baseline demographic and socioeconomic data were collected as of the index date, with economic status classified according to NHIS records into medical aid beneficiaries and others based on insurance premium payment percentiles. Osteoporosis was defined using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes M80 (osteoporosis with pathological fracture), M81 (osteoporosis without pathological fracture), and M82 (osteoporosis in disease classified elsewhere). Tooth extraction procedures were identified by one or more claims of the specified procedure codes (Supplementary Table 7). Comorbid conditions were determined using ICD-10 codes, requiring a minimum of two diagnostic claims within the year prior to the index date to confirm a diagnosis: hypertension (I10, I15), diabetes mellitus (E10, E118, E119, E13, E149), dyslipidemia (E78), anemia (D46, D50–53, D55–64, D74), cardiovascular disease (I21, I22), and rheumatoid arthritis (M05). The Charlson comorbidity index was calculated based on established literature and stratified into three categories: ≤ 1, 2, and ≥ 3. Malignant neoplasms were defined using ICD-10 codes C00-C97, and individuals with the codes from the entire period 2002–2020 were excluded from the cohort.

The large number of new and more detailed external cause codes in ICD-10-CM allowed some records to be reassigned to other categories by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, a single ICD-10-CM code (X58, 'exposure to other specified factors') encompasses both the concept of 'other specified (unintentional injury), not elsewhere classifiable' and the concept of unspecified unintentional injury, whereas these concepts were represented by two different codes in ICD-9-CM (E928.8 and E928.9, respectively). As a result, some records categorised as 'other specified' by the ICD-9-CM matrix were categorised as 'unspecified' by the ICD-10-CM matrix. This finding is also consistent with the Kentucky data, which showed an immediate significant increase in 'unspecified' injury hospitalisation rates and a corresponding decrease in 'other specified' injury hospitalisation rates when ICD-10-CM was implemented.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

### Iron deficiency in 78 805 people admitted with heart failure across england: a retrospective cohort study [^4132e3f0]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

For the present study, codes utilised to define HF, ID or IDA were from the 10 th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). There are 71 ICD-10 codes specifying the clinical spectrum of anaemia. Clinical coders cannot assume the patient has ID or IDA unless so documented in the clinical record by the responsible clinician, and they are not permitted to independently interpret test results of any kind. As defined in the national clinical coding standards', iron deficiency' is an Essential Modifier which requires that IDA must be extant in the clinical record for the applicable codes to be assigned. If IDA is not formally recorded in a form interpretable by coders, the coding rules stipulate that the diagnosis must be coded as D649: anaemia, unspecified. For this study, the ICD-10 codes used to differentiate HF patients with or without ID or IDA are listed in table 1. Consistent with the coding convention described above, we also included ICD-10 code D649 within the IDA coding envelope, anticipating that a proportion of HF patients with IDA would be assigned that diagnostic code given the expected variation in documentation and resultant coding practice.

Table 1
ICD-10 codes used to identify patients with HF with or without ID/IDA

Study population

Iron deficiency was highlighted in the updated ESC HF guidelines of June 2016. Aware that this publication might engender transient changes in clinical practice and introduce random error, we elected to assess HES data for the financial year April 2015 through March 2016. This evaluation relates to all adult men and women admitted over that period for whom HF was coded as the primary discharge diagnosis, with possible recording of ID or IDA in any of 19 subsidiary diagnostic coding positions.

Mindful that in a higher proportion of younger people, HF would stem from cyanotic congenital heart disease with secondary polycythaemia, a distinctive disruption of iron homeostasis which might disproportionately confound assessment of ID or IDA compared with the general HF population, we chose to define adulthood as21 years. In accepting this compromise, data on only 41 patients aged 18 to 20 years admitted over the above period were excluded from study evaluation.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^7e59b1dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Since implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the US, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The widely used pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) system required a major update from version 2 (V2) to version 3 (V3) to capture the range of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Objective

To update the CCC V3 system, creating V3, with new, missing, or retired codes; to reconceptualize the system's use of technology codes; and to compare CCC V3 with V2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study examined US hospitalization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and the Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, for all patients aged 0 to 18 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024.

Exposures

The CCCs were identified in both data sources using the CCC V2 and V3 systems.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The (1) percentage of pediatric hospitalizations associated with a CCC, (2) numbers of CCC body-system categories per patient, and (3) explanatory power for hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared over time for V3 vs V2.

Results

Among 7 186 019 hospitalizations within PHIS, 54.3% patients were male, the median age was 4 years (IQR, 1–11 years), and 51.2% were aged 0 to 4 years). The CCC V2 identified 2 878 476 (40.1%) patients as having any CCC compared with 2 753 412 (38.3%) identified by V3. In addition, V2 identified 100 065 (1.4%) patients with transplant status compared with 146 683 (2.0%) by V3, and V2 identified 914 835 (12.7%) as having technology codes compared with 805 585 (11.2%) by V3. The 2 systems were similar in accounting for the number of CCC body-system categories per patient and in explaining variation in hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality. For both V2 and V3, 10.0% of the variance in hospital length of stay and 12.0% of the variance in in-hospital mortality was explained by the presence of a CCC. Similar patterns were observed when analyzing the 2 999 420 Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases' hospitalizations (52.3% of patients were male, the median age was 1 year [IQR, 0–12 years], and 62.0% were 0 to 4 years old), except that the percentages of identified CCCs were all lower: V2 identified 758 110 hospitalizations (25.3%) with any CCC compared with 718 100 (23.9%) identified by V3.

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest that, moving forward, V3 should be used to identify CCCs, and ongoing, frequent updates to V3, using a transparent, structured process, will enable V3 to accurately reflect the evolving spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Analysis 2: other chapters

Figure 2 and online supplemental table 2 show the most common chapters of ICD-10-CM codes that were in the primary diagnosis field when the drug overdose code was in any field position.

Figure 2
Analysis 2: top chapters of primary diagnosis for records with a drug overdose diagnosis code* in any field. (A) Discharge data from eight states' hospitalisation databases. Top four most common chapters are displayed. (B) Discharge data from five states' ED visit databases. Top three most common chapters are displayed. *Drug overdose diagnoses include ICD-10-CM code beginning with T36–T50 including unintentional, intentional harm, assault or undetermined intents, and initial, subsequent or missing encounter type.

Among hospitalisation records with a drug overdose code in any field position, on average, 72.5% (median = 71.1%; range = 68.1%–79.2%) of the primary diagnosis fields included codes from the 'S00–T88: Injury, Poisoning, and Other Consequences of External Causes' chapter. The second most common chapter of primary diagnosis for all but one state was 'F01–F99: Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders' chapter with an average of 12.0% (median = 12.7%; range = 3.8%–20.2%). State 5's second most common chapter was 'A00–B99: Certain Infectious and Parasitic Diseases' (4.1%). The third most common chapter varied: 'A00–B99' for states 1, 3 and 7; 'J00–J99: Diseases of the Respiratory System' for states 2, 6 and 8; 'F01–F99' for state 5 and 'I00–I99: Diseases of the Circulatory System' for state 4. All other chapters represented an average of 12.1% of primary diagnosis codes (median = 12.0%; range = 7.4%–17.1%).

### Hospitalizations in people with down syndrome across age groups: a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^0393f5ee]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Classification of primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses

We classified the primary causes of hospitalization and secondary diagnoses based on ICD-10 codes and classified these into six main disease groups as most relevant due to their prevalence and clinical importance: circulatory system (I00–I99), infectious diseases (A00–B99), digestive system (K00–K95), nervous system (G00–G99), neoplasms (C00–D49), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (M00–N99). Congenital malformations of the nervous system (Q00–Q07) were subclassified in the nervous system diseases, congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20–Q28) were subclassified in the circulatory system diseases, and congenital malformations of the digestive system (Q38–Q45) in the digestive system diseases, respectively. Furthermore, we classified the following infectious diseases classified elsewhere in ICD-10 as infectious diseases: respiratory infections (J00–J22), infectious arthropathies (M00–M02), inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (G00–G09). Secondary diagnoses are defined diseases diagnosed according to ICD-10 and include both acute and chronic diagnoses. Physiognomic or expected features of Down syndrome could not be assessed, since they are not part of the ICD-10 catalogue and are hence not documented in the nationwide dataset used in this study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the number of hospitalizations characterized by the incidence rate of hospitalizations per 100,000 population person-years, displayed across age groups and stratified by primary reasons for hospitalization. Secondary outcomes comprised (i) the number of diagnoses per hospitalized patient over lifetime, (ii) length of hospital stay (LOS) — defined as days spent in the hospital during the hospitalization, (iii) intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, (iv) mechanical ventilation rate, (v) length of ICU stay, (vi) all-cause in-hospital mortality, and (vii) 30-day all-cause hospital readmission.

### Consensus recommendations for optimizing electronic health records for nutrition care [^681631bc]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2020). High credibility.

Nutrition diagnosis and malnutrition coding — nutrition screening and assessment identify problems requiring treatment, and the Academy's Nutrition Care Process utilizes nutrition diagnoses to standardize nutrition diagnostic terminology; a nutrition diagnosis as defined by the Academy describes a specific nutrition problem that can be improved or resolved through nutrition interventions. The domains of nutrition diagnoses include "intake", "clinical", and "behavioral-environmental" as defined on-page, while a medical diagnosis is used by health care providers and coders as described in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Malnutrition is one nutrition clinical domain and medical diagnosis (ICD-10 code) that affects patient care as well as appropriate coding, billing, and reimbursement; patients can be diagnosed with malnutrition in any health care setting, organizations should adopt explicit malnutrition criteria that all health care professionals can apply consistently, and the Academy and ASPEN published recommended criteria for the identification of adult and pediatric malnutrition.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### Which ICD-9 codes were assigned for malignant mesothelioma in the mortality data in the United States before the ICD-10 was introduced? [^837f0403]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is rare and fatal; survival in most cases is only about one year. Mortality rate is, therefore, a good proxy measure of incidence rate. However, the specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for MM was not available until the Tenth Revision ICD (ICD-10). Little is known on which Ninth Revision ICD (ICD-9) codes were assigned for MM in the ICD-9 era.

Methods

We used a 1996 double-coded mortality file compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics to calculate the detection rate (DR) and confirmation rate (CR) of selected ICD-9 codes.

Results

Of 2386 decedents whose underlying cause of death was MM (ICD-10 code C45), the DR (deaths) of corresponding ICD-9 code was 57% (1365) for code 199 "malignant neoplasm without specification of site"; 19% (448) for code 162.9 "malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus, and lung, unspecified"; 13% (310) for code 163 "malignant neoplasm of pleura"; and 11% (271) for other codes. The CR (deaths) for the aforementioned three ICD-9 codes were 4.0% (1365/33,942), 0.3% (448/150,342), and 70.8% (310/438), respectively.

Conclusions

The three ICD-9 codes (199, 162.9, and 163) were the most commonly used codes for MM and composed nine-tenths of all MM deaths in the years before the ICD-10 was introduced. Using only ICD-9 code 163, the code most often used as the surrogate measure of MM in mortality studies in the ICD-9 era, capture may have been only 13% of all MM deaths in the US, and the estimated number of MM deaths missed in 1996 would be 2086.

### Child maltreatment surveillance following the ICD-10-CM transition, 2016–2018 [^172e6b35]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Child maltreatment is poorly documented in clinical data. The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) represents the first time that confirmed and suspected child maltreatment can be distinguished in medical coding. The utility of this distinction in practice remains unknown. This study aims to evaluate the application of these codes by patient demographic characteristics and injury type.

Methods

We conducted secondary data analysis of emergency department (ED) discharge records of children under 18 years with an ICD-10-CM code for confirmed (T74) or suspected (T76) child maltreatment. Child age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status and co-occurring injuries (S00-T88) were compared by maltreatment type (confirmed or suspected).

Results

From 2016 to 2018, child maltreatment was documented in 1650 unique ED visits, or 21.7 per 10000 child ED visits. Suspected maltreatment was documented most frequently (58%). Half of all maltreatment-related visits involved sexual abuse, most often in females and individuals of non-Hispanic white race. Physical abuse was coded in 36% of visits; injuries to the head were predominant. Non-Hispanic black children were more frequently documented with confirmed physical abuse than suspected (38.7% vs 23.7%, p < 0.01). The rate of co-occurring injuries documented with confirmed and suspected maltreatment differed by 30% (9.2 vs 12.5 per 10000 ED visits, respectively).

Conclusions

The ability to discriminate confirmed and suspected maltreatment may help mitigate clinical barriers to maltreatment surveillance associated with delayed diagnosis and subsequent intervention. Racial disparities in suspected and confirmed cases were identified which may indicate biased diagnostic behaviours in the ED.

### American Burn Association (ABA) burn care quality platform (BCQP) and large data set analysis considerations: a practical guide to investigating clinical questions in burns via large data sets [^f11c2149]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

Burn Care Quality Platform (BCQP) data elements and tiered reporting — The registry includes patients identified by ICD-10-CM codes, with burn centers submitting data on patients with codes T20-T32, T58, or T59, and centers that treat soft tissue infections, acute dermatologic conditions, or other skin integrity conditions may also submit associated data. Collection uses a three-tiered approach based on percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) injured: patients with < 10% TBSA burned must report basic data fields; patients with ≥ 10% to < 20% TBSA burned that underwent surgery, intubation, or expired have additional data fields related to surgical and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes required; and patients with ≥ 20% TBSA burned have further data fields required, constituting the largest reported data set. The tiered approach to data collection is important to note, as comparisons between tiers may be limited in accuracy by their respective reporting requirements. Finally, care directives are collected in the registry although not currently included as a BCQP data element, and the same is true for certain complications; the ABA Quality and Burn Registry Committee may update the BCQP accordingly in the future, and "missingness" in these fields should be accounted for in relevant studies.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f960c8ff]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), a coding system for all claims billing in the USA, went into effect on 1 October 2015, replacing the 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM). The coding transition brought with it benefits and challenges for drug overdose surveillance using hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge data. Increases in specificity of drug codes, the ability to distinguish initial encounters from subsequent encounters and sequelae, the inclusion of external cause information within drug overdose diagnosis codes and new concepts like 'underdosing' provide epidemiologists with richer data. However, these new features impact how injuries, including drug overdose, should be measured and interpreted using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data. Amid a continuing drug overdose epidemic in the USA, high-quality data and standardised surveillance methods are key for tracking and assessing drug overdose burden.

Several studies have characterised drug overdoses using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data, but have used varying selection criteria and indicator definitions to ascertain drug overdose cases. Specifically, these indicator definitions differ on the number of diagnosis fields searched, the encounter types included, the manner of injury/intent selected and the specific ICD-10-CM codes included. Some studies searched all diagnosis fields (ie, primary diagnosis field, secondary diagnosis and all other fields available)and others only included cases with a primary diagnosis of injury.

ICD-10-CM introduced the differentiation of encounter type, with codes for initial encounter, subsequent encounter and sequelae. Initial encounters represent active treatment of drug overdose, while subsequent encounters represent encounters taking place 'after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase'. Sequelae are new medical conditions or complications, occurring at any point after the acute phase of the injury, which are residual effects of the original injury. Some studies have included all encounters, while others have limited inclusion to initial encounter type.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### Modification effects of albuminuria on the association between kidney function and development of anemia in diabetes [^fdb653b0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Data Source and Study Population

We used a hospital-based claims database from JMDC Inc. in Tokyo, Japan. The details of this database have been described previously. Briefly, the JMDC database is a claims database sourced from hundreds of nationwide medical institutions, including clinics and various hospital systems, with data available on in-hospital care and outpatient services in Japan. Some hospitals in the JMDC database have also submitted detailed laboratory data, such as complete blood cell counts or biochemistry test results. We used information on laboratory data and clinical backgrounds available between April 2014 and February 2023. We analyzed data recorded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code-based diagnoses and drug specifications according to the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes.

Among those registered in the JMDC database, we included individuals satisfying all the following criteria: (1) age ≥ 20 years; (2) available serum creatinine and albuminuria levels and hemoglobin values obtained within the same month (for those with eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2); (3) diabetes (definite diagnosis by ICD-10 codes of E10–14, antidiabetes drug prescriptions, or available data for albuminuria, because albuminuria tests are reimbursed only for individuals with diabetes in Japan); and (4) an available look-back period of 6 months. The exclusion criteria were as follows: previous diagnosis of polycythemia, bone marrow-related diseases (D45, D46, D474, D475, D477, D50–64, D76, C81–C96), kidney replacement therapy performed in the previous 6 months, or missing information on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Graduate School of Medicine of The University of Tokyo (2018030NI). The necessity for obtaining informed consent was waived because of the anonymity of the data used in this study.

### Linking of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons distal radius fracture clinical practice guidelines to the international classification of functioning, disability, and health; international classification of diseases; and ICF core sets for hand conditions [^878bea85]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Background: American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) distal radius fracture (DRF) clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are readily available to clinicians, patients, and policymakers. International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) provides a framework for describing the impact of health conditions. The International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) is a classification system to classify health conditions as specific disease or disorders. The aim of this study is to analyze and describe the scope and focus of the AAOS DRF CPG using the ICF and ICD-10 as a basis for content analysis, and to compare the content of the CPG with the ICF hand core sets as the reference standard. Methods: Established linking rules were used by 2 independent raters to analyze the 29 recommendations of the AAOS DRF CPG. ICD-10 codes were assigned in the same process. Summary linkage statistics were used to describe the results for ICF and the hand core sets. Results: Among the 29 recommendations of the AAOS DRF CPG, 5 meaningful concepts were linked to the ICF codes. Of these, 5 codes appeared on the comprehensive ICF core set and only 3 codes appeared in the brief ICF core set, and 7 conditions were covered in ICD-10 codes. Conclusions: The AAOS DRF CPG focuses on surgical interventions and has minimal linkage to the constructs of the ICD-10 and ICF. It does not address activity or participation (disability), and is not well linked to key concepts relevant to hand conditions.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6cf86e4d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses.

Objective

To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (< 50, 50–64, and > 64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson χ2 tests were used to compare different subgroups.

Results

Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24–0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39–0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42–0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84–0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16–0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22–0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40–0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (χ2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (χ2 = 14.25; P = 0.003) but not for cough (χ2 = 5.13; P = 0.16).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^1fd75ae6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ICD-10-AM codes

In the ICD-10-AM, two codes may be used to record NAFLD/NASH: K75.8 'Other specified inflammatory liver diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)' and K76.0 'Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)'. NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis may also attract code K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver'. Obesity may be represented by ICD-10-AM codes under the E66 code block or by the chronic condition supplementary code U78.1. T2DM codes are contained in the E11 code block. Codes for other causes of CLD are outlined in table 1.

Table 1
ICD-10-AM codes for aetiologies of chronic liver disease

All ICD-10-AM codes were obtained from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection registry (QHAPDC) for every hospital encounter within the study cohort during a minimum 12-month follow-up period. For the current study, one encounter was randomly selected for each patient to be included in the audit sample. In a subset of patients who had ≥ 1 encounter with and ≥ 1 encounter without code K74.6, a second encounter was selected (one encounter containing code K74.6 and one encounter that did not contain code K74.6) to ensure the sample contained a representative number of patients with possible NAFLD.

In Australia, assignment of ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes is impacted by the Australian Coding Standards, which stipulate the condition must be either the chief reason for admission or required commencement, alteration or adjustment of therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures or increased clinical care and/or monitoring during the encounter. T2DM and HCV are exceptions to this assignment process, as these conditions are always coded when documented. In addition, a supplementary 'U' coding capability was introduced on 1 July 2015, to capture conditions (such as obesity) that contribute to a patient's health status during the admission, but do not otherwise meet the criteria for coding. The index pathway used by coders for coding of cirrhosis, CLD aetiology, obesity and T2DM remained consistent during the audited time period.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^fccce523]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of V2 classification scheme

We evaluated the CCC v2 system in three important ways on diverse data sources. First, we evaluated the CCC v2 system in terms of comparability between ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes using the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data for 1996, which is coded using both ICD-9 and ICD-10 schemes (more about the comparability ratio can be referred to:). We estimated the comparability ratio to determine whether any discrepancies between ICD-9 and ICD-10 were of significance (Z-test). The comparability refers to the ratio of the number of a CCC coded from ICD-9 to the number of the equivalent CCC coded from ICD-10. For any CCC category (CR c), the comparability ratio is calculated as CR c = D c ICD-10 /D c ICD-9, where D c ICD-10 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC v2 classified by ICD-10 and D c ICD-9 is the number of deaths attributable to CCC v2 classified by ICD-9. A comparability ratio of 1.00 indicates that the same number of deaths was assigned to the CCC category under both ICD-9 and ICD-10, denoting no net effect of ICD-10 on that particular CCC category. A comparability ratio less than 1.00 results from fewer deaths being classified to that CCC category under ICD-10, and a ratio greater than 1.00 indicates more deaths being classified under ICD-10.

Second, we examined the year-to-year stability of classification across the 1999 implementation of ICD-10 for the CDC Multiple Cause of Death data from 1991–2010. In this data source, coding of mortality causes transitioned from ICD-9 to ICD-10 in 1999. Therefore, we identified the CCC v2 categories with ICD-9 before 1999, and with ICD-10 beginning in 1999. The proportions of the ten CCC v2 categories for each year were estimated, and were then plotted against the year (1991–2010). We examined changes in the time trends of CCC v2 proportions, particularly at the 1999 time point.

Finally, we compared the proportions of CCC v2 categories to those of CCC v1 using the KID 2009 and the NEDS 2010 data. CCC categories were identified using the v1 and v2 systems based on ICD-9 codes, since these datasets do not yet contain ICD-10 codes. We assessed for differences between the resulting estimates and reported the absolute and relative change in percentages between the two systems for each of the datasets.

### Guidelines for adolescent depression in primary care (GLAD-PC): part I. practice preparation, identification, assessment, and initial management [^2ab03876]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients (evaluation), AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to assess for depressive symptoms based on the diagnostic criteria established in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10 (grade of evidence: 3; strength of recommendation: very strong) and use standardized depression tools to aid in the assessment (if not already used as part of the screening process).

### Causes of death and characteristics of decedents with viral hepatitis, United States, 2010 [^d4334970]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

METHODS

MCOD Data

This study used the public-use 2010 US MCOD data file, which contains information on all registered deaths occurring within the calendar year. State vital registration offices house these death certificates and, through a cooperative agreement, compile and share this information with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS then uses this information to generate the annual national multiple-cause mortality datasets.

The conditions on the cause of death section of the death certificate are reported by the decedent's physician, hospital residents, medical examiner, or coroner. The types of causes of death are the underlying, immediate, intermediate, and contributing causes of death that, together, are called the multiple causes of death. In MCOD files, these conditions are translated into International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes by highly skilled nosologists at NCHS using 2 schemes: entity axis and record axis. The entity axis represents a direct transcription of each disease entity listed on the cause of death section of the death certificate. The record axis represents a modified version of the entity axis in which repetitive conditions and inconsistencies are removed, related conditions are joined, and coding rules are followed. An example of how conditions are coded is as follows: a death certificate with cirrhosis of liver and alcoholism as causes of death would be directly transcribed to ICD-10 codes K74 (cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol) and F10 (alcohol dependence syndrome) as entity axis conditions. These conditions represent separate entities for the same death record. Searching for death records with ICD-10 code K74 would, on the surface, seem that such records had no mention of alcohol. Therefore, a preferable record axis code would be K70.3 (alcoholic cirrhosis of liver), which would encompass both ICD-10 codes K74 and F10.

### The invisible cost of pain management by the current international classification of diseases coding system: a study in a tertiary care inpatient setting [^787ec8be]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is applied worldwide for public health data collection among other use cases. However, the current version of the ICD (ICD-10), to which the reimbursement system is linked in many countries, does not represent chronic pain properly. This study aims to compare the ICD-10 with the ICD-11 in hospitalized patients in terms of specificity, clinical utility, and reimbursement for pain management. The medical records of hospitalized patients consulted for pain management at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand, were reviewed, and all pain-related diagnoses were coded into ICD-10 and ICD-11. The data of 397 patients showed unspecified pain was coded 78% in the ICD-10 and only 0.5% in the ICD-11 version. The difference gap in the proportion of unspecified pain between the 2 versions is wider than in the outpatient setting. The 3 most common codes for ICD-10 were other chronic pain, low back pain, and pain in limb. The 3 most common codes for ICD-11 were chronic cancer pain, chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain. As in many other countries, no pain-related ICD-10 codes were coded for routine reimbursement. The simulated reimbursement fee remained the same when adding 397 pain-related codings, even if the cost of pain management, such as cost of labor, existed. Compared with the ICD-10 version, the ICD-11 is more specific and makes pain diagnoses more visible. Thus, shifting from ICD-10 to ICD-11 has the potential to improve both the quality of care and the reimbursement for pain management.
