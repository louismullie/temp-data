## Question

elevated prolactin level in women

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing elevated prolactin in women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hyperprolactinemia and excluding physiologic causes. Then, I should verify the magnitude of elevation and its diagnostic implications. Next, I will review secondary causes, especially medications, hypothyroidism, and renal disease. After that, I need to check for assay artifacts like macroprolactin and the hook effect. Then, I will consider when to image and how to interpret MRI findings. Finally, I will outline management strategies, including dopamine agonists, surgery, and pregnancy-specific considerations, and close with long-term follow-up and special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude physiologic states that can raise prolactin, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a transient or expected elevation. I should confirm that the patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and I should avoid nipple stimulation, exercise, and stress for about 30 minutes before sampling, since these can acutely increase prolactin; a single morning measurement is sufficient, and dynamic testing is not recommended for diagnosis [^cabe8aed] [^11a5e3f9].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of elevation and what it implies. Mild elevations, roughly 20–100 ng/mL, are commonly drug-induced or due to systemic disease or microadenomas, whereas levels above about 250 ng/mL strongly suggest a prolactinoma, and levels above 500 ng/mL are essentially diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma. However, I should double-check for assay interference or the hook effect before concluding tumor size from a single value [^a9c447c4] [^709b0f53].

> I need to check for secondary causes next, and medications are the most frequent. Antipsychotics, especially risperidone and typical agents, metoclopramide, and some antidepressants can raise prolactin into the 25–200 ng/mL range. If feasible, I should consider holding the drug for 3 days and remeasuring, or substituting to a lower-risk agent, and if the medication cannot be stopped and the timing does not fit, I should obtain pituitary MRI to exclude a mass effect or stalk compression [^f03c868b] [^2031ab0c] [^a2885d63].

> Hold on, I should verify thyroid and renal function because primary hypothyroidism and chronic kidney disease are established non-tumor causes of hyperprolactinemia. Hypothyroidism increases TRH, which stimulates prolactin, and CKD impairs prolactin clearance; correcting these conditions normalizes prolactin, so I should obtain TSH and consider creatinine/eGFR in the initial workup [^52e1b14f] [^834ee2f3].

> Next, I should review assay artifacts that can mislead us. Macroprolactin is a high–molecular-weight, biologically inactive complex detected by many immunoassays; it accounts for a meaningful fraction of apparent hyperprolactinemia in asymptomatic patients, so I should screen for it with polyethylene glycol precipitation when the clinical picture is discordant or the patient is asymptomatic, to avoid unnecessary imaging and treatment [^28496c46] [^e5d726bb] [^71ab77cc].

> But wait, what if the prolactin is only modestly elevated and the pituitary MRI shows a large mass? I should consider the hook effect, where very high prolactin saturates two-site immunoassays and yields a falsely low readout. Serial dilution of the sample can unmask the true elevation and prevent underestimation of tumor activity [^5aef25bf] [^78906a77].

> I will now examine when to image, and I should confirm that persistent elevation warrants MRI even if the degree of prolactin rise is modest. The prevalence of a pituitary tumor is about 50–60% in women with hyperprolactinemia, and tumor size correlates poorly with prolactin level, so MRI is indicated for any confirmed, persistent elevation unless a clear non-tumor cause is found; in pregnancy, I should avoid routine MRI unless there are red flags like new headaches or visual symptoms [^d5837afd] [^55741b0a].

> Let me think about management once a prolactinoma is confirmed. Dopamine agonists are first-line to normalize prolactin, shrink tumor, and restore gonadal function. Cabergoline is generally preferred over bromocriptine due to higher efficacy and tolerability, with normalization rates around 70–90% and substantial tumor shrinkage in most patients. I should titrate to effect and monitor prolactin and symptoms, reserving surgery for resistance or intolerance [^f2403085] [^b4925a1c] [^d58fb85f].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy-specific guidance. Women planning pregnancy should use the lowest effective cabergoline dose to restore ovulation, then stop the agonist immediately when pregnancy is confirmed. Routine prolactin checks during pregnancy are not recommended because pregnancy itself drives a 10-fold rise in prolactin and does not track tumor activity. If a macroprolactinoma was present or symptoms of growth occur, I should monitor clinically and with visual fields, and consider MRI without gadolinium if there are severe headaches or visual changes [^4a54e804] [^1658be53] [^55741b0a].

> I should double-check the approach to asymptomatic microprolactinomas. Observation without dopamine agonist therapy is reasonable, and if hypogonadism is present, oral contraceptives can treat symptoms while monitoring; treatment is indicated for bothersome galactorrhea, hypogonadism, or fertility goals, and long-term data suggest many microadenomas remain stable or regress, supporting conservative management in selected patients [^2559487f] [^78ae720d].

> Next, I should review long-term follow-up and the possibility of withdrawal. After at least 2 years of therapy with normalized prolactin and no visible tumor, a cautious taper can be attempted with close monitoring, as recurrence risk is 26–69% and most recurrences occur in the first year. I will check prolactin every 3 months initially and then annually, with MRI if prolactin rises again [^d028bdcc].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I do not miss nuances. In drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, if the offending agent cannot be stopped, cautious use of a dopamine agonist may be considered in symptomatic patients, balancing psychiatric stability and bone health risks. In resistant or intolerant cases, transsphenoidal surgery is appropriate, and for malignant prolactinomas, temozolomide may be offered. In adolescents and children, the same principles apply, with dopamine agonists first-line and surgery for refractory cases [^91df36c2] [^33584be0] [^4159bfd9] [^dc4eaa68].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm true hyperprolactinemia and exclude physiologic causes, quantify the degree of elevation, systematically exclude medications and systemic disease, screen for macroprolactin and the hook effect when discordant, image when elevation persists, treat prolactinomas with dopamine agonists tailored to symptoms and fertility plans, manage pregnancy conservatively with symptom-triggered imaging, and maintain long-term surveillance with a plan for cautious withdrawal when stable [^cabe8aed] [^d5837afd] [^f2403085] [^55741b0a] [^d028bdcc].

Elevated prolactin in women is most often due to **pregnancy, lactation, or medications** (especially antipsychotics) [^6b7689ca], but persistent elevations (> 6 months) warrant evaluation for **pituitary prolactinomas** or other causes [^d5837afd]. Diagnosis relies on a **single morning prolactin measurement** [^cabe8aed], with repeat testing if mild, and macroprolactin screening if asymptomatic [^28496c46]; MRI is indicated for persistent elevation or symptoms [^d5837afd]. Management is cause-specific: stop offending drugs when possible [^f03c868b], treat hypothyroidism [^52e1b14f], and use dopamine agonists (cabergoline preferred) for prolactinomas [^f2403085]; surgery or radiotherapy is reserved for resistance or intolerance [^328817de]. Prognosis is excellent with treatment, and fertility is often restored [^6b7689ca].

---

## Physiological causes

Physiological states can **transiently elevate prolactin**; these are not pathological and do not require treatment:

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Prolactin rises 10-fold during pregnancy and remains elevated with breastfeeding, declining as nursing frequency drops [^1658be53] [^a8c76d4c].
- **Stress, sleep, and exercise**: Acute stress, sleep, and vigorous exercise can transiently increase prolactin [^709b0f53].
- **Nipple stimulation**: Mechanical stimulation can acutely raise prolactin [^11a5e3f9].

---

## Pathological causes

Persistent hyperprolactinemia reflects **underlying disease** and requires evaluation:

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Pituitary disorders | - Prolactinomas (micro- or macroadenomas) [^6b7689ca] <br/> - Non-prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors causing stalk effect [^e1b055cc] |
| Hypothalamic disorders | - Craniopharyngiomas <br/> - Infiltrative diseases (sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis) <br/> - Traumatic brain injury [^notfound] |
| Systemic diseases | - Primary hypothyroidism [^52e1b14f] <br/> - Chronic kidney disease [^52e1b14f] <br/> - Liver cirrhosis [^74552a49] <br/> - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [^709b0f53] |
| Medications | - Antipsychotics (risperidone, haloperidol) [^a2885d63] <br/> - Antidepressants (SSRIs, TCAs) [^f282e1d9] <br/> - Antiemetics (metoclopramide) [^d393a8c6] <br/> - Estrogen therapy [^2031ab0c] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Women with hyperprolactinemia may present with:

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, or infertility due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^6b7689ca].
- **Galactorrhea**: Milk production outside pregnancy or lactation [^11a5e3f9].
- **Hypogonadism**: Decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and osteoporosis from chronic estrogen deficiency [^898f433d].
- **Mass effect**: Headache and visual field defects with macroadenomas [^de5cb144].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential to **confirm true hyperprolactinemia** and identify the cause:

- **Confirm hyperprolactinemia**: Obtain a single morning sample without recent stress, exercise, or nipple stimulation; repeat if mildly elevated [^cabe8aed] [^11a5e3f9].
- **Exclude physiological causes**: Rule out pregnancy and recent lactation [^11a5e3f9].
- **Medication review**: Identify dopamine-antagonist drugs [^f282e1d9].
- **Assess secondary causes**: Check TSH for hypothyroidism and consider renal/hepatic disease [^52e1b14f].
- **Macroprolactin screening**: Use polyethylene glycol precipitation if asymptomatic or discordant [^28496c46] [^e5d726bb].
- **Pituitary imaging**: MRI is indicated for persistent elevation (> 6 months), symptoms, or prolactin > 200 ng/mL [^d5837afd].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific** and aims to normalize prolactin, restore gonadal function, and control tumor mass:

- **Remove underlying cause**: Stop offending medications, treat hypothyroidism, or address systemic disease [^52e1b14f].
- **Dopamine agonists**: First-line for prolactinomas; cabergoline is preferred for efficacy and tolerability [^f2403085] [^b4925a1c].
- **Surgery**: Transsphenoidal surgery for dopamine-agonist resistance or intolerance [^328817de].
- **Radiotherapy**: Reserved for refractory or recurrent cases [^328817de].
- **Pregnancy management**: Stop dopamine agonists when pregnancy is confirmed; monitor clinically and with visual fields if macroadenoma is present [^132d73fb] [^55741b0a].

---

## Prognosis and fertility outcomes

With appropriate treatment, **prognosis is excellent**: prolactin normalizes in 70–90% of prolactinomas, and fertility is restored in most women [^6b7689ca]. Pregnancy is generally safe after tumor shrinkage, though macroadenomas carry a small risk of expansion during pregnancy [^b6d01d1f].

---

Elevated prolactin in women spans physiological and pathological causes; **persistent hyperprolactinemia** warrants a focused evaluation and targeted therapy, with dopamine agonists as first-line for prolactinomas and excellent outcomes expected.

### Hyperprolactinemia and prolactinomas [^42b35ec4]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Any process interfering with dopamine synthesis, its transport to the pituitary gland, or its action at the level of lactotroph dopamine receptors can cause hyperprolactinemia. As described in this article, considering the complexity of prolactin regulation, many factors could cause hyperprolactinemia, and hyperprolactinemia can have clinical effects not only on the reproductive axis. Once any drug effects are excluded, prolactinomas are the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia. The most frequent symptom is hypogonadism in both genders. Medical and surgical therapies generally have excellent results, and most prolactinomas are well controlled or even cured in some cases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^28496c46]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia—macroprolactin screening in asymptomatic patients is suggested, as the guideline states we suggest assessing for macroprolactin with rating (2|⊕⊕○○). Retrospective analyses report that approximately 40% of patients with hyperprolactinemia have macroprolactinemia, and among those with macroprolactinemia, galactorrhea is present in 20%, oligo/amenorrhea in 45%, and pituitary adenomas in 20%. Macroprolactinemia should be suspected when typical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are absent; many commercial assays do not detect macroprolactin, and polyethylene glycol precipitation is an inexpensive way to detect macroprolactin in serum. Because macroprolactinemia is a common cause of hyperprolactinemia and clinical criteria do not reliably distinguish it from true hyperprolactinemia, routine screening for macroprolactin could eliminate unnecessary diagnostic testing and treatment, and screening for macroprolactin in investigation of asymptomatic hyperprolactinemic subjects is suggested.

### Galactorrhea: rapid evidence review-AAFP (...) [^11a5e3f9]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

3 Nipple discharge is the third most common breast-related medical issue after masses and pain. 4 Hyperprolactinemia may cause galactorrhea and is more common in women than men. The prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in women varies. 5, 6. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING A suggested approach to the evaluation of galactorrhea is summarized in Figure
1. 5, 11–14 The first step in the evaluation of premenopausal women is to rule out physiologic lactation by asking about breastfeeding and pregnancy within the past year and obtaining a urine pregnancy test. During a normal pregnancy, serum prolactin rises to 200 to 500 ng per mL. 17 Because exercise and nipple stimulation can elevate serum prolactin levels, they should be avoided for at least 30 minutes before the measurement.

17 According to one laboratory, prolactin levels are elevated if greater than 30 ng per mL in nonpregnant premenopausal females, greater than 20 ng per mL in postmenopausal women, and greater than 18 ng per mL in males. 26These values may differ depending on the laboratory. The degree of prolactin elevation can indicate possible etiologies, although there can be exceptions. A prolactin level less than 100 ng per mL is associated with drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, systemic disease, or microadenoma, whereas a prolactin level greater than 250 ng per mL is highly suggestive of a macroadenoma. 31 The dose of cabergoline or bromocriptine is gradually increased until the prolactin level normalizes. 13 Surveillance during treatment should include prolactin measurements every three months and a repeat MRI after one year. 13.

### Medical causes and consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A context for psychiatrists [^163ebedc]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinaemia is the commonest endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and can lead to both short-term sexual dysfunction and galactorrhoea, and long-term loss of bone mineral density. Prolactin is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland under the influence of dopamine, which exerts a tonic inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion. Physiological regulators of prolactin secretion include many different types of 'stress' and sleep. Disruption of the normal control of prolactin secretion results in hyperprolactinaemia from pathological and pharmacological causes. The administration of antipsychotic medication is responsible for the high prevalence of hyperprolactinaemia in people with severe mental illness. Physiological hyperprolactinaemia, such as pregnancy and lactation, should be distinguished from pathological causes to prevent unnecessary investigation and treatment. The causes, consequences and management of hyperprolactinaemia are discussed in this article.

### Approach to the patient with persistent hyperprolactinemia and negative sellar imaging [^d9b07f43]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of menstrual disturbances affecting young women. There is a diversity of causes, from physiological, such as pregnancy, to pharmacological and pathological, such as hypothyroidism. Renal and hepatic failure, intercostal nerve stimulation by trauma or surgery, prolactinomas, other tumors in the hypothalamus-pituitary region, as well as macroprolactinemia can also be considered. Identifying the correct cause is important to establish the correct treatment. Should all these causes be ruled out and pituitary imaging revealed as negative, idiopathic hyperprolactinemia is therefore diagnosed. In symptomatic patients, treatment with dopaminergic agonists is indicated. As for the asymptomatic hyperprolactinemic individuals, macroprolactinemia should be screened, and once it is detected, there is no need for pituitary imaging study or for dopaminergic agonist use.

### Drugs and prolactin [^f282e1d9]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

Medications commonly cause hyperprolactinemia and their use must be differentiated from pathologic causes. The most common medications to cause hyperprolactinemia are the antipsychotic agents, although some of the newer atypical antipsychotics do not do so. Other medications causing hyperprolactinemia include antidepressants, antihypertensive agents, and drugs which increase bowel motility. Often, the medication-induced hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, causing galactorrhea, menstrual disturbance, and erectile dysfunction. In the individual patient, it is important differentiate hyperprolactinemia due to a medication from a structural lesion in the hypothalamic-pituitary area. This can be done by stopping the medication temporarily to determine if the prolactin (PRL) levels return to normal, switching to another medication in the same class which does not cause hyperprolactinemia (in consultation with the patient's physician and/or psychiatrist), or by performing an MRI or CT scan. If the hyperprolactinemia is symptomatic, management strategies include switching to an alternative medication which does not cause hyperprolactinemia, using estrogen/testosterone replacement, or cautiously adding a dopamine agonist.

### Prolactin-secreting adenomas: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^6b7689ca]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperprolactinemia: 
- Definition: Hyperprolactinemia is defined as a sustained elevation of serum prolactin above normal levels, typically > 25 ng/mL in nonpregnant women and > 20 ng/mL in men. It may occur physiologically (pregnancy, stress), pharmacologically (dopamine antagonists), or pathologically (pituitary adenomas, hypothyroidism, CKD).
- Pathophysiology: Prolactin secretion is normally inhibited by hypothalamic dopamine acting on D2 receptors in lactotrophs. Loss of this inhibition, whether from drugs, lesions, or stalk compression, results in excess prolactin release. Estrogens and thyrotropin-releasing hormone enhance secretion. Chronically high prolactin suppresses GnRH, reducing LH and FSH, which causes hypogonadism, infertility, and sexual dysfunction.
- Epidemiology: Hyperprolactinemia is one of the most common endocrine disorders. It affects about 15-20% of women evaluated for infertility. Drug-induced causes are most frequent, followed by prolactinomas, hypothyroidism, and renal disease. Prolactinomas account for 30-40% of pituitary tumors, with microadenomas more common in women and macroadenomas in men.
- Risk factors: Major risk factors include use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, and antiemetics. Physiological triggers include pregnancy, lactation, nipple stimulation, and stress. Pathologic causes include pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney or liver disease, chest wall injury, and epilepsy. Genetic syndromes such as MEN1 and familial isolated pituitary adenoma also increase risk.
- Disease course: The clinical course depends on etiology. Physiologic and drug-induced forms are often mild and reversible, whereas adenomas produce persistent elevations. Women present with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, or low libido. Men present with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility, or rarely gynecomastia. Large tumors may cause headache, visual loss, or hypopituitarism.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Prognosis is excellent when the cause is identified and treated. Drug- or disease-related hyperprolactinemia resolves after withdrawal or correction of the underlying condition. Dopamine agonists such as cabergoline normalize prolactin in 70-90% of prolactinoma cases and restore fertility in most women. Surgery is reserved for resistant or compressive tumors. Untreated cases may lead to chronic hypogonadism, infertility, and bone loss.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia—serum prolactin testing during pregnancy advises: In pregnant patients with prolactinomas, we recommend against performing serum prolactin measurements during pregnancy. During pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase 10-fold, reaching levels of 150 to 300 μg/liter by term, and the pituitary gland increases in volume more than 2-fold; after dopamine agonists are discontinued at the start of pregnancy, serum prolactin levels increase and subsequent increases do not accurately reflect changes in tumor growth or activity, prolactin may not increase during pregnancy in all patients with prolactinomas, and postpartum levels are frequently lower than before conception with hyperprolactinemia sometimes resolving entirely after pregnancy.

### Abstract (...) [^32f0cbfb]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Normal Lactation and Prolactin Before lactation, the female breast is primed by estrogen, progesterone, growth hormone, insulin, thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids. These hormones aid in the growth of the ductal system and lobules, and in the development of secretory characteristics of the alveoli. Ironically, high levels of estrogen and progesterone also inhibit lactation at receptor sites in the breast tissue. The precipitous drop in the levels of these hormones after delivery, in the presence of an elevated prolactin level, facilitates lactation. Prolactin levels cycle and are highest during sleep. Levels in normal nonpregnant women range from 1 to 20 ng per mL, depending on the laboratory, and may increase to as high as 300 ng per mL during pregnancy. Pituitary prolactinomas are associated with elevated prolactin levels.

Clinical signs and symptoms include headache, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, defects in peripheral vision, hirsutism, acne, and hypogonadism presenting as decreased libido, decreased fertility or decreased bone density. The prognosis for patients with these tumors is excellent. Most pituitary prolactinomas regress or remain stable for many years. Nonpituitary malignancies, such as bronchogenic carcinoma, renal adenocarcinoma and Hodgkin's and T-cell lymphomas, may also release prolactin. The dosages of estrogen and progesterone used in postmenopausal hormonal replacement therapy are generally not high enough to cause galactorrhea. However, some patients with hyperprolactinemia may not have symptoms if they are estrogen deficient. Once hormone replacement therapy is started, the breast tissue is primed, and galactorrhea may then occur.

HISTORY The history should include the duration of galactorrhea, previous pregnancies, and other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, such as infertility, decreased libido, acne, hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. The patient's menstrual history is important because hyperprolactinemia, through its effect on gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may cause low estrogen levels. As a result, the patient may have amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, as well as decreased bone density.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and hyperprolactinemia [^3a09ed59]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Analysis of the evidence linking PCOS and hyperprolactinemia suggests that these conditions have independent origins. Elevated prolactin serum levels are documented in the early studies of patients with polycystic ovaries. However, recent investigators using serial serum sampling have excluded transient elevations of prolactin and have shown a less frequent association of these disorders. Treatment of individuals with both PCOS and hyperprolactinemia is distinct from the management of the individual with only one of these conditions. Upon evaluating the therapeutic alternatives for dysfunctional uterine bleeding and hirsutism in these patients, the effect of exogenous estrogen and progesterone on the secretion of prolactin must be considered. The addition of a dopamine agonist (e.g., bromocriptine or cabergoline) to a regimen of clomiphene citrate must also be considered as ovulation induction options for these women. Finally, future discoveries about the relationship between PCOS and hyperprolactinemia will require a better understanding of how the hypothalamus regulates the pituitary secretion of LH and prolactin.

Hyperprolactinemia evaluation—hyperprolactinemia may be associated with decreased E2 concentrations and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, yet only approximately 1/3 of women with hyperprolactinemia will have galactorrhea; prolactin concentrations are higher in women with amenorrhea than in those with oligomenorrhea, and prolactin levels <15–20 ng/mL in most clinical laboratories will exclude hyperprolactinemia, whereas mildly elevated values (20–40 ng/mL) should be repeated and confirmed, and if they remain mildly elevated (and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic), a macroprolactin level should be considered; macroprolactin has been reported to have a prevalence as high as nearly 20% of patients diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia, is biologically inactive compared with the predominant circulating form of prolactin (80%–95%) called monomeric prolactin, and macroprolactinemia is confirmed by having the laboratory pretreat the patient’s serum with polyethylene glycol to precipitate macroprolactin; establishing this diagnosis avoids unnecessary and costly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging.

### Hyperprolactinemia [^8db18638]. Pituitary (2008). Low credibility.

In several respects prolactin is unique among anterior pituitary hormones. The primary regulation of prolactin secretion is mediated through hypothalamic inhibition, and the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia can be established without the use of stimulation or suppression tests. Documenting the presence of hyperprolactinemia is not difficult-the challenge is in identifying the cause of the hormone hypersecretion. With immunoradiometric assays falsely low levels of prolactin are occasionally seen in patients with macroadenomas and very high serum prolactin (the hook effect). Macroprolactin should be suspected when a patient with hyperprolactinemia does not present with typical clinical symptoms, and all hyperprolactinemic sera should be screened for macroprolactin. With prolactinomas, prolactin levels generally parallel tumor size. Prolactin secreting macroadenomas are typically associated with levels that exceed 250 microg/l and may exceed 1,000 microg/l. Large non-functioning adenomas also lead to hyperprolactinemia but levels virtually never exceed 94 microg/l. Acquired and isolated prolactin deficiency is rare.

Before evaluation of galactorrhea, it is important to understand the mechanism underlying breast development and lactation. Breast development is affected by a number of factors, including estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin levels. PRL is essential for morphologic breast development and lactation, which includes synthesis of milk and maintenance of milk production. The pituitary lactotroph and PRL secretion are also directly stimulated by estrogen, 6 which explains why pregnant women have elevated PRL levels. 7 Following delivery, PRL increases with each suckling episode, stimulating milk production. Over the next several weeks, as breastfeeding gradually shifts from being on demand to a schedule, the increases in PRL levels become less. By two to three months, PRL levels no longer increase with each suckling episode, but milk production continues. Following cessation of breastfeeding, milk production rapidly decreases so that it is usually gone after a month.

8, 9 In the neonatal period, the high level of estrogen from the mother can cause transient galactorrhea in the newborn, called witch's milk. 10, 11 During pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, women can have galactorrhea with PRL levels up to 200 mcg per L. 10 Other causes of transient hyperprolactinemia are vigorous exercise and physical stress.

7, 27 Despite the well-known stimulatory effect of estrogen on lactotrophs, the effect of oral contraceptives and hormone therapy, especially low-dose estrogen, on hyperprolactinemia and prolactinoma is not well established. If the patient's PRL level is not elevated, then no further evaluation is needed. 33.

We suggest that clinicians not treat asymptomatic patients harboring microprolactinomas with dopamine agonists, and we suggest treatment with a dopamine agonist or oral contraceptives for patients with microadenomas who have amenorrhea. We suggest that with careful clinical and biochemical follow-up, therapy may be tapered and perhaps discontinued after at least 2 yr in patients who no longer have elevated serum prolactin and have no visible tumor remnant on MRI.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology disease state clinical review: clinical relevance of macroprolactin in the absence or presence of true hyperprolactinemia [^e5d726bb]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the current literature regarding the prevalence of macroprolactin (macroPRL) in hyperprolactinemic patients and determine recommendations for testing.

Methods

An electronic United States National Library of Medicine PubMed search (through October, 2014) was conducted for search term "macroprolactin." Only English-language articles were considered.

Results

MacroPRL is an under-recognized cause of elevated prolactin (PRL) and is present in approximately 4% to 40% of hyperprolactinemic patients depending on the referral population. Clinical findings which could be due to hyperprolactinemia are the impetus for testing for PRL. Because of this there is significant overlap in the clinical presentation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia and those with macroPRL, differentiation cannot always be made on the basis of symptoms. A lack of recognition of the presence of macroPRL can lead to unnecessary laboratory investigations, imaging, and pharmacologic or surgical treatment.

Conclusion

Until there is a commercially available PRL assay that is not subject to interference by macroPRL, clinicians should consider the possibility of macroPRL, especially if the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and/or response to therapy reveal inconsistencies.

Galactorrhea and menstrual irregularity are typical manifestations of hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of a demonstrable pituitary mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the condition is usually labeled as idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and presumed to be due to microadenomas too small to visualize.

### Approach to the patient with dopamine-resistant microprolactinoma [^4a590d4f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Prolactinoma is a significant cause of hyperprolactinemia and the most common type of pituitary tumor. Women of fertile age are most commonly affected, and the clinical picture is characterized by galactorrhea, oligo-amenorrhea and, infertility. In microprolactinomas, which represent more than 60% of cases in women before menopause, there is usually no concern about the mass effect. Therefore, the management can be expectant if there are no symptoms or in a patient in the post-menopause period; oral contraceptive in the presence of hypogonadism and no desire for pregnancy; dopamine agonist (DA) in the presence of bothersome galactorrhea, hypogonadism, and the desire for fertility; and neurosurgery in selected non-invasive cases. Resistance to dopamine agonists occurs in less than 10% of cases. Although the reduction in D2R expression is considered the primary cause of DA resistance, the underlying mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. The main concern in resistant cases is the risk of symptomatic tumor growth during assisted reproduction techniques and pregnancy. Other conditions in which hyperprolactinemia could be implicated, such as metabolic parameters, osteoporosis, and breast cancer risk are also discussed. Understanding the mechanisms of DA resistance can lead to the opening of new treatment strategies.

### Current guidelines and their recommendations for prolactin monitoring in psychosis [^88cd7ec1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the use of second-generation antipsychotics and physical health monitoring have begun to include information on hyperprolactinemia, and generally recommend that patients should be queried about possible symptoms related to elevated prolactin: menstrual abnormalities, galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. However, with only two exceptions, none of the guidelines suggest performing baseline plasma prolactin levels. Although several of the guidelines mention the potential for hyperprolactinemia to be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, there is no guidance how to monitor for this. Product labeling for the different antipsychotics inform the clinician about potential risks but are not helpful with precise monitoring recommendations. The internal medicine literature contains important information regarding the pulsatile secretion of prolactin, differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, and plasma levels of prolactin usually associated with certain symptoms that would be useful for the prescriber of antipsychotics to be aware of. The prudent clinician should consider obtaining a baseline plasma prolactin level and at least one follow-up measurement when starting any patient on a new antipsychotic. This will help guide clinical decisions about antipsychotic dosage, switching antipsychotic medications, or considering ancillary treatments to protect bone mass. These decisions would be within the context of considering other adverse events as well as the overall effectiveness of the antipsychotic medication being used.

Hyperprolactinemia—cabergoline outcomes in micro- and macroprolactinomas show high biochemical and clinical response rates. In a placebo-controlled study, cabergoline treatment (0.125–1.0 mg twice weekly) for 12–24 months in prolactin-secreting microadenomas resulted in normalization of prolactin levels in 95% of patients and restored menses in 82% of women with amenorrhea. In a prospective study of 26 treatment-naive macroprolactinomas, normoprolactinemia was achieved within 6 months in 81% of patients receiving 0.25–2 mg cabergoline weekly, and 92% exhibited significant tumor shrinkage. In a retrospective series of 455 patients, cabergoline normalized prolactin levels in 92% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or a microprolactinoma and in 77% of 181 patients with macroadenomas; additionally, 80% of men with macroadenomas or microadenomas experience prolactin normalization after dopamine agonist therapy.

Macroprolactin

Macroprolactin is an isoform of PRL with greater molecular weight and reduced biological activity. In patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia, the assessment for macroprolactin can help endocrinologists in preventing incorrect diagnoses leading to inappropriate treatments, and in discriminating true hyperprolactinemia requiring a proper therapeutic approach. Although more than 80% of circulating PRL is monomeric (23 kDa), serum can also contain a covalently bound dimer and a larger polymeric form, known as “big prolactin” (50 kDa) and “big-big prolactin” (150 kDa), respectively. In most cases, macroprolactin is composed of a complex formed by an IgG and a monomeric PRL ; consequent hyperprolactinemia results from low renal PRL clearance and reduced dopaminergic tone. Macroprolactin is quite common; it has been reported to cause hyperprolactinemia in approximately 20% of cases. Therefore, screening for macroprolactin with the use of polyethylene glycol should be routinely offered, before investigating alternative causes of PRL excess, in patients with asymptomatic hyperprolactinemia. The overall prevalence of signs and symptoms of PRL excess in patients with macroprolactin is generally lower than that observed in patients with monomeric hyperprolactinemia. Indeed, menstrual disturbances, including both oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea, as well as galactorrhea and a combination of menstrual disturbances and galactorrhea have been reported to occur in 24%, 13%, and 2% of patients with macroprolactin, respectively, presumably resulting from concomitant disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome and pituitary tumors, compared with 26%, 29%, and 34% of those with monomeric hyperprolactinemia, respectively. This suggests a potential overlap in the clinical presentation mainly in terms of infertility features. Of note, more than 60% of patients with macroprolactin reported no peculiar signs and symptoms of PRL excess. The coexistence of macroprolactin and pituitary incidentalomas may result in a further diagnostic pitfall leading to an improper diagnosis of prolactinoma, but the absence of a clinical syndrome specifically ascribable to hyperprolactinemia may assist in a better diagnostic definition.

Pituitary tumor–related and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia—patients with large nonfunctioning pituitary tumors, craniopharyngiomas, or granulomatous infiltration of the hypothalamus can develop hyperprolactinemia because of pituitary stalk compression or dopaminergic neuronal damage, and in 226 patients with histologically confirmed nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas, a prolactin level greater than 94 µg/liter reliably distinguished between prolactinomas and nonfunctioning adenomas; dopamine agonist therapy lowers prolactin levels and improves symptoms in patients with stalk compression, but it is not definitive therapy for a nonfunctioning adenoma; fewer than 10% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia ultimately are found to harbor a microadenoma and progression from a microadenoma to a macroadenoma is rare; spontaneous normalization of prolactin levels occurs in approximately 30% of patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; and it is important to determine whether patients with hyperprolactinemia also have acromegaly because prolactin is elevated in up to 50% of patients with GH-secreting tumors.

### Approach to the patient with prolactinoma [^bb033737]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Accounting for approximately 40% of the entire cohort of pituitary tumors, prolactinomas are the most common hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas; infertility and gonadal and sexual dysfunction are the most relevant clinical features in both sexes. Prolactinomas are the main pathologic cause of PRL excess, albeit several different conditions may induce the increase in PRL levels and should be excluded before a diagnosis is made (Table 1). In clinical practice, microprolactinomas (<10 mm in size) are more frequent than macroprolactinomas (>10 mm in size) and occur more frequently in women, in whom the disturbances of the menstrual cycle and infertility generally prompt rapid medical advice leading to an early diagnosis, as in clinical case 2. Conversely, in men the rate of macroprolactinomas with visual field defects, as in clinical case 3, and hypopituitarism at first presentation is higher and the mean age at diagnosis is at least 10 years delayed compared with women, given that the most important components of the clinical syndrome are the decrease of libido and/or erectile dysfunction, as in clinical case 3.

Table 1. 
Causes of hyperprolactinemia

In adults, the estimated prevalence of prolactinomas accounts for 60 to 100 per million population. According to a recent review study including different patient series, where standardized incidence rates for pituitary tumors range from 4 to 7.39 cases per 100,000/y, prolactinomas have been reported to represent 40% to 66% of all pituitary tumors. Patient age has been shown to differently influence incidence rates in men and women: indeed, between the age of 20 and 50 years, the ratio between women and men is estimated to be 10:1, whereas after the sixth decade of life, the frequency of prolactinomas is similar in both sexes. This difference may reflect that in young females the clinical syndrome resulting from hypogonadism (infertility and oligo-amenorrhea) prompts early medical advice, particularly in case of pregnancy desire. Conversely, in elderly patients, including postmenopausal women, and in men, the diagnosis is due predominantly to mass effects from large tumors. In pediatric and adolescent ages, prolactinomas, albeit rare, represent about 50% of all pituitary tumors.

### Disorders of prolactin secretion [^7adc9431]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Prolactinomas are a common cause of reproductive/sexual dysfunction. Once other causes of hyperprolactinemia have been excluded with a careful history and physical examination, routine chemistries, and an assay for TSH, MR imaging, or CT will delineate the size and extent of the tumor. Medical therapy is the initial treatment of choice. When infertility is the primary indication for treatment, bromocriptine use has an extensive safety record and is preferred. For other indications, cabergoline seems to be more efficacious and better tolerated. Transsphenoidal surgery remains an option, especially for patients with microadenomas, when medical therapy is ineffective.

### Diagnosis and management of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas: a pituitary society international consensus statement [^328817de]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

This Consensus Statement from an international, multidisciplinary workshop sponsored by the Pituitary Society offers evidence-based graded consensus recommendations and key summary points for clinical practice on the diagnosis and management of prolactinomas. Epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical presentation of disordered pituitary hormone secretion, assessment of hyperprolactinaemia and biochemical evaluation, optimal use of imaging strategies and disease-related complications are addressed. In-depth discussions present the latest evidence on treatment of prolactinoma, including efficacy, adverse effects and options for withdrawal of dopamine agonist therapy, as well as indications for surgery, preoperative medical therapy and radiation therapy. Management of prolactinoma in special situations is discussed, including cystic lesions, mixed growth hormone-secreting and prolactin-secreting adenomas and giant and aggressive prolactinomas. Furthermore, considerations for pregnancy and fertility are outlined, as well as management of prolactinomas in children and adolescents, patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder, postmenopausal women, transgender individuals and patients with chronic kidney disease. The workshop concluded that, although treatment resistance is rare, there is a need for additional therapeutic options to address clinical challenges in treating these patients and a need to facilitate international registries to enable risk stratification and optimization of therapeutic strategies.

Endocrine Society—diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia (Recommendation 1.1) states to establish the diagnosis, “we recommend a single measurement of serum prolactin; a level above the upper limit of normal confirms the diagnosis as long as the serum sample was obtained without excessive venipuncture stress,” and “we recommend against dynamic testing of prolactin secretion” (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Evidence notes assay-specific normal values are generally lower than 25 μg/liter and that when the World Health Organization Standard 84/500 is used, 1 μg/liter is equivalent to 21.2 mIU/liter; dynamic tests using TRH, L-dopa, nomifensine, and domperidone are not superior to a single sample. A prolactin level greater than 500 μg/liter is diagnostic of a macroprolactinoma, whereas levels greater than 250 μg/liter usually indicate a prolactinoma but selected drugs can cause elevations above 200 μg/liter without evidence of adenoma. Remarks add that the initial determination should avoid excessive venipuncture stress and can be drawn at any time of the day.

### Prolactinomas and menopause: any changes in management? [^1ba501eb]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatment goals in prolactinomas are to correct hypogonadism, restore fertility and control tumor mass in case of macroadenomas. According to current guidelines, medical treatment of asymptomatic postmenopausal women is not indicated. The purpose of this study was to review the current literature pertaining to biological behavior of prolactinomas during menopause, likelihood of successful dopamine agonist withdrawal during this period and possible prolactin-mediated increased morbidity that could modify current management.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search including papers published until July 2019 was conducted using PubMed and Medline databases.

Results

Women with prolactinomas entering menopause have a higher chance of prolactin normalization of treatment compared with women in their reproductive years. Although most prolactin secreting adenomas diagnosed during menopause are large, they respond well to dopamine agonist treatment. Data directly linking hyperprolactinemia with an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity are inconsistent. There is no data indicating that correction of hyperprolactinemia improves clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients bearing microadenomas.

Conclusion

There is no evidence that justifies changing current recommendations to withhold medical treatment of microprolactinomas in asymptomatic post-menopausal women. Macroprolactinoma patients should be treated according to standard clinical practice.

### Surgery as first-line treatment for prolactinoma? Discussion of the literature and results of a consecutive series of surgically treated patients [^74552a49]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prolactinomas or lactotrophic adenomas are the most common pituitary adenomas, accounting for approximately 50% of all pituitary adenomas and are characterized by excessive prolactin secretion (levels > 150–200 ng/mL). These high levels of prolactin can cause decreased fertility, decreased energy and libido, and galactorrhea in men and premenopausal women. Headache is a common symptom in men, pre- and postmenopausal women while hypogonadism is seen exclusively in men, and oligo- or amenorrhea is seen exclusively in premenopausal women. Visual field deficits and visual acuity deficits can result from compression of the optic nerves and chiasm.

While elevated prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia) can also be caused by other pituitary adenomas through increased intrasellar pressure, known as the stalk effect, or by hypothalamic dysfunction, medications, or various conditions such as pregnancy, liver cirrhosis, and hypothyroidism, these levels are usually well below the prolactin serum levels caused by prolactinomas.

### Technology insight: measuring prolactin in clinical samples [^829af00b]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Measurement of prolactin is one of the most commonly undertaken hormonal investigations in evaluating patients with reproductive disorders. Hyperprolactinemia is found in up to 17% of such cases. Diagnostic evaluation of hyperprolactinemia is difficult but is facilitated by a logical approach where a thorough patient history is obtained, secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia are excluded, and the limitations of current prolactin assays are appreciated. Once hyperprolactinemia has been confirmed, attempts to establish the underlying cause can start. Given current workloads, laboratories rely on automated platforms to measure prolactin, most of which employ two-site immunoassay sandwich methods. Although generally robust and reliable, such immunoassays are susceptible to interference, and good collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory helps to minimize problems. A major challenge facing laboratories is correct differentiation of patients with true hyperprolactinemia from those with macroprolactinemia. Macroprolactin is a high-molecular-mass, biologically inactive form of prolactin that is detected to varying degrees by all prolactin immunoassays. Conservative estimates suggest that the presence of macroprolactin leads to misdiagnosis in as many as 10% of all reported instances of biochemical hyperprolactinemia. In the absence of specific testing, macroprolactin represents a diagnostic pitfall that results in the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of large numbers of patients.

Endocrine Society hyperprolactinemia—dopamine agonist management during pregnancy states: We recommend that women with prolactinomas be instructed to discontinue dopamine agonist therapy as soon as they discover that they are pregnant. In selected patients with macroadenomas who become pregnant on dopaminergic therapy and who have not had prior surgery or radiation therapy, it may be prudent to continue dopaminergic therapy throughout the pregnancy, especially if the tumor is invasive or is abutting the optic chiasm. Because bromocriptine crosses the placenta, fetal drug exposure is likely for up to the first 4 wk after conception, and in the more than 6000 pregnancies achieved and reported in women taking bromocriptine the incidence of congenital malformations or abortions was not increased with long-term follow-up of up to 9 yr showing no harmful effects; in a prospective cabergoline study of 85 women, of whom 80 achieved pregnancy, the drug was withdrawn at 5 wk gestation, all babies were born healthy, and no mothers experienced tumor expansion. Quinagolide has a poor safety profile in the relatively small number of pregnancies and should not be prescribed to women desirous of becoming pregnant.

1 INTRODUCTION

The magnitude of prolactin elevation guides the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia and typically parallels tumour diameter in prolactinomas. Severe hyperprolactinaemia (>10‐fold normal) is almost always due to macroprolactinomas (diameter > 1 cm), pregnancy or breastfeeding. 1 Causes of mild hyperprolactinaemia (<4‐fold normal) include microprolactinomas (diameter < 1 cm), dopamine interference (eg stalk compression/transection in the “stalk effect,” antipsychotics, metoclopramide), primary hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome and prolactin co‐secretion in acromegaly or Cushing's disease. Mild, transient increases in prolactin may follow stress, pain, coitus, exercise, sleep, meals or seizures. 2, 3, 4, 5

### Dopamine agonists for preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and recurrent miscarriage history [^f90ec1c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperprolactinemia is the presence of abnormally high circulating levels of prolactin. Idopathic hyperprolactinemia is the term used when no cause of prolactin hypersecretion can be identified and it is causally related to the development of miscarriage in pregnant women, especially women who have a history of recurrent miscarriage. A possible mechanism is that high levels of prolactin affect the function of the ovaries, resulting in a luteal phase defect and miscarriage. A dopamine agonist is a compound with high efficacy in lowering prolactin levels and restoring gonadal function.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of different types of dopamine agonists in preventing future miscarriage given to women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and a history of recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in all languages examining the effect of dopamine agonists on preventing future miscarriage. Women who had idiopathic hyperprolactinemia with a history of recurrent miscarriages were eligible for inclusion in this review. Comparisons planned included: dopamine agonists alone versus placebo/no treatment; and dopamine agonists combined with other therapy versus other therapy alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed a single trial for inclusion, evaluated trial quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

One study (recruiting 48 women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia) met our inclusion criteria; 46 women (42 pregnancies - 4/46 women did not conceive during the study period) were included in the analysis. The study compared the use of a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine, 2.5 mg to 5.0 mg/day until the end of the ninth week of gestation) versus a no-treatment control. The study was judged as being at a high risk of bias. It was not possible to carry out meta-analysis due to insufficient data.The study reported both of this review's primary outcomes of miscarriage and live birth. Results from this single study suggest that, compared to no treatment, oral bromocriptine was effective in preventing future miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.87, 46 participants (low-quality evidence)) in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. There was no clear difference with regard to the other primary outcome of live births (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.42, 46 participants (very low-quality evidence)).There was no difference with regard to this review's secondary outcome of conception (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.09, 46 participants (very low-quality evidence)) between the group of women who received dopamine (21 out of 24 women conceived) and women in the no-treatment group (21 out of 22 women conceived). The included study only reported the serum prolactin levels in pregnant women and therefore the data could not be analyzed in this review. No other secondary outcomes relevant to this review were reported; adverse effects for women (nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo, fatigue, hypotension, arrhythmia, and psychotic symptoms) and infants (birth defects, low birthweight, and developmental disabilities) were not reported.We downgraded the quality of the evidence for risk of bias in the one trial contributing outcome data (no description of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and possible reporting bias) and for imprecision (all effect estimates were based on small sample size, miscarriage was based on few events, and the 95% CIs of live birth and conception cross the line of no effect).

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is insufficient evidence (from a single randomized trial with a small sample size, and judged to be at high risk of bias) to evaluate the effectiveness of dopamine agonists for preventing future miscarriage in women with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia and a history of recurrent miscarriage. We assessed outcomes using GRADE methodology. Miscarriage was assessed as low quality due to risk of bias concerns in the one trial contributing data (no description of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and possible reporting bias) and to imprecision (effect estimates were based on small sample size and few events). Live births and conception were assessed as of very low quality due to the same risk of bias concerns in study design and to imprecision (with a wide 95% CI consistent with either benefit or harm), and a small sample size. There were no data relating to adverse effects of the intervention for either the mother or her baby.Futher high-quality research in this area is warranted. There is a need for well-designed, larger RCTs to confirm and extend the findings of the trial reviewed here. Many questions remain unanswered. Some important considerations for future research include, the need for well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes, and for those studies to consider important outcomes (including adverse effects for both the mother and her baby). Future studies should examine the effectiveness and safety of various dopamine agonists including bromocriptine, cabergoline and quinagolide.

### Incidence and clinical significance of elevated macroprolactin levels in patients with hyperprolactinemia [^fb7198b1]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with macroprolactinemia in an endocrinology practice at a tertiary care military medical center in the United States.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of 40 patients who had been referred for evaluation of hyper-prolactinemia between June 2003 and August 2004 in whom macroprolactin had been measured.

Results

Of the 40 patients, 18 (9 men and 9 women) (45%) had an elevated macroprolactin level (mean, 75% of the total prolactin). The demographic characteristics of these patients were similar to those of patients with elevated monomeric prolactin. Most of the men with macro-prolactinemia (78%) had erectile dysfunction as the presenting complaint, whereas the most frequent symptom in women was menstrual irregularities (56%). Fifty percent of patients had no identifiable cause for their presenting complaint other than macroprolactinemia. Of the 18 patients with macroprolactinemia, 16 underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary, of whom 56% had normal findings. Of the patients with abnormal MRI findings, 57% had a microadenoma, and 43% had either an atrophic anterior lobe or a prominent hypophysis. No significant relationship was detected between MRI findings or symptoms and the presence of elevated macroprolactin levels. Approximately 40% of patients in the macroprolactin group were treated with a dopamine agonist, 28% of whom had normalization of the total prolactin level.

Conclusion

Although macroprolactin is commonly found in patients with hyperprolactinemia, neither symptoms nor MRI findings are useful in predicting its presence. Patients with macroprolactinemia often have symptoms similar to those in patients with elevation in monomeric prolactin. The clinical significance of macro-prolactinemia remains uncertain.

Putative effects of Hyperprolactinemia on QOL

Classically confined to the initiation and maintenance of lactation in females, it has become clear that prolactin exerts a range of metabolic, immunologic, and reproductive effects.

Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is the most common presenting symptom of hyperprolactinemia, manifesting as oligo-amenorrhoea in pre-menopausal women and impotence in males. Hyperprolactinemia reduces the frequency and amplitude of GnRH secretory pulses, and downstream reductions in LH secretory pulses lead to gonadal suppression. Prolactin exerts its inhibitory tone on kisspeptin neurons, which are the key regulators of pulsatile GnRH neuronal secretion. This is evidenced by the restoration of gonadal function with kisspeptin supplementation in patients with hyperprolactinemia induced hypogonadism. In women, hypogonadism is associated with sexual dysfunction, fatigue, sleep and mood disturbances with corresponding reductions in QOL. In men, the negative effects of hypogonadism on vitality, body composition, mood, cognitive function and sexual health lead to similarly reduced QOL.

Hyperprolactinemia may affect QOL independent of its effects on gonadal hormones. Hyperprolactinaemia is associated with anxiety, somatization, hostility and depression. This may be augmented by the emotional impact of their diagnosis and variable adoption of the sick role. The mechanisms of direct effects of prolactin on the brain and behaviour are unclear. Prolactin influences hypothalamic appetite regulation by inducing leptin resistance, inducing hyperphagia and weight gain. Hypogonadism, particularly androgen deficiency, may further contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome in hyperprolactinemia. It also acts peripherally, inducing insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Dissatisfaction with body composition and appearance may affect mood and QOL. Hyperprolactinemia also has direct effects on bone metabolism, increasing resorption and inhibiting new bone formation, predisposing to fractures, which may affect physical functioning, pain, and QOL.

Headache has a significant impact on QOL in patients with pituitary adenoma, and prolactinoma may be particularly cephalalgogenic. Headaches occur in both micro- and macro-prolactinomas, may be induced by TRH (a potent prolactin secretagogue), and improve with DA therapy, implicating prolactin in headache pathogenesis.

### Pharmacological hyperprolactinaemia [^d393a8c6]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A middle-aged woman was referred under the 2-week urgent brain cancer initiative following the finding of a raised serum prolactin level. The patient had been taking metoclopramide on a daily basis to aid her symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. The raised prolactin level had led to oligomenorrhoea prompting her general practitioner (GP) to check pituitary hormone levels.Metoclopramide is a potent dopamine antagonist and dopamine acts as the physiological inhibitor of prolactin synthesis. Thus, the dopamine antagonism led to elevated prolactin level and the symptom of oligomenorrhoea.Following curtailment of the metoclopramide, the prolactin level normalised very quickly and the patient was reassured.Consideration should be given to non-pathological causes of hyperprolactinaemia, including physiological states such as pregnancy and concurrent medication.

In selected patients with macroadenomas who become pregnant on dopaminergic therapy and have not had prior surgery or radiation therapy, it may be prudent to continue dopaminergic therapy throughout pregnancy, especially if the tumor is invasive or abutting the optic chiasm. In pregnant patients with prolactinomas, we recommend against performing serum prolactin measurements during pregnancy.

### Clinical and diagnostic characteristics of hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence [^dc4eaa68]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia, which is a rare endocrine disorder encountered in pediatric patient care. Epidemiological and clinical information about hyperprolactinemia in childhood and adolescence is limited. Clinical signs of hyperprolactinemia are very heterogeneous. In girls, disturbances in menstrual function and galactorrhea may be seen, whereas in boys, headache, visual disturbances, delayed pubertal development and hypogonadism are often present. Owing to the ease of ordering a serum prolactin measurement, an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to the management of this endocrine disorder is required. Before a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is made, drug use, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and parasellar tumors should be excluded. The main objectives of treatment are normalization of prolactin level, adenoma shrinkage, and recovery from clinical signs related to hyperprolactinemia. In patients with microadenoma, invasive or non-invasive macroadenoma, and even in patients with visual field defects, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment. Surgical treatment is indicated in patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to medical treatment or who have persistent neurological signs. Radiotherapy should be considered as a supportive treatment for patients in whom surgery fails or medical response is not achieved.

Figure 1. 
Clinical characteristics of patients with prolactinoma. Pituitary tumor per se exerts several compressive mass effects, leading to headache, visual field defects, and hypopituitarism. Prolactin excess results in both sexes in weight gain, delayed pubertal development, hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, and osteopenia or osteoporosis. Other signs and symptoms are gender-related and include in men libido reduction, erectile dysfunction, and gynecomastia; in women, oligo-amenorrhea, vaginal dryness, irritability, and depression.

Besides the hypogonadism-related signs and symptoms, PRL excess may exert extragonadal systemic effects. Given the direct actions of PRL and dopaminergic tone on pancreatic β cells and adipocytes, hyperprolactinemia may also induce an unfavorable metabolic profile. Increased food intake and weight gain in patients with prolactinomas have been shown to promote altered body composition, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and adverse lipid profile, leading to visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome in approximately one-third of patients. However, the potential impact of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism on body composition and metabolic profile cannot be excluded. Indeed, men with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the lower quartiles have been found to have a 2-fold higher risk of developing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Similarly, in 40 premenopausal hyperprolactinemic women, in whom FSH, LH, and estrogen levels were in the normal range, but their pulsatile secretion was decreased because of hyperprolactinemia, PRL excess has been found associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance independently of body weight and leptin and adiponectin levels. The altered body composition, characterized by increased fat mass and reduced lean mass, together with concomitant secondary hypogonadism, contribute to decreased bone density from the direct and indirect (ie, hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism) effects of prolactin on bone physiology, early alterations in bone turnover markers, reduced bone mass mainly in trabecular rather than cortical bone, delayed peak bone mass acquisition, and high risk of vertebral fractures in both sexes.
