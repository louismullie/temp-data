## Question

A rancher is currently the owner of record of a parcel of land designated as "A. " It is the higher of two neighboring properties on a mountain. A farmer is the owner of parcel "B," which is situated lower than "A" on the mountainside. In 2000, the rancher, who owned both parcels of land, constructed a private drainage system. This system consisted of an underground pipeline that extended across both parcels of land. Sewage from parcel "A" drained through the system to a municipal sewer, which was located at the bottom of the mountain. In 2005, the rancher sold parcel "B" to the farmer. The deed to the farmer did not contain any mention of the rancher's drainage system. Located on each of the parcels are large ranch-style homes occupied by the respective owners. Lately, the sewage drain has begun to emit an unpleasant odor across parcel "B. " As a result, the farmer sued the rancher in trespass praying for damages caused by the drainage system. Judgment should be for

Answer Choices:
A. the rancher, because the deed to the farmer did not contain any covenants restricting the rancher's use of the land.
B. the rancher, because the farmer's proper cause of action would be for nuisance, rather than trespass.
C. the farmer, because the drainage system was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages as a matter of law.
D. the farmer, because the rancher did not have the right to improve his own land in a manner that caused harm to another.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which party should win a lawsuit where a farmer sued a rancher for trespass because sewage odors from an underground pipeline on the farmer's land are causing harm, and what the correct legal reasoning is among the given options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the facts fit the tort of trespass to land. Then, I should verify whether nuisance is the more appropriate claim and why. Next, I will examine the implications of the deed not mentioning the pipeline. After that, I need to consider the merits of the alternative options. Finally, I will synthesize the best answer and confirm it aligns with core property law principles.

> Let me first confirm the elements of trespass. Trespass to land generally requires a physical invasion of the plaintiff's property by the defendant or something set in motion by the defendant, and the invasion must be intentional or at least the direct result of the defendant's act. Odors alone, without a tangible entry, typically do not satisfy the physical invasion requirement for trespass, even if they cause harm, so I need to be careful not to conflate offensive intangible intrusions with trespassory invasions [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the more appropriate tort here. Nuisance applies when there is a substantial and unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of land, which can be caused by intangible things like odors, noise, or vibrations; sewage odors emanating onto neighboring property are a classic example of a private nuisance claim rather than trespass, so the farmer's proper cause of action should be nuisance, not trespass [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should review the deed point before concluding. The fact that the deed did not mention the pipeline affects whether there was disclosure or a recorded easement, but it does not convert an odor-based interference into a trespass; it may influence remedies or notice defenses in a nuisance analysis, but it does not change the classification of the tort, so Option A's reliance on the deed alone to defeat trespass is a red herring for the legal theory question [^notfound].

> I will now examine the alternative options. Option C asserts the drainage system was the proximate cause of damages as a matter of law; while causation may exist, that still does not establish the element of physical invasion required for trespass, so the conclusion that trespass lies is legally flawed even if causation is present. Option D states the rancher had no right to improve in a way that harmed another; that sounds like a nuisance rationale about unreasonable interference, again underscoring that nuisance, not trespass, is the proper claim. Thus, both C and D point to the same bottom line: the right cause of action is nuisance, not trespass [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize. The correct answer is that judgment should be for the rancher because the farmer pleaded the wrong cause of action; the facts support nuisance, not trespass, so the rancher should prevail on the legal theory as pleaded, even though the farmer may have a viable nuisance claim if pursued separately. Therefore, the best choice is Option B [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **B. the rancher, because the farmer's proper cause of action would be for nuisance, rather than trespass**. Trespass requires a **physical invasion** of land, whereas odors are intangible and constitute a **nuisance** claim. The farmer cannot recover under trespass, but may have a valid nuisance claim if the odor is substantial and unreasonable.

---

## Legal distinction between trespass and nuisance

Trespass is an **unauthorized physical invasion** of another's land, such as walking on it or placing objects on it. Nuisance is an **unreasonable interference** with the use and enjoyment of land, often involving intangible elements like odors, noise, or smoke. The key difference is that trespass requires a **physical entry**, while nuisance does not.

---

## Application to the facts

Here, the rancher's drainage system is underground and does not physically invade the farmer's land; the complaint is about **odors**, which are intangible. Therefore, the farmer's claim does not meet the **physical invasion** requirement for trespass and should be dismissed. The appropriate claim would be **nuisance**, which addresses unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of land.

---

## Conclusion

The rancher should win because the farmer's claim is for **trespass**, which does not apply to intangible odors. The farmer may pursue a separate **nuisance** claim if the odor is substantial and unreasonable.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

Domain 8: Ethical and legal aspects of care—Guideline 8.4 treatment and ongoing decision-making states that, within the limits of applicable laws and standards, person-centered goals form the basis for the plan of care and decisions related to providing, forgoing, and discontinuing treatments. The patient’s plan of care reflects ethical principles and the assessment of treatment preferences and is accurately documented to reflect the patient’s previously stated goals in terms of providing, forgoing, and discontinuing care. The IDT ensures that existing treatments align with the patient’s goals and the standard practices of care, and the team actively works to prevent medically non-beneficial care. When a family member or surrogate decision-maker seeks to override the patient’s documented treatment decisions, the patient’s preferences are reviewed, and ethics consultation is sought if needed, and failure to honor patient preferences is considered an ethical concern and is addressed by the IDT. Children receive open and honest, developmentally appropriate information about their serious illness and treatment options and are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making according to their wishes, age, and developmental capacity, and when the child’s wishes differ from those of the adult decision-maker, staff is available to assist the child and family work towards a resolution, prioritizing fidelity to the patient. When parents or legal decision-makers express a strong preference for non-disclosure of a poor prognosis to a seriously ill child or adolescent, the IDT assesses family motivations and values regarding truth-telling practices and preferences; while it is sometimes ethically permissible to defer to family values regarding nondisclosure of prognosis, clinicians work collaboratively with the family to meet the child or adolescent’s individual needs while respecting the parent or decision-makers’ expectations and boundaries. All treatments provided are directed at the relief of suffering, in accordance with the doctrine of double effect, and the IDT educates the patient and family regarding the cost of care and financial burdens associated with treatment options. In cases where the wishes of the patient or surrogate conflict with the clinicians caring for the patient, processes are in place to honor clinician conscientious objection in a manner that ensures patients are never abandoned and continue to receive quality, safe care, and when treatments are forgone or discontinued, the IDT ensures appropriate symptom control at all times, as aligned with the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.

### Land tenure drives Brazil's deforestation rates across socio-environmental contexts [^1d11b625]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Consistency of findings across scales

We formally synthesized the estimated scale-specific effects via two complementary approaches. First, we assessed the consistency of the direction of the effects by calculating percentages of scale-specific models with, respectively, significant deforestation-increasing, significant deforestation-decreasing, and no significant effects (Supplementary Tables S4 – 6). Second, we assessed how consistent the relative rankings of alternative tenure regimes were in terms of the magnitudes of their effects vis-a-vis a given counterfactual, by calculating percentages of scales at which each tenure regime showed higher/lower effects than all others (Supplementary Tables S4 – 6). Note that, although relative ranks were inherently indirect comparisons of alternative tenure regimes to differently-matched counterfactuals, both the undesignated/untitled counterfactual and the private counterfactuals were weighted to represent the covariate distribution in the entire population of parcels at each respective scale. This weighting thus effectively provided a standardized counterfactual for effect estimations across all tenure-regime comparisons at a given scale.

Census Bureau claimed that rural areas covered 97% of the nation’s land area but contained 19. 3% of the population. Rural areas are served by a variety of healthcare facilities and practitioners who face specific challenges associated with workforce and other resource shortages, socioeconomic factors that add to resident health risks, and public health issues that often compete with the ability to plan for and respond to natural and human-caused events. Tribal communities have the autonomy to respond to and manage incidents that occur on their lands. These resources highlight guidance for and lessons learned by healthcare practitioners who serve rural and tribal communities.

|-|-|
|Saline loading tests|- Administer 2 L of normal saline IV over 4 hours with the patient in a recumbent position (contraindicated in the presence of severe, uncontrolled hypertension or congestive HF). Define PA as a postinfusion plasma aldosterone > 280 pmol/L. Recognize that PA is unlikely if < 140 pmol/L, and values in between are considered indeterminate<br>- Administer > 200 mmol/day of oral sodium (equivalent to > 5 g/day of sodium, > 12 g/day of sodium chloride, or > 2 teaspoon/day of salt) for 3 days. Define PA as a 24-hour urinary aldosterone > 33 nmol/day (measured from the morning of day 3 to the morning of day 4). Recognize that PA is unlikely if < 28 nmol/day|
|Plasma aldosterone to plasma renin ratio|- > 1400 pmol/L/ng/mL/hour (or > 270 pmol/L/ng/L), with a plasma aldosterone > 440 pmol/L|
|Captopril suppression test|- Administer 25-50 mg captopril PO after the patient has been sitting or standing for 1 hour. Measure renin and plasma aldosterone levels while seated at time 0 and 1-2 hours after ingestion. Recognize that PA is unlikely if plasma aldosterone is suppressed by > 30% after captopril ingestion. Recognize that plasma aldosterone level remains elevated in PA, while renin level remains suppressed.|

### Common errors in statistics and methods [^9bb4c344]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Quality assessment of studies

Quality assessment should be performed as a quantitative assessment of the studies included in meta-analysis using a set of predefined safeguards to reduce the risks of bias. Quality assessment tools should be used as they were designed to be used, with any user-defined adaptations clearly justified. Any issues of quality or potential risk of bias, which may impact on meta-analysis results, should be briefly described. Quality ‘scores’ should only be assigned according to scoring systems defined by the tool, and user-defined scores (ie, user-defined thresholds for high, moderate, low quality, etc) should be avoided. While a study with the best ‘score’ does not ensure high quality, it ensures that predefined safeguards to reduce risks of bias are met.

Lack of grading the certainty of the main results in meta-analysis

It is common practice to accept the combined results of a meta-analysis at face value and categorise them as significant or non-significant without considering the importance of the findings as well as potential biases and flaws in both the individual studies included in the meta-analysis and the overall estimation (particularly heterogeneity, publication bias or small study bias). To be valuable in clinical practice, the results of a meta-analysis should also be evaluated for certainty and quality using methods such as GRADE.

Incomplete info to understand/reproduce the search results in meta-analysis

This is another illustration of the general rule that your paper should have enough information to allow other researchers to duplicate what you did. Some authors simply list terms (and not search engines or detailed search structure) or do not give dates.

Instructions for Use

NGENLA (en’ JEN-lah)

(somatrogon-ghla)

24 mg

injection, for subcutaneous use

Read this Instructions for Use before you start using NGENLA and each time you get a new refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

Important information about your NGENLA pen:

The NGENLA pen for injection is a single-patient-use, disposable (throw away) prefilled pen containing 24 mg of medicine. You can give more than 1 dose from the pen.
NGENLA can be given by a patient, caregiver or healthcare provider. Do not try to inject NGENLA yourself until you are shown the right way to give the injections and read and understand the Instructions for Use. If your healthcare provider decides that you or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of NGENLA at home, you should receive training on the right way to prepare and inject NGENLA. It is important that you read, understand, and follow these instructions so that you inject NGENLA the right way.
It is important to talk to your healthcare provider to be sure you understand your NGENLA dosing instructions. To help you remember when to inject NGENLA, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Call your healthcare provider if you or your caregiver have any questions about the right way to inject NGENLA, or call the helpline on 1-800-645-1280.
Do not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give other people a serious infection or get a serious infection from them.
Each turn (click) of the dose knob dials 0.2 mg of medicine. You can give from 0.2 mg to 12 mg in a single injection. If your dose is more than 12 mg, you will need to give more than 1 injection.
A new pen may contain slightly more than 24 mg of medicine, this is normal.
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This will decrease the risk of contamination, infection, leakage of medicine, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose.
Do not shake your pen. Shaking can damage the medicine.
The pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the assistance of a person trained in the proper use of the product.
