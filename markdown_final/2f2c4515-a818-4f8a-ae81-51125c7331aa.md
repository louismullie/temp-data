## Question

Outpatient antibiotic treatment for diverticulitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about outpatient antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the clinical scenario and confirm whether this is uncomplicated disease suitable for outpatient care. Then, I should verify the modern evidence on whether antibiotics are necessary or if observation is sufficient. Next, I will review guideline positions to ensure alignment. After that, I need to identify the patient characteristics that warrant antibiotics despite uncomplicated disease. Then, I will select appropriate outpatient regimens and durations when antibiotics are indicated, and finally, I should outline monitoring, follow-up, and what to do if the patient deteriorates, making sure each step is supported by evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification and site-of-care decision, because everything hinges on distinguishing uncomplicated from complicated disease and ensuring the patient is safe for outpatient management. Uncomplicated diverticulitis typically lacks abscess, free perforation, obstruction, fistula, or generalized peritonitis, and in immunocompetent patients without systemic inflammatory response, outpatient care is appropriate when they can tolerate oral intake, have reliable social support, and can follow up within about a week, with CT reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or red flags for complications [^114qHWQV] [^111wzpRm] [^113ARzkh] [^117Sp1JW].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on antibiotics versus no antibiotics in uncomplicated disease, because I need to ensure I am not over-treating. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show no clear benefit of routine antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis in terms of complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, or long-term outcomes, and some analyses suggest antibiotics may slightly reduce short-term treatment failure at the expense of adverse effects and resistance, so the net clinical effect is uncertain and often favors no antibiotics in carefully selected patients [^112KL8LJ] [^112Ayosi] [^116GwU69] [^113yJpdz] [^115Nkrks].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should align with guidelines to avoid bias. The ACP recommends managing most immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis as outpatients and suggests initial management without antibiotics in select patients, while the AGA advises selective rather than routine antibiotic use in mild uncomplicated disease, and WSES recommends no antibiotics for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without systemic inflammation, with ESCP similarly advising against routine antibiotics in uncomplicated cases [^114qHWQV] [^111FL5kK] [^114tSnhe] [^115dhejn] [^116RUjhs].

> I need to check which patient characteristics still warrant antibiotics despite uncomplicated disease, because I should not overgeneralize. Indications include immunocompromise, significant comorbidity or frailty, refractory symptoms or vomiting, marked inflammatory markers such as CRP greater than 140 mg/L or WBC greater than 15 × 10⁹/L, or CT features like a small fluid collection or longer segment of inflammation, and in these scenarios, antibiotics are reasonable given higher risk of deterioration or atypical courses [^111j4YAs] [^116zGVHW] [^112GtzkF].

> Next, I should review outpatient antibiotic choices and durations when antibiotics are indicated, and I must ensure gram-negative and anaerobic coverage. Common outpatient regimens include amoxicillin-clavulanate monotherapy or a fluoroquinolone combined with metronidazole, with typical durations of 4 to 7 days, and I should preferentially avoid fluoroquinolones when alternatives exist due to harms; observational comparative data suggest amoxicillin-clavulanate has similar diverticulitis outcomes but lower C. difficile risk than metronidazole plus fluoroquinolone, supporting stewardship-aligned selection [^117HwJxb] [^1154ntz4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "all patients with abscess need antibiotics", but I should double-check size thresholds and source control. For small abscesses under about 4–5 cm, a trial of antibiotics alone is reasonable, whereas larger abscesses generally warrant percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics, and in diffuse peritonitis or failure of nonoperative care, surgical source control is indicated; these are complicated presentations and not the focus of uncomplicated outpatient care, but I need to ensure I escalate appropriately if such features emerge [^113sdRcJ] [^115zz6Pg] [^1174RrCX].

> I will now examine monitoring and follow-up, because safe non-antibiotic strategies require reliable reassessment. Patients should have clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, vomiting, or new systemic symptoms, and a planned check-in within 7 days is prudent; outpatient failure rates are low when patients are appropriately selected, and early switch to oral therapy when hospitalized shortens length of stay without compromising outcomes, reinforcing that close follow-up and timely escalation are key safety nets [^114q159b] [^116C1Z8J] [^1144uKss].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or frail; does the same no-antibiotic approach apply? Evidence for omitting antibiotics is strongest in younger, healthier cohorts, so in older or frail adults I should maintain a lower threshold for antibiotics and inpatient observation, especially with systemic symptoms, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow-up, while still individualizing decisions and ensuring close follow-up given limited direct evidence in this subgroup [^116UsKxZ] [^113bj8KR].

> Let me reconsider the overall outpatient algorithm to ensure internal consistency. For immunocompetent patients with mild, uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis who can take oral intake, have social support, and can follow up, observation with supportive care and no routine antibiotics is appropriate. If risk features are present or the patient prefers antibiotics, prescribe a short course with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage, preferably amoxicillin-clavulanate to minimize fluoroquinolone harms, and arrange reassessment within a week with a low threshold to obtain CT and escalate if the clinical course deviates from expectations [^114qHWQV] [^117HwJxb] [^113ARzkh].

Outpatient antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms and no systemic signs, as evidence shows no clear benefit in complications, recurrence, or surgery [^112KL8LJ] [^112Ayosi] [^112zD7kL]. Antibiotics are indicated for **complicated disease** (abscess, perforation, fistula, obstruction), immunocompromised patients, or those with systemic inflammatory response or high-risk features (CRP > 140 mg/L, WBC > 15×10⁹/L, frailty, or significant comorbidities) [^111j4YAs] [^116zGVHW] [^114h9ANa]. When needed, use amoxicillin-clavulanate or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole for 4–7 days; avoid fluoroquinolones if possible due to harms [^117HwJxb] [^1154ntz4]. Ensure close follow-up within 48–72 hours and clear return precautions.

---

## Indications for outpatient antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated diverticulitis; however, they are recommended in the following scenarios:

- **Complicated diverticulitis**: Abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction [^117H9Cyy] [^116t3h3t].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of severe infection and complications [^112GtzkF] [^114h9ANa].

- **Systemic inflammatory response**: Fever, tachycardia, or elevated inflammatory markers (CRP > 140 mg/L, WBC > 15×10⁹/L) [^111j4YAs] [^116zGVHW].

- **Frailty or significant comorbidities**: Higher risk of adverse outcomes [^111j4YAs] [^116zGVHW].

---

## Recommended outpatient antibiotic regimens

When antibiotics are indicated, **regimens should cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria**. Commonly recommended regimens include:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg orally every 12 hours | 4–7 days [^117HwJxb] |
| Ciprofloxacin + metronidazole | Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally every 12 hours + metronidazole 500 mg orally every 8 hours | 4–7 days [^117HwJxb] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole + metronidazole | TMP-SMX double-strength orally every 12 hours + metronidazole 500 mg orally every 8 hours | 4–7 days [^117HwJxb] |

---

Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) should be **reserved for patients with severe beta-lactam allergy** or when first-line agents are contraindicated, given their association with significant adverse effects, including Clostridioides difficile infection and tendon rupture [^1154ntz4].

---

## Evidence supporting outpatient management without antibiotics

Recent randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses demonstrate that **outpatient management without antibiotics is safe and effective** for selected patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis:

- **AVOD trial**: No significant differences in recovery, complications, or recurrence between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups [^117FBk5Z].

- **DIABOLO trial**: Non-antibiotic management was non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in mild cases [^112Ayosi].

- **Cochrane review**: Antibiotics did not significantly reduce complications or emergency surgery in uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112KL8LJ].

---

## Patient selection criteria for outpatient management

Patients suitable for outpatient management should meet the following criteria:

- **Immunocompetent**: No immunosuppression or significant comorbidities [^114spdCt].

- **Mild symptoms**: No systemic inflammatory response or severe pain [^114qHWQV] [^113ngLXg].

- **Ability to tolerate oral intake**: No persistent vomiting or dehydration [^114spdCt].

- **Reliable follow-up**: Access to healthcare and ability to return if symptoms worsen [^114qHWQV].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Close follow-up is essential to ensure **clinical improvement** and detect complications early. Patients should be reassessed within 48–72 hours, with clear instructions to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (e.g. fever, severe pain, vomiting) [^114qHWQV].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of outpatient antibiotic therapy

### Benefits

Potential benefits include **reduced risk of complications** in high-risk patients (immunocompromised, systemic inflammatory response) and patient reassurance, as some patients may feel more secure with antibiotic therapy.

---

### Risks

Potential risks include **antibiotic-associated adverse effects** — such as gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, and Clostridioides difficile infection — and contribution to antimicrobial resistance with unnecessary antibiotic use [^113Pe1KP].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **selective antibiotic use** in uncomplicated diverticulitis:

- **AGA 2021**: Antibiotics should be used selectively, not routinely, in immunocompetent patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis [^114tSnhe].

- **ACP 2022**: Clinicians should initially manage select patients without antibiotics, coupled with close monitoring [^114KKZGJ].

- **WSES 2020**: Antibiotics are not recommended for immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis without systemic inflammation [^115dhejn].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Outpatient antibiotic therapy for diverticulitis should be **individualized** based on clinical presentation, patient characteristics, and risk factors. Antibiotics are not routinely required for uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients with mild symptoms and no systemic inflammatory response. They are indicated for complicated disease, immunocompromised patients, or those with systemic inflammatory response or high-risk features. When antibiotics are indicated, use regimens that cover Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria for 4–7 days, and ensure close follow-up within 48–72 hours.

What is the optimal antibiotic therapy for patients with diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation? What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy after surgical source control in diffuse peritonitis due to diverticular perforation?

We suggest to choose the empirically designed antibiotic regimen on the basis of the underlying clinical condition of the patient, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors for major antimicrobial resistance patterns (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B).

We suggest a 4-day period of postoperative antibiotic therapy in complicated ALCD if source control has been adequate (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Antibiotic therapy plays an important role in the management of complicated acute diverticulitis. Typically, it is an empiric antibiotic treatment. The regimen should depend on the severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns. Several recommendations have been recently published in literature. However, consideration of local epidemiological data and resistance profiles is essential for antibiotic selection.

Considering intestinal microbiota of large bowel acute diverticulitis requires antibiotic coverage for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as for anaerobes. Most of the complicated acute diverticulitis is mainly a community-acquired infection. The main resistance threat in IAIs is posed by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are becoming increasingly common in community-acquired infections worldwide. The most significant risk factors for ESBL-producing pathogens include prior exposure to antibiotics and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy. Anti-ESBL-producer coverage should be warranted for patients with these risk factors. Discontinuation of antibiotic treatment should be at 4 days from source control as this has been demonstrated as non-inferior to longer therapy based on the STOP IT trial.

The recent prospective trial by Sawyer et al. demonstrated that in patients with complicated IAIs undergoing an adequate source-control procedure, the outcomes after approximately 4 days fixed-duration antibiotic therapy were similar to those after a longer course of antibiotics that extended until after the resolution of physiological abnormalities. Patients who have signs of sepsis beyond 5 to 7 days of adequate antibiotic treatment warrant aggressive diagnostic investigation in search of a reservoir of infection.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^114iKtUj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations meanwhile. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics 'should be used selectively' (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline 11), antibiotics 'should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course' (German guideline 9), or antibiotics 'on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered' (Italian guideline 8).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta‐analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high‐risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Sp1JW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on current best available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Recommendation 1

ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Could patients with uncomplicated ALCD be treated as outpatient?

We suggest management in an outpatient setting for patients with uncomplicated ALCD and no comorbidities. We suggest re-evaluation within 7 days. If the clinical condition deteriorates, re-evaluation should be carried out earlier (weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B).

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis symptoms without significant comorbidities, who are able to take fluids orally and manage themselves at home, can be treated as outpatients. They should be re-evaluated within 7 days from the time of the diagnosis. However, if the clinical condition deteriorates, re-evaluation should be carried out earlier. Patients with significant comorbidities and unable to take fluids orally should be treated in hospital with intravenous fluids.

Etzioni et al. in 2010 published a retrospective analysis, demonstrating that outpatient treatment was effective for the vast majority (94%) of patients suffering from acute diverticulitis. A systematic review on outpatient management of acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis was recently published. Jackson et al. concluded that current evidence suggested that a more progressive, ambulatory-based approach to the majority of cases of acute uncomplicated acute diverticulitis was justified. Rodríguez-Cerrillo et al. have recently shown that also elderly patients with comorbidities can be safely treated at home avoiding hospital admission.

The DIVER trial has demonstrated that outpatient treatment may be safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and can reduce the costs without negatively influencing the quality of life of these patients. This multicenter, RCT included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All the patients underwent abdominal CT. The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department, and then, patients were either admitted to hospital or discharged. Among a total of 132 patients, four patients in those admitted to hospital and three patients in those discharged to home management developed treatment failure (there were no differences between the groups (p = 0.62)). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times less in the outpatient treated group, with significant costs savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

Acute diverticulitis — antibiotic use and generalizability of evidence are described: Two recent randomized trials and 2 systematic reviews have reported no clear benefit and questioned the routine use of antibiotics, as does this guideline, suggesting selective and individualized use. Further, the patients studied were inpatients with uncomplicated disease confirmed by computed tomography (CT); therefore, the results should not be generalized to complicated patients (those with abscesses or fistulas), those with severe infection or sepsis, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with significant comorbidities. Outpatient management without antibiotics has not been studied, although we would expect these patients to have generally milder disease and logically equal or better outcomes.

### Diagnostic imaging and medical management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a systematic review [^112zVg3K]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians need to better understand the value of computed tomography (CT) imaging and nonsurgical treatment options to manage acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

Purpose

To evaluate CT imaging, outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotic treatment, and interventional radiology for patients with complicated diverticulitis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 1 January 1990 through 16 November 2020.

Study Selection

Existing systematic reviews of CT imaging accuracy, as well as randomized trials and adjusted nonrandomized comparative studies reporting clinical or patient-centered outcomes.

Data Extraction

6 researchers extracted study data and risk of bias, which were verified by an independent researcher. The team assessed strength of evidence across studies.

Data Synthesis

Based on moderate-strength evidence, CT imaging is highly accurate for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. For patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, 6 studies provide low-strength evidence that initial outpatient and inpatient management have similar risks for recurrence or elective surgery, but they provide insufficient evidence regarding other outcomes. Also, for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, 5 studies comparing antibiotics versus no antibiotics provide low-strength evidence that does not support differences in risks for treatment failure, elective surgery, recurrence, posttreatment complications, and other outcomes. Evidence is insufficient to determine choice of antibiotic regimen (7 studies) or effect of percutaneous drainage (2 studies).

Limitations

The evidence base is mostly of low strength. Studies did not adequately assess heterogeneity of treatment effect.

Conclusion

Computed tomography imaging is accurate for diagnosing acute diverticulitis. For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, no differences in outcomes were found between outpatient and inpatient care. Avoidance of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be safe for most patients. The evidence is too sparse for other evaluated questions.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^116TRamW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is an inflammatory complication to the very common condition diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics with reference to the microbiology, extrapolation from trials on complicated intra-abdominal infections and clinical experience.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic interventions for uncomplicated diverticulitis on relevant outcome.

Search Methods

Studies were identified by computerised searches of the The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Ongoing trials were identified and reference lists of identified trials and relevant review articles were screened for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including all types of patients with a radiological confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated diverticulitis. Interventions of antibiotics compared to any other antibiotic treatment (different regime, route of administration, dosage or duration of treatment), placebo or no antibiotics. Outcome measures were complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, late complications and duration of hospital stay and recovery of signs of infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification of RCTs, trial assessment and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of a third part. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing trials. Effect estimates were extracted as relative risks (RR).

Main Results

Three RCTs were identified. A qualitative approach with no meta analysis was performed because of variety in interventions between included studies. Interventions compared were antibiotics to no antibiotics, single to double compound antibiotic therapy and short to long IV administration. None of the studies found significant difference between the tested interventions. Risk of bias varied from low to high. The newest RCT overall had the best quality and statistical power.

Authors' Conclusions

The newest evidence from one RCT says there is no significant difference between antibiotics versus no antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Previous RCTs have only suggested a non-inferiority between different antibiotic regimes and treatment lengths. This new evidence needs confirmation from more RCTs before it can be implicated safely in clinical guidelines. Ongoing RCTs will be published in the years to come and more are needed. The role of antibiotics in the treatment of complicated diverticulitis has not been investigated yet.

### Outpatient versus hospitalization management for uncomplicated diverticulitis: a prospective, multicenter randomized clinical trial (DIVER trial) [^115PVe1j]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

We compare the results of 2 different strategies for the management of patients with uncomplicated left colonic diverticulitis and to analyze differences in quality of life and economic costs.

Background

The most frequent standard management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis still is hospital admission both in Europe and United States.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized controlled trial included patients older than 18 years with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. All the patients underwent abdominal computed tomography. There were 2 strategies of management: hospitalization (group 1) and outpatient (group 2). The first dose of antibiotic was given intravenously to all patients in the emergency department and then group 1 patients were hospitalized whereas patients in group 2 were discharged. The primary end point was the treatment failure rate of the outpatient protocol and need for hospital admission. The secondary end points included quality-of-life assessment and evaluation of costs.

Results

A total of 132 patients were randomized: 4 patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2 presented treatment failure without differences between the groups (P = 0.619). The overall health care cost per episode was 3 times lower in group 2, with savings of €1124.70 per patient. No differences were observed between the groups in terms of quality of life.

Conclusions

Outpatient treatment is safe and effective in selected patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Outpatient treatment allows important costs saving to the health systems without negative influence on the quality of life of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Trial registration ID: EudraCT number 2008–008452–17.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

### WSES guidelines for the management of acute left sided colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^117FBk5Z]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A multi-centre randomized trial involving ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis was published in 2012 by Chabok et al. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence. It should therefore be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

A recent prospective single-arm study analyzed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (nonantibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic air. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but, 2 days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%, 6 orally, 8 intravenously) patients.

However the high mortality associated with sepsis, requires clinicians to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion, in the conditions that predispose to sepsis. WSES expert panel suggests antimicrobial therapy covering Gram negative and anaerobes in patients with radiological documented uncomplicated acute diverticulitis associated with systemic manifestations of infection.

An appropriate antimicrobial regimen administered for an adequate duration has minimal impact on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

If antimicrobial therapy is necessary oral administration of antibiotics may be equally as effective as intravenous administration.

A randomized controlled trial of oral versus intravenous therapy for clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was published in 2009. Oral and intravenous regimens utilizing ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were compared. There were 41 patients in the oral arm and 38 in the IV arm (n = 79). No patients had to be converted to intravenous antibiotics from the oral group. There was a complete resolution of symptoms in both groups.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^113ngLXg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Non-operative treatment, with bowel rest and antibiotics, is suggested in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis (Recommendation 1 C).

Conservative treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is successful in 70 to 100 percent of patients. Uncomplicated diverticulitis may be managed as an outpatient (dietary modification and oral antibiotics) for those without appreciable fever, excessive vomiting, or marked peritonitis, as long as there is the opportunity for follow-up. The patient should be able to take liquids and antibiotics by mouth. Hospitalization is indicated if the patient is unable to take liquids or has severe pain, or if symptoms fail to improve despite adequate outpatient therapy. Antibiotics should be selected to treat the most common bacteria found in the colon: gram-negative rods and anaerobic bacteria. Non-operative treatment will resolve acute diverticulitis in 85 percent of patients, but approximately one-third will have a recurrent attack often within one year.

The decision to recommend elective sigmoid colectomy after recovery from acute diverticulitis should be made on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation 1 C).

The overall rate of recurrence appears to be approximately 10 to 30% within a decade after a first documented attack and that the majority of patients who have a single episode of diverticulitis will not have another. In one report involving an average follow-up of 9 years with 2551 patients whose initial episode of diverticulitis was treated successfully without surgery, only 13% had recurrent attacks and only 7% required colectomy. These observations imply that routine elective colectomy is probably unwarranted if the disease is successfully managed on initial presentation and that surgical treatment should be limited to patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative therapy. Thus, continued observation may be appropriate for most patients who have repeated attacks of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Acute diverticulitis: diagnosis and treatment recommendations… [^115mQMeE]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In patients with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis, abdominal contrast CT has high sensitivity and specificity and is recommended if there is diagnostic uncertainty.
- Uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients with no risk factors for complicated diverticulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with medical supervision if they can drink fluids, have social support, and wish to avoid admission.
- In patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis and no risk factors for complicated diverticulitis, antibiotic treatment does not affect quality of life or reduce related complications or need for surgery, although it may slightly decrease the likelihood of ongoing diverticulitis. From the AFP Editors. There are approximately 200, 000 hospitalizations per year for acute diverticulitis in the United States.

The American College of Physicians performed a systematic review to determine the most effective diagnosis and management options for acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis. Need for Hospitalization For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who can drink fluids, want to avoid admission, and have social support, there is no evidence that hospitalization improves the outcomes of future elective surgery or risk of recurrence. The impact of hospitalization on treatment failure, quality of life, and mortality is unknown. Most patients with uncomplicated disease may be managed in an outpatient setting. Outpatient management has not been evaluated for patients with complicated diverticulitis or who have risk factors for complicated diverticulitis. Antibiotics For patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, the ACP recommends a trial of supportive care that includes bowel rest and hydration.

In these patients, complication rates, quality of life, need for surgery, length of hospital stay, and long-term recurrence are similar whether antibiotics are given or not. Antibiotics may slightly decrease the likelihood of ongoing diverticulitis or short-term recurrence. Patients with complicated diverticulitis or risk factors for complicated diverticulitis should receive antibiotics. The best antibiotic regimen for diverticulitis is unknown. Clostridioides difficile infection, and antibiotic resistance, were not reported in the available studies. In complicated diverticulitis, the benefit of percutaneous drainage is uncertain. The few observational studies had uncertain outcomes and did not report procedural adverse events. Editor's Note: Although the evidence is somewhat limited, it is important to know that uncomplicated diverticulitis without risk factors is simple to treat. Imaging is not required if the clinical diagnosis is certain.

Outpatient treatment without antibiotics has similar outcomes as admission or prescribing antibiotics. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis: a systematic review [^1144uKss]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis occurs in up to 25% of patients with diverticulosis. The majority of cases are mild or uncomplicated and it has become a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency department. On the basis of the National Inpatient Sample database from the USA, 86% of patients admitted with diverticulitis were treated with medical therapy. However, several recent studies have shown that outpatient treatment with antibiotics is safe and effective. The aim of this systematic review is to update the evidence published in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. We performed a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines and searched in MEDLINE and Cochrane databases all English-language articles on the management of acute diverticulitis using the following search terms: 'diverticulitis', 'outpatient', and 'uncomplicated'. Data were extracted independently by two investigators. A total of 11 articles for full review were yielded: one randomized controlled trial, eight prospective cohort studies, and two retrospective cohort studies. Treatment successful rate on an outpatient basis, which means that no further complications were reported, ranged from 91.5 to 100%. Fewer than 8% of patients were readmitted in the hospital. Intolerance to oral intake and lack of family or social support are common exclusion criteria used for this approach, whereas severe comorbidities are not definitive exclusion criteria in all the studies. Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective, and economically efficient when applying an appropriate selection in most reviewed studies.

### Management of right colonic uncomplicated diverticulitis: outpatient versus inpatient management [^116SNVY7]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Initial conservative management may be the mainstay of therapy for uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. However, definitive treatment guidelines have not yet been established. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of outpatient management versus inpatient management for preventing recurrence of this condition.

Methods

Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 103 patients were consecutively enrolled at the first attack of uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis. In this prospective observational study, 40 patients underwent an outpatient management regimen consisting of oral antibiotics (for 4 days), and 63 patients underwent an inpatient management regimen that included bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics (for 7–10 days). The treatment was selected by the patient. Failure to respond to therapy and the incidence of recurrence of this condition were assessed.

Results

Both groups of patients were treated successfully, and their symptoms were relieved. The patients were followed up for a median time of 21 months. Of the 40 patients with short-term oral antibiotic therapy on an outpatient basis, disease recurrence was observed in 4 patients (10%). Of these four patients, one underwent surgery and the remaining three were treated nonoperatively. Of the 63 patients on inpatient management, recurrence was observed in 7 patients (11%). Of these seven patients, one underwent surgery and the remaining six were treated nonoperatively.

Conclusions

Outpatient management with short-term oral antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated right colonic diverticulitis is as effective as inpatient management in regard to preventing disease recurrence.

### Contemporary review of risk-stratified management in acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis [^114DzQgr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition. Severity of the disease is based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations and dictates the need for medical or surgical intervention. Recent clinical trials have improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease resulting in new approaches to and better evidence for the management of acute diverticulitis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library (years 2004–2015), MEDLINE (years 2004–2015), and EMBASE (years 2004–2015) databases. We used the search terms "diverticulitis, colonic" or "acute diverticulitis" or "divertic" in combination with the terms "management", "antibiotics", "non-operative", or "surgery". Registers for clinical trials (such as the WHO registry and the https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were searched for ongoing, recruiting, or closed trials not yet published.

Results

Antibiotic treatment can be avoided in simple, non-complicated diverticulitis and outpatient management is safe. The management of complicated disease, ranging from a localized abscess to perforation with diffuse peritonitis, has changed towards either percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches in selected cases. The role of laparoscopic lavage without resection in perforated non-fecal diverticulitis is still debated; however, recent evidence from two randomised controlled trials has found a higher re-intervention in this group of patients.

Conclusions

A shift in management has occurred towards conservative management in acute uncomplicated disease. Those with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be treated without antibiotics. For complicated diverticulitis with purulent peritonitis, the use of peritoneal lavage appears to be non-superior to resection.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114KKZGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis — initial care without antibiotics in select patients: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis without antibiotics (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). "Select" patients are defined as immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis, with no systemic inflammatory response or immunosuppression, who are not medically frail, do not require hospitalization, and can follow up as an outpatient under medical supervision with social and family support. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications, quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics; initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, and this recommendation does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment. Implementation does not require a CT-confirmed diagnosis, but clinicians should err on the side of imaging in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with perforation, bleeding, obstruction, or abscess; the included studies did not report how many patients randomly assigned to watchful waiting needed antibiotics at follow-up (6, 12, 24 months and 11 years).

### Antibiotics for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis… [^113Pe1KP]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does antibiotic therapy for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis reduce complications or the need for emergency surgery. Evidence-Based Answer Antibiotics do not reduce complications or the need for emergency surgery in people with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Treatment without antibiotics appears to be safe.

1. Practice Pointers Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis occurs in approximately 4% of people with colonic diverticulosis and has traditionally been considered a bacterial infection that should be treated with antibiotics. 2 Risk factors for diverticulitis suggest that chronic inflammation is a potential etiology, which has led some clinicians to question the utility of antibiotics.

3 The authors of this Cochrane review sought to determine if antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis reduces complications or the need for emergency surgery. The Cochrane review included three RCTs comparing antibiotics and no antibiotics. The authors included studies in which left-sided acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was confirmed by radiography and excluded complicated diseases. Primary outcomes were complications and emergency surgery within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, or surgery after 30 days; adverse events; and all-cause mortality. The quality of evidence for the primary outcomes was low due to a lack of blinding in two of the three studies, leading to a risk of detection and performance bias. The body of evidence is limited because only three RCTs are included in this review.

However, a recently published non-inferiority, triple-blinded RCT not included in this review demonstrated that not using antibiotics for outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is safe and not inferior to antibiotic therapy. 4 The American Gastroenterological Association suggests selective use of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with patients who are immunocompromised, pregnant, or critically ill, representing a shift toward management without antibiotics. 5 The use of antibiotics to treat acute uncomplicated diverticulitis can cause serious adverse events, including allergic reactions and Clostridioides difficile infections. Antibiotic treatment should be carefully considered because of growing global concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics appears to be safe.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112KL8LJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Diverticulitis is a complication of the common condition, diverticulosis. Uncomplicated diverticulitis has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, as diverticulitis has been regarded as an infectious disease. Risk factors for diverticulitis, however, may suggest that the condition is inflammatory rather than infectious which makes the use of antibiotics questionable.

Objectives

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine if antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis affects the risk of complications (immediate or late) or the need for emergency surgery.

Search Methods

For this update, a comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform on February 2021.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including all types of patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of left-sided uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Comparator and interventions included antibiotics compared to no antibiotics, placebo, or to any other antibiotic treatment (different regimens, routes of administration, dosage or duration of treatment). Primary outcome measures were complications and emergency surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence, late complications, elective colonic resections, length of hospital stay, length to recovery of symptoms, adverse events and mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors performed the searches, identification and assessment of RCTs and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or involvement of the third author. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain additional data if needed or for preliminary results of ongoing trials. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was used to assess the methodological quality of the identified trials. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Effect estimates were extracted as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with the Mantel-Haenzel method.

Main Results

The authors included five studies. Three studies compared no antibiotics to antibiotics; all three were original RCTs of which two also published long-term follow-up information. For the outcome of short-term complications there may be little or no difference between antibiotics and no antibiotics (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.30 to 2.62; 3 studies, 1329 participants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of emergency surgery within 30 days may be lower with no antibiotics compared to antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.13, 1.71; 1329 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence). However, there is considerable imprecision due to wide confidence intervals for this effect estimate causing uncertainty which means that there may also be a benefit with antibiotics. One of the two remaining trials compared single to double compound antibiotic therapy and, due to wide confidence intervals, the estimate was imprecise and indicated an uncertain clinical effect between these two antibiotic regimens (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.58; 51 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). The last trial compared short to long intravenous administration of antibiotics and did not report any events for our primary outcomes. Both trials included few participants and one had overall high risk of bias. Since the first publication of this systematic review, an increasing amount of evidence supporting the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics has been published, but the total body of evidence is still limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis suggests that the effect of antibiotics is uncertain for complications, emergency surgery, recurrence, elective colonic resections, and long-term complications. The quality of the evidence is low. Only three RCTs on the need for antibiotics are currently available. More trials are needed to obtain more precise effect estimates.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114Y6a1M]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the longtime prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder of primarily older people in western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last 5 years.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115UzMfE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ACP clinical guideline — site of care for acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis states that ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). In the absence of evidence suggesting a benefit in routine hospitalization for patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, the initial (default) management of uncomplicated diverticulitis can be as an outpatient, and patients should have adequate family or social support and follow-up. For these patients, low-certainty evidence showed that there may be no differences in risk for elective surgery or long-term diverticulitis recurrence after outpatient compared with inpatient management, and the available evidence was very uncertain (insufficient) for most critical and important outcomes (including emergency surgery, mortality, quality of life, and treatment failure), but few patients had these outcomes after management in outpatient or inpatient settings. The CGC also judged that outpatient management would likely have lower associated costs than inpatient management, with indirect evidence from outside the United States suggesting a cost savings of 35% to 83% per episode of acute diverticulitis. This recommendation does not apply to patients with suspected complicated diverticulitis, recent antibiotic use, concomitant unstable comorbid conditions, immunosuppression, or signs of sepsis.

The treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (UD) with antibiotics remains common despite substantial evidence supporting the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic outpatient management. In the past 15 years, there have been two landmark randomized-controlled clinical trials, follow-up studies, and numerous retrospective studies that have supported the non-inferiority of nonantibiotic management of UD. Multiple medical societies including the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Physicians recommend using antibiotics selectively rather than routinely in UD. We aim to raise physician awareness of the latest guideline recommendations through our article, potentially improving antibiotic stewardship and reducing related healthcare costs.

### Efficacy and safety of nonantibiotic outpatient treatment in mild acute diverticulitis (DINAMO-study): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, noninferiority trial [^112zD7kL]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mild AD can be treated safely and effectively on an outpatient basis without antibiotics.

Summary Of Background Data

In recent years, it has shown no benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated AD in hospitalized patients. Also, outpatient treatment of uncomplicated AD has been shown to be safe and effective.

Methods

A Prospective, multicentre, open-label, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial, in 15 hospitals of patients consulting the emergency department with symptoms compatible with AD. The Participants were patients with mild AD diagnosed by Computed Tomography meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to control arm (ATB-Group): classical treatment (875/125mg/8h amoxicillin/clavulanic acid apart from anti-inflammatory and symptomatic treatment) or experimental arm (Non-ATB-Group): experimental treatment (antiinflammatory and symptomatic treatment). Clinical controls were performed at 2, 7, 30, and 90days. The primary endpoint was hospital admission. Secondary endpoints included number of emergency department revisits, pain control and emergency surgery in the different arms.

Results

Four hundred and eighty patients meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to Non-ATB-Group (n = 242) or ATB-Group (n = 238). Hospitalization rates were: ATB-Group 14/238 (5.8%) and Non-ATB-Group 8/242 (3.3%) [mean difference 2.58%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.32 to -1.17], confirming noninferiority margin. Revisits: ATB-Group 16/238 (6.7%) and Non-ATB-Group 17/242 (7%) (mean difference -0.3, 95% CI 4.22 to -4.83). Poor pain control at 2days follow up: ATB-Group 13/230 (5.7%), Non-ATB-Group 5/221 (2.3%) (mean difference 3.39, 95% CI 6.96 to -0.18).

Conclusions

Nonantibiotic outpatient treatment of mild AD is safe and effective and is not inferior to current standard treatment.

### The WSES / SICG / ACOI / SICUT / AcEMC / SIFIPAC guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute left colonic diverticulitis in the elderly [^113bj8KR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Omitting antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated ALCD did not result in more complicated diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis or sigmoid resections at long-term follow-up. As the DIABOLO trial was not powered for these secondary outcome measures, some uncertainty remains whether (small) non-significant differences could be true associations.

A systematic review and meta-analysis including 2469 patients (including elderly patients) with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis showed that treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis without antibiotics might be feasible with outcomes that are comparable to antibiotic treatment and with potential benefits for patients and the overall health economic system.

Furthermore, antibiotic use in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis seems to increase the length of hospital stay.

Finally, current evidence does not support the administration of antibiotics to improve outcomes in carefully selected healthy patients with uncomplicated ALCD. However, this evidence comes from young patients (mean age in AVOD trial: 57; age range in DIABOLO trial: 48–64). For this reason, for elderly patients, the recommendation has very low-quality evidence. Further studies should help identify specific subpopulations of patients who would derive benefit from antibiotic therapy and help define appropriate antibiotic regimens and treatment durations that minimize cost, adverse effects, and risk of anti-microbial resistance. Due to the low event rate, it remains uncertain whether antibiotic treatment is necessary in cases with isolated pericolic gas, whether in young or elderly patients.

It also notes missing safety data: "Studies typically did not report on harms, adverse events, or side effects, including health care associated infections (outpatient vs inpatient comparison); side effects or adverse events attributable to antibiotics, such as Clostridioides difficile infection and antibiotic resistance (antibiotic comparisons); or adverse events related to procedures, such as bleeding and catheter infections (percutaneous drainage of abscess vs conservative management comparisons)". The settings were limited: "Most included studies were done in the emergency department; more evidence is needed on the diagnosis and management pathway among patients presenting to primary care clinics", and future work "should aim to include a wider spectrum of patients and health care settings".

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^114Mt7cb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Prevention of acute diverticulitis

Primary prevention of acute diverticulitis is a very important topic. Acute diverticulitis, defined as acute inflammation of a colonic diverticulum, is a common emergency presentation managed by both surgeons and physicians. Factors predisposing to the development of acute diverticulitis include obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity and medication use such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

There have been advances in the medical treatments offered to patients in recent years. Patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis are generally treated as outpatients with a clear liquid diet and antibiotics. In outpatients, broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually given for 7–10 days. If opioid analgesics are required for pain control, meperidine is the preferred option since morphine causes colonic spasm and may accentuate colonic hyper-segmentation.

Outpatient treatment is effective in most cases, and less than 10% of patients are readmitted at the emergency room for diverticulitis within 60 days of the initial evaluation. Hospitalization with intravenous antibiotic treatment is usually recommended by current guidelines if the patient: is unable to take oral therapy; is affected by severe comorbidity; fails to improve with outpatient therapy; or is affected by complicated diverticulitis. Clinical improvement in patients affected by acute diverticulitis is generally observed within 3–4 days. If patients are hospitalized, a 7–10 day course of oral antibiotics is usually given following discharge. However, results of studies investigating such prevention are often conflicting.

Abstract

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common disease treated by acute care surgeons. Acute uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis involves thickening of the colon wall with inflammatory changes and less commonly requires the expertise of a surgeon; many cases may be treated as an outpatient with or without antibiotics. Complicated diverticulitis involves phlegmon, abscess, peritonitis, obstruction, stricture, and/or fistula and usually requires inpatient hospital admission, treatment with antibiotics, and consideration for intervention including operative management. This review will discuss what the acute care surgeon needs to know about diagnosis and management of acute colonic diverticulitis.

### Meta-analyses of current strategies to treat uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112NPuGT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis is common. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate management. Some authors have reported the efficacy and safety of observational management, and others have argued for a more aggressive approach with oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to perform an updated meta-analysis of the different management strategies for uncomplicated diverticulitis with 2 separate meta-analyses.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were used.

Study Selection

All randomized clinical trials, prospective, and retrospective comparative studies were included.

Interventions

Observational and antibiotics treatment or oral and intravenous antibiotics treatment were included.

Main Outcome Measures

Successful management (emergency management, recurrence, elective management) was measured.

Results

After review of 293 identified records, 11 studies fit inclusion criteria: 7 studies compared observational management and antibiotics treatment (2321 patients), and 4 studies compared oral and intravenous antibiotics treatment (355 patients). There was no significant difference between observational management and antibiotics treatment in terms of emergency surgery (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.1) and recurrence (11% vs 12%; p = 0.3). In this part, considering only randomized trials, elective surgery during the follow-up occurred more frequently in the observational group than the antibiotic group (2.5% vs 0.9%; p = 0.04). The second meta-analysis showed that failure and recurrence rates were similar between oral and intravenous antibiotics treatment (6% vs 7% (p = 0.6) and 8% vs 9% (p = 0.8)).

Limitations

Inclusion of nonrandomized studies, identification of high risks of bias (selection, performance, and detection bias), and presence of heterogeneity between the studies limited this work.

Conclusions

Observational management was not statistically different from antibiotic treatment for the primary outcome of needing to undergo surgery. However, in patients being treated by antibiotics, our studies demonstrated that oral administration was similar to intravenous administration and provided lower costs. Although it may be difficult for physicians to do, there is mounting evidence that not treating uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis with antibiotics is a viable treatment alternative.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113yJpdz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with antibiotics or not does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favour of using antibiotics and all reasons in favour of omitting them should be taken into account. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy. Insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic‐related morbidity (8.3 per cent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life‐threatening allergic reactions. In the end, individual‐patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision‐making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcome (high pain scores, high WBC and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation) no beneficial role for antibiotics in the prevention of such adverse outcomes was found.

The objectives of therapy in patients who develop acute diverticulitis include the treatment of symptoms, the colonic infection, the prevention of complications and the recurrence of the condition(Table 3). Based on the severity of symptoms, ability to tolerate oral intake, presence of comorbidities and adequate outpatient support, the decision on whether patients should be hospitalized or receive ambulatory care should be carefully considered. Treatment of complications may require interventional radiology or surgery.

Diverticulitis

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (Recommendation 2C).

The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is a point of controversy in the medical community.

In 2011, a systematic review was published overviewing antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Relevant data regarding the use of antibiotics in mild or uncomplicated cases of diverticulitis were sparse and of poor methodological quality. There was no concrete evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerated recovery nor prevented complications or recurrence.

However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms.

Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis depends on the condition and compliance of the patient as well as his or her availability for follow-up analysis. The treatment involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be admitted for more aggressive inpatient treatment.

Hospitalized patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotic infusion.

The clinical value of antibiotics in the treatment of acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis is poorly understood by the medical community and therefore merits further study.

Mesalazine for treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and primary prevention of diverticulitis: results from a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (data from Picchio et al.).

The apparent colonic hypermotility in diverticular disease, suggests that antispasmodic agents might improve abdominal pain, by decreasing muscular contraction. No randomized clinical trials are, however, available to confirm this benefit.

In acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (Hinchey, stage 0 or Ia), an outpatient management is now considered the optimal approach for most patients. Oral antimicrobials are often prescribed, but recent studies found no support to the routine use of antibiotics. A recent meta-analysisactually found that antibiotic use increases the length of hospital stay but is not associated with a reduction in overall or individual complication rates. The combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole is probably the most prescribed oral treatment. Admission to hospital and intravenous antibiotics are only recommended when the patient cannot tolerate oral feeding, is affected by severe comorbidities or does not improve with outpatient treatment. Most diverticulitis-associated abscesses can be treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobials or percutaneous drainage. Emergency surgery is considered standard treatment only in patients with acute peritonitis (Hinchey, stages III and IV).

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^116C1Z8J]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A systematic review including 21 studies (11 prospective, 9 retrospective, and only 1 randomized trial) with 1781 patients who had outpatient management of ALCD was recently published. The meta-analysis concluded that outpatient management is safe, and the overall failure rate in an outpatient setting was 4.3% (95% CI 2.6–6.3%). Location of diverticulitis is not a selection criterion for an outpatient strategy (p = 0.512). The other subgroup analyses did not report any factors that influence the rate of failure: previous episodes of acute diverticulitis (p = 0.163), comorbidities (p = 0.187), pericolic gas (p = 0.653), intra-abdominal abscess (p = 0.326), treatment according to a registered protocol (p = 0.078), type of follow-up (p = 0.700), type of antibiotic treatment (p = 0.647), or diabetes (p = 0.610). In patients who failed outpatient treatment, the majority had prolonged antibiotic therapy and only few had percutaneous drainage for an abscess (0.13%) or surgical intervention for perforation (0.06%). However, these results should be interpreted with some caution because of the low quality of available data. The data reported suggested that outpatient management is safe if associated with an accurate selection of patients (40%); no subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences between groups (including comorbidities, previous episode and diabetes). The main limitations of the findings of the present review concern their applicability in common clinical practice as it was impossible to identify strict criteria of failure.

Another review about outpatient management of ALCD was published in 2017. The search yielded 192 publications. Of these, 10 studies met the inclusion criteria including 1 RCT, 6 clinical controlled trials, and 3 case series. There was no difference in failure rates of medical treatment (6.5 vs. 4.6%, p = 0.32) or in recurrence rates (13.0 vs. 12.1%, p = 0.81) between those receiving ambulatory care and inpatient care for uncomplicated diverticulitis. Ambulatory treatment was associated with an estimated daily cost savings of between €600 and €1,900 per patient treated. Meta-analysis of data was not possible due to heterogeneity in study designs and inclusion criteria.

### Randomized clinical trial of observational versus antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^112Ayosi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Methods

Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands, and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated, ongoing and recurrent diverticulitis, sigmoid resection and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.

Results

A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 (i.q.r. 6–35) days for the observational and 12 (7–30) days for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0.91 (lower limit of 1-sided 95 per cent c.i. 0.78; P = 0.151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3.8 versus 2.6 per cent respectively; P = 0.377), ongoing diverticulitis (7.3 versus 4.1 per cent; P = 0.183), recurrent diverticulitis (3.4 versus 3.0 per cent; P = 0.494), sigmoid resection (3.8 versus 2.3 per cent; P = 0.323), readmission (17.6 versus 12.0 per cent; P = 0.148), adverse events (48.5 versus 54.5 per cent; P = 0.221) and mortality (1.1 versus 0.4 per cent; P = 0.432). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the observation group (2 versus 3 days; P = 0.006). Per-protocol analyses were concordant with the intention-to-treat analyses.

Conclusion

Observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and can be considered appropriate in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Registration number: NCT01111253 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

5 Uncomplicated Diverticulitis

Little data exists to support optimal medical management of diverticulitis in older or frail adults. Historically, management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis involved inpatient admission with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest. Following several large randomized controlled trials of younger patients (mean age ~57) with few, if any comorbidities, outpatient management with omission of antibiotics has become the recommendation for young patients with mild uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this treatment strategy has not been evaluated in older or frail adults. As such, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) guidelines recommend selected use of antibiotics in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis in patients who are frail or have significant comorbidities. Close clinical follow‐up is essential in older adults, and antibiotics and/or inpatient observation should be considered in older, frail patients with systemic symptoms, fever, leukocytosis, multiple comorbidities, or unreliable follow‐up.

Evidence cited states there "may be no differences in diverticulitis-related complications (such as abscess, fistula, stenosis, and obstruction), quality of life, need for surgery, or long-term recurrence between those receiving and those not receiving antibiotics", though "antibiotic treatment may slightly decrease treatment failure rates (defined as "ongoing diverticulitis" within 3 months of treatment) compared with no antibiotic treatment". Clinical considerations specify this "does not apply to patients with complicated diverticulitis, systemic inflammatory response, immunosuppression, or ongoing or recent antibiotic treatment", and that "Initial management without antibiotics should be coupled with watchful waiting and ability to continue monitoring patient status, based on individual clinical judgment".

### Comparative effectiveness and harms of antibiotics for outpatient diverticulitis: two nationwide cohort studies [^1154ntz4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Outpatient diverticulitis is commonly treated with either a combination of metronidazole and a fluoroquinolone (metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone) or amoxicillin-clavulanate alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised that fluoroquinolones be reserved for conditions with no alternative treatment options. The comparative effectiveness of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for diverticulitis is uncertain.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and harms of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone versus amoxicillin-clavulanate for outpatient diverticulitis.

Design

Active-comparator, new-user, retrospective cohort studies.

Setting

Nationwide population-based claims data on U.S. residents aged 18 to 64 years with private employer-sponsored insurance (2000 to 2018) or those aged 65 years or older with Medicare (2006 to 2015).

Participants

Immunocompetent adults with diverticulitis in the outpatient setting.

Intervention

Metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Measurements

1-year risks for inpatient admission, urgent surgery, and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and 3-year risk for elective surgery.

Results

In MarketScan (IBM Watson Health), new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 106 361) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 13 160) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]), 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, 0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.3 to 0.7]), or 1-year CDI risk (risk difference, 0.0 percentage points [CI, -0.1 to 0.1]) between groups. In Medicare, new users of metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone (n = 17 639) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (n = 2709) were identified. There were no differences in 1-year admission risk (risk difference, 0.1 percentage points [CI, -0.7 to 0.9]), 1-year urgent surgery risk (risk difference, -0.2 percentage points [CI, -0.6 to 0.1]), or 3-year elective surgery risk (risk difference, -0.3 percentage points [CI, -1.1 to 0.4]) between groups. The 1-year CDI risk was higher for metronidazole-with-fluoroquinolone than for amoxicillin-clavulanate (risk difference, 0.6 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 1.0]).

Limitation

Residual confounding is possible, and not all harms associated with these antibiotics, most notably drug-induced liver injury, could be assessed.

Conclusion

Treating diverticulitis in the outpatient setting with amoxicillin-clavulanate may reduce the risk for fluoroquinolone-related harms without adversely affecting diverticulitis-specific outcomes.

### Medical treatment of diverticular disease: antibiotics [^114Wtoaa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease (DD) of the colon represents the most common disease affecting the large bowel in western countries. Its prevalence is increasing. Recent studies suggest that changes in gut microbiota could contribute to development of symptoms and complication. For this reason antibiotics play a key role in the management of both uncomplicated and complicated DD. Rifaximin has demonstrated to be effective in obtaining symptoms relief at 1 year in patients with uncomplicated DD and to improve symptoms and maintain periods of remission following acute colonic diverticulitis (AD). Despite absence of data that supports the routine use of antibiotic in uncomplicated AD, they are recommended in selected patients. In patients with AD that develop an abscess, conservative treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is successful in up to 70% of cases. In patients on conservative treatment where percutaneous drainage fails or peritonitis develops, surgery is considered the standard therapy. In conclusion antibiotics seem to remain the mainstay of treatment in symptomatic uncomplicated DD and AD. Inpatient management and intravenous antibiotics are necessary in complicated AD, while outpatient management is considered the best strategy in the majority of uncomplicated patients.

Q3.2 What are the optimal non - operative strategies in the management of uncomplicated AD?

Statement: In immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, symptomatic treatment without antibiotics provides similar outcomes to treatment with antibiotics.

Recommendation: A trial of non-antibiotic therapy can be considered with appropriate follow-up in select immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. (LoE: high. Strength of recommendation: weak).

Membership survey results: Yes 509 (59.12%).

228 members (26.48%) agreed that this recommendation was already their current practice; 199 (23.11%) agreed that this recommendation was likely to change their practice while 434 (50.41%) disagreed that it was likely to change their practice.

Since there was no majority agreement on either the statement of recommendation nor the likelihood that the recommendation would change practice, further voting was carried out at SAGES and EAES meetings. Agreement with the recommendation was achieved in 61.7% (129/209) and 70.8% (90/127) and with likelihood to change practice in 46% (98/212) and 71% (80/122) among SAGES and EAES members, respectively.

Consensus was not reached on the recommendation nor its likelihood to change practice.

Statement: Immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis may be managed in the outpatient setting.

Recommendation: Immunocompetent individuals presenting with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and mild symptoms may be managed in the outpatient setting. (LoE: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak).

### Outpatient treatment of patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^1143mVU9]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

Evidence supporting outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis is limited. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an ambulatory treatment protocol in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

Method

All patients diagnosed with uncomplicated diverticulitis based on abdominal computed tomography findings from June 2003 to December 2008 were considered for outpatient treatment. Admission was indicated in patients not able to tolerate oral intake and those with comorbidity or without adequate family support. Treatment consisted of oral antibiotics for 7 days (amoxicillin-clavulanic or ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole in patients with penicillin allergy). Patients were seen again at between 4 and 7 days after starting treatment to confirm symptom improvement.

Results

Ninety-six patients were diagnosed with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis and 26 presented at least one criterion for admission. Ambulatory treatment was initiated in 70 (73%) patients. Only two (3%) required admission because of persisting abdominal pain and vomiting, respectively. Intravenous antibiotics resolved the inflammatory process in both cases. In the remaining 68 (97%), ambulatory treatment was completed without complication.

Conclusion

Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective and applicable to most patients with tolerance to oral intake and without severe comorbidity and having appropriate family support.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^116GwU69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

This individual‐patient data meta‐analysis included 1109 patients, 545 in the observational group and 564 in the antibiotics group. Duration of follow‐up was comparable between the groups: 12.3 (i.q.r. 12.1–13.0) months in the observational group and 12.4 (12.1–13.0) months in the antibiotics group. Baseline characteristics were mostly comparable; however, primary diverticulitis was slightly but significantly more common in the antibiotics group (Table 2).

Baseline characteristics of patients according to study group

Observational versus antibiotic treatment

The duration of stay for the initial hospital admission was slightly but non‐significantly shorter in the observational group compared with the antibiotics group (median 2 versus 3 days respectively; P = 0.037) (Table 3). Some 33 of 1109 patients (3.0 per cent) were treated as outpatients from the start of treatment. The rate of ongoing diverticulitis differed somewhat, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance: 7.2 per cent (39 of 545) in observational group versus 5.0 per cent (28 of 564) in the antibiotics group (P = 0.062). The rates of recurrent diverticulitis were comparable: 8.6 per cent (47 of 545) versus 9.6 per cent (54 of 564) respectively (P = 0.610). Complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection rates were recorded during the acute disease stage (within 1 month) and at 1‐year follow‐up. Rates of complicated diverticulitis within 1 month were comparable between groups: 1.8 per cent (10 of 545) in the observational group versus 1.1 per cent (6 of 564) in antibiotics group (P = 0.204); at 1‐year follow‐up they differed somewhat (by 10 patients), but non‐significantly: 4.0 per cent (22 of 545) versus 2.1 per cent (12 of 564) respectively (P = 0.079). Rates of sigmoid resection were no different between the groups at 1 month (0.6 per cent (3 of 545) versus 0.7 per cent (4 of 564); P = 0.818) or 1 year (5.0 per cent (27 of 545) versus 2.5 per cent (14 of 564); P = 0.214).
