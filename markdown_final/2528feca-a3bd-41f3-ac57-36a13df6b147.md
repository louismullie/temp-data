## Question

A 60-year-old woman who is 10 years post-menopausal comes in due to a recent onset of mid-thoracic back pain. Thoracic spine x-rays demonstrate a vertebral compression fracture. She is 5'4" and weighs 115 lbs. She undergoes DXA screening for osteoporosis. The correct T-score to initiate treatment for osteoporosis in this patient is:

a) < -1.0

b) < -2.5

c) < -1.5

d) None of the options are correct

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which T-score threshold should trigger osteoporosis treatment in a 60-year-old, 10-year postmenopausal woman who has just sustained a vertebral compression fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the WHO diagnostic definition of osteoporosis by T-score. Then, I should verify how a fragility fracture changes the treatment threshold regardless of T-score. Next, I will review major guidelines to confirm whether a vertebral fracture alone mandates therapy. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent discrepancies between diagnostic and treatment criteria and select the best answer from the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic definition so I don't jump to conclusions: osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or lower at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, whereas osteopenia corresponds to T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5, and normal is T-score at or above −1.0, so option b (< −2.5) would be the diagnostic threshold, not necessarily the treatment threshold in all contexts.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical impact of a fragility fracture, because that often overrides BMD thresholds; a low-trauma vertebral compression fracture is itself a major osteoporotic fracture and places the patient at very high risk for subsequent fractures, and multiple sources emphasize that the occurrence of a vertebral fracture — even with BMD not in the osteoporosis range — warrants treatment for secondary fracture prevention, so I should not wait for a T-score to reach −2.5 if a fragility fracture has occurred [^116rBs7A] [^1133tBTK] [^115ceMto].

> Hold on, I should verify this against guideline direction; the USPSTF supports screening and treatment decisions that reduce fractures, and contemporary endocrine and spine guidance operationalize a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis and recommend pharmacotherapy after a major fragility fracture irrespective of T-score, which means treatment is indicated now regardless of the DXA result in this patient with a vertebral fracture [^117KsQdR] [^117FrEX7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the question might be asking for the diagnostic T-score cutoff, which would be −2.5, but that would ignore the fact that a prevalent vertebral fracture already establishes high to very high fracture risk and justifies treatment even if the T-score is above −2.5; so the correct clinical answer is that treatment should be initiated now, irrespective of the T-score, which means none of the numeric T-score options is the right trigger in this scenario [^116rBs7A] [^1133tBTK].

> I should double-check the options against this reasoning: a) < −1.0 is too low a threshold for routine treatment in the absence of fracture; b) < −2.5 is the diagnostic definition but does not capture the indication created by a vertebral fracture; c) < −1.5 is sometimes used as an intervention threshold in special contexts but is not the standard here; d) none of the options are correct because the presence of a vertebral fracture alone mandates treatment regardless of T-score, so the best choice is d [^117FrEX7] [^116rBs7A].

> Let me reconsider to ensure I'm not missing a nuance; some societies discuss lower T-score thresholds for "very high risk" in the absence of fracture, but those are not needed here because a vertebral fracture already fulfills a high-risk criterion that compels therapy, so the conclusion stands that treatment is indicated now and no specific T-score threshold listed applies to this patient's decision point [^1133tBTK] [^117FrEX7].

---

The correct answer is **None of the options are correct** because a postmenopausal woman with a vertebral compression fracture has clinical osteoporosis regardless of T-score, and treatment should be initiated immediately [^117MYr9p] [^115ceMto]. The T-score threshold of **≤ −2.5** defines osteoporosis by BMD alone, but a fragility fracture overrides this and mandates therapy [^117MYr9p] [^115ceMto].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis

Osteoporosis is defined by the WHO as a **T-score ≤ −2.5** at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip [^1177QWTj] [^117MYr9p]. However, in postmenopausal women, a fragility fracture — especially a vertebral compression fracture — establishes a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis regardless of T-score [^117FrEX7] [^117MYr9p].

---

## Clinical guidelines for treatment initiation

Current guidelines recommend initiating osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women who have had a fragility fracture, irrespective of T-score [^117MYr9p] [^115ceMto]. The presence of a vertebral compression fracture places the patient at **high risk for subsequent fractures**, making pharmacologic therapy indicated regardless of BMD [^116rBs7A] [^111Djo8Y].

---

## Role of T-score in treatment decisions

While T-score is used to diagnose osteoporosis, it does not solely determine treatment initiation in the presence of a fragility fracture [^117FrEX7]. Treatment should begin immediately after a vertebral compression fracture is confirmed, as the risk of future fractures is significantly increased [^111Djo8Y] [^115ceMto].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Treatment initiation** |
|-|-|
| T-score ≤ −2.5 without fracture | Initiate treatment |
| T-score > −2.5 with vertebral compression fracture | Initiate treatment |
| T-score > −2.5 without fracture | Consider treatment based on fracture risk assessment (FRAX) |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **None of the options are correct** [^notfound]. A postmenopausal woman with a vertebral compression fracture has clinical osteoporosis and should start osteoporosis treatment regardless of T-score [^116rBs7A]. The T-score threshold of ≤ −2.5 applies to BMD-based diagnosis only and does not override the indication to treat after a fragility fracture [^1177QWTj].

### Effect of abaloparatide on fracture incidence and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at highest risk for fracture [^116rBs7A]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment-emergent AEs observed with abaloparatide were consistent with those observed in the overall ACTIVE population. In prior analyses, although abaloparatide treatment was associated with a transient increase in heart rate when compared to placebo, it did not increase the risk of serious cardiac AEs.

There are some considerations for the study. Approximately 80% of the ACTIVE population met guideline criteria for being at very high risk for fractures. An indicator of high risk for future fractures is the occurrence of a vertebral fracture, even in the absence of a T score meeting the threshold for osteoporosis classification. However, unless deliberate efforts are made to identify vertebral fractures through the utilization of imaging such as x-rays or vertebral fracture assessment, most will go undetected. Although the AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines require a fracture to be recent for an individual to be considered at very high fracture risk and do not include prevalent vertebral fractures, this criterion was included in this study because morphometric vertebral fractures at baseline were accurately ascertained even though their recency could not be established. Additionally, The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research guidelines specify vertebral fractures as criteria to be considered at high risk of fracture when determining treatment for secondary fracture risk reduction. Regardless of the definition, abaloparatide therapy reduces fracture risk across a range of fracture probabilities.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

North American Spine Society (NASS) osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures guideline — scope and population — encompasses adults (18 years or older) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture(s) defined as compression fracture of the vertebral body due to decreased cortical or trabecular bone density secondary to osteoporosis, and fractures may or may not be symptomatic and may or may not result in clinically significant deformity and/ or neurologic deficit. The guideline outlines a reasonable evaluation of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures and treatment options for adult patients with this condition, is based upon a systematic review of clinical literature available as of September 30, 2020, and does not cover all treatment options for osteoporosis. It states that THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A "STANDARD OF CARE", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol, and emphasizes that treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment and experience.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^115vRpA2]. The Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) after vertebral augmentation — identify risk factors and evidence grades as follows: Long duration of menopause and preoperative multi-level vertebral fractures are risk factors for adjacent vertebral compression fractures (AVCF) after percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), whereas high-level bone mineral density (BMD) is protective, and this was graded as Level IV evidence after downgrading. Low BMD T-score and treatment by cement augmentation are associated with increased risk of new OVCFs after treatment; this study was downgraded to Level IV evidence because of less than 80% follow-up, nonconsecutive patients, and nonrandomization. Osteoporosis and intervertebral discal cement leakage were reported as the most important risk factors affecting new vertebral compression fractures (NVCFs) after vertebral augmentation, and this was graded as Level IV evidence. In a prospective randomized control trial, vertebroplasty clinical outcome was not influenced by cement viscosity, but lower cement viscosity and higher degree of osteoporosis were significant risk factors for cement leakage, and the number of vertebral body fractures on presentation predicted new fractures postoperatively; this paper was downgraded from potential Level I to Level II evidence, noting higher cement leakage post-VP in those with lower T-score and those injected with low-viscous cement, and higher postoperative new fracture rates in patients with multiple preoperative fractures. A work group narrative stated that a majority of the evidence supported this recommendation, but one outlier did not find a statistically significant effect on new vertebral fractures.

### Probability of achieving bone mineral density treatment goals with denosumab treatment in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^111xDxL8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Goal-directed treatment is critical in managing chronic health conditions and setting achievable treatment targets that guide initial treatment and treatment adjustments. In patients with osteoporosis, reducing the risk of first or recurrent fracture and increasing BMD can be considered the main treatment goals. Studies show that BMD levels achieved after the initiation of osteoporosis medication (denosumab, alendronate, zoledronic acid, or romosozumab) are robust indicators of subsequent fracture risk.BMD levels attained at the TH are the most consistent predictors of the subsequent risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures.

For interpreting BMD determinations by DXA, T-score is the established outcome reported since it reduces differences by DXA manufacturer and model and is the most feasible output in clinical practice. Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score of −2.5 or less, at one of the main skeletal sites, and many guidelines suggest initiating treatment for individuals with T-scores in this osteoporosis range. Furthermore, a T-score above the osteoporotic range (ie, > −2.5) has been proposed as a minimum target for osteoporosis treatment; however, higher target T-scores may be required in patients with higher fracture risk, due to prior fracture history, advanced age, or other major clinical risk factors.

The antiresorptive agent denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high specificity to the human RANK ligand, reduces osteoclast number and activity, thereby reducing bone resorption. In the Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM; NCT00089791) study, postmenopausal women randomized to receive denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 mo for 3 yr had improved BMD at TH and LS and a reduced risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures compared with those randomized to placebo. In women who entered the extension phase of the study, FREEDOM Extension (NCT00523341), with denosumab treatment for up to an additional 7 yr, the yearly incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures remained low, and BMD continued to increase without plateau (LS, 21.7%; TH, 9.2%; femoral neck, 9.0%). In addition, with continuous denosumab treatment, subsequent fracture risk was predicted by TH T-score achieved at any time throughout the 10 yr of observation.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, clinical indications

Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers, if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on the overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient who is taking high dose glucocorticoids may lose bone much more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessment may be appropriate in older individulas. A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with T-score between − 1.50 and − 1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between − 2.0 and − 2.49) for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

### Effect of abaloparatide on fracture incidence and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at highest risk for fracture [^1133tBTK]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Medicare claims data show that 10% of women aged ≥ 65 years with a clinical fracture will sustain another fracture within the next year, and 31% will sustain another fracture within 5 years. Following an initial fracture, mortality rates were found to be 19% and 64% within 1 and 5 years, respectively. These statistics highlight the importance of identifying postmenopausal women at risk for fracture, and the critical need to prescribe appropriate therapies that can rapidly improve bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce fracture risk in these individuals.

Among different organizations, criteria for the identification and classification of women with osteoporosis at high fracture risk are varied. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) consider individuals to be at a very high fracture risk if they meet any of the following criteria: a recent fracture within the past 12 months, multiple fractures, a history of injurious falls or a high risk for falls, fracturing while on an approved osteoporosis treatment or medications known for causing skeletal harm (eg, long-term glucocorticoids), a very low T score (eg, less than −3.0), or very high fracture risk probability (ie, major osteoporotic fracture [MOF] > 30% or hip fracture > 4.5%) by FRAX or another validated fracture risk algorithm. Other organizations (eg, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [ACOG], Endocrine Society [ES], and The Menopause Society) utilize similar criterion. - For example, both The Menopause Society and ACOG criteria for very high fracture risk classification include BMD loss (vs experiencing a fracture for AACE/ACE) while on antiresorptive treatment, while ES guidelines include severe or multiple vertebral fractures or a low BMD T score at the hip or spine of < −2.5 (vs < −3.0 for AACE/ACE) as part of their high fracture risk criteria.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: B-cell lymphomas 3.2025 [^113UwSEP]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

B-cell lymphomas — bone health in patients receiving steroid-containing regimens states that steroid-containing systemic therapy regimens have been associated with increased risk of fractures and treatment-induced bone loss, with higher risk among young females with chemotherapy-induced premature menopause and older patients receiving chemotherapy; patients with newly diagnosed B-cell lymphomas are also at risk of low bone mineral density (BMD), which may worsen during steroid-based systemic therapy. Referral to an endocrinologist with expertise on bone health and initiation of treatment as per National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines is recommended for patients with osteoporotic BMD, with a history of hip or vertebral fractures, or with asymptomatic vertebral compression deformity. Evaluation of vitamin D levels and post-treatment BMD evaluation using a fracture risk assessment tool is recommended for patients receiving steroid-based systemic therapy, and adequate calcium intake is essential since corticosteroids block calcium absorption and increase the risk of fracture. Raloxifene or hormone replacement therapy up until the expected time of natural menopause could be considered in appropriate patients with premature menopause. Bisphosphonates should be used as first-line pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis, and denosumab is an effective alternative option to prevent osteoporotic fractures in patients who cannot tolerate or whose symptoms do not improve with bisphosphonate therapy.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1177QWTj]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force osteoporosis — definitions and burden: In 1994, the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis in postmenopausal White women as bone density at the hip or lumbar spine that is 2.5 standard deviations or lower (T score ≤ −2.5) than the mean bone mineral density measured at that site for a reference population of young healthy White women; fragility fractures are fractures sustained from a fall from standing height or lower that would not cause a fracture in most healthy persons. The age-adjusted prevalence of osteoporosis is 12.6% among community-dwelling US residents 50 years or older, with higher prevalence among persons 65 years or older (21% in women and 5.7% in men), and evidence shows that only 40% to 60% of persons experiencing a hip fracture recover their prefracture level of mobility and ability to perform activities of daily living.

### Fracture prevention with infrequent zoledronate in women 50 to 60 years of age [^11471BGu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Zoledronate prevents fractures in older women when administered every 12 to 18 months, but its effects on bone density and bone turnover persist beyond 5 years. Whether infrequent zoledronate administration would prevent vertebral fractures in early postmenopausal women is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a 10-year, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving early postmenopausal women (50 to 60 years of age) with bone mineral density T scores lower than 0 and higher than -2.5 (scores of -1 or higher typically indicate normal bone mineral density) at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or hip. Participants were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of zoledronate at a dose of 5 mg at baseline and at 5 years (zoledronate-zoledronate group), zoledronate at a dose of 5 mg at baseline and placebo at 5 years (zoledronate-placebo group), or placebo at both baseline and 5 years (placebo-placebo group). Spinal radiographs were obtained at baseline, 5 years, and 10 years. The primary end point was morphometric vertebral fracture, which was assessed semiquantitatively and defined as at least a 20% change in vertebral height from that seen on the baseline radiograph. Secondary end points were fragility fracture, any fracture, and major osteoporotic fracture.

Results

Of 1054 women with a mean age of 56.0 years at baseline, 1003 (95.2%) completed 10 years of follow-up. A new morphometric fracture occurred in 22 women (6.3%) in the zoledronate-zoledronate group, in 23 women (6.6%) in the zoledronate-placebo group, and in 39 women (11.1%) in the placebo-placebo group (relative risk, zoledronate-zoledronate vs. placebo-placebo, 0.56 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.34 to 0.92; P = 0.04]; and zoledronate-placebo vs. placebo-placebo, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P = 0.08]). The relative risk of fragility fracture, any fracture, and major osteoporotic fracture was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.93), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.86), respectively, when zoledronate-zoledronate was compared with placebo-placebo and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.02), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97), and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.99), respectively, when zoledronate-placebo was compared with placebo-placebo.

Conclusions

Ten years after trial initiation, zoledronate administered at baseline and 5 years was effective in preventing morphometric vertebral fracture in early postmenopausal women.

### Denosumab-bmwo [^111GWB5B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis

The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled women had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that affect bone were excluded from this study. The 7808 enrolled women were aged 60 to 91 years with a mean age of 72 years. Overall, the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.8, and 23% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (N = 3906) or denosumab 60 mg (N = 3902) once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.

The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years. Vertebral fractures were diagnosed based on lateral spine radiographs (T4-L4) using a semiquantitative scoring method. Secondary efficacy variables included the incidence of hip fracture and nonvertebral fracture, assessed at 3 years.

Effect on Vertebral Fractures

Denosumab significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001), as shown in Table 3. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the denosumab-treated women. The absolute risk reduction was 4.8% and relative risk reduction was 68% for new morphometric vertebral fractures at year 3.

Denosumab was effective in reducing the risk for new morphometric vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, baseline BMD, baseline history of fracture, or prior use of a drug for osteoporosis.

Effect on Hip Fractures

The incidence of hip fracture was 1.2% for placebo-treated women compared to 0.7% for denosumab-treated women at year 3. The age-adjusted absolute risk reduction of hip fractures was 0.3% with a relative risk reduction of 40% at 3 years (p = 0.04) (see Figure 1).

Effect on Nonvertebral Fractures

Treatment with denosumab resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of nonvertebral fractures (see Table 4).

14.1 Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis

The efficacy and safety of denosumab in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled women had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip. Women with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that affect bone were excluded from this study. The 7808 enrolled women were aged 60 to 91 years with a mean age of 72 years. Overall, the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.8, and 23% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (N = 3906) or denosumab 60 mg (N = 3902) once every 6 months. All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.

### Ibandronate sodium [^111SHTp3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

Daily Dosing

The effectiveness and safety of ibandronate sodium were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study (Treatment Study) of 2946 women aged 55 to 80 years, who were on average 21 years postmenopause, who had lumbar spine BMD 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1 to L4], and who had 1 to 4 prevalent vertebral fractures. Ibandronate sodium was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment. The diagnosis of an incident vertebral fracture was based on both qualitative diagnosis by the radiologist and quantitative morphometric criterion. The morphometric criterion required the dual occurrence of 2 events: a relative height ratio or relative height reduction in a vertebral body of at least 20%, together with at least a 4 mm absolute decrease in height. All women received 400 international units vitamin D and 500 mg calcium supplementation per day.

Effect on Fracture Incidence

Ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral (primary efficacy measure) and of new and worsening vertebral fractures. Over the course of the 3-year study, the risk for vertebral fracture was 9.6% in the placebo-treated women and 4.7% in the women treated with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg (ibandronate) (p < 0.001) (see Table 3).

### Identifying younger postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using USPSTF-recommended osteoporosis risk assessment tools [^111u1uG8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, we compared the predictive utility of 3 guideline-recommended osteoporosis calculators — ORAI, OSIRIS, and OST — for identifying osteoporosis in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years. Discrimination of ORAI or OSIRIS were less than ideal in identifying osteoporosis at the hip or the lumbar spine, with AUCs of 0.741 or lower across all score thresholds. At best, the published and alternative cutoffs evaluated yielded only fair to moderate discrimination between women with vs women without osteoporosis. By comparison, the AUC for OST was 0.716 at all thresholds or 0.653 at the guideline-recommended threshold, highlighting that adding risk factors in ORAI (estrogen use) and in OSIRIS (estrogen use and history of fracture) not included in OST did not appreciably increase overall discrimination, merely reconfiguring the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, discrimination in identifying osteoporosis at the femoral neck was good for all 3 tools, with AUCs across all thresholds ranging from 0.818 to 0.830.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, bisphosphonate therapy: One paper provides Level III evidence that in patients with acute OVCFs, in addition to PVP, Z significantly reduced recurring fracture risk and increased BMD. In a retrospective comparative study of intravenous zoledronic acid (ZOL) and oral alendronate (ALN) in osteoporotic patients with a low trauma fracture, the authors concluded that ZOL and ALN both produce a significant increase in BMD and are well tolerated, and that yearly ZOL provides a safe, convenient alternative to weekly oral bisphosphonates; however, the work group downgraded this potential Level III paper due to nonconsecutive patients, no validated outcomes being measured, and the diagnostic method not being stated. This paper provides Level IV evidence that in patients with osteoporosis and an acute VCF, patients with OVCF treated with ALN had significantly fewer fractures at one year compared to ZOL, and the work group recommends high-quality prospective studies evaluating the role of medical treatment of the underlying bone loss to improve long-term outcomes such as reduction in risk of future fragility fractures in patients presenting with symptomatic acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease in the US and worldwide, with the prevalence in the United States eclipsing more than 50 million patients. Among Caucasians in the United States over the age of 50, lifetime osteoporotic fracture risk is 50% for women and 20% for men. These fractures are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and impose a significant economic strain. It is projected that by 2025, healthcare costs associated with these fractures will contribute upwards of $25 billion in healthcare spending with the incidence expected to continually increase thus further contributing to this cost.

Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common location for osteoporotic fractures. While these fractures have a large overlap with vertebral fragility fractures, which encompasses fractures resulting from osteoporosis as well as other causes of bone fragility, VCFs are specifically the result of osteoporosis-related weakening of the trabecular bone. While most of these fractures are subclinical, they can cause considerable pain, disability, and deformity impairing mobility and limiting independence, thus reducing quality of life and shortening life expectancy. Additionally, VCFs are associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk for developing subsequent vertebral fractures. Patients with severe pain with advanced imaging findings suggestive of a VCF often require surgical vertebral augmentation with vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty. While surgical intervention plays a crucial role in treating these fractures, it is equally important to use preventative measures to help reduce the risk of osteoporotic VCFs from developing. The use of osteoporosis medications such as anti-resorptive agents and bone forming agents have specifically helped to address this by reducing the incidence of spine and hip fractures by up to 50% over 3 years. Unfortunately, many patients never receive these medications due to lack of screening for osteoporosis and failure to promptly identify osteoporosis and treat it.

Although several guidelines including those from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2020, The Menopause Society 2021, and The American College of Radiology 2022recommend bone density evaluation, particularly if there is concern for VCF, the true proportion of patients who undergo screening or receive osteoporosis treatment following vertebroplasty and/or kyphoplasty remains unknown. The goal of this study was, therefore, to investigate the true frequency of osteoporosis screening and treatment among patients undergoing kyphoplasty for VCFs. Despite current recommendations and the effectiveness of kyphoplasty in treating severe VCFs, we hypothesized that many patients may not receive the appropriate osteoporosis treatment needed to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the risk of subsequent VCFs.

Diagnostic accuracy of central DXA bone mineral density (BMD) for fracture prediction: Central DXA "measures BMD at central bone sites (the hip and lumbar spine) and is the established standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis", and was used for T score determination in trials. Across 13 cohorts, the discrimination of BMD alone for predicting major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) showed AUCs "ranging from 0.60 to 0.80", and for hip fracture, AUCs "ranging from 0.64 to 0.86". In women aged 45 to 54 years, femoral neck BMD predicted fracture with an AUC of "0.64 (95% CI, 0.63–0.66) over a follow-up of 3 to 12 years", while in men 65 years or older, AUCs were "0.76 (95% CI, 0.71–0.80) for the prediction of MOF and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72–0.81) for the prediction of hip fracture" over "15.8 years" of follow-up.

2.2.1 Diagnostic Challenges

There is a lack of international consensus regarding appropriate diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis in premenopausal women. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Calcified Tissue Society together recommend the diagnosis of osteoporosis in premenopausal women with vertebral and/or multiple fragility fractures with low aBMD, defined by the IOF as a Z‐score ≤ ‐2 prior to 20 years of age, and a T‐score < ‐2.5 in older premenopausal women who have attained peak bone mass. The IOF also recognises aBMD T‐score < ‐2.5 at the spine or hip in a premenopausal woman with an underlying chronic disease affecting bone metabolism, as consistent with osteoporosis. The IOF recommends use of T‐scores in premenopausal women to maintain consistency with the World Health Organisation criteria for postmenopausal osteoporosis but acknowledges the recommendations by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry to report Z‐scores rather than T‐scores in premenopausal women. For Z‐scores, a comparison to average age‐matched and sex‐matched BMD, a score ≤ ‐2 is classified as 'below the expected range for age'. This is particularly relevant when assessing younger adults as factors other than osteoporosis may also contribute to low bone density, such as low peak bone mass and osteomalacia due to an underlying chronic disease or other factors described above. For clarity and to maintain consistency with much of the published literature, we have used the term osteoporosis in premenopausal women presenting with fracture (regardless of bone density) and 'low bone density' to identify premenopausal women presenting with aBMD Z‐score ≤ ‐2 without fracture.

BMD interpretation

Absolute BMD values differ between the vendors due to inherent differences in how each technology works. However, for diagnostic classification, this value is converted into a T-score and/or Z-score value which is a patient's BMD represented in standard deviations in comparison to a reference population, with a precision of 1 decimal place. The ISCD guidance recommends that T-scores are preferred in postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women, and men over the age age 50 years, whereas Z-scores for younger individuals. On the other hand the International Osteoporosis Foundations (IOF) supports the use of T-scores in premenopausal women and men under the age of 50 years as well. As described in Part I, the standard skeletal sites for DXA measurement are the hip (total hip and femoral neck) with the femoral neck being designated by the IOF as the reference site for epidemiological studies, the L1-L4 region of the lumbar spine, and radius. However, in chronic arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, BMD should not be measured at the radius, because there is local, juxta-articular bone loss resulting in a lower BMD than in other parts of the skeleton. BMD in g/cm2 is used primarily for input into fracture risk algorithms (e.g. FRAX) and to monitor the skeletal effects of osteoporosis. Incorporating ethnicity into FRAX (US, South Africa and Singapore versions) aims to help calibrate interventions appropriately, addressing racial disparities in fracture risk assessment and intervention thresholds. It is important to note that the significance of ethnicity varies by location; for instance, black individuals in the US exhibit lower fracture probabilities than Caucasians. However, their fracture risk remains higher than that of African black individuals, partly due to differing fracture rates and lower mortality risks in the US population. Despite the widespread acceptance of FRAX, it is advised that it be considered as an important reference platform rather than a definitive gold standard tool in fracture risk assessment. Applying the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, a T-score value less than or equal to -2.5 at the lumbar spine, one-third (33%) radius, femoral neck, or total hip is consistent with osteoporosis, while T-values ≥ -1.0 at these ROIs represent normal BMD. Diagnostic classification is based on the lowest T-score at any of the recommended DXA regions. Caution is advised when performing forearm measurements, as this is not the most relevant site for fracture risk assessment. A T-score between − 2.5 and − 1.0 is defined as "osteopenia", "low bone mass" or "low bone density" Table 1). In children and adolescents, premenopausal women, and men under the age of 50 years, the ISCD recommendation is to use Z-scores, although IOF has recommended use of T-scores in younger men and premenopausal women who are no longer growing. In these younger populations, a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is defined by ISCD as "bone mineral density below the expected range for age", with the suggestion that the terms osteopenia or osteoporosis should not be used to classify BMD measurements in these patients. In contrast, the IOF recommends that, in order to ensure consistency with the WHO operational definition of osteoporosis, a T-score ≤ -2.5 in premenopausal women and men younger than 50 years may be viewed as diagnostic of osteoporosis in the presence of skeletal fragility. Indeed the IOF and ESCEO positions solely recognise this WHO operational definition as the clinical diagnostic criterion for osteoporosis, maintaining a distinction between diagnostic and intervention thresholds, and avoiding conflation of risk factor with outcome. However, in recent years, some other societies (EANM, ASBMR and CSEM) have pragmatically proposed that a diagnosis of osteoporosis may be presumed in the presence of a prior low-trauma major osteoporotic fracture, even with a normal BMD (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis). This, however, does not exclude other sites, including fracture of the humerus, ribs, tibia (excluding the ankle) and other femoral fractures. It is also possible that the vertebral fracture sustained in the remote past may have been in association with a significant trauma. Historical information may be of value to clarify this.

Proximal junctional failure (PJF) after surgery for osteoporotic vertebral collapse: PJF was found in 16% within 4 years after surgery; independent risk factors were severe osteoporosis and extended fusion to the sacrum, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) with cut-off value 0.61 g/ cm2 may potentially predict PJF; Level IV evidence also indicates that severe baseline osteoporosis is associated with PJF and that lumbar BMD rather than hip BMD is predictive of PJF.

1.1 Overview of Osteoporosis

International guidelines recommend fracture risk assessment in all post‐menopausal women, with consideration given to the assessment of clinical risk factors and secondary drivers of osteoporosis and accelerated bone loss (as described in Table 1). Where there is clinical concern, DXA screening is advised along with optimisation of relevant modifiable risk factors. Following a minimal trauma fracture, all patients should be screened for risk factors, regardless of BMD, to mitigate risk of future fractures.

TABLE 1
Clinical risk factors and potential secondary drivers of osteoporosis and accelerated bone loss.

A comprehensive clinical assessment including DXA is recommended in premenopausal women with fragility fracture, or an underlying chronic disease affecting bone metabolism (see Table 1). However, routine DXA screening is not recommended in premenopausal women without risk factors. For those without a clear underlying cause for fragility fracture, genetic screening may be appropriate particularly in the presence of clinical and biochemical characteristics which increase suspicion of a genetic condition such as osteogenesis imperfecta, hypophosphatasia or other genetic syndromes with a phenotype of increased fracture risk. The yield has been shown to be higher if testing is targeted in young adults < 55yo with two or more peripheral fractures, high normal BMI, and/or a positive family history of osteoporosis. Important considerations in determining whether genetic testing is pursued include the likelihood of changes to management, potential impact on family planning and, of course, accessibility of tests.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: In adults with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, it is suggested that there is optimal timing for treatment with vertebral augmentation and delayed treatment is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Grade of Recommendation: B. Evidence cited includes randomized data from the VAPOUR study indicating clinically significant benefits when vertebroplasty is performed within 6 weeks of fracture, with Level I evidence that early VP done within 6 weeks of fracture onset shows lower NRS pain scores and lower RMDQ at up to 6 months; comparative studies describe kyphoplasty outcomes in acute (< 10 weeks) versus chronic (> 16 weeks) fractures, and timing of BKP where early is ≤ 2 months. This paper provides Level II evidence that patients over 65 years old with OVCF and undergoing BKP within 2 months have significantly lower back pain scores at final follow-up (after 6 months) compared to those after 2 months.

In this study 541 postmenopausal women were treated with 20 mcg FORTEO subcutaneously once daily.

All women received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. Baseline and endpoint spinal radiographs were evaluated using the semiquantitative scoring. Ninety percent of the women in the study had 1 or more radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures defined as changes in the height of previously undeformed vertebrae. Such fractures are not necessarily symptomatic.

For kyphoplasty, investigators concluded that "the application of a small amount of PMMA can be considered in order to lower the risk of new fractures in adjacent vertebrae. The postoperative use of anti-osteoporotic medication is recommended for the prevention of new VCFs". Additionally, authors emphasized systemic management: "The most important elements related to reducing NVCF were treating osteoporosis and improving BMD and BMI.

Enrolled patients < 50 years of age were required to have a history of osteoporotic fracture. Enrolled patients ≥ 50 years of age who were in the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation were required to have a baseline BMD T-score of ≤ -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD T-score ≤ -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and a history of osteoporotic fracture.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either an oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control, risedronate 5 mg once daily) (n = 397) or denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously once every 6 months (n = 398) for one year. Randomization was stratified by gender within each subpopulation. Patients received at least 1000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.

Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)

In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to the active-control at one year (Active-control 0.8%, denosumab 3.8%) with a treatment difference of 2.9% (p < 0.001). In the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation, denosumab significantly increased lumbar spine BMD compared to active-control at one year (Active-control 2.3%, denosumab 4.4%) with a treatment difference of 2.2% (p < 0.001). Consistent effects on lumbar spine BMD were observed regardless of gender; race; geographic region; menopausal status; and baseline age, lumbar spine BMD T-score, and glucocorticoid dose within each subpopulation.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^113xsW32]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lifetime risk of an osteoporotic fracture is 50% for women and 20% for men. Of these fractures, vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common. While surgery plays a crucial role in managing these fractures, preventative measures are also critical when addressing the risk of osteoporotic VCFs. Although many recent guidelines recommend osteoporosis evaluation and treatment for patients with VCFs, the true proportion of patients who undergo an osteoporosis workup following their kyphoplasty procedure is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of osteoporosis screening and treatment in patients who undergo a kyphoplasty procedure to correct a vertebral fragility fracture.

Methods

This study utilized the TriNetX Research Network, a database containing de-identified patient information. Using this database, we identified patients from 89 institutions with non-traumatic VCFs and VCFs that resulted from low-energy trauma who subsequently underwent a kyphoplasty procedure. We then analyzed any follow-up osteoporosis treatment or screening they received.

Results

A total of 3371 patients were identified to have undergone kyphoplasty to treat a VCF for the first time. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of its kind to date. Among these patients, 71.3% never had a DEXA scan or prior medical treatment for osteoporosis within 2 years before their kyphoplasty procedure. Additionally, 56.1% of all patients with VCFs treated with kyphoplasty for the first time were never screened or treated for osteoporosis in the two years preceding and 1 year following the procedure.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that only 15.2% of patients with a vertebral fragility fracture secondary to decreased bone density are screened and treated for osteoporosis. Despite existing guidelines recommending osteoporosis evaluation and treatment for patients with VCFs, our findings highlight missed opportunities for intervention. Improving the implementation of existing screening protocols and increasing awareness among healthcare providers could reduce VCF-associated morbidity and mortality.

14.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

The safety and efficacy of once-daily teriparatide injection, median exposure of 19 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 1,637 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In this study 541 postmenopausal women were treated with 20 mcg teriparatide injection subcutaneously once daily.

All women received 1,000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. Baseline and endpoint spinal radiographs were evaluated using the semiquantitative scoring. Ninety percent of the women in the study had 1 or more radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures defined as changes in the height of previously undeformed vertebrae. Such fractures are not necessarily symptomatic.

New Vertebral Fractures — Teriparatide injection, when taken with calcium and vitamin D and compared with calcium and vitamin D alone, reduced the risk of 1 or more new vertebral fractures from 14.3% of women in the placebo group to 5% in the teriparatide injection group (444 of the 541 patients treated with 20 mcg once daily of teriparatide injection were included in this analysis). This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001); the absolute reduction in risk was 9.3% and the relative reduction was 65%. Teriparatide injection was effective in reducing the risk for vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, or baseline BMD (see Table 2).

In another randomized trial, "in patients with new vertebral fractures, elcatonin was shown to alleviate pain as effectively as a combined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and vitamin D3 (VD3) regimen immediately after starting the treatment, and more effectively than for later stages, thereby improving ADL and QOL", and "elcatonin inhibited bone resorption more effectively than NSAID + VD3 and prevented decreases in BMD at other sites, it did not hinder fracture healing". The guideline summarizes Level II evidence that, in acute VCFs, calcitonin was superior to an NSAID "after 2 weeks" and improved quality of life and activities of daily living "at 1 and 3 months".

### Utility of magnetic resonance imaging-based vertebral bone quality score in recognizing patients at risk for secondary fracture after vertebroplasty [^117XkNgd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether the vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score could identify, among patients undergoing vertebroplasty and having probable low bone mineral density, those who were at risk for secondary fracture.

Methods

In this retrospective study, the authors evaluated the medical records of patients with a compression fracture who had undergone vertebroplasty and had preprocedural T1-weighted MRI from January 2016 to January 2021. VBQ scores were calculated as the quotient of the median signal intensity from the L1 to L4 vertebral bodies divided by the signal intensity of L3 cerebrospinal fluid on T1-weighted imaging. A high VBQ score was defined as ≥ 3.0, with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis performed to verify this threshold. Secondary fracture included a fracture at any site after the index vertebroplasty procedure. Time-to-event analysis was performed to determine secondary fracture occurrence.

Results

Among 60 patients eligible for the study, the mean time to follow-up was 25.7 ± 15.4 months (mean ± standard deviation), age was 73.65 ± 10.1 years, BMI was 28.93 ± 6.7, and 57% of the patients were female. The mean VBQ score excluding the lumbar fracture level was 3.44 ± 0.82, which was not significantly different from the mean VBQ score including the fracture level (3.40 ± 0.84; p = 0.401). Secondary fracture occurred in 33.3% of the patients, 85% of whom had a high VBQ score. Fracture occurred more than 60 days after the index procedure in 80% of the patients. Based on time-to-event analysis, secondary fracture occurred more often and earlier in patients with a VBQ score ≥ 3.0.

Conclusions

The VBQ score was not significantly affected by VCF. A high score (≥ 3.0) was common in patients who had undergone vertebroplasty and sustained a secondary fracture. Most fractures occurred ≥ 60 days from vertebroplasty, suggesting that initiation of anti-osteoporosis therapies after such a procedure may be useful. The VBQ score may be helpful in identifying high-risk patients who may need additional evaluation and anti-osteoporosis therapy.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures — risk factors for new fractures after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are described across retrospective studies as follows: In both sexes, "hand grip strength, older age, and lower BMI associated with higher risk of subsequent VF". Level III evidence indicates "lower BMI and higher number of compression fractures are associated with a high risk of new VCF after vertebroplasty", and that "lower BMI (less than 22kg/m2) and greater kyphosis correction are associated with increased hazards of future new VCF in patients undergoing PV for single-level OVCF". Among women after kyphoplasty, those with new VCFs "have lower BMI and longer duration of symptoms compared to those not incurring new VCFs". After percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), "two-thirds of these new fractures occur in vertebrae adjacent to those previously treated", and affected patients differed by "BMI (low BMI vs controls), lower BMD and lower serum PTH levels". One study reported different patterns: "The incidence of new symptomatic VCFs after PVP was higher in osteoporotic patients with initial multiple-level fractures", and Level III evidence stated "a higher BMI and increase in number of initial VCFs are associated with increased risk of new VCFs after PVP". The work group summarized that "The majority of the evidence supports this recommendation, but considering that one article6 showed the opposite (higher BMI with increased initial OCVFs), more research is needed".

Subtheme I.3 perceived importance and benefit, and feasibility of treatment

Whilst some healthcare professionals emphasised the importance of addressing pharmacological treatment after the first fracture in general, especially in old age, others found themselves struggling with the importance of addressing osteoporosis care overall: 'I have some major philosophical problems with both the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. where do you draw the line of risk and benefit?.the majority of people on therapies. will not do them good, statistically speaking (general practitioner)'. Others questioned the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment after a fragility fracture in terms of public health, especially in old age.

Healthcare professionals described that recommending treatment of osteoporosis was often not self-evident. Whilst FLS clinicians stated that they were adept at making clinical judgements on whether treatment should be recommended, they expressed difficulties in deciding whether to recommend treatment at the patient level due to challenges in interpreting clinical guidelines: 'We all come up with a different point of view as to what is actually the best way to manage this individual. Sometimes, like you say, it's a really, really grey area, isn't it? (FLS clinician)'. Furthermore, certain patient characteristics, such as old age and competing health issues or comorbidities, made healthcare professionals doubt the priority of addressing osteoporosis care: 'Preferably you don't fracture your hip, but most people with a hip prothesis are really well of, whilst a diabetic foot… you can't add a new toe (general practitioner)'. Moreover, it was described that in low-income countries, the management of osteoporosis depended on the financial ability of the patient. If the patient had insufficient financial resources to undergo a DXA scanning, osteoporosis care was sometimes not addressed.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^11716KnZ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Part IV: Clinical indications for DXA and VFA

The majority of international guidelines incorporate a case finding strategy based on clinical risk factors. Although screening by DXA is nominally recommended in the United States for all women aged 65 years or older, and men aged 70 years or older, in practice there is little systematic application of this policy. The MRC SCOOP study in the UK demonstrated a 28% reduction in the risk of hip fracture in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial of primary care screening, using FRAX hip fracture probability. Meta-analysis of these findings with trials in the Netherlands and Denmark have demonstrated evidence for screening efficacy and informed a recent IOF position paper supporting implementation of screening for high fracture risk. Various approaches have been suggested internationally to optimise screening efficiency; strategies such as targeting older individuals and use of automated systems which identify those at high risk from primary care records, offer potential ways forward.

For younger adults, DXA testing is recommended for those with a previous fracture or other major risk factors for osteoporosis and fracture such as chronic glucocorticoid use or hypogonadism, (see Tables 4 and 5, and the Statements based on IWG consensus). Other risk factors include lifestyle choices, medical conditions and medications associated with increased fracture risk or accelerated bone loss or those taking or being considered for osteoporosis treatment. A comprehensive list has been developed by the IWG.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for:

Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (1.1)
Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis (1.2)

Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use (1.3)

1.1	Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .]

1.2	Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis

BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3	Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Identifying younger postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using USPSTF-recommended osteoporosis risk assessment tools [^1124rdQa]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

For younger postmenopausal women, clinical guidelines recommend using osteoporosis risk prediction tools to identify candidates with low bone mineral density (BMD). However, the performance of these tools is not well quantified.

Objective

To examine the performance of Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument (ORAI) and Osteoporosis Index of Risk (OSIRIS), compared with Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST), in identifying the presence of osteoporotic BMD in younger postmenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used data from the Women's Health Initiative Bone Density Substudy, which was conducted at 3 clinical centers in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Birmingham, Alabama. Participants were healthy postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years with BMD measurements evaluated using the 3 risk prediction tools: OSIRIS, ORAI, and OST. Risk factors and other participant characteristics were compared across osteoporosis status. Data were collected from October 1993 to December 1998 and analyzed between September 23, 2023, and April 10, 2024.

Exposures

The primary exposures were OSIRIS, ORAI, and OST risk scores.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was osteoporosis defined by BMD T score of -2.5 or lower at 1 or more of 3 anatomical locations: femoral neck, total hip, and/or lumbar spine. The tools were evaluated via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at published score cutoffs and at alternate cutoffs.

Results

Among 6067 included participants (mean [SD] age at baseline, 57.7 [4.1] years), the prevalence of osteoporosis was 14.1% (n = 857) at any 1 of 3 anatomical sites. AUC for identifying osteoporosis at any site was 0.633 (95% CI, 0.633–0.634) for OSIRIS, 0.663 (95% CI, 0.663–0.664) for ORAI, and 0.654 (95% CI, 0.654–0.655) for OST.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, 3 guideline-recommended osteoporosis risk assessment tools had fair to moderate discrimination in identifying osteoporosis defined by lowest BMD at any 1 of 3 skeletal sites. Screening is essential to reducing individual and societal burden of osteoporosis and related fractures, and this study showed a gap in identifying younger postmenopausal women using common clinical risk factors.

Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy.
Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management.
Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, but should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.
Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment.
Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors which are associated with bone loss.
Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies, medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases, and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.
If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care.
A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison is available, and the precise timing depends particular clinical circumstances.
If the DXA interpreter has adequate clinical information, a precise timing for the next BMD should be recommended; otherwise, a general recommendation about repeat testing should still be part of the report.

### Effect of abaloparatide on fracture incidence and bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at highest risk for fracture [^111oZYXe]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Anabolic medications (eg, abaloparatide, teriparatide, and romosozumab), which increase bone formation, followed by antiresorptive treatments (eg, alendronate or denosumab), which reduce bone resorption, have been shown to be effective at decreasing fracture risk and increasing BMD. For individuals at very high fracture risk, the AACE/ACE guidelines recommend treatment with anabolic therapies or antiresorptive agents. Other guidelines (ie, ACOG, ES, and The Menopause Society) also recommend initial treatment with an anabolic agent for individuals at high or very high risk of fracture, such as those with severe or multiple vertebral fractures.-

Abaloparatide is a synthetic, 34-amino acid peptide that selectively binds to the G protein-coupled RG conformation of the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor, which favors increased bone formation while limiting effects on bone resorption markers. Abaloparatide is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture and to increase BMD in men with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.

In the randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints (ACTIVE; identifier: NCT01343004) study, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with abaloparatide for 18 months had a significantly reduced risk of new vertebral fracture (0.6% vs 4.2%), nonvertebral fracture (2.7% vs 4.7%), clinical fracture (4.0% vs 8.3%), and MOF (1.5% vs 6.2%) compared to participants who received placebo. At 18 months, abaloparatide also significantly decreased the risk of MOF compared to teriparatide; however the ACTIVE study was not powered to show superiority of abaloparatide versus teriparatide. Bone mineral density at 6, 12, and 18 months increased significantly at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck in participants treated with abaloparatide versus placebo. When compared with teriparatide, abaloparatide treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck at all study time points, and at the lumbar spine at 6 and 12 months.

### Diagnosing osteoporosis for the spine practitioner [^117FrEX7]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Literature review.

Objectives

Review updated criteria that categorizes patient's bone health for operative and non-operative patients.

Summary Of Background Data

Osteoporosis is common in spine patients including those with fragility fractures and in the elective surgery population. Untreated osteoporosis is associated with secondary spine fractures and increased likelihood of osteoporotic bone related complications after elective surgery. Recently, the definition of osteoporosis is expanded beyond use of bone mineral density (BMD) to also include fracture history and fracture risk. Most spine practitioners are not aware of this definition.

Methods

Recent clinical guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis of osteoporosis are reviewed. Included are the use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), adjuncts such as trabecular bone score and vertebral fracture assessment, and other factors such as comorbidities, fracture history, and opportunistic use of other imaging studies.

Results

The use of the clinical diagnosis based on BMD, fracture history, and fracture risk increases the diagnosis of osteoporosis in spine patients. BMD is measured using DXA, which is sensitive and precise, although errors in analysis and interpretation are common. Fracture history is a strong predictor of secondary fracture and poor surgical outcomes. Reducing fracture risk is the goal of medical treatment but is rarely performed by spine practitioners. Fracture risk can be stratified into low, high, and very high-risk groups. High and very high-risk patients are candidates for medical management. Other clues to the presence of osteoporosis that should prompt further bone health assessment are based on history, height loss, risk factors, and opportunistic use plain radiographs, CT, and MRI.

Conclusions

Spine practitioners should be aware of newer concepts in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Utilizing the clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis based on BMD thresholds, fracture history, and fracture risk will identify patients who should be considered for further health assessment and treatment.

Clinical challenge

Two 70‐year‐old postmenopausal identical twins (Ms DMS and Ms BPS) were seen for a second opinion about their severe osteoporosis. Ms DMS had a vertebral fracture 12 years ago and experienced a wrist fracture in her fifties. She has been treated for nine years with denosumab at 60 mg subcutaneously every six months. Her twin sister has a history of two vertebral fractures 9 and 13 years ago, and she has been taking alendronate at 70 mg orally once a week for the past 15 years. Beyond age, menopausal status, and a family history of an early hip fracture in their mother, neither sister has additional major risk factors for fractures. They have both been reading about adverse effects related to long‐term osteoporosis treatment and are concerned about continuing their medications.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^115qzwBJ]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Osteoporotic fractures are a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Of these fractures, vertebral compression fractures (VCF) are the most common. Our results indicate a significant gap in osteoporosis care following kyphoplasty procedures in the management of VCFs. This highlights the importance of adjusting treatment algorithms for patients following kyphoplasty procedures to enable greater prevention of future fractures and morbidity. It also sheds light on the necessity of identifying patients at risk for VCFs including the use of third-party resources such as Fracture Liaison Services to help reduce rates of refracture in patients who undergo kyphoplasty.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^114kwo6s]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite constituting 31.3% of all patients who underwent kyphoplasty for vertebral compression fractures, males comprised 34.9% of the patients who did not receive any pre- or post-kyphoplasty osteoporosis treatment. In contrast, only 26.8% of patients who received pre-kyphoplasty osteoporosis treatment were males. This discrepancy may partly be attributable to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) not recommending routine osteoporosis screening for men due to insufficient evidence regarding its benefit in preventing osteoporotic fractures. Osteoporosis is four times more common in women, corresponding to a greater focus on female populations and resulting in a lack of extensive research on male osteoporosis screening. However, it is crucial to recognize that men are also at substantial risk for fragility fractures. In fact, current evidence indicates that men experience more osteoporosis-related complications and exhibit a higher mortality rate following osteoporosis fractures, particularly those of the hip, than women, starting from the time of hospital admission. - This emphasizes the importance of developing targeted screening protocols for men to address this critical gap in osteoporosis management.

Our study also evaluated refracture rates by examining the proportion of patients who underwent additional kyphoplasty procedures or had other, non-vertebral fractures more than 3 months after their initial kyphoplasty. We hypothesized that the refracture rate would be higher in the treatment-naive group compared to the cohort of patients with a history of osteoporosis intervention. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the treatment-naive group had a statistically insignificant (P = 0.125), proportion of patients undergoing a second kyphoplasty, indicating a similar refracture rate to the group that underwent treatment and/or screening for osteoporosis. Furthermore, the data in Table 4 and Figure 4 revealed that patients without follow-up osteoporosis evaluation or treatment had significantly lower rates of femur and humerus fractures compared to those with prior osteoporosis evaluation and/or treatment. While this may be a function of underdiagnosis or misclassification in this group leading to fewer documented fractures, it is also possible that patients who did not receive follow-up osteoporosis treatment after kyphoplasty may represent a healthier subset with lower baseline fracture risk. The unexpected refracture rates may also be related to the small treatment group used in our analysis therefore making the rate of refracture difficult to truly measure. Furthermore, the use of a database with deidentified patient information limited our ability to fully elucidate the cause behind this finding. Existing literature generally indicates that refracture rates are higher in treatment-naive patients, highlighting the need for further research to understand these discrepancies.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^11472FPr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

BTMs, such as C‐terminal telopeptide (CTX), also can be used in monitoring the effectiveness of osteoporosis therapy and guiding decisions about drug holidays or treatment reinitiation. CTX reflects the rate of bone resorption, and its levels typically decrease with effective antiresorptive treatment, such as bisphosphonates. A significant drop in CTX from pretreatment levels, defined as more than the least significant change of 30%, suggests that an antiresorptive therapy is effective in suppressing bone turnover. CTX levels also can be used to monitor drug holidays. A common approach involves comparing baseline (predrug holiday) levels with those during the drug holiday. Two potential thresholds for interpretation include a return to baseline levels (pretreatment) or an increase of more than 30% from the end‐of‐treatment levels. Our approach to these two thresholds can be summarized as follows: (1) a return to pretreatment baseline levels or higher (ie, before any bone active drug has been started), indicating complete loss of antiresorptive effect or (2) an increase of more than 30% (above the least significant change of most BTMs) from end‐of‐treatment levels, suggesting excessive bone loss. Measuring BTMs at 6 to 12 months after stopping bisphosphonates might allow clinicians to determine whether therapy should be restarted earlier than BMD alone would suggest, particularly in high‐risk patients. Other BTMs, including urinary N‐telopeptide, can be used in similar ways, albeit urinary turnover markers are more subject to diurnal variations.

### Rate of osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral compression fractures: a retrospective study and review of the literature [^11457A8J]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Vertebral compression fractures, especially those precipitated by osteoporosis, are a widespread issue, particularly within the elderly population. Consequently, our primary objective was to evaluate the prevalence of osteoporosis screening and treatment in patients undergoing a kyphoplasty procedure in the management of their VCF. To our knowledge, this study is the largest to date examining these rates. Our results suggest that only a small proportion of patients with a vertebral compression fracture secondary to decreased bone density are screened and treated for osteoporosis. In fact, among patients never treated or screened for osteoporosis, only 21% received any osteoporosis screening or treatment following their first kyphoplasty procedure.

The inadequacy of follow-up treatment for osteoporosis has been well documented in the setting of VCFs. In a 2021 study, Haffner et al found that in a population of patients with low-energy VCFs, only 11.5% received post-injury DEXA evaluation and only 19.2% received appropriate osteoporosis-targeting pharmacological therapy. Similarly, a study of 156 former military members with VCFs revealed only 38% were treated medically for osteoporosis in the year following their fracture and 39% patients underwent DEXA evaluation. In another large-scale study of 2933 VCF patients performed by Barton et. Al, 98% of patients did not undergo a DEXA scan within the two years before or 1 year following their VCF. Additionally, only 7% were prescribed antiresorptive therapy following their fracture, with 73% of patients never receiving any antiresorptive therapy at all. This study also revealed that 38% of patients went on to develop a second fragility fracture within 2 years. The authors did acknowledge, however, that their figures may be confounded as they did not differentiate between high impact and low impact VCFs in their study population. The profoundly low treatment and screening follow-up rates for VCFs occur despite these fractures being associated with a 5 times greater risk of developing future VCFs and significantly increased mortality rates.

### Identifying younger postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using USPSTF-recommended osteoporosis risk assessment tools [^111ucfeA]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

While ORAI's performance appears better in these smaller studies, these previous studies were conducted in more homogeneous populations, whereas the present study was conducted in a larger and more diverse population. Additionally, a US study of 202 women aged 45 to 64 years recruited from a single city reported an AUC of 0.82 under ORAI for identifying a BMD T score of –2.5 or lower at the femoral neck. For OSIRIS, the original publication did not include younger women and studies in US women have not involved postmenopausal women aged 65 years or younger. These tools were designed and calibrated for prediction of BMD at the femoral neck. However, risk for osteoporosis is usually identified in practice using measures at multiple skeletal sites, and this study found suboptimal performance from these tools in predicting osteoporosis risk when generalized to other BMD anatomical sites, highlighting the innovation of the current study.

A previous study compared 2 other guideline-recommended osteoporosis risk prediction tools — FRAX (designed for fracture prediction) and SCORE (designed for identifying osteoporosis by BMD) — against OST in WHI participants aged 50 to 64 years and reported AUCs of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.56–0.63), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69–0.76), and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72–0.78) for FRAX, SCORE, and OST, respectively, for identifying a femoral neck T score of –2.5 or lower. This study joins a body of literature on tools for predicting osteoporotic BMD and fracture risk among younger postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years. Despite its inclusion in the USPSTF osteoporosis screening guidelines, FRAX has been inferior in selecting postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years for osteoporosis screening with BMD testing.

Limitations

Although the WHI provided a large sample, making the findings generalizable to a substantial number of younger postmenopausal women in the US, the study is not without limitation. WHI participants were healthier, had a higher educational level, and had higher socioeconomic status than the general population; thus, the results may not generalize to less healthy or more socially disadvantaged populations.

### Prevalence and determinants of vertebral fractures in a SLE cohort [^113sY64h]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Determining the optimal timing for OP screening in patients with SLE who are not on ongoing GC therapy, or in whom steroids were discontinued long ago, remains challenging. Currently, no evidence-based thresholds regarding cumulative GC dose or duration of exposure exist to guide screening in such cases.

Based on the findings reported by Garcìa-Carrasco et al, which indicate an annual incidence of 3.5 vertebral fractures per 100 patients with SLE, the estimated number needed to screen to detect one fracture is 15 when performing spinal radiography every 2 years, and 10 when screening is conducted every 3 years. Therefore, we believe it is reasonable not to delay VFA or spinal X-ray screening beyond a 3-year interval.

Moreover, since DXA can be easily complemented by VFA, we might suggest to include such assessment whenever feasible.

Consistent evidence indicates that even asymptomatic radiographic vertebral fractures can contribute to pain, disability, long-term functional impairment and reduced quality of life. These outcomes not only affect patient well-being but also place a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The economic impact of vertebral fractures is considerable, particularly when compounded by other GC-related adverse events, all of which contribute to significantly elevated direct and indirect healthcare costs.

In our study, T-score values at both lumbar and femoral sites were significantly lower in patients with fractures, reinforcing the well-established association between reduced BMD and increased fracture risk. Nonetheless, the mean T-score in patients with fractures remained within the mid-osteopenic range, suggesting that bone quality impairments, beyond mere reductions in bone mass, play a significant role in SLE. A strong correlation was found with GCs exposure indeed. The cumulative steroid dose clearly influenced both the presence and the number of fractures. Evidence on GIOP confirms that chronic steroid exposure significantly increases fracture risk, which cannot be fully attributed to BMD loss alone. Notably, data on pooled inflammatory rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases indicate that chronic GC at doses as low as 2.5 mg/day might increase fracture risk, which can be, however, mitigated by antiresorptive therapy. Given the increasing body of evidence, recent guidelines have lowered the threshold for chronic GC therapy, recommending discontinuation whenever possible due to its strong association with damage accrual in SLE.
