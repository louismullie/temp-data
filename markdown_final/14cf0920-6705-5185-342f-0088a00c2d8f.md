## Question

What is the treatment for fatty liver?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for fatty liver, specifically nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the disease spectrum and staging because treatment hinges on fibrosis stage. Then, I should verify the universal first-line therapy and its weight-loss targets. Next, I will examine diet composition and exercise prescriptions. After that, I need to check which pharmacologic options are actually recommended and in whom, including any newly approved agents. I will then consider bariatric surgery candidacy. Finally, I should review comorbidity management, monitoring, and special populations, and close with a concise, stage-based algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework so I don't jump to conclusions: fatty liver in this context refers to NAFLD, spanning simple steatosis (NAFL) and NASH, with fibrosis staging (F0–F4) driving prognosis and treatment intensity; patients with NASH and fibrosis are at highest risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, so I need to ensure staging informs therapy decisions [^65ad3bd8] [^a30dfba6].

> I should confirm the universal foundation of care: lifestyle modification is first-line for all patients with NAFLD, regardless of stage, because it improves steatosis, NASH activity, and cardiometabolic outcomes; weight loss of about 3–5% improves steatosis, 7–10% improves NASH histology, and around 10% can reverse fibrosis in many patients, though sustainability is challenging and often requires multidisciplinary support [^a30dfba6] [^d1663370] [^3616f3b0].

> Wait, let me verify the diet specifics so I don't overgeneralize: there is no single "best" diet, but a Mediterranean-style pattern with reduced saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars, and with emphasis on fiber, unsaturated fats, and minimally processed foods, is consistently supported; caloric deficits of roughly 500–1000 kcal/day are reasonable, and I should tailor to comorbidities and preferences while avoiding extremes that are hard to maintain long term [^a30dfba6] [^f5e8acd6] [^d1663370].

> I need to check the exercise prescription: at least 150–200 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity is recommended, with resistance training added when feasible; importantly, exercise confers benefits on liver fat and NASH even without weight loss, so I should encourage movement patterns patients can sustain rather than insisting on a single regimen [^a30dfba6] [^3511f864].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacologic options and eligibility, because I recall conflicting statements about approvals: historically, there were no FDA-approved NASH drugs, and off-label use of vitamin E, pioglitazone, and GLP-1 receptor agonists has been considered in selected patients; vitamin E 800 IU/day can improve NASH in non-diabetic adults, pioglitazone improves NASH (especially with diabetes) but may cause weight gain, and semaglutide improves NASH and offers cardiovascular benefit, though none of these demonstrate robust antifibrotic effects and they are not studied in cirrhosis, so I should reserve them for biopsy-proven NASH with fibrosis or high-risk metabolic phenotypes after lifestyle failure [^8e0d5415] [^4c194504] [^d1663370].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were still zero FDA-approved therapies, but I should double-check that: in March 2024, the FDA approved resmetirom (Rezdiffra) for adults with noncirrhotic NASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2–F3), to be used with diet and exercise; in the phase 3 REGENERATE trial, 80–100 mg daily improved NASH resolution and fibrosis versus placebo, marking the first disease-specific approval, so I need to correct my earlier assumption and incorporate this option for eligible patients [^7aba3a7f].

> Next, I should review bariatric surgery candidacy: for patients with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities, metabolic surgery achieves high rates of NASH resolution and fibrosis regression in those without cirrhosis, and reduces long-term cardiovascular and cancer mortality; I need to ensure patients are appropriately selected and counseled on risks and benefits [^2a3e3ee5] [^3616f3b0].

> I will now examine comorbidity management because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in NAFLD: treat hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes aggressively; statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction even in compensated cirrhosis, with careful monitoring in decompensated disease; for type 2 diabetes, prioritize GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors when appropriate because they aid weight loss and may improve NASH, while avoiding agents that worsen liver injury or glycemic control [^17c93dff] [^4c194504] [^62059846].

> Let me consider monitoring and staging so I don't miss progression: noninvasive fibrosis risk scores (FIB-4, NFS) and transient elastography help stratify risk; patients with indeterminate or high risk should be referred to hepatology for further evaluation, and those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis require HCC surveillance and variceal screening per standard protocols; I should confirm that biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing NASH and fibrosis when treatment decisions hinge on histology [^a30dfba6] [^791ac363].

> But wait, what about special populations and emerging therapies: in children, lifestyle intervention is the only recommended therapy and vitamin E may be considered in select cases; for patients with obstructive sleep apnea, CPAP has not shown clear histologic benefit despite plausible mechanisms, so I should focus on weight loss and cardiometabolic optimization; numerous agents targeting metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways are in phase 2–3 trials, suggesting that combination therapy may be the future, but I should avoid investigational agents outside trials [^5be16dea] [^7563e974] [^581a6857].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stage-based algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines: for all patients, implement lifestyle therapy with weight loss, Mediterranean-style diet, and regular exercise; for low-risk patients (F0–F1), continue lifestyle measures and manage comorbidities without liver-directed pharmacotherapy; for high-risk patients (F2–F3 NASH), add pharmacotherapy such as resmetirom if available, or consider vitamin E or pioglitazone in appropriate adults, with GLP-1 agonists favored when obesity/diabetes coexist; for cirrhosis, prioritize decompensation care, HCC/variceal surveillance, and transplant referral, using statins cautiously for cardiovascular risk; throughout, embed multidisciplinary care and reassess fibrosis risk periodically [^a30dfba6] [^8e0d5415] [^7aba3a7f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for everyone, weight loss targets are dose-responsive for liver histology, diet quality and sustained physical activity are key, and pharmacotherapy is reserved for those with NASH and fibrosis or high-risk metabolic phenotypes, with the notable addition of resmetirom as the first FDA-approved option for noncirrhotic NASH with F2–F3 fibrosis; individualized, stage-based care with aggressive cardiometabolic risk reduction yields the best outcomes while we await broader antifibrotic therapies [^a30dfba6] [^7aba3a7f] [^d1663370].

The cornerstone of fatty liver treatment is **lifestyle modification** [^a30dfba6] — weight loss, a Mediterranean-style diet, and at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week [^2a3e3ee5] — which improves steatosis and may reverse NASH and fibrosis when sustained [^3616f3b0]. Weight loss of 3–5% reduces liver fat, 7–10% improves NASH, and ≥ 10% can reverse fibrosis [^d1663370] [^a30dfba6]. Pharmacotherapy is reserved for biopsy-proven NASH with fibrosis [^bfee9d3c]; **pioglitazone or vitamin E** may be considered in selected adults [^4c194504], and semaglutide is reasonable when obesity or diabetes is present [^8e0d5415]. Bariatric surgery is effective for severe obesity with NASH [^2a3e3ee5]. Manage comorbidities aggressively, avoid alcohol, and monitor for progression with noninvasive fibrosis assessment [^a30dfba6].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modification is the **foundation of treatment** for fatty liver disease, with benefits across the NAFLD spectrum [^a30dfba6].

---

### Weight loss

- **Caloric restriction**: Aim for a 500–1,000 kcal/day deficit to achieve 0.5–1 kg/week weight loss [^notfound].
- **Weight loss targets**: 3–5% reduces steatosis; 7–10% improves NASH; ≥ 10% can reverse fibrosis [^d1663370] [^a30dfba6].
- **Sustainability**: Gradual, sustained weight loss is key; rapid weight loss can worsen liver injury [^7014befb].

---

### Dietary patterns

- **Mediterranean diet**: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and unsaturated fats; limit saturated fats, refined carbs, and added sugars [^2a3e3ee5] [^f5e8acd6].
- **Macronutrients**: High-fiber, low-glycemic foods; omega-3s may reduce liver fat but not NASH/fibrosis [^notfound].
- **Alcohol**: Avoid or minimize; even modest intake increases risk in NAFLD [^a30dfba6].

---

### Physical activity

Aim for **≥ 150 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (e.g. brisk walking, cycling) [^a30dfba6]; resistance training 2–3 times/week further improves insulin resistance and liver fat [^notfound]. Even without weight loss, exercise reduces liver fat and improves metabolic health [^554a206c].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacotherapy is reserved for **biopsy-proven NASH with fibrosis** or high-risk patients who fail lifestyle therapy [^bfee9d3c] [^d95f6348].

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Efficacy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pioglitazone | NASH with fibrosis | Improves NASH and fibrosis | Weight gain, edema, fracture risk |
| Vitamin E | NASH without diabetes | Improves NASH | Long-term safety uncertain |
| Semaglutide | NASH with obesity/T2DM | Improves NASH, weight loss | GI side effects, cost |
| Obeticholic acid | NASH with fibrosis | Improves fibrosis | Pruritus, dyslipidemia, not FDA-approved |

---

## Bariatric surgery

Bariatric surgery is indicated for **BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m² with comorbidities** [^notfound]. Procedures such as sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass resolve NASH in 70–90% and reverse fibrosis in many patients [^notfound]. It also improves long-term cardiovascular outcomes [^2a3e3ee5].

---

## Management of comorbidities

Aggressive management of **metabolic comorbidities** is essential [^26dde287].

- **Diabetes**: Prefer GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for glycemic control and weight loss [^62059846].
- **Dyslipidemia**: Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction [^a1b0f685].
- **Hypertension**: Control per guidelines to reduce cardiovascular risk [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is critical to detect progression and guide therapy. Use **noninvasive fibrosis assessment** with FIB-4, transient elastography, or MR elastography to stage and track disease [^a30dfba6]. Monitor liver enzymes, metabolic parameters, and lifestyle adherence at 6–12 month intervals. Continue lifelong follow-up for those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Several agents are in late-phase trials targeting **metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways** [^581a6857]. Combination therapy is likely given disease heterogeneity, and personalized medicine based on genetics and phenotype may optimize outcomes [^d09c9b0a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Lifestyle modification**: First-line for all patients; aim for 7–10% weight loss, Mediterranean diet, and regular exercise [^a30dfba6].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider pioglitazone or vitamin E for NASH with fibrosis; semaglutide for obesity/T2DM [^4c194504] [^8e0d5415].
- **Bariatric surgery**: For severe obesity with NASH refractory to lifestyle therapy [^2a3e3ee5].
- **Comorbidity management**: Aggressive control of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [^26dde287].
- **Monitoring**: Regular noninvasive fibrosis assessment and metabolic follow-up [^a30dfba6].

---

Lifestyle modification is the **cornerstone** of fatty liver treatment, with pharmacotherapy and surgery reserved for selected patients. Sustained weight loss, dietary change, and exercise improve liver histology and reduce cardiovascular risk, while comorbidity management and monitoring prevent progression [^a30dfba6].

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of liver disease in the United States and is strongly associated to the metabolic syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the evidence behind the current recommendations on lifestyle modifications and available treatment options for NAFLD.

Recent Findings

The unrelenting rise in obesity and diabetes epidemic has led to a large healthcare burden from NAFLD and it is projected to continue to grow over the next two decades. Lifestyle modification that leads to weight loss is effective at treating NAFLD, but these modifications require a multidisciplinary approach for success in the real world. Multiple pharmacologic treatment options have been studied with promising results, but none have been approved for treatment in the United States. Clinical trials are on-going to study further pharmacologic treatment alternatives.

Summary

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in United States, and an independent risk factor for mortality. Implementation of lifestyle modifications through a multidisciplinary approach and careful selection of patients for pharmacologic interventions will be essential for successful management of NAFLD.

### Why Do lifestyle recommendations fail in most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? [^d78576d8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized as a major health burden. The efficacy and safety profile of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains uncertain; therefore, lifestyle modification is the first line of treatment. Based on available data, patients should optimally achieve at least a 5% to 10% weight reduction for histologic improvement. There is no clear consensus on the optimal diet or exercise regimen. Sustainability of any intervention is key to success; however, compliance has been a major issue in clinical trials. This finding underscores the importance of multidisciplinary strategies to achieve targeted weigh loss.

### Current therapeutic strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^6ec24ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH) to increasing fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has now become the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries, with the more advanced stages of disease being associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of patients with NAFLD remains a clinical challenge. The aim of this study is to describe established and emerging strategies for the treatment of NAFLD. Relevant research and review articles were identified by searching PubMed. Selected articles referenced in these publications were also examined. Good quality randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the need for multifaceted lifestyle interventions in patients with NAFLD including the need for diet, exercise and behavioural counselling. Despite several trials of pharmacological agents, no highly effective treatment yet exists, with surgery representing the mainstay for advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach, with a major focus on lifestyle change, represents best treatment pending the development of new therapeutic options.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: controlling an emerging epidemic, challenges, and future directions [^bd88c41d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects over 30% of the United States population and is projected to become a leading cause of chronic liver disease by 2020. As a result, the economic and societal burden of NAFLD is far-reaching. The cost of managing NAFLD complications has an estimated 10 year economic burden of $908 billion. This review provides an overview of current knowledge on NAFLD, with emphasis on identifying gaps in its diagnosis and management, and proposes future directions to address these limitations. Despite the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, there is limited knowledge and practice regarding its natural history, staging, diagnosis, and management. Though a challenging task, opportunities for bridging these gaps should focus on the development of noninvasive biomarkers, the elucidation of biological pathways, the creation of up-to-date screening guidelines, and the organization of clinical trials of longer duration to determine clinical endpoints and assess the safety of new treatment options.

### Pathogenesis and novel treatment options for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^5bcfba7d]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease affects 20–40% of the population. Its active form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterised by hepatocyte injury, liver inflammation, and progression of fibrosis, and has emerged as one of the most important causes of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Weight reduction of 10% by dietary restriction and regular exercise is sufficient to reverse NASH in most patients, but in practice this reduction is often not achieved. Available drugs such as vitamin E, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline have borderline efficacy, but are limited by potential side-effects and toxicities, and do not improve liver fibrosis. However, basic and translational research has improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of NASH, thereby identifying several promising new treatment targets. Several drugs are in phase 2 and 3 development and could enter clinical practice in the near future. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis, treatment evaluation, existing therapies, and potential new treatments for NASH.

### Emerging and established therapeutic approaches for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^b8e84f5f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), more recently referred to as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, refers to a disease spectrum ranging from hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and cirrhosis, associated with hepatic complications (including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extrahepatic complications (particularly cardiometabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease). Treatment options include lifestyle interventions (dietary modification and physical activity programs) and pharmacologic interventions. Treatment aims should be broad, with a hepatic focus (to improve/reverse hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and steatohepatitis), ideally with additional extrahepatic effects affecting metabolic co-morbidities (eg, insulin resistance, glucose dysregulation, dyslipidemia), causing weight loss and affording cardiovascular protection. NASH and fibrosis represent the main histopathological features that warrant treatment to prevent disease progression. Despite a paucity of established treatments, the array of potential molecular targets, pathways, and potential treatments is continually evolving. The goal of this article was to provide a narrative review summarizing the emerging and more established therapeutic options considering the complex pathophysiology of NAFLD and the important long-term sequelae of this condition.

Methods

The literature was reviewed by using PubMed, conference abstracts, and press releases from early-phase clinical studies to provide an overview of the evidence.

Findings

As understanding of the pathophysiology of NASH/NAFLD evolves, drugs with different mechanisms of action, targeting different molecular targets and aberrant pathways that mediate hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials. Pharmacologic therapies fall into 4 main categories according to the molecular targets/pathways they disrupt: (1) meta-bolic targets, targeting insulin resistance, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, or substrate utilization; (2) inflam-matory pathways, inhibiting inflammatory cell recruitment/signaling, reduce oxidative/endoplasmic reticulum stress or are antiapoptotic; (3) the liver-gut axis, which modulates bile acid enterohepatic circulation/signaling or alters gut microbiota; and (4) antifibrotic targets, targeting hepatic stellate cells, decrease collagen deposition or increase fibrinolysis.

Implications

Lifestyle modification must remain the cornerstone of treatment. Pharmacologic treatment is reserved for NASH or fibrosis, the presence of which requires histopathological confirmation. The disease complexity provides a strong rationale for combination therapies targeting multiple pathways simultaneously.

### Non-pharmacological management options for MAFLD: a practical guide [^04b766b0]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle changes should be the main basis for any treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), aiming to increase energy expenditure, reduce energy intake and improve the quality of nutrients consumed. As it is a multifactorial disease, approaches such as physical exercise, a better dietary pattern, and possible pharmacological intervention are shown to be more efficient when used simultaneously to the detriment of their applications. The main treatment for MAFLD is a lifestyle change consisting of diet, activity, exercise, and weight loss. The variables for training prescription such as type of physical exercise (aerobic or strength training), the weekly frequency, and the intensity most indicated for the treatment of MAFLD remain uncertain, that is, the recommendations must be adapted to the clinical conditions comorbidities, and preferences of each subject in a way individual. This review addresses recent management options for MAFLD including diet, nutrients, gut microbiota, and physical exercise.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease review: diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^dccc89b7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels in both developed and developing countries. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, are at risk for progressive liver disease and in need of effective treatment options. A practical approach may be pursued by identifying patients with NAFLD with the highest likelihood for histologic evidence of NASH. Despite decades of clinical trials, no single treatment can be recommended to all patients with NASH. Importantly, there is no evidence that pioglitazone or vitamin E improves fibrosis. Bariatric surgeries may improve hepatic histology in morbidly obese patients with NASH, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Currently, NASH is the second leading etiology of liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. The primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD may require aggressive strategies for managing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

### Prevention and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^585f506e]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

A better knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms implicated in the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, linking fatty liver to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, has shifted the goal of treatment from a mere clearing of fat from the liver to a systematic treatment of metabolic risk factors for fatty liver. Any attempt to modify the "unhealthy" habits responsible for fatty liver requires an integrated approach, based on the cognitive theory of behaviour by a multidisciplinary team including physicians, psychologists, dieticians and physical exercise experts, and recent data demonstrate that this is feasible and effective. Whenever this goal is not attained, a treatment based on insulin-sensitizers remains the best option, to simultaneously tackle all metabolic alterations of the metabolic syndrome. However, in individual patients, both raised blood pressure and dyslipidemia need to be controlled, in order to reduce cardiovascular risk. In these areas, any attempt should be made to use of drugs less likely to induce a deterioration of glucose control. It remains to be determined whether these treatments are able to modify the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the long term.

Abstract

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a wide spectrum of pathologies ranging from non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterized by simple steatosis without inflammation, to non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by steatosis of the liver accompanied by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, which can lead to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, a Mediterranean diet and physical activity, only a few NAFLD‐specific pharmacological treatment options such as Vitamin E and Pioglitazone are considered by current international guidelines. However, recently randomized controlled trials with GLP‐1 agonists, FXR and PPAR ligands as well as other agents have been published and may expand the therapeutic armamentarium for NAFLD in the near future. Finally, knowledge about treating complications of end‐stage liver disease due to NASH becomes an increasingly important cornerstone in the treatment of the broad disease spectrum of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize currently available and future treatment options for patients with NAFLD that may help internal medicine specialists treat the complete clinical spectrum of this highly prevalent liver disease.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^072a3c46]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a range of disorders from steatosis and steatohepatitis through to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related death. Therefore, managing this common disorder is becoming an important public health issue. Lifestyle measures are commonly suggested but robust data are lacking. Trials with antioxidants (vitamin E, betaine) as well as cytoprotectants (ursodeoxycholic acid) have been disappointing. While data for insulin sensitizers such as metformin are less conclusive, thiazolidinediones appear promising. However, not all patients respond to thiazolidinediones. Moreover, issues related to weight gain, cardiovascular risk need to be addressed. The use of endocannabinoid antagonists and insulin secretagogues are novel strategies to combat this disorder.

### Treatment candidacy for pharmacologic therapies for NASH [^9a86b44a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has emerged as one of the important causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and over 50 therapeutic agents are in various phases of clinical development. Recently, obeticholic acid has achieved the interim histological endpoint of fibrosis improvement with no worsening of NASH in the phase 3 REGENERATE study, and now patients are being followed for long-term clinical outcomes. Several drugs are in Phase 3 trials with a goal to achieve conditional registration under the subpart H pathway by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is thus timely to consider the current situation and the way ahead in the management of NASH. In this article, we review the natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, upcoming treatments for NASH and various assessments. Based on the current knowledge, we discuss what should be the target treatment population and whether noninvasive tests are ready to guide NASH treatments both for patient selection and evaluation of treatment response.

### MAFLD: a consensus-driven proposed nomenclature for metabolic associated fatty liver disease [^cc1f34eb]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatty liver associated with metabolic dysfunction is common, affects a quarter of the population, and has no approved drug therapy. Although pharmacotherapies are in development, response rates appear modest. The heterogeneous pathogenesis of metabolic fatty liver diseases and inaccuracies in terminology and definitions necessitate a reappraisal of nomenclature to inform clinical trial design and drug development. A group of experts sought to integrate current understanding of patient heterogeneity captured under the acronym nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and provide suggestions on terminology that more accurately reflects pathogenesis and can help in patient stratification for management. Experts reached consensus that NAFLD does not reflect current knowledge, and metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease "MAFLD" was suggested as a more appropriate overarching term. This opens the door for efforts from the research community to update the nomenclature and subphenotype the disease to accelerate the translational path to new treatments.

Treatment Of NAFLD — Lifestyle factors, metabolic comorbidities and NAFLD‐specific therapies

According to current guidelines pharmacotherapy in NASH patients should be reserved for those with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and those with less severe disease but at high risk of disease progression (i.e. metabolic syndrome, diabetes).

Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that once a diagnosis of NAFLD is established patients have increased overall mortality compared to non‐NAFLD patients. However, this increased mortality mostly comes from cardiovascular‐ rather than from liver‐related outcomes; furthermore, cancer‐related mortality is among the leading causes of mortality in NAFLD patients, mainly driven by extrahepatic malignancies followed by hepatocellular carcinoma. Most importantly, once a diagnosis of NASH and/or advanced fibrosis (i.e. fibrosis stage 3 or cirrhosis) and/or portal hypertension is confirmed patients are at an increased risk for liver‐related complications (i.e. hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma) and liver‐related mortality. Therefore, lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying metabolic conditions should be performed in all NAFLD patients, while specific pharmacological treatment should mainly be aimed at patients with biopsy‐proven NASH and fibrosis. A short summary of a possible treatment algorithm for patients with NAFLD has been summarized in Fig. 2.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^3511f864]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To summarize the cornerstone of every treatment in all patients with NAFLD should contain the following three components:
Mediterranean diet aiming to reduce the average daily calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal.
Weight loss induced by diet and physical activity aiming at losing at least 3–5% of body weight.
Moderate physical activity aiming at 150–200 min/week — also in patients with NAFLD‐associated advanced chronic liver disease.

Pharmacological treatment options

Guideline‐recommended pharmacological treatment options for NAFLD patients are scarce and currently, only Vitamin E and the proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR‐y) ligand Pioglitazone are recommended for selected patients by the European‐ and American Association for the Study of the Liver.

### Current status of therapy in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^50332261]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic has now spread worldwide. With increase in weight, there is an increase in dysregulated energy metabolism ultimately leading to dysfunction of multiple organ systems recognized as the metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide, and is thought to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. It is a nondiscriminating disease affecting both children and adults and no socioeconomic class is spared. There is a well-defined increase in both liver-related and all-cause mortality. Current projections foresee a continued worsening in prevalence, especially with the increased rate of childhood obesity. Prevention would be the ultimate goal, but with continued trends in obesity, therapeutic options are needed to manage this chronic liver disease and prevent its complications of cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Therapies will need to be affordable, tolerable, and safe to be useful on such a large scale. This article will discuss some of the basic understanding of NAFLD, as well as review the currently tested therapies, some novel therapies, and potential future therapeutic options.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease of obesity [^4617c4cc]. Obesity Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are part of the same continuum. They are a major, under-recognized cause of chronic liver disease. Good medical treatment options do not exist to date. The mainstay of treatment is weight loss. Bariatric surgery offers weight loss and improvement of NAFLD and NASH.

### Pharmacotherapy for NASH: current and emerging [^a0df6ab6]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design. The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. If longer term safety and efficacy are established among heterogeneous cohorts, these medications may help mitigate potential morbidity and mortality for this burgeoning patient population.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^72d5e97b]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has emerged a major challenge because of it prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, complex pathogenesis, and lack of approved therapies. As the burden of hepatitis C abates over the next decade, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will become the major form of chronic liver disease in adults and children and could become the leading indication for liver transplantation. This overview briefly summarizes the most recent data on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Ongoing clinical trials are focused on an array of disease mechanisms and reviewed here are how these treatments fit into the current paradigm of substrate overload lipotoxic liver injury. Many of the approaches are directed at downstream events such as inflammation, injury and fibrogenesis. Addressing more proximal processes such as dysfunctional satiety mechanisms and inappropriately parsimonious energy dissipation are potential therapeutic opportunities that if successfully understood and exploited would not only address fatty liver disease but also the other components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia.

### FDA approves first treatment for patients with liver… [^7aba3a7f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Rezdiffra for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver scarring, to be used along with diet and exercise. "Previously, patients with NASH who also have notable liver scarring did not have a medication that could directly address their liver damage, " said Nikolay Nikolov, M. D., acting director of the Office of Immunology and Inflammation in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Today's approval of Rezdiffra will, for the first time, provide a treatment option for these patients, in addition to diet and exercise". To enroll in the trial, patients needed to have a liver biopsy showing inflammation due to NASH with moderate or advanced liver scarring.

In the trial, 888 subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: placebo; 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra; or 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra; once daily, in addition to standard care for NASH, which includes counseling for healthy diet and exercise. At 12 months, liver biopsies showed that a greater proportion of subjects who were treated with Rezdiffra achieved NASH resolution or an improvement in liver scarring as compared with those who received the placebo. A total of 26% to 27% of subjects who received 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra and 24% to 36% of subjects who received 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra experienced NASH resolution and no worsening of liver scarring, compared to 9% to 13% of those who received placebo and counseling on diet and exercise. The range of responses reflects different pathologists' readings.

In addition, a total of 23% of subjects who received 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra and 24% to 28% of subjects who received 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra experienced an improvement in liver scarring and no worsening of NASH, compared to 13% to 15% of those who received placebo, depending on each pathologist's readings.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^3838b61b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to a third of the population in many developed countries. Between 10% and 30% of patients with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis. There are metabolic risk factors common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, so patients with NASH have an increased risk of liver-related and cardiovascular death. Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost a third of the Western population, and the burden of the disease is set to rise exponentially. 1 Current drug therapies for the resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are limited in their efficacy, and there are no FDA‐approved drugs for NASH. 2 In this article, we review the potential therapeutic targets for NASH and their biological rationale, the current state of drugs in clinical trials, as well as some practical considerations as to how we manage NASH in the clinic.

### Treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current views and perspectives [^5bf40e7b]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. Problems still exist concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in clinical practice, for example: (a) how to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its type; (b) how to select patients candidate to treatment; (c) how to treat selected patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but only non-alcoholic steatohepatitis evolves into cirrhosis and the absolute risk of mortality for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is low. As yet, no tools, other than liver biopsy, are available to differentiate the various types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many drugs are, currently, under study to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even if well-performed trials are until necessary to define the best treatment. At the moment, the entity of the problem and the characteristics of patients frequently put the physician, in clinical practice, to choose the therapeutic approach arbitrarily which is considered more effective for each individual patient. Probably the future will consider the possibility of treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with more than one drug, by considering the various aspects and degree of this syndrome. Actually each physician should select the individual treatment on the basis of his/her knowledge and experience, by never forgetting the old saying 'primum non nocere'. However, the epidemiological entity of the problem, the characteristics of the patients, generally young, the frequent lack of clinical evidence of involvement of the liver, are all the factors that require vast well-performed clinical trials in order to define the best therapeutic approach for each individual patient.

### Probiotics for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and / or steatohepatitis [^c37bd670]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment option because of their modulating effect on the gut flora that could influence the gut-liver axis.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of probiotics for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to May 2006). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials evaluating probiotic treatment in any dose, duration, and route of administration versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The diagnosis was made by history of minimal or no alcohol intake, imaging techniques showing hepatic steatosis and/or histological evidence of hepatic damage, and by exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We had planned to extract data in duplicate and analyse results by intention-to-treat.

Main Results

No randomised clinical trials were identified. Preliminary data from two pilot non-randomised studies suggest that probiotics may be well tolerated, may improve conventional liver function tests, and may decrease markers of lipid peroxidation.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of randomised clinical trials makes it impossible to support or refute probiotics for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults: current concepts in etiology, outcomes, and management [^dfa4a0d0]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease, extending from simple steatosis to inflammation and fibrosis with a significant risk for the development of cirrhosis. It is highly prevalent and is associated with significant adverse outcomes both through liver-specific morbidity and mortality but, perhaps more important, through adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes. It is closely associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity, and both of these conditions drive progressive disease toward the more advanced stages. The mechanisms that govern hepatic lipid accumulation and the predisposition to inflammation and fibrosis are still not fully understood but reflect a complex interplay between metabolic target tissues including adipose and skeletal muscle, and immune and inflammatory cells. The ability to make an accurate assessment of disease stage (that relates to clinical outcome) can also be challenging. While liver biopsy is still regarded as the gold-standard investigative tool, there is an extensive literature on the search for novel noninvasive biomarkers and imaging modalities that aim to accurately reflect the stage of underlying disease. Finally, although no therapies are currently licensed for the treatment of NAFLD, there are interventions that appear to have proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials as well as an extensive emerging therapeutic landscape of new agents that target many of the fundamental pathophysiological processes that drive NAFLD. It is highly likely that over the next few years, new treatments with a specific license for the treatment of NAFLD will become available.

### Weight loss for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease… [^7014befb]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is weight loss an effective treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Evidence-Based Answer There are insufficient high-quality studies to determine patient-oriented outcomes of weight loss for the treatment of fatty liver disease. Nonetheless, weight loss remains a reasonable goal because it may reduce liver inflammation and improve comorbidities. In two of the studies reviewed, liver enzyme levels were essentially halved in patients who lost weight with lifestyle changes. Weight loss currently has the most supporting evidence for improving liver enzyme levels, compared with other therapies. 1, 4 This Cochrane review analyzed seven randomized trials that investigated weight loss as a treatment for fatty liver disease. One study examined children; the other studies focused on adults.

The intensity of lifestyle changes in the intervention groups and counseling in the placebo groups differed among studies. All but one trial were judged to be at high risk of bias, and comparisons were hindered by different end points. In these trials, lifestyle changes were associated with reductions in ALT levels, as well as appreciable weight loss. Orlistat was used for weight loss in two other studies, but there was no notable reduction in liver enzyme levels or body mass index compared with patients in placebo groups who were counseled on restrictive diets. However, both the orlistat and placebo groups achieved halving of liver enzyme levels and an approximate weight loss of 17. 78 lb.

In a 2004 meta-analysis, bariatric surgery was reported to resolve 77 percent of diabetes mellitus cases, 62 percent of hypertension cases, and 70 percent of hyperlipidemia cases. 5 Although some experts believe that bariatric surgery may also improve fatty liver disease that accompanies metabolic syndrome, no clinical trials have been performed. In addition, there have been some reports of histologic deterioration with rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery, so these patients should be monitored closely. 1.

### Clinical trial landscape in NASH [^581a6857]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease consists of a spectrum starting from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or even liver failure. The prevalence of NASH has increased in parallel with the rising rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Given the high prevalence and deadly complications of NASH, there have been significant efforts to develop effective treatments. Phase 2A studies have assessed various mechanisms of action across the spectrum of the disease, while phase 3 studies have focused mainly on NASH and fibrosis stage 2 and higher, as these patients have a higher risk of disease morbidity and mortality. The primary efficacy endpoints also vary, by using noninvasive tests in early-phase trials while relying on liver histological endpoints in phase 3 studies as required by regulatory agencies. Despite initial disappointment due to the failure of several drugs, recent phase 2 and 3 studies have shown promising results, with the first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for NASH expected to be approved in 2023. In this review, we discuss the various drugs under development for NASH, their mechanisms of action, and the results of their clinical trials. We also highlight the potential challenges in developing pharmacological therapies for NASH.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^6302754f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been reported as a novel worldwide epidemic, very often associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Both conditions have also been shown to be associated with a number of endocrine pathologies. Despite the epidemic, the complex pathophysiology and major complications, ranging from metabolic disturbances (diabetes and more) to cardiovascular disease, people with NASH are left with very few management options. The best and most approved therapeutic option is lifestyle intervention. Although pharmacotherapies based on pathophysiological background are in development, response rates appear modest, mainly for fibrosis treatment, which is the reason for lack of approved drug therapy. Previous drugs analyzed, such as pioglitazone and vitamin E, show weak efficacy. From different phase II trials, antidiabetic (injectable) drugs seem to be promising, both in mono- or bitherapy. Also, derivatives of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors may have an interesting future, as well. For that reason, more focus should be given on prevention of this novel disease entity. In view of this booming epidemic, with a background of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and the important medical consequences, early recognition, prevention and intervention of NAFLD/NASH seems appropriate. In this review, we will focus on the different current and future therapeutic intervention options, taking into consideration the complex pathophysiology of this disease.

### Emerging advances in the pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And related cirrhosis [^4c0980de]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly growing throughout the world. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, is likely to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and etiology for liver transplantation in future decades in the Western World. Most patients with NAFLD have some components of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to NASH, that can progress to advanced liver disease, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, the options for the pharmacological treatment of NASH are still very limited. Nonetheless, several classes of therapies have shown promise, and are currently being evaluated in large phase 2b and phase 3 trials, creating some hope that selected agents will be approved in the coming years. As NASH is a heterogeneous disease, multiple mechanistic pathways are being targeted to achieve optimal treatment response. Combination therapy is also on the horizon, where 2 or more drugs targeting different mechanistic pathways are being used to boost the clinical response. In this review, we first present the current concept of the pathophysiology of NASH, focusing on the pathways currently targeted in clinical trials. We then present the pharmacological agents that are being evaluated in phase IIb of clinical development and beyond, using histological outcomes, and finally we present preliminary results from the combination trials that have already been initiated.

### A fad too far? Dietary strategies for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD [^fac44b07]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health problem, and its prevalence has increased in recent years, concurrent with rising rates of obesity and other metabolic diseases. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies for NAFLD, and lifestyle interventions, including weight loss and exercise, remain the cornerstones for treatment. Manipulating diet composition and eating patterns may be a sustainable approach to NAFLD treatment. Dietary strategies including Paleolithic, ketogenic, Mediterranean, high-protein, plant-based, low-carbohydrate, and intermittent fasting diets have become increasingly popular because of their purported benefits on metabolic disease. This review highlights what is currently known about these popular dietary approaches in the management of NAFLD in clinical populations with mechanistic insight from animal studies. It also identifies key knowledge gaps to better inform future preclinical and clinical studies aimed at the treatment of NAFLD.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: controlling an emerging epidemic, challenges, and future directions [^f0a53e28]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks and future directions

There are many challenges facing patients affected by NAFLD. There are also many challenges faced by clinicians and researchers involved in the management of NAFLD. However, there are opportunities to overcome these challenges. There is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of NAFLD is guided by an interaction of nutritional habits, genetics, and environmental factors. One area of future research is to explore specific pathways through which these factors interact, especially in the era of epigenetics. A deeper understanding of this complex interaction can lead to the development of guidelines for screening, early diagnosis, and the development of therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic studies will enable us to predict which subset of patients affected by NAFLD are likely to progress into more advanced stages of disease.

Furthermore, the use of noninvasive biomarkers to obviate the need for liver biopsy requires further investigation. Noninvasive staging methods will encourage more patients to enroll in clinical trials, which will further broaden our understanding of the disease. To this end, there is also a need for clinical trials of longer duration to determine clinical endpoints, as well as the long-term safety and durability of new treatment options.

Our review has also shown that there is a need to increase training among healthcare providers with respect to lifestyle behavioral changes and motivational interventions. A patient-centered approach is expected to yield better outcomes in terms of weight loss and its effect on liver fat accumulation. This should also be reflected in authoritative guidelines. The 2012 guidelines of the AASLD need to be updated to reflect current knowledge and trends in order to guide healthcare providers and patients.

NAFLD is emerging as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and presents an impending social and economic burden. If it is not addressed, a significant portion of healthcare expenditure and resources will be required to cater for NAFLD-related diseases, further increasing healthcare expenditure. There is a gap in our knowledge and therapeutic armamentarium that needs to be bridged before we can stem the tide.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^74d248ce]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia; it is therefore considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. A particular health concern is patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with accompanying hepatocellular injury that can lead to progressive liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as increased cardiovascular risk. At present, there is no approved therapy for NASH and the optimal treatment remains uncertain; effective therapies are thus a research priority to reduce the anticipated burden of liver disease.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a particular health concern due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with progressive disease. At present, without specific targeted pharmacological therapies, the mainstay of therapy remains weight loss through dietary modification and lifestyle change; thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence for current and emerging therapies in NASH.

Recent Findings

Some existing medications, including pioglitazones and angiotensin receptor antagonists, may be repurposed to help treat this condition. Vitamin E may improve histology in NASH, but safety issues limit its use. Recently, a number of novel agents specifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis have entered clinical trials, including the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid, which has shown significant histological improvements in steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

Summary

Diet/lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, current liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E and pioglitazone offer some benefits; obeticholic acid appears promising and is currently being tested. Comorbidities must be diagnosed and treated; cardiovascular disease remains a primary cause of death in these patients.

Abstract

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in western populations, and is closely associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. The burden of disease is set to rise exponentially, and this is further compounded by the lack of good medications. In addition, these patients tend to have multiple comorbidities that may not be adequately managed. In this article, we review the biological basis of potential therapies in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the current drugs being tested in clinical trials, as well some practical considerations in managing patients in the clinic.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^57838b0e]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Principles of management of NAFLD

Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

All patients with NAFLD require advice about lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as treatment of any associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia). For patients with simple steatosis, which carries a relatively benign liver-related prognosis, this can be done in a primary care setting. Patients with steatohepatitis and fibrosis are at highest risk of developing progressive liver disease so require more aggressive lifestyle modification and if this fails can be considered for liver-directed pharmacotherapy with pioglitazone or vitamin E. For patients who have progressed to cirrhosis, surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential and some treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of HCC. Interventions for the treatment of NAFLD are summarised in table 1.

### Pharmacologic treatment strategies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^8049ddcb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common form of liver disease, associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive subtype of NAFLD, can cause progressive fibrosis leading to cirrhosis. With the obesity epidemic, there is an increased health care burden from NASH, one of the most common causes of liver transplantation in the United States. There currently are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medical therapies for NASH. There exists a need for therapeutics to correct the drivers of NASH and to reverse or halt fibrosis progression. This article reviews pharmacologic therapeutics being developed to treat NASH.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^663ddf1c]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Despite its prevalence and rising incidence, NAFLD is marked by substantial interpatient variability in prognosis and continues to lack the breadth of therapeutic research and development shared by other causes of chronic liver disease. Although major advances have been made in understanding pathogenesis and also identification of genetic modifiers of liver injury extending beyond simple steatosis including PNPLA3 and TM6SF2, these advances have not yet been fully capitalized upon and so we lack effective pharmacotherapy. Diet and lifestyle modification remain the mainstay of treatment. For patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, current liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E and pioglitazone offer some benefits in selected cases. Figure 1 provides a schematic of treatment, once the diagnosis of NASH has been made. However, the beneficial effects of these therapies must be balanced with the potential adverse effects, limiting their widespread use. Coexisting comorbidity must be diagnosed and treated because CVD remains primary cause of death in these patients. The new agents currently in trial provide the first hope of effective, targeted pharmacotherapy in this field.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - the most common chronic liver disease - encompasses a histological spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Over the next decade, NASH is projected to be the most common indication for liver transplantation. The absence of an effective pharmacological therapy for NASH is a major incentive for research into novel therapeutic approaches for this condition. The current focus areas for research include the modulation of nuclear transcription factors; agents that target lipotoxicity and oxidative stress; and the modulation of cellular energy homeostasis, metabolism and the inflammatory response. Strategies to enhance resolution of inflammation and fibrosis also show promise to reverse the advanced stages of liver disease.

### Endpoints and clinical trial design for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^e0911f07]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a common cause of chronic liver disease in the general population. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is associated with an increased risk of liver-related mortality and cardiovascular disease. At present, a liver biopsy is the only generally acceptable method for the diagnosis of NASH and assessment of its progression toward cirrhosis. Although several treatments have shown evidence of efficacy in clinical trials of varying design, there are no approved treatments for NASH, and published trials are often too divergent to allow meaningful comparisons. There is thus a lack of established noninvasive, point-of-care diagnostics and approved treatment on one hand and a substantial population burden of disease on the other. These provide the rationale for developing consensus on key endpoints and clinical trial design for NASH.

Conclusion

This article summarizes the consensus arrived at a meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases on the key endpoints and specific trial design issues that are germane for development of diagnostic biomarkers and treatment trials for NASH.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both? [^24b25e87]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on patient clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^a1bd11e4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

NASH is a common liver disease that increases liver-related mortality and reduces survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologist. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH is based on the potential for disease progression and the difficulties that many patients have successfully implementing, in the long term, diet and lifestyle changes. Even in those that succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone.

### Emerging therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d7c61119]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most prevalent liver disease in the world, yet there are still no approved pharmacological therapies to prevent or treat this condition. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of severity, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although NASH is linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis and has now become the leading cause of liver failure-related transplantation, the majority of patients with NASH will ultimately die as a result of complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiometabolic diseases. Importantly, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and tightly interrelated with insulin resistance and T2DM. Thus, targeting these interconnected conditions and taking a holistic attitude to the treatment of metabolic disease could prove to be a very beneficial approach. This Review will explore the latest relevant literature and discuss the ongoing therapeutic options for NAFLD focused on targeting intermediary metabolism, insulin resistance and T2DM to remedy the global health burden of these diseases.

### Lifestyle modifications for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^1f6d25dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods.

Main Results

We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention (to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^999d8e78]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review [^791ac363]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affect approximately 30% and 5%, respectively, of the US population. In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, half of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and malignancy, yet awareness of this remains low. Cirrhosis, the third leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is predicted to become the most common indication for liver transplantation.

Objectives

To illustrate how to identify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at greatest risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis; to discuss the role and limitations of current diagnostics and liver biopsy to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; and to provide an outline for the management of patients across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Evidence Review

PubMed was queried for published articles through February 28, 2015, using the search terms NAFLD and cirrhosis, mortality, biomarkers, and treatment. A total of 88 references were selected, including 16 randomized clinical trials, 44 cohort or case-control studies, 6 population-based studies, and 7 meta-analyses.

Findings

Sixty-six percent of patients older than 50 years with diabetes or obesity are thought to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis. Even though the ability to identify the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis subtype within those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease still requires liver biopsy, biomarkers to detect advanced fibrosis are increasingly reliable. Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatosis. Available treatments with proven benefit include vitamin E, pioglitazone, and obeticholic acid; however, the effect size is modest (< 50%) and none is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The association between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease is clear, though causality remains to be proven in well-controlled prospective studies. The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing and up to 50% of cases may occur in the absence of cirrhosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Between 75 million and 100 million individuals in the United States are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its potential morbidity extends beyond the liver. It is important that primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and other specialists be aware of the scope and long-term effects of the disease. Early identification of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may help improve patient outcomes through treatment intervention, including transplantation for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^db710f7c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a very common medical condition, driven by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, ultimately producing a severe chronic liver disease and increased cardiovascular risk. Most people are asymptomatic for a long time, and their daily life is unaffected, leading to difficulty in identifying and managing people who slowly progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NASH-cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite advances in the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and the identification of liver fibrosis as the strongest factor in predicting disease progression, no specific treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies. Outside controlled trials, treatment is generally limited to lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss. Pioglitazone remains the drug of choice to reduce progression of fibrosis in people with diabetes, although it is often used off-label in the absence of diabetes. Vitamin E is mainly used in children and may be considered in adults without diabetes. Several drugs are under investigation according to the agreed targets of reduced NASH activity without worsening of fibrosis or improving fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic agents and metabolism modulators have been tested in either phase III or phase IIb randomized controlled trials; a few failed, and others have produced marginally positive results, but only a few are being tested in extension studies. The development of non-invasive, easily repeatable surrogate biomarkers and/or imaging tools is crucial to facilitate clinical studies and limit liver biopsy.

### Features, diagnosis, and treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^dd0ac52f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

As the global incidence of obesity has increased, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a worldwide health concern. NAFLD occurs in children and adults of all ethnicities and includes isolated fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Patients with NASH are at risk for developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma and have increased all-cause mortality. NAFLD is associated with a variety of clinical conditions and is an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and the specific steps that lead to NASH and advanced fibrosis are not fully understood, although researchers have found that a combination of environmental, genetic, and metabolic factors lead to advanced disease. There have been improvements in noninvasive radiographic methods to diagnose NAFLD, especially for advanced disease. However, liver biopsy is still the standard method of diagnosis for NASH. There are many challenges to treating patients with NASH, and no therapies have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; multimodal approaches are being developed and becoming the standard of care. We review pathogenesis and treatment approaches for the West's largest liver-related public health concern.

### Therapeutic landscape for NAFLD in 2020 [^d09c9b0a]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modifications focused on healthy eating and regular exercise are the primary recommendations for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, for multiple societal, psychological, physical, genetic, and epigenetic reasons, the ability of people to adopt and sustain such changes is challenging and typically not successful. To end the epidemic of NASH and prevent its complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, pharmacological interventions are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Treatments include drugs targeting energy intake, energy disposal, lipotoxic liver injury, and the resulting inflammation and fibrogenesis that lead to cirrhosis. It is likely that patients develop the phenotype of NASH by multiple mechanisms, and thus the optimal treatments of NASH will likely evolve to personalized therapy once we understand the mechanistic underpinnings of NASH in each patient. Reviewed here is the treatment landscape in this rapidly evolving field with an emphasis on drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^27c3770d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NAFLD and NASH are increasingly being recognized as important causes of cirrhosis and its complications. In this context, presence of multiple components of metabolic syndrome and advanced fibrosis are considered risk factors for liver-related mortality. Although weight loss through lifestyle modification can be effective and is always recommended, the efficacy is limited and not sustained. Although very few drug treatments are available for NASH, a large number of clinical trials of pharmacological agents which target one or more pathways in the pathogenesis of NASH are currently being undertaken. Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of NASH, it is likely that the treatment option may require a combination of different drugs. Additionally, the duration of treatment may require long-term maintenance. In this context, one could envision a short term, intense 'induction' treatment regimen, followed by a long term, potentially lifelong maintenance regimen. As we develop these regimens, it is not only to establish their efficacy and safety, but also to show improvement of patient reported outcomes. Finally, these regimens must be cost effective and provide long-term value to patients and society.

### Management of NAFLD: a stage-based approach [^65ad3bd8]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

NAFLD is the most prevalent form of liver disease in the USA, affecting an estimated 30% of the population. The condition is associated with increased mortality related to cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver disease. Identification of patients who might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes is critical as it is not feasible to screen all patients with suspected NAFLD. Patients with NASH, the progressive subtype of NAFLD, should be targeted for treatment, especially if they have concomitant fibrosis because such patients are more likely than those without fibrosis to have adverse outcomes. Treatment goals in patients with NAFLD vary depending on the disease stage owing to differential risk of progression and the particularities of an individual's comorbid disease. Lifestyle intervention is important for all patients irrespective of disease stage, but other therapies should be targeted to those most likely to benefit. In this Review, we highlight risk factors for disease progression and offer a stage-based treatment approach for patients with NAFLD.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: pharmacologic and surgical options [^9cc6276d]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen many studies examining the prevalence and natural history of NAFLD in the United States and it is clear that this disease is likely to be an important cause of liver-related morbidity in the future. Several pharmacologic therapies have shown some promise; currently, vitamin E and insulin-sensitizing agents such as pioglitazone can be considered in appropriate cases. Conservative measures to promote weight loss still have a role to play, but the obesity epidemic in the Western World has reached such proportions that bariatric surgery is proving to be an attractive option for patients with a BMI greater than 35 to 40 kg/m2. Well-designed prospective studies are required to ensure that all of these therapies are safe and effective in the long term. Newer agents will likely be investigated as the pathogenesis of NAFLD and fibrosis progression in NASH are further elucidated.

### NAFLD as a continuum: from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes [^5fcdafec]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing rapidly. It is nowadays recognized as the most frequent liver disease, affecting a quarter of global population and regularly coexisting with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In a more simplistic view, NAFLD could be defined as an increase in liver fat content, in the absence of secondary cause of steatosis. In fact, the clinical onset of the disease is a much more complex process, closely related to insulin resistance, limited expandability and dysfunctionality of adipose tissue. A fatty liver is a main driver for a new recognized liver-pancreatic α-cell axis and increased glucagon, contributing to diabetes pathophysiology.

Main text

This review will focus on the clinical and pathophysiological connections between NAFLD, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We reviewed non-invasive methods and several scoring systems for estimative of steatosis and fibrosis, proposing a multistep process for NAFLD evaluation. We will also discuss treatment options with a more comprehensive view, focusing on the current available therapies for obesity and/or type 2 diabetes that impact each stage of NAFLD.

Conclusion

The proper understanding of NAFLD spectrum — as a continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome and diabetes — may contribute to the early identification and for establishment of targeted treatment.

### Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults: a systematic review [^554a206c]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a serious and growing clinical problem. Despite lifestyle modification, i.e. diet and physical activity, being the recommended therapy, there are currently no systematic evaluations of its efficacy. This review applies a systematic approach to evaluating lifestyle modifications studied to date. Medline (Pubmed), Scopus, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for studies and study groups assessing the effect of diet, physical activity, and/or exercise modification in adult populations with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The outcome markers of interest were indicators of steatosis, histological evidence of inflammation and fibrosis, and glucose control/insulin sensitivity. We identified 23 studies for inclusion; seven had control groups, but only six were randomised. Eleven groups received diet-only interventions, two exercise-only, and 19 diet and physical activity/exercise. Studies consistently showed reductions in liver fat and/or liver aminotransferase concentration, with the strongest correlation being with weight reduction. Of the 5 studies reporting changes in histopathology, all showed a trend towards reduction in inflammation, in 2 this was statistically significant. Changes in fibrosis were less consistent with only one study showing a significant reduction. The majority of studies also reported improvements in glucose control/insulin sensitivity following intervention. However, study design, definition of disease, assessment methods, and interventions varied considerably across studies. Lifestyle modifications leading to weight reduction and/or increased physical activity consistently reduced liver fat and improved glucose control/insulin sensitivity. Limited data also suggest that lifestyle interventions may hold benefits for histopathology.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^bfb2d8b6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common type of chronic liver disease worldwide. From the spectrum of NAFLD, it is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that predominantly predisposes patients to higher risk for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is growing evidence that the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is not uniform among all patients with NASH. In fact, NASH patients with increasing numbers of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, visceral obesity and dyslipidemia are at a higher risk of mortality. Additionally, patients with higher stage of liver fibrosis are also at increased risk of mortality. In this context, NASH patients with fibrosis are in the most urgent need of treatment. Also, the first line of treatment for NASH is lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. Nevertheless, the efficacy of lifestyle modification is quite limited. Additionally, vitamin E and pioglitazone may be considered for subset of patients with NASH. There are various medications targeting one or more steps in the pathogenesis of NASH being developed. These drug regimens either alone or in combination, may provide potential treatment option for patients with NASH.

### Comparative review of diets for the metabolic syndrome: implications for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^ae2493aa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant health problem and affects 70 million adults in the United States (30% of the adult population), and an estimated 20% of these individuals have the most severe form of NAFLD-nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are awaiting clarification. Insulin resistance and obesity-related inflammation, among other possible genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors, are thought to play a key role. A program targeting gradual weight reduction and physical exercise continues to be the gold standard of treatment for all forms of NAFLD. Even though weight loss and dietary and lifestyle changes are recommended as primary treatment for fatty liver, little to no scientific evidence is available on diet and NAFLD. This article reviews the implications of current dietary approaches, including national guidelines and popular weight-loss diets, with a focus on determining the optimal diet to prescribe for NAFLD and NASH patients. The effects of macronutrient content (carbohydrate, fat, and protein ratios) and specific food components, such as soluble fiber, n-3 fatty acids, and fructose, are discussed. The premises, effects, barriers, and issues related to current dietary guidelines and specific diets are discussed, and the question, "Will it work for the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH? ", is addressed.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^a30dfba6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — management of patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis emphasizes lifestyle measures: Low risk is defined as having a FIB-4 score < 1.3, LSM < 8.0 kPa by transient elastography, or a liver biopsy fibrosis stage of F0–F1; for these patients, we recommend therapeutic lifestyle interventions, and specific pharmacologic treatment targeting liver steatosis is not necessary; management should focus on lifestyle interventions to modify unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factors, with particular efforts to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; all patients should receive education about nutritional strategies, regular physical activity, and avoiding excess alcohol intake; given that even low alcohol intake is associated with increased risks for advanced liver disease and cancer in individuals with NAFLD, adults with NAFLD should restrict alcohol consumption to reduce liver-related events; there are no large, long-term behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy studies regarding weight loss in NAFLD, but weight loss of any magnitude should be encouraged, and reversal of steatosis may be observed with even modest weight loss (approximately 5%), although most studies suggest that a greater decrease (up to 10%) is needed to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^4c194504]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Off-label pharmacologic management addresses comorbidities and clarifies what is and is not appropriate for NASH. There are no FDA-approved medications for NAFLD, but drugs for comorbidities with potential benefit may be considered. Semaglutide can be considered for its approved indications in NASH because it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves NASH; pioglitazone improves NASH and can be considered for NASH in T2DM; vitamin E can be considered in select individuals without diabetes as it improves NASH. Available data on semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E do not show an antifibrotic benefit and these compounds have not been carefully studied in cirrhosis. Metformin, UDCA, DPP-4, statins, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH due to lack of meaningful histological benefit. Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction across NAFLD, including compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated cirrhosis, data are limited but use could be considered in high cardiovascular risk with careful monitoring. Hypertriglyceridemia management includes lifestyle changes and omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^96cf1e27]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with global public health impact affecting more than 25% of the global population. NAFLD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, solid organ malignancies, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, resulting in significant health care resource use and decreased health-related quality of life. NAFLD cirrhosis is a leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Lifestyle modification to achieve weight loss remains a first-line intervention in patients with NAFLD. We summarize evidence-based interventions for lifestyle modification in the treatment of NAFLD and provided best practice advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^038b6105]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

NAFLD is a worldwide epidemic associated with metabolic and endocrine pathologies. The most evidenced approach is lifestyle intervention, which lacks long-term efficacy. Therefore, prevention merits more attention, since the pharmaceutical options currently available are limited. Although multiple pharmacotherapies are in development, response rates appear modest, mainly for fibrosis treatment. From different phase II trials, antidiabetic drugs seem promising, both in mono- or bitherapy. Derivatives of PPAR molecules may have an interesting future, as well. As a general recommendation, we propose early screening and recognition of the problem, to deliver optimal treatment once an approved pharmacological armamentarium becomes available.

### Blowing away fatty liver: mission impossible? [^7563e974]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a group of conditions in which there is accumulation of excess fat in the liver. The most common and mild form of NAFLD, fatty liver, affects up to 25–30% of the general population. Each year, 0.1% of patients with fatty liver progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which fat accumulation is associated with liver cell inflammation, which can lead to severe liver scarring and cirrhosis. Almost 50% of those with NAFLD meet criteria for metabolic syndrome.

There is growing cross-sectional data that implicates obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the development and progression of NAFLD, as assessed by liver biopsies or validated noninvasive screening tools for liver fibrosis.

Intermittent hypoxia is thought to be a plausible mechanism through which OSA might drive abnormal lipid metabolism and fatty liver. However, there is significant interaction between the risk factors for NAFLD and OSA, such that it is proving difficult to clarify cause and effect and therefore what treatment approaches are likely to be effective.

To date, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have failed to demonstrate a clinical effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on noninvasive markers of NAFLD severity (Table 1). More broadly, RCTs of CPAP versus sham CPAP have failed to demonstrate efficacy in improving any components of metabolic syndrome. However, it is still argued that failure to demonstrate the positive effect of CPAP on metabolic syndrome is not so much related to a flawed intervention as it is to flawed methodology. Criticisms of previous studies have included investigation of populations without significant metabolic pathology at baseline, failure to examine markers of metabolic syndrome as the primary outcome and insufficient power to enable effective secondary analysis, intention-to-treat analysis impacted by poor compliance, short treatment periods (< 3 mo), and prevalence of significant obesity masking treatment effect on metabolic outcomes.

### Novel strategies to treat hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis [^81c9312e]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Concordant with soaring obesity rates, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease in the world. The obesity epidemic demands interventions to reverse obesity-associated hepatic steatosis, NAFLD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and several new pharmacologic approaches have been developed within the past several years. Steatosis develops when energy delivery to the liver, modulated by rates of hepatic lipogenesis, exceeds the capacity of the liver to utilize or export this energy. Therefore, pharmacologic approaches to reverse hepatic steatosis have focused largely, though not exclusively, on (1) reducing substrate availability to the liver, (2) reducing hepatic lipid synthesis, and (3) increasing hepatic mitochondrial fat oxidation (Figure 1). This Perspective will discuss these three classes of emerging pharmacologic therapies against hepatic steatosis, with the ultimate intent to ameliorate NAFLD and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and the advantages and pitfalls afforded by each strategy to treat these epidemics of obesity-associated liver disease.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^61424dab]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Most cases are diagnosed incidentally in the primary care or hospital setting on the basis of elevated liver enzyme levels or hepatic steatosis on imaging. NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum: The vast majority of patients have nonprogressive nonalcoholic fatty liver, and a few of those develop progressive liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis, a condition termed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Persons with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis have increased liver-related mortality. In the absence of regulatory agency-approved drugs, lifestyle modification and weight loss remain the cornerstones of NAFLD therapy.

Natural history of NAFLD and NASH indicates limited progression in simple steatosis but potential progression to cirrhosis in NASH; despite smaller cohorts and modest follow-up, it is generally agreed that simple steatosis has very slow, if any, histological progression, whereas NASH can progress to cirrhotic-stage disease, and reported outcomes include increased overall mortality compared with matched control populations.

### Evaluation and management of obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^0499e739]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

The clinicopathologic spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a relatively benign clinical course, but NASH can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD occurs in the absence of significant alcohol use and is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. NAFLD affects approximately 30% of the US population and the incidence seems to be rising as the obesity epidemic continues. At present, the most accurate modality for the diagnosis of NASH is liver biopsy; however, many patients do not have a liver biopsy, and in the absence of more-accurate imaging technologies and serum markers, the diagnosis is frequently one of exclusion. As yet there is no convincingly effective treatment for NAFLD — a multimodal treatment plan that targets obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia and hypertension might be the best option for these patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^151f6a0d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Introduction

Worldwide there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity which has directly translated into a rise in metabolic diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Within the United States, it is estimated that approximately one-third of adults have NAFLD. Among individuals with common metabolic conditions, the prevalence of NAFLD is even higher, with an estimated two-thirds of individuals with diabetes having underlying NAFLD. Currently, NAFLD is the second most common cause of cirrhosis and indication for liver transplant in the United States. Individuals with NAFLD are estimated to have 26% higher overall healthcare costs compared with individuals without NAFLD. A core challenge of managing patients with NAFLD is identifying the optimal strategy for screening, diagnosis, and management given the present treatment options, difficulties in uptake and sustainability of first-line treatment, and competing co-morbidities in individuals with NAFLD.

Screening individuals for NAFLD, even those at high risk for having NAFLD, is not currently recommended given limitations in diagnostic testing and treatment options, and prior studies suggesting the lack of evidence demonstrating long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening.NAFLD is commonly diagnosed incidentally when imaging shows evidence of fatty liver infiltration or presumptively when liver enzymes are elevated in the setting of metabolic risk factors. From a primary care provider (PCP) perspective, it is challenging to determine the best approach to managing patients with either suspected or confirmed NAFLD, given current treatment landscape. Because the presence of advanced fibrosis is associated with increased all-cause and liver-related mortality, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines state that non-invasive biomarkers like the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) or fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) can be used to help identify individuals at high risk for advanced fibrosis. As an alternative, transient elastography (TE) can also be used for this purpose. It is unclear to what extent PCPs use these methods and how useful these tools are in the real-world clinical practice. The ability to accurately identify NAFLD patients at high risk for advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is critically important, as most patients with NAFLD are asymptomatic and often patients remain undiagnosed until they present with decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

### State of the art: treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^bc0cbc47]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries, and consists of a spectrum of histopathological changes that range in severity from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. The use of pharmacological agents as adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modification is crucial, because weight loss is often difficult to achieve and maintain. The purpose of this review is to analyze the most recent literature pertaining to current therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that vitamin E may improve liver histology in NASH without affecting insulin resistance; however, long-term risks remain to be studied. Pioglitazone is beneficial in improving liver histology and insulin resistance, but is associated with weight gain. Emerging data suggest that pentoxifylline may also be beneficial in improving serum aminotransferase and liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH.

Summary

Ongoing research evaluating potential pharmacological agents for NASH is critical, because these patients are at an increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapies being used for the treatment of NASH include the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone, in addition to dietary counseling and regular exercise.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases which occurs in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include (1) correction of the underlying risk factors, (2) avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease, and (3) specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

NAFLD treatment — Treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are centered around nutrition, physical activity, and medications. Generally, excessive alcohol intake [e.g., > 2 drinks daily (24 oz beer, 8 oz wine, or 2 oz spirits)] is associated with increased risk of alcohol-associated liver disease and cirrhosis, whereas moderate ethanol intake (i.e., 1–2 drinks daily) may reduce the risk of NASH and CVD; in patients with established NASH, however, all alcohol consumption should be avoided. Regarding treatment of NAFLD and NASH, the objectives should include preservation of liver function, preventing progression to end-stage liver disease, preventing hepatocellular carcinoma, and preventing metabolic complications (e.g., diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome), which are cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) guideline — NAFLD is a highly prevalent chronic liver disease in children that occurs in the setting of insulin resistance and increased adiposity, has become the most common liver disease in children in the United States, and can result in progressive fibrosis and lead to end-stage liver disease. Within the last decade, it has become one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in adults. The expert committee reviewed and summarized available literature to formulate recommendations to guide screening and clinical care of children with NAFLD. Recommendations are based on a formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature (PubMed/EMBASE search through May 2015) and cover clinical practice areas including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and public health implications.

NAFLD — Disease modifying interventions emphasize diet, physical activity, and selective use of bariatric surgery. Overweight or obese patients should be prescribed a diet leading to a caloric deficit, with preference for diets limited in carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats such as a Mediterranean diet due to cardiovascular benefits. Patients should be strongly encouraged to increase activity, with prescriptive exercise potentially improving compliance and benefiting independent of weight loss. Bariatric surgery should be considered for eligible patients as it effectively resolves NAFLD or NASH in most patients without cirrhosis and reduces mortality from cardiovascular disease and malignancy.

Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity worldwide, the deleterious effects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are becoming a growing challenge for public health. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world. NAFLD is closely associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and persistent abnormalities of liver function tests. In general NAFLD is a common denominer for a broad spectrum of damage to the liver, which can be due to hepatocyte injury, inflammatory processes and fibrosis. This is normally seen on liver biopsy and can range from milder forms (steatosis) to the more severe forms (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure). In these patients, advanced fibrosis is the major predictor of morbidity and liver-related mortality, and an accurate diagnosis of NASH and NAFLD is mandatory. Histologic evaluation with liver biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose NAFLD. Diagnosis of NAFLD is defined as presence of hepatic steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Weight loss, dietary modification, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established. Dietary recommendations and lifestyle interventions, weight loss, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established with promising results but are difficult to maintain. Pioglitazone and vitamin E are recommended by guidelines in selected patients. This review gives an overview of NAFLD and its treatment options.

Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lay summary — prevalence, risk, and weight loss targets: NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease affecting 25% of the global population, yet awareness remains limited with < 5% of persons with NAFLD being aware of their disease compared with 38% with viral hepatitis, and Twelve to 14% of persons with NAFLD have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The risk of NASH is two- to threefold higher in persons with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the primary treatment is weight loss with a low-calorie diet; restriction of saturated fat, starch, and sugar; improved eating patterns (eg, Mediterranean diet and minimally processed whole foods); and exercise. Cardiometabolic benefit and reduction of liver fat can be observed with ≥ 5% weight loss, and more weight loss may reverse steatohepatitis or liver fibrosis (≥ 10% weight loss); there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for NAFLD, and bariatric surgery is effective for weight loss and reducing liver fat in persons with severe obesity.

### Weight loss interventions and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: optimizing liver outcomes [^3616f3b0]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The growth in prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most important global health challenges. The three chronic diseases are closely linked in their epidemiology and pathophysiology. Currently, weight loss is the most effective treatment for NAFLD (even in the minority of patients with NAFLD who do not have obesity) and is recommended in all national and international guidelines. Accumulating evidence has shown that weight loss, whether achieved by diet and lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery or pharmacotherapy, can improve biomarkers of NAFLD, as well as prevent progression and, in some cases, reverse fibrosis. There is a dose dependency of weight loss with NAFLD improvement. Pharmacotherapy with antiobesity medications, alone or in combination with intensive lifestyle interventions or other weight-loss drugs, is closing the efficacy gap between diet and exercise and weight-loss surgery in efficacy at reversing obesity. Given the importance of providing effective weight-loss treatment to patients with NAFLD, weight management services need to be made increasingly available and embedded within hepatology services. This narrative review addresses the evidence that weight loss optimizes liver outcomes in people with NAFLD.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes

Weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction are critical components of the management of patients with both NAFLD and T2DM. There is robust evidence to demonstrate the cardiovascular benefit of specific classes of glucose lowering agents, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). In addition, both classes of agent promote weight loss and may have a beneficial impact on the liver. In line with published guidance, we would advocate a low threshold for the preferential use of agents that lower weight and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with NAFLD to treat their diabetes. Accordingly, in people with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, treatment with glucose lowering agents that promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk should be considered (recommendation 30, Table 1).

Service considerations

Research and clinical trials

Patients with NAFLD should be considered for research studies and offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials where available (Recommendation 31, Table 1). It is recognised in other disease areas that increased participation in research is associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients. NAFLD is a relatively recently described entity with substantial unmet need in terms of understanding of its natural history, diagnostic tests, and treatment to prevent disease progression. These needs can only be addressed through the engagement of people with NAFLD with research. Where research studies are available, these should be offered to appropriate patients to consider participation.

Multidisciplinary care for people with NAFLD

Given the strong relationship between NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome, patients with fatty liver frequently have associated metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity and a holistic approach to their management is advised. Comprehensive management of NAFLD requires expertise in clinical hepatology for the diagnosis, staging of NAFLD and management of hepatic comorbidity. Diabetes is often present in advanced NAFLD and this, with optimisation of cardio-metabolic risk factors requires relevant expertise. Lifestyle intervention and health promotion are required to assist sustainable health improvement. International guidelines highlight the multi-disciplinary nature of interventions in NAFLD, and the feasibility and utility of a multi-disciplinary clinic has been demonstrated. Therefore, management of patients with advanced NAFLD in secondary care should be by multidisciplinary teams with expertise in clinical hepatology, management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle intervention and health promotion (diet and exercise/physical activity) (Recommendation 32, Table 1).
