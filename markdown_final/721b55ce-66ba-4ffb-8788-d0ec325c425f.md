## Question

What benefits has Vitrakvi demonstrated in clinical trials?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits demonstrated by Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) in clinical trials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core efficacy endpoints, especially overall response rate and durability. Then, I should verify the pivotal trials and pooled datasets that underpin the regulatory approval. Next, I will examine tissue-agnostic performance across histologies, including CNS and salivary gland tumors. After that, I need to review safety and tolerability, followed by the time-to-response and long-term survival signals. Finally, I should confirm dosing and patient selection criteria, including the biomarker requirement and resistance considerations, and synthesize a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the drug and mechanism to anchor the claims. Larotrectinib is a highly selective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that targets tumors driven by NTRK gene fusions, with minimal off-target kinase activity, which mechanistically supports tissue-agnostic antitumor effects in fusion-positive cancers [^116vS3n6] [^1138SM2x].

> I will now examine the core efficacy signals. Wait, let me verify the pivotal numbers from the FDA-recognized datasets. In the initial pooled analysis of 55 patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, the objective response rate (ORR) was 75% by independent review and 80% by investigator assessment, with a 22% complete response (CR) rate in one regulatory summary and a 13% CR rate in another; the median duration of response (DoR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were not reached at the time of analysis, indicating exceptional durability, and at one year, 71% of responses were ongoing and 55% remained progression-free [^112zqspv] [^112DwmnY] [^1162Vsav].

> Hold on, I should verify the larger pooled analysis that extended these findings. In the updated integrated dataset of 159 patients, investigator-assessed ORR was 79% with 16% CRs, median DoR was 35.2 months, median PFS was 28.3 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 44.4 months, which collectively represent clinically meaningful, long-term benefit across diverse histologies and ages [^112P5ube] [^115DPQhQ].

> Let me consider the tissue-agnostic nature and whether benefits persist across uncommon histologies. In salivary gland cancer enriched for ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, ORR reached 92% with rapid responses and high 24-month PFS, supporting routine fusion testing in this population. In pediatric patients, ORR around 93% has been reported, including in infantile fibrosarcoma, and responses are sufficiently robust to facilitate limb-sparing surgery and organ preservation in selected cases, illustrating transformative clinical utility in both scenarios [^114HVkto] [^1143cv5X] [^111L4cBP] [^1133LL8s].

> I need to check intracranial activity, because CNS penetrance is a critical benefit question. In TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors, larotrectinib achieved an ORR of 30% with a 24-week disease control rate of 73% and meaningful 12-month PFS and OS signals; importantly, tumor shrinkage occurred in 82% of patients with measurable disease, and all complete and partial responses occurred in pediatric patients, suggesting a role in delaying or avoiding radiotherapy and enabling less morbid surgeries in children with high-grade gliomas and other CNS histologies [^1154JGrr] [^115Rs2ob] [^114UoymF].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerability to ensure the benefit-risk profile is favorable. Across pooled safety populations, most treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were grade 1–2; grade 3–4 AEs occurred in 13% with low rates of dose reductions and discontinuations, and no treatment-related deaths were reported in the pivotal pooled analysis; common toxicities included fatigue, dizziness, anemia, and transaminase elevations, which were generally manageable with monitoring and dose modification [^112P5ube] [^1138SM2x] [^113Smqsi].

> I should double-check the time-to-response and its clinical implications. Median time to response is approximately 1.8 months, with many responses apparent at the first on-treatment assessment, which allows for early clinical confirmation of benefit and, in some cases, enables surgical downstaging or symptom palliation within weeks of initiation [^115DPQhQ].

> Let me verify the regulatory foundation and labeled indications so I don't overstate scope. Larotrectinib received the first tissue-agnostic oncology approval in 2018 for adults and children with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors that are metastatic or unresectable with high morbidity, or have progressed after prior therapy, based on three multicenter, open-label, single-arm trials (LOXO-TRK-14001, SCOUT, NAVIGATE); this landmark agnostic indication was unprecedented at the time and remains a template for precision oncology [^115RM1ja] [^111gU3Ur] [^1123sdDZ].

> I need to ensure I capture patient selection and dosing correctly. Therapy should be selected based on detection of an NTRK gene fusion by an appropriate test, and dosing is 100 mg orally twice daily for adults and adolescents with BSA ≥ 1 m², and 100 mg/m² (max 100 mg) twice daily for pediatric patients with BSA < 1 m², continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. I initially thought pediatric dosing might be 150 mg/m², but wait, I should verify — this is incorrect. The recommended pediatric dose is 100 mg/m² with a maximum of 100 mg per dose, which aligns with the FDA label and pivotal pediatric data [^117QwsRD] [^115WBkZD] [^111L4cBP].

> But wait, what about limitations and nuances I must not overlook. Activity is specific to NTRK fusions; NTRK point mutations and amplifications generally lack meaningful responses, and patients with known acquired resistance mutations to TRK inhibitors are not indicated for larotrectinib; moreover, a dedicated study of NTRK overexpression without fusions failed to show meaningful efficacy, reinforcing the fusion-specific mechanism and the importance of accurate biomarker detection in clinical practice [^1165CRgC] [^111JztGJ] [^1138SM2x].

> In synthesis, I should confirm the overall clinical benefit profile. Larotrectinib demonstrates high and durable objective responses across a wide range of NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including in salivary gland cancers and primary CNS tumors, with a favorable safety profile, rapid onset of response, and long-term survival outcomes that compare favorably to many standard-of-care options for advanced disease. This tissue-agnostic benefit is a realized paradigm of precision oncology, contingent on systematic NTRK fusion testing to identify eligible patients [^112P5ube] [^112zqspv] [^115DPQhQ].

Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) has demonstrated **high and durable response rates** across diverse NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors in clinical trials, with an overall response rate of 75% in the initial 55-patient dataset [^112zqspv] and 79% in the expanded 159-patient pooled analysis [^112P5ube], including 16% complete responses [^112P5ube]. Responses were rapid (median 1.8 months) [^115DPQhQ] and durable, with a median duration of response of 35.2 months and median progression-free survival of 28.3 months [^115DPQhQ]; median overall survival was 44.4 months [^115DPQhQ]. The safety profile is favorable [^112zqspv], with mostly grade 1–2 adverse events [^116bgU1P] and low discontinuation rates [^116bgU1P], supporting long-term therapy [^113Smqsi]. These benefits led to **tissue-agnostic FDA approval** [^112zqspv] for NTRK fusion-positive cancers [^111qGrMZ] and are reflected in multiple guidelines recommending larotrectinib for these patients [^113YHQuQ] [^111M7UJ6] [^113fZ8X8].

## Clinical trial evidence

### Initial clinical trials

The initial clinical evidence for Vitrakvi came from three multicenter, open-label, single-arm trials — LOXO-TRK-14001, SCOUT, and NAVIGATE [^111gU3Ur] enrolling patients with **NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors** [^112DwmnY]. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1 [^112DwmnY].

- **LOXO-TRK-14001 (phase I)**: Enrolled adults with advanced solid tumors, including those with NTRK fusions. The trial established the recommended adult dose of 100 mg orally twice daily and provided initial safety and efficacy data [^112Q7QaW].

- **SCOUT (phase I/II)**: Focused on pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors, including primary CNS tumors. The trial established the pediatric dosing regimen and demonstrated significant efficacy in pediatric NTRK fusion-positive cancers [^111L4cBP].

- **NAVIGATE (phase II)**: Enrolled adolescents and adults with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, further expanding the evidence base for efficacy and safety in this population [^112P5ube].

---

### Pooled analysis of clinical trials

A pooled analysis of 159 patients from the three trials provided comprehensive efficacy and safety data [^112P5ube]. Key findings include:

| **Efficacy endpoint** | **Result** |
|-|-|
| Overall response rate (ORR) | 79% (95% CI, 72–85) [^112P5ube] |
| Complete response (CR) rate | 16% [^112P5ube] |
| Partial response (PR) rate | 63% [^115DPQhQ] |
| Median duration of response (DOR) | 35.2 months (95% CI, 22.8–not estimable) [^114TDs2X] |
| Median progression-free survival (PFS) | 28.3 months (95% CI, 22.1–not estimable) [^114TDs2X] |
| Median overall survival (OS) | 44.4 months (95% CI, 36.5–not estimable) [^114TDs2X] |
| Median time to response | 1.8 months (interquartile range, 1.7–1.9 months) [^115DPQhQ] |

---

These results demonstrate **robust and durable antitumor activity** across a wide range of tumor types and ages, supporting the tissue-agnostic indication [^112zqspv].

---

## Efficacy across tumor types

Vitrakvi has demonstrated significant efficacy across multiple tumor types, including:

- **Salivary gland cancer**: ORR of 92% (22/24 patients), with rapid and durable responses [^114HVkto].

- **Infantile fibrosarcoma**: High response rates, enabling limb-sparing surgeries and improved quality of life [^115PW1c3].

- **Primary CNS tumors**: Objective responses observed in pediatric and adult patients, including high-grade gliomas [^1154JGrr].

- **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**: Significant responses reported, supporting its use in NTRK fusion-positive NSCLC [^113fZ8X8].

---

## Safety profile

Vitrakvi has a favorable safety profile, with predominantly low-grade adverse events. Common adverse reactions include fatigue, dizziness, nausea, constipation, and elevated liver enzymes [^117MvmAo]. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 39% of patients, but only 7% were grade 4, and **discontinuation due to adverse events was rare** (approximately 2%) [^115DPQhQ] [^1138SM2x].

---

## Regulatory approval and guidelines

Based on the compelling clinical trial data, Vitrakvi received accelerated approval from the FDA in November 2018 for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions [^115g7br7]. This marked the **first tissue-agnostic approval** for a targeted therapy [^111qGrMZ]. Multiple international guidelines, including NCCN and ESMO, recommend larotrectinib for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors [^112Z9e8z] [^111M7UJ6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While Vitrakvi demonstrates significant benefits, certain limitations must be considered:

- **Prevalence of NTRK fusions**: NTRK fusions are rare, occurring in less than 1% of solid tumors, necessitating broad genomic testing to identify eligible patients [^112HuwSB].

- **Acquired resistance**: Resistance mutations can develop, limiting long-term efficacy. Ongoing research focuses on next-generation TRK inhibitors to overcome resistance [^113biYBq].

- **Limited comparative data**: Most clinical evidence comes from single-arm trials, highlighting the need for further comparative studies [^112DwmnY].

---

Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) has demonstrated **significant clinical benefits** in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including high and durable response rates, rapid onset of response, and a favorable safety profile [^112P5ube]. These benefits have led to regulatory approval and widespread guideline endorsement, establishing Vitrakvi as a cornerstone of precision oncology for NTRK fusion-positive cancers [^114TDs2X].

Trial Information

Additional details of endpoints or study design

A substudy module size of 16 was chosen as sufficient for detecting a signal of therapeutic efficacy, analogous to the first of the 2 stages of the Simon phase II trial design with 10–16 participants. This signal-seeking phase is typical when determining whether formal expansion into a larger phase II trial is justifiable with ≥ 3/16 responding participants considered sufficiently interesting to investigate further. The ratio of time to progression (TTP) on study (TTP2) to TTP on prior line of therapy (TTP2:TTP1) accounts for disease stabilization. This is important given the limited historical data for rare cancer types and the heterogeneity within a pan-cancer study. By applying the TTP2:TTP1 ratio, each patient acts as their own control and, Von Hoff et al established a ratio ≥ 1.3 (equating to TTP2 exceeding the documented TTP1 by at least 30%) as sufficient to indicate disease stabilization. When TTP1 is not available, the minimum period of time for stable disease was set at 6 months. PFS was defined as the interval from date of registration to the date of first evidence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. OS was defined as the interval from the date of registration to date of death from any cause.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^1154JGrr]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved to treat adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

Methods

Patients with TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors from two clinical trials (NCT02637687, NCT02576431) were identified. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR).

Results

As of July 2020, 33 patients with TRK fusion-positive CNS tumors were identified (median age: 8.9 years; range: 1.3–79.0). The most common histologies were high-grade glioma (HGG; n = 19) and low-grade glioma (LGG; n = 8). ORR was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16–49) for all patients. The 24-week disease control rate was 73% (95% CI: 54–87). Twenty-three of 28 patients (82%) with measurable disease had tumor shrinkage. The 12-month rates for duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 75% (95% CI: 45–100), 56% (95% CI: 38–74), and 85% (95% CI: 71–99), respectively. Median time to response was 1.9 months (range 1.0–3.8 months). Duration of treatment ranged from 1.2–31.3+ months. Treatment-related adverse events were reported for 20 patients, with grade 3–4 in 3 patients. No new safety signals were identified.

Conclusions

In patients with TRK fusion-positive CNS tumors, larotrectinib demonstrated rapid and durable responses, high disease control rate, and a favorable safety profile.

### Elective discontinuation of larotrectinib in pediatric patients with TRK fusion sarcomas and related mesenchymal tumors [^1133LL8s]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this global multicenter clinical trial data set of, to our knowledge, the largest pediatric TRK fusion sarcoma population treated with a TRK inhibitor to date, larotrectinib demonstrated long-lasting activity that affected the survival of pediatric patients with IFS or other STS and related mesenchymal tumors. No new safety signals were observed, and adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of larotrectinib. Liver enzyme elevation, mostly grade 1/2, was the most common toxicity.

Approximately a third of the patients who electively discontinued larotrectinib had disease progression. Fifteen of the 16 (94%) patients who progressed or relapsed achieved disease control when larotrectinib was resumed, with 69% (11 of 16) having an objective response. All patients in the wait-and-see cohort were alive at the cutoff. This suggests that patients with localized completely resected tumors can discontinue larotrectinib and surgical local control should be strongly considered as soon as feasible without significant morbidity after response to larotrectinib. Moreover, elective discontinuation with close monitoring after prolonged disease response, even without surgical local control, could potentially be considered in some patients. However, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the optimal length of therapy to allow for larotrectinib discontinuation in this group.

Larotrectinib leads to rapid clinical improvement in patients, allowing for less morbid surgical procedures in responding patients. This rapid response can be especially important when there are life-threatening complications including compression of vital structures or tumoral hemorrhage.

A limitation was that decisions to discontinue treatment in the absence of disease progression and treatment duration before discontinuation varied according to investigator discretion. The Children's Oncology Group conducted a prospective study, ADVL1823 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), which assessed the optimal duration of larotrectinib; follow-up is ongoing to evaluate durability of response after patients stop treatment.

A strength of this analysis is the large sample size for a rare disease and a clinical trial design that permitted the wait-and-see analysis. The EPI-VITRAKVI study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) compared results from the larotrectinib SCOUT trial with external historical controls treated with chemotherapy. The findings indicate that in patients with IFS, larotrectinib reduced morbidity and the need for aggressive local therapies compared with chemotherapy and should be considered as first-line therapy.

### Reply to' comment on "Tumour-agnostic drugs in paediatric cancers"' [^112bGDm5]. British Journal of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

The ongoing phase II study in newly diagnosed NTRK fusion-positive IFS, solid and brain tumours and relapsed leukaemia in patients < 30 years (NCT03834961) is addressing objective response rate to first-line treatment with larotrectinib, with secondary endpoints of toxicity, event-free survival and overall survival and, for IFS, duration of response. It will provide further information on the use of the drug in frontline and results are eagerly awaited. Meanwhile, the role of the second-generation TRK inhibitor seletrectinib is also under investigation in a phase I/II study (NCT03215511) and an expanded access programme (NCT03206931). Additional TRK inhibitors such as entrectinib (Roche) and repotrectinib (Turning Point Therapeutics) are in development. While acknowledging the excellent points raised by Dr. Oliver and colleagues, it remains our view that given the favourable toxicity profile compared to conventional options and the demonstrated high response rates, TRK inhibitors constitute a highly attractive frontline option in IFS that for many patients may allow definitive, curative surgery before development of drug resistance.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^111w6X7g]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Larotrectinib is active in patients with TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors, a population with a high unmet need for effective and tolerable targeted therapeutic options. Confirmed responses and durable disease control were observed in patients with low- and high-grade gliomas as well as those with non-gliomas, with no treatment-related safety concerns. These results further support expanded testing for actionable therapeutic targets, including NTRK gene fusions, in patients with primary adult and pediatric CNS tumors.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^114UoymF]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The median time to response was 1.9 months (range 1.0–3.8 months). Median duration of response was not reached (range 3.8–22.0+ months) at a median follow-up of 12.0 months. At the time of data cutoff, 18 patients (55%) remained on treatment (Figure 1B). Fifteen patients (45%; 6 adults and 9 pediatric patients) experienced progression of disease while on treatment; 4 of these patients continued treatment post-progression because clinical benefit was ongoing in the opinion of the investigator, with 2 patients receiving treatment post-progression for > 1 month. Median progression-free survival was 18.3 months (95% CI: 6.7–not estimable [NE]) at a median follow-up of 16.5 months, with a 12-month progression-free survival rate of 56% (95% CI: 38–74) and a 24-month progression-free survival rate of 42% (95% CI: 18–65). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI: 16.9–NE) at a median follow-up of 16.5 months, with a 12-month overall survival rate of 85% (95% CI: 71–99) and a 24-month overall survival rate of 58% (95% CI: 28–88). The duration of treatment ranged from 1.2–31.3+ months (median 11.1 months). At the time of data cutoff, 15 patients (45%) had discontinued treatment, with 14 discontinuing due to progression of disease.

### Entrectinib, a TRK / ROS1 inhibitor with anti-CNS tumor activity: differentiation from other inhibitors in its class due to weak interaction with P-glycoprotein [^117SZNGo]. Neuro-Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Crizotinib was the first-in-class treatment for ROS1 and ALK fusion-positive NSCLC but it has not demonstrated intracranial efficacy in these settings, suggesting that the CNS exposure of this drug may be inadequate to control CNS disease. Similarly, the US prescribing information for larotrectinib, the first tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved by the FDA, does not describe any intracranial efficacy, and intracranial benefit following larotrectinib treatment has only been reported in a few patients with NTRK fusion-positive tumors and CNS involvement. Importantly, crizotinib and larotrectinib are both known substrates for P-gp.

Therefore, an unmet medical need exists for effective treatments with CNS activity for patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC and NTRK fusion-positive tumors.

Entrectinib is a novel, potent, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK that received accelerated approval by the US FDA in August 2019 for the treatment of adults with ROS1 -positive, metastatic NSCLC, and ≥ 12-year-old patients with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion. In an integrated analysis of 3 phase I/II trials, entrectinib yielded strong and durable responses in patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC and NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors. Importantly, entrectinib treatment was associated with clinically meaningful intracranial responses, with an intracranial objective response rate of 55% in both patient groups.

While the mechanism of action of entrectinib on TRK and ROS1 is known, conflicting early information was reported on the distribution of this compound to the brain and its interaction with P-gp. For example, initial data using classical bidirectional efflux ratio (ER) assays suggested that entrectinib and other molecules in its class (crizotinib and larotrectinib) are all strong substrates for P-gp, predicting poor brain penetration (see below). However, although entrectinib displayed low brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exposure in rats after a single oral dose, it achieved high brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (0.6–1.5) following repeated high daily doses in rat toxicology studies. Therefore, clear evidence is needed to demonstrate that entrectinib can achieve clinically meaningful CNS exposures, associated with pharmacological activity and efficacy in CNS models, in order to support the scientific rationale for entrectinib as a treatment for brain tumors harboring ROS1 and NTRK rearrangements.

Outcome Notes

The primary outcome of objective response was achieved in only one of 17 patients (6%, 95% CI, 1%-27%). This response occurred in the only non-CNS tumor with an NTRK fusion and was maintained over at least 39 months. Of the remaining 15 non-CNS tumors included based on NTRK overexpression, 11 achieved stable disease and 4 had progressive disease. The only CNS tumor enrolled in the study harbored an NTRK fusion and achieved stable disease.

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^114eno6i]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 gene fusions (NTRK gene fusions) occur in a range of adult cancers. Larotrectinib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRK kinases and has demonstrated activity in patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions.

Patients and methods

This multi-centre, phase I dose escalation study enrolled adults with metastatic solid tumours, regardless of NTRK gene fusion status. Key inclusion criteria included evaluable and/or measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2, and adequate organ function. Larotrectinib was administered orally once or twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing dose levels according to a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. The primary end point was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity.

Results

Seventy patients (8 with tumours with NTRK gene fusions; 62 with tumours without a documented NTRK gene fusion) were enrolled to 6 dose cohorts. There were four dose-limiting toxicities; none led to study drug discontinuation. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Larotrectinib-related adverse events were predominantly grade 1; none were grade 4 or 5. The most common grade 3 larotrectinib-related adverse event was anaemia [4 (6%) of 70 patients]. A dose of 100 mg twice daily was recommended for phase II studies based on tolerability and antitumour activity. In patients with evaluable TRK fusion cancer, the objective response rate by independent review was 100% (eight of the eight patients). Eight (12%) of the 67 assessable patients overall had an objective response by investigator assessment. Median duration of response was not reached. Larotrectinib had limited activity in tumours with NTRK mutations or amplifications. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed exposure was generally proportional to administered dose.

Conclusions

Larotrectinib was well tolerated, demonstrated activity in all patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions, and represents a new treatment option for such patients.

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^114Z7Gnh]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 1 May 2014 and 24 August 2017, 70 patients with a median age of 59.5 years (IQR 50–66, range 19–82 years) were enrolled to 6 cohorts. Four patients were enrolled to cohort 1 (50 mg QD), five to cohort 2 (100 mg QD), 43 to cohort 3 (100 mg b.i.d.), 4 to cohort 3a (200 mg QD), 7 to cohort 4 (150 mg b.i.d.), and 6 to cohort 5 (200 mg b.i.d.). The trial profile is summarised in supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online. Patient characteristics at baseline are summarised in Table 1. Patients were in general heavily pre-treated, with 44 (63%) of 70 having at least three prior systemic therapies. The data cut-off date for the present analysis was 19 February 2018.

Table 1.
Patient characteristics at baseline

NTRK gene fusions were identified in the tumours of eight patients; six were ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, one an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion, and one a TPR-NTRK1 fusion (Table 1). Additional oncogenic driver mutations were not identified in any of the TRK fusion tumours. Patients with 23 unique cancer diagnoses were included in this dose escalation study, as summarised in supplementary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online, according to NTRK gene fusion status.

All enrolled patients were assessable for safety. During the dose-escalation phase, no DLTs occurred at the first two dose levels. A DLT (dizziness) was reported in one of the first six patients treated at 100 mg b.i.d. and none were seen at 200 mg QD. DLTs occurred in one of seven patients treated at 150 mg b.i.d. (alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased) and one of six patients treated at 200 mg b.i.d. (dizziness). The MTD was consequently not reached, and the 100 mg b.i.d. dosing schedule was chosen as the recommended phase II dose based on its tolerability and the durability of response in patients with NTRK gene fusions; cohort 3 was subsequently expanded to further explore the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib.

### Larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumours: a pooled analysis of three phase 1 / 2 clinical trials [^112P5ube]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The selective TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was approved for paediatric and adult patients with advanced TRK fusion-positive solid tumours based on a primary analysis set of 55 patients. The aim of our analysis was to explore the efficacy and long-term safety of larotrectinib in a larger population of patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumours.

Methods

Patients were enrolled and treated in a phase 1 adult, a phase 1/2 paediatric, or a phase 2 adolescent and adult trial. Some eligibility criteria differed between these studies. For this pooled analysis, eligible patients were aged 1 month or older, with a locally advanced or metastatic non-CNS primary, TRK fusion-positive solid tumour, who had received standard therapy previously if available. This analysis set includes the 55 patients on which approval of larotrectinib was based. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), on a continuous 28-day schedule, to adults mostly at a dose of 100 mg twice daily, and to paediatric patients mostly at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 (maximum of 100 mg) twice daily. The primary endpoint was objective response as assessed by local investigators in an intention-to-treat analysis. Contributing trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02122913 (active not recruiting), NCT02637687 (recruiting), and NCT02576431 (recruiting).

Findings

Between May 1, 2014, and Feb 19, 2019, 159 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer were enrolled and treated with larotrectinib. Ages ranged from less than 1 month to 84 years. The proportion of patients with an objective response according to investigator assessment was 121 (79%, 95% CI 72–85) of 153 evaluable patients, with 24 (16%) having complete responses. In a safety population of 260 patients treated regardless of TRK fusion status, the most common grade 3 or 4 larotrectinib-related adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (eight [3%] of 260 patients), anaemia (six, 2%), and decreased neutrophil count (five [2%]). The most common larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (two [< 1%] of 260 patients), increased aspartate aminotransferase (two [< 1%]), and nausea (two [< 1%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred.

Interpretation

These data confirm that TRK fusions define a unique molecular subgroup of advanced solid tumours for which larotrectinib is highly active. Safety data indicate that long-term administration of larotrectinib is feasible.

### Agnostic-histology approval of new drugs in oncology: are we already there? [^115SdQaK]. Clinical Cancer Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last several years, several molecular aberrations have been unevenly described across cancers, although the distinct functional relevance in each biological context is not yet fully understood. Novel discoveries have led to the development of drugs tailored to the molecular profile of patients, thus increasing the likelihood of response among biomarker-selected patients. In this context, there has been a progressive redefinition of a precision medicine framework where evidence-based development and earlier approvals might now be driven by this molecular information. Innovative trial designs have greatly facilitated the evaluation and approval of new drugs in small cohorts of orphan cancers in which histology-dependent molecularly defined trials might be logistically difficult. However, accelerated approvals based on this agnostic-histology development model have brought new clinical, regulatory, and reimbursement challenges. In this article, we will highlight many of the biologic issues and clinical trial design challenges characterizing the development of tissue-agnostic compounds. Also, we will review some of the key factors involved in the development of pembrolizumab and larotrectinib, the first two drugs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in an histology-agnostic manner. Because we anticipate that agnostic-histology approvals will continue to grow, we aim to provide insight into the current panorama of targeted drugs that are following this strategy and some premises to take into consideration. Clinicians and regulators should be prepared to overcome the associated potential hurdles, ensuring that uncertainties are dealt with properly and allowing new, promising agents to arrive faster to the market.

### Tumor-agnostic precision medicine from the AACR GENIE database: clinical implications [^1144DUsf]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

NTRK fusions can be targeted using larotrectinib and entrectinib. Both agents have received FDA approval for a tissue-agnostic indication in patients with solid tumors who harbor NTRK fusions. The efficacy of larotrectinib in patients with NTRK gene fusions was evaluated in the context of three clinical trials: LOXO-TRK-14001 (NCT02122913), SCOUT (NCT02637687), and NAVIGATE (NCT02576431). In a pooled analysis of 55 patients, the ORR was 75%, and the median duration of response was 32.9 months. Entrectinib was approved on the basis of a pooled analysis of ALKA-372–001 (NCT02097810), STARTRK-1 (NCT02097810), and STARTRK-2 (NCT02568267) trials. The ORR was 59% in 54 evaluable patients with NTRK gene fusions (ref.; Fig. 2).

### Efficacy of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive cancers in adults and children [^112zqspv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Fusions involving one of three tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK) occur in diverse cancers in children and adults. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib, a highly selective TRK inhibitor, in adults and children who had tumors with these fusions.

Methods

We enrolled patients with consecutively and prospectively identified TRK fusion-positive cancers, detected by molecular profiling as routinely performed at each site, into one of three protocols: a phase 1 study involving adults, a phase 1–2 study involving children, or a phase 2 study involving adolescents and adults. The primary end point for the combined analysis was the overall response rate according to independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety.

Results

A total of 55 patients, ranging in age from 4 months to 76 years, were enrolled and treated. Patients had 17 unique TRK fusion-positive tumor types. The overall response rate was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 61 to 85) according to independent review and 80% (95% CI, 67 to 90) according to investigator assessment. At 1 year, 71% of the responses were ongoing and 55% of the patients remained progression-free. The median duration of response and progression-free survival had not been reached. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, 86% of the patients with a response (38 of 44 patients) were continuing treatment or had undergone surgery that was intended to be curative. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1, and no adverse event of grade 3 or 4 that was considered by the investigators to be related to larotrectinib occurred in more than 5% of patients. No patient discontinued larotrectinib owing to drug-related adverse events.

Conclusions

Larotrectinib had marked and durable antitumor activity in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer, regardless of the age of the patient or of the tumor type. (Funded by Loxo Oncology and others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02122913, NCT02637687, and NCT02576431 .).

### Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) [^116vS3n6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Larotrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, larotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50values between 5–11 nM. One other kinase TNK2 was inhibited at approximately 100-fold higher concentration. TRKA, B, and C are encoded by the genes NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of these genes with various partners can result in constitutively-activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as an oncogenic driver, promoting cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines.

In in vitro and in vivo tumor models, larotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumor activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins resulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein overexpression. Larotrectinib had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the clinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain with clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 9-fold higher than the recommended adult dose, VITRAKVI does not prolong QTc intervals to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of larotrectinib were studied in healthy subjects and adult and pediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In healthy subjects who received a single dose of VITRAKVI capsules, systemic exposure (Cmaxand AUC) of larotrectinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg (1 to 4 times the recommended adult dose) and slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 mg to 900 mg (6 to 9 times the recommended adult dose). In adult patients who received VITRAKVI capsules 100 mg twice daily in Study LOXO-TRK-14001, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved at approximately 1 hour after dosing and steady-state was reached within 3 days. Mean steady-state larotrectinib [coefficient of variation (CV%)] for Cmaxwas 788 (81%) ng/mL and AUC0–24hrwas 4351 (97%) ng*h/mL.

The most commonly occurring treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were fatigue, dizziness and anaemia (Table 2). Forty-two (60%) of 70 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events, with the most common being anaemia, fatigue and aspartate aminotransferase increased. Adverse events with an outcome of death were reported for five patients; all were related to disease progression. Most treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 (supplementary Table S3, available at Annals of Oncology online); 13 (19%) of the 70 patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which was anaemia [4 (6%) of 70 patients]. No patients had grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events. Serious adverse events were reported in 32 (46%) of the 70 patients overall and in 17 (40%) of 43 patients in the 100 mg b.i.d. cohort. These were predominantly related to disease progression. Three (4%) of the 70 patients, none with an NTRK gene fusion, discontinued treatment due to larotrectinib-related adverse events (amylase increased, enterocutaneous fistula, lipase increased, and muscular weakness). Adverse events leading to dose interruption or modification were recorded in 30 (43%) of 70 patients; the most common were dizziness (5 patients; 7%) aspartate aminotransferase increased and pyrexia (3 patients; 4%). Utilising NTRK gene fusion status as a surrogate for safety related to long-term exposure, there was no meaningful difference in treatment-related adverse event profiles for patients with or without NTRK gene fusions (supplementary Table S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).

### Larotrectinib treatment for patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers [^115sLoHL]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with salivary gland tumors in this study will continue to be followed up for long-term duration of response, survival outcomes, and safety. Additional patients in this cohort may eventually develop resistance to larotrectinib; this will potentially provide additional molecular data on the mechanism of acquired resistance. Long-term efficacy and safety data for larotrectinib will also be generated in several ongoing studies: the adult and pediatric phase II MATCH studies of biomarker-directed targeted therapy (NCT02465060, NCT03155620, and NCT03213704) and a prospective, non-interventional study of larotrectinib for TRK fusion cancer during routine clinical practice (NCT04142437).

In summary, larotrectinib demonstrated robust and durable activity in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland tumors of various histologies. The drug was well tolerated, with no new or unexpected safety findings. Larotrectinib represents a new precision oncology approach for patients with salivary gland tumors carrying NTRK gene fusions. The findings from this study support testing for NTRK gene fusions in patients with advanced salivary gland cancer to identify patients who may benefit from TRK inhibitors such as larotrectinib.

### Genomically matched therapy in advanced solid tumors: the randomized phase 2 Rome trial [^113xNacE]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Precision oncology aims to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring cancer treatments to individual patients, focusing on specific vulnerabilities identified through the analysis of cancer characteristics and the patient's clinical history. However, implementing these strategies presents major challenges, such as detecting actionable biomarkers, interpreting their clinical significance within the context of an individual patient's history and systematically utilizing available tailored treatments (TTs). This complexity is further compounded by the variability in the frequency of actionable molecular alterations across different tumor types, making histology a less reliable factor for determining treatment options. Additionally, standard therapeutic options vary considerably across different tumor types. As a result, the clinical significance of an actionable genetic alteration can differ substantially across various cancer types.

Among the different approaches for detailed molecular characterization of tumor samples, genomic tests are the most widely used in clinical trials to identify patients with actionable alterations.

Recent advancements have uncovered that treatments targeting some tumor-agnostic biomarkers induce considerable clinical benefits regardless of histology. Notable examples include pembrolizumaband dostarlimabfor tumors exhibiting high microsatellite instability (MSI-H); pembrolizumab for high tumor mutational burden (hTMB); larotrectinib, entrectiniband repotrectinibfor tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions; dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumors; selpercatinib for RET fusions; and trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-overexpressing (3+) solid tumors.

However, definitive evidence demonstrating the superiority of these approaches over standard therapies is lacking, with inconsistent outcomes reported across randomized agnostic precision oncology clinical trials. For instance, although the SHIVA trial did not show progression-free survival (PFS) benefits for off-label TT compared to standard treatments, the MOSCATO-01 trial achieved its endpoint, underscoring the value of broad genomic testing and targeted drug treatments.

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^111hanC2]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Patients were enrolled to six cohorts according to a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. A safe starting dose of 50 mg once daily (QD) was determined based on data from animal toxicity studies. Larotrectinib was administered orally, as a QD or twice daily (b.i.d.) dose for continuous 28-day cycles. Treatment was continued until disease progression, the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or the withdrawal of patient consent. Dose escalation was to proceed through planned dose levels (supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online), according to the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Expansion of the cohort treated at the MTD, or at a dose level deemed by the sponsor to provide significant TRK inhibition was permitted to better characterise safety and efficacy in specific patient groups. Dose interruptions of up to 4 weeks to allow for recovery were specified for clinically significant adverse events. Upon recovery, patients could either continue at the assigned dose of larotrectinib or have the dose reduced. Patients who had drug-related toxicity requiring a recovery period longer than 4 weeks were to be withdrawn from study drug administration, unless there was compelling evidence of response and no alternative treatment.

### Identifying patients with NTRK fusion cancer [^112QH1cu]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, clinical trials have shifted away from site-of-origin and histological subtype-specific designs and more towards basket trials, which are designed to test therapies targeted towards specific molecular mechanisms, and trials targeting NTRK fusions have been particularly successful. In one such recent trial, larotrectinib showed remarkable and durable efficacy against locally advanced and metastatic solid tumours harbouring an NTRK fusion. Entrectinib, active against NTRK fusions as well as fusions involving ROS1 and ALK, has also shown great efficacy in recent clinical trials. The success of larotrectinib has resulted in its subsequent fast-track approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), * and therefore standard of care will now require accurate identification of patients who could benefit from this practice-changing therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^115Rs2ob]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite therapeutic advances, progress in the treatment of primary CNS tumors, in particular, has been relatively slow due to a number of reasons, including molecular heterogeneity, poor blood-brain barrier penetration of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective anticancer agents. The results from this analysis demonstrate the activity of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors regardless of histology, thus confirming its capacity for blood-brain barrier penetrance as previously shown by the response seen in metastases of extra-cranial tumors to the CNS. Therapies used in the current standard of care for primary CNS tumors have limitations that highlight the unmet need for targeted therapies. For example, many chemotherapeutic agents have limited efficacy intracranially and/or demonstrate significant toxicity. In addition, cranial radiotherapy may have significant negative long-term consequences on neurocognitive functions, particularly in children. Specifically, pediatric high-grade gliomas are associated with very low survival rates or limited tolerable therapeutic options. Therefore, targeted therapy would be especially impactful in these patients by improving disease control and allowing for the delay of other treatments with less favorable risk/benefit profiles. As all of the complete responses and partial responses in this analysis occurred in pediatric patients, larotrectinib may be a valuable therapeutic option for delaying or avoiding the need for radiotherapy or as an adjuvant to surgery to preserve neurological function and avoid invasive or potentially debilitating complete tumor resection in this population. The current analysis is the largest report to date of a TRK inhibitor studied in primary CNS cancers. With this study, we further show that clinical trials of adult and pediatric patients with both primary CNS and non-CNS tumors are feasible, which is important when studying rare primary CNS tumors, such as those harboring an NTRK gene fusion.

### Larotrectinib treatment for patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers [^114HVkto]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective, and central nervous system-active tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion cancer. We report the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers.

Patients and Methods

Patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer treated with larotrectinib were identified from two clinical trials (NCT02122913 and NCT02576431). Patients received larotrectinib 100 mg twice daily (BID) except for one patient who received 150 mg BID in the phase I trial. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.

Results

At the data cut-off (July 20, 2020), 24 patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer had been treated. The most common histologies were secretory carcinoma (54%), adenocarcinoma (25%), and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (13%). All 24 patients had an ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. The ORR was 92% (95% confidence interval, 73–99). Best overall response was complete response in three (13%) patients, partial response in 19 (79%), and progressive disease in two (8%). The rate of progression-free survival at 24 months was 78% (median follow-up 30.9 months). Most treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were grade 1–2, and no patients discontinued treatment due to AEs.

Conclusion

Larotrectinib demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland tumors of various histologies, and a favorable safety profile. These findings support NTRK gene fusion testing in patients with advanced salivary gland cancers.

Key Recent US Food and Drug Administration Approvals for Precision Oncology Targeted Therapies

Larotrectinib, a tropomyosin kinase receptor (TRK) inhibitor, is the second tumor‐agnostic therapy to be approved by the FDA. 50 On November 2018, the FDA granted an accelerated approval to larotrectinib for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotropic TRK fusion. 50 Larotrectinib was approved based on tumor response rates and duration observed from a pooled analysis of 55 patients with 16 different tumors from three single‐arm clinical trials: LOXO‐TRK‐14001 (A Study to Test the Safety of the Investigational Drug Larotrectinib in Adults That May Treat Cancer; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02122913), SCOUT (A Study to Test the Safety and Efficacy of the Drug Larotrectinib for the Treatment of Tumors With NTRK‐fusion in Children; NCT02637687), and NAVIGATE (A Study to Test the Effect of the Drug Larotrectinib in Adults and Children With NTRK‐fusion Positive Solid Tumors; NCT02576431). 50, 51, 52 TRK fusions in these trials were identified by either next‐generation sequencing or by fluorescence in situ hybridization according to the procedures and analytic pipelines established by each laboratory. 52 Entrectinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is the third tumor‐agnostic therapy to receive an accelerated approval from the FDA on August 2019. 53 Similar to the two other tumor‐agnostic therapies, entrectinib was approved based on a pooled analysis of three single‐arm clinical trials: ALKA (European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database, 2012‐000148‐88), STARTRK‐1 (A Study of Oral RXDX‐101 in Adult Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancer Targeting NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1, or ALK Molecular Alterations; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02097810), and STARTRK‐2 (Basket Trial of Entrectinib [RXDX‐101] for the Treatment of Patients With Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK 1/2/3 [Trk A/B/C], ROS1, or ALK Gene Rearrangements [Fusions]; NCT02568267). 53, 54

### TRK inhibitors in TRK fusion-positive cancers [^115PW1c3]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical activity

In 2018, the antitumour activity of larotrectinib in the first 55 adult and paediatric patients consecutively enrolled into one of the three larotrectinib trials was published. The objective response rate (ORR) was 75% [95% confidence interval (CI) 61% to 85%, independent review]. In the 15 paediatric patients with evaluable disease in this series, the ORR was 93% (95% CI 68% to 100%). This initial data set has since been expanded. A total of 122 adult and paediatric patients (including the 55 patients above) with TRK fusion-positive cancers have since been treated with larotrectinib. Age ranged from 1 month to 80 years. The most common histologies were salivary gland cancer (16%), infantile fibrosarcoma (15%), thyroid cancer (15%) and lung cancer (9%). Most fusions involved NTRK1 (45%) or NTRK3 (53%) and were detected by local molecular profiling.

In this updated data set, the ORR was 81% (95% CI 72% to 88%; n = 109 evaluable; Table 2). Response occurred regardless of tumour type, age, NTRK gene or upstream partner type. Complete and partial responses were observed in 17% and 63% of patients, respectively. The median duration of response was not reached. The median time to response was 1.8 months (approximately when the first follow-up imaging assessment was carried out). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) have yet to be reported for the larger integrated set; neither had been reached at the earlier data cut in the first 55 patients.

Table 2.
TRK inhibitor activity

Data from this drug development programme resulted in the approval of larotrectinib by the US FDA for the treatment of TRK fusion-positive cancers regardless of tumour type or age in November of 2018. This label includes a provision for the treatment of cancers that are locally advanced based on the experience with neoadjuvant therapy in this programme. The most illustrative cases involved infants with infantile fibrosarcomas who would have required limb amputations to treat their cancer. Larotrectinib use resulted in substantial disease regression (complete pathological response) that allowed limb-sparing surgery, underscoring the utility of this therapy in earlier stage disease.

### A phase II trial of larotrectinib in tumors with NTRK fusions or extremes of NTRK mRNA overexpression identified by comprehensive genomic profiling [^111JztGJ]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

TRK-inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy across several cancers with NTRK fusions. Their activity in cancers with NTRK overexpression remains unclear.

Methods

This trial enrolled patients with advanced cancers harboring NTRK fusions or extreme mRNA overexpression, defined as NTRK1/2/3 expression by RNA profiling > 5 SDs for a given cancer type. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including time-to-progression (TTP) ratio [TTP on study to TTP on previous systemic therapy (TTP1)], progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Initially planned for 2 non-comparator groups: primary central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS tumours with NTRK fusions, the protocol was amended to permit NTRK overexpression.

Results

Seventeen patients were treated with larotrectinib: one glioblastoma with a SPECC1L::NTRK2 fusion (group 1), and a peripheral nerve sheath tumor with a TPM3::NTRK1 fusion and 15 patients with overexpression (group 2). The ORR was 6%. An additional 3 of 12 (25%) TTP1-evaluable patients achieved a TTP ratio ≥ 1.3 and 2 of 5 without an evaluable TTP1 had a PFS > 6 months. Median PFS and OS were 3.5 (95% CI, 1.4–6.0) and 15.9 months (95% CI, 6.4-NR), respectively.

Conclusion

Unlike its efficacy in NTRK-fusion positive cancers, larotrectinib did not demonstrate a signal of efficacy among tumors with NTRK overexpression.

### Developing drugs for tissue-agnostic indications: a paradigm shift in leveraging cancer biology for precision medicine [^115RM1ja]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Larotrectinib, an inhibitor specific to TRK, first entered clinical trials as a dose‐finding study that did not require patients' tumors to be positive for the NTRK fusion in early 2014, with the first publication of the preclinical and clinical effect in NTRK fusion–positive cancers coming in 2015 (Figure 1b). 17 This publication described the clinical course of a patient achieving a near‐complete response to therapy, exceptional for their clinical case. Due to the rarity of NTRK fusions, traditional randomized clinical trials were deemed not feasible to study TRK inhibitors. Because of this, clinical trials designed to include multiple tumor types were used to study the clinical efficacy of early TRK inhibitors in both adult and pediatric patients.

Following preclinical development, regulators worked alongside researchers to design a nonrandomized clinical trial strategy that would be powered to identify a signal of response. In the agreed upon study, the first 55 patients with NTRK fusions treated with larotrectinib would be presented to the FDA for conditional approval. The predetermined efficacy end point of ORR by independent radiology review was reported in a pooled analysis of three clinical trials, NCT02122913, NCT02637687, and NCT02576431, which included patients whose age ranged from 4 months to 76 years who exhibited fusion in any of the three known NTRK genes. 18, 19, 20 In this combined study of 55 subjects, 75% (95% CI, 61–85%) achieved an overall response of partial or better (Table 2). 21 Across studies, tissue types, and age ranges, clinical response remained consistent. Based on this pooled analysis, the FDA granted accelerated approval contingent on postmarketing requirements, including the characterization of the response in CRC, melanoma, central nervous system, and non‐small lung cancers, as well 40 additional tumors that had not yet exhibited a high response rate. To be able to better characterize the duration of the response, patients are required to be followed for a minimum of 12 months. This accelerated approval included adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors exhibiting an NTRK fusion, without a known acquired resistance mutation, which are metastatic or unamenable to surgical resection, and for whom no alternative treatments are available. It is notable that this approval represents the first time that the initial approval for a cancer therapeutic agent was agnostic to tissue type.

### Larotrectinib for paediatric solid tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions: phase 1 results from a multicentre, open-label, phase 1 / 2 study [^111L4cBP]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Gene fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 (TRK fusions) are found in a broad range of paediatric and adult malignancies. Larotrectinib, a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK kinases, had shown activity in preclinical models and in adults with tumours harbouring TRK fusions. This study aimed to assess the safety of larotrectinib in paediatric patients.

Methods

This multicentre, open-label, phase 1/2 study was done at eight sites in the USA and enrolled infants, children, and adolescents aged 1 month to 21 years with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours or CNS tumours that had relapsed, progressed, or were non-responsive to available therapies regardless of TRK fusion status; had a Karnofsky (≥ 16 years of age) or Lansky (< 16 years of age) performance status score of 50 or more, adequate organ function, and full recovery from the acute toxic effects of all previous anticancer therapy. Following a protocol amendment on Sept 12, 2016, patients with locally advanced infantile fibrosarcoma who would require disfiguring surgery to achieve a complete surgical resection were also eligible. Patients were enrolled to three dose cohorts according to a rolling six design. Larotrectinib was administered orally (capsule or liquid formulation), twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing doses adjusted for age and bodyweight. The primary endpoint of the phase 1 dose escalation component was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity. All patients who received at least one dose of larotrectinib were included in the safety analyses. Reported here are results of the phase 1 dose escalation cohort. Phase 1 follow-up and phase 2 are ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02637687.

Findings

Between Dec 21, 2015, and April 13, 2017, 24 patients (n = 17 with tumours harbouring TRK fusions, n = 7 without a documented TRK fusion) with a median age of 4·5 years (IQR 1·3–13·3) were enrolled to three dose cohorts: cohorts 1 and 2 were assigned doses on the basis of both age and bodyweight predicted by use of SimCyp modelling to achieve an area under the curve equivalent to the adult doses of 100 mg twice daily (cohort 1) and 150 mg twice daily (cohort 2); and cohort 3 was assigned to receive a dose of 100 mg/m 2 twice daily (maximum 100 mg per dose), regardless of age, equating to a maximum of 173% of the recommended adult phase 2 dose. Among enrolled patients harbouring TRK fusion-positive cancers, eight (47%) had infantile fibrosarcoma, seven (41%) had other soft tissue sarcomas, and two (12%) had papillary thyroid cancer. Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (occurring in 21 [88%] of 24 patients); the most common larotrectinib-related adverse events of all grades were increased alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ten [42%] of 24 each), leucopenia (five [21%] of 24), decreased neutrophil count (five [21%] of 24), and vomiting (five [21%] of 24). Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase elevation was the only dose-limiting toxicity and occurred in one patient without a TRK fusion and with progressive disease. No grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events were observed. Two larotrectinib-related serious adverse events were observed: grade 3 nausea and grade 3 ejection fraction decrease during the 28-day follow-up after discontinuing larotrectinib and while on anthracyclines. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and 100 mg/m 2 (maximum of 100 mg per dose) was established as the recommended phase 2 dose. 14 (93%) of 15 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers achieved an objective response as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1; the remaining patient had tumour regression that did not meet the criteria for objective response. None of the seven patients with TRK fusion-negative cancers had an objective response.

Interpretation

The TRK inhibitor larotrectinib was well tolerated in paediatric patients and showed encouraging antitumour activity in all patients with TRK fusion-positive tumours. The recommended phase 2 dose was defined as 100mg/m 2 (maximum 100 mg per dose) for infants, children, and adolescents, regardless of age.

Table 2
Clinical response to TRK inhibitors in NTRK fusion–positive cancers

Entrectinib has also demonstrated activity against a number of other kinases, including TRK, ROS1, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and was developed as an additional treatment option for NTRK fusion–positive cancers. Pooled analysis of three clinical trials, ALKA, NCT02097810, and NCT02568267, included both pediatric and adult patients who exhibited a fusion in any of the three known NTRK genes. 22 In this combined study of 54 subjects, 57% (95% CI, 43–71%) achieved either complete or partial response to therapy (Table 2). 23 Median duration of response was noted to be 10 months (95% CI, 7.1–not estimable) with a median follow‐up of only 12.9 months. Similar to larotrectinib, early clinical data for entrectinib in NTRK fusion–positive cancers suggest significant response across tumor types. Entrectinib entered clinical trials in early 2012 and was granted accelerated approval by the FDA based on a pooled analysis of phase I trials (Figure 1c). 24 Entrectinib shares a similar tissue‐agnostic indication with larotrectinib, with the exception of a restriction for the use of entrectinib in NTRK fusion–positive patients to those over 12 years of age.

### A next-generation TRK kinase inhibitor overcomes acquired resistance to prior TRK kinase inhibition in patients with TRK fusion-positive solid tumors [^113biYBq]. Cancer Discovery (2017). Low credibility.

Larotrectinib, a selective TRK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated histology-agnostic efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers. Although responses to TRK inhibition can be dramatic and durable, duration of response may eventually be limited by acquired resistance. LOXO-195 is a selective TRK TKI designed to overcome acquired resistance mediated by recurrent kinase domain (solvent front and xDFG) mutations identified in multiple patients who have developed resistance to TRK TKIs. Activity against these acquired mutations was confirmed in enzyme and cell-based assays and in vivo tumor models. As clinical proof of concept, the first 2 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancers who developed acquired resistance mutations on larotrectinib were treated with LOXO-195 on a first-in-human basis, utilizing rapid dose titration guided by pharmacokinetic assessments. This approach led to rapid tumor responses and extended the overall duration of disease control achieved with TRK inhibition in both patients. Significance: LOXO-195 abrogated resistance in TRK fusion-positive cancers that acquired kinase domain mutations, a shared liability with all existing TRK TKIs. This establishes a role for sequential treatment by demonstrating continued TRK dependence and validates a paradigm for the accelerated development of next-generation inhibitors against validated oncogenic targets.

### Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) [^112DwmnY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of VITRAKVI was evaluated in pediatric and adult patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trials: Study LOXO-TRK-14001 (NCT02122913), SCOUT (NCT02637687), and NAVIGATE (NCT02576431). All patients were required to have progressed following systemic therapy for their disease, if available, or would have required surgery with significant morbidity for locally advanced disease.

Adult patients received VITRAKVI 100 mg orally twice daily and pediatric patients (18 years or younger) received VITRAKVI 100 mg/m2up to a maximum dose of 100 mg orally twice daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next generation sequencing (NGS) (89%), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). NTRK gene fusions were inferred in 14 patients who had a documented ETV6 or NTRK 3 translocation identified by FISH. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) according to RECIST v1.1.

### Updated integrated analysis of the efficacy and safety of entrectinib in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors [^1171tMGK]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Within the entrectinib studies, variation in response probabilities was observed between tumor types, likely due to differences in biology and prognoses across the multiple histologies; other patient parameters may also influence and confound clinical outcomes. As patient numbers were low and confidence intervals were accordingly large, further recruitment should give a clearer picture of the efficacy of entrectinib across NTRK fusion-positive tumor types. Additional molecular analyses, such as the identification of currently nontargetable alterations that may affect disease dynamics or be linked to resistance mechanisms are currently being performed but have so far not shown any correlation between the presence of coalterations and response or resistance to treatment.

In this study, entrectinib was well tolerated with low discontinuation rates and dose-reduction rates consistent with previous reports. The high median dose intensity (> 91%) also indicates that any dose reductions and/or interruptions had a minor impact on overall dose exposure, with the majority of patients receiving most of the full planned dose. The safety profile was similar between the NTRK fusion-positive and overall safety populations and aligned with the safety profile of other TRK-targeted agents such as larotrectinib and with the previously reported safety profile.

Conclusions

This updated integrated analysis of entrectinib phase I/II clinical trials included more patients and longer follow-up than the previously reported data. Entrectinib continued to demonstrate clinically meaningful, durable systemic responses in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors and was associated with intracranial responses in the small cohort of patients with baseline CNS metastases at baseline, suggesting it could address the unmet need of a CNS-active treatment for these patients. Although NTRK fusions are rare, our results should encourage broader screening for these fusions in patients with solid tumors as they may benefit from entrectinib.

TARGETED THERAPY FOR TRK FUSION CANCERS

NTRK gene fusions (but not other NTRK alterations) appear to be primary oncogenic drivers in the tumors that harbor them. The encoded fusion proteins feature constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that may be targeted clinically with a number of agents that are either approved or in development.

Larotrectinib

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, ATP-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of TRK. It is highly potent, with IC 50 values in the range of 6.5–10.6 nM, and highly selective for TRKA, B, and C, with binding affinities over 100-fold greater than for a panel of other kinases. Larotrectinib is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion who have disease that is locally advanced or metastatic, or where surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity, and who have no satisfactory treatment options. Patients with a known resistance mutation are not indicated for larotrectinib treatment.

Larotrectinib has demonstrated robust efficacy in a combined analysis of three phase I/II trials in adults and children with TRK fusion cancers, irrespective of age or tumor type. In an integrated dataset of 159 patients, investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) was 79% [95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 85%] and median duration of response was 35.2 months (median follow-up 12.9 months). The median time to response was 1.8 months. Objective responses and durable disease control were also observed in the subsets of patients with primary CNS tumors or non-CNS solid tumors with brain metastases. Larotrectinib-related adverse events of grade 3–4 occurred in 13% of patients, and dose reductions and treatment discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events occurred in 8% and 2% of patients, respectively. Long-term follow-up is ongoing. The favorable safety profile of larotrectinib, together with robust clinical efficacy, translated into rapid, sustained, and clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life in the majority of patients.

Purpose Of Review

In this review, we highlight the pre-clinical development, recent clinical studies, and future directions of larotrectinib in patients with NTRK fusion-positive tumors.

Recent Findings

The tropomyosin receptor kinase family, TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC, transmit extracellular signals via a variety of intracellular pathways to promote normal neuronal development. TrkA, B, and C are encoded by NTRK1, 2, and 3, respectively. NTRK chromosomal alterations, most commonly gene fusions, have been identified as driver mutations in a broad range of malignancies. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of Trk, including larotrectinib, have shown broad clinical activity across multiple tumor types with NTRK fusion events. Although the prevalence of NTRK alterations is low, the exceptional activity of larotrectinib makes NTRK alterations an important predictive biomarker to screen for in any cancer.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^1136VDVt]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The main efficacy endpoint of these trials was ORR. Intracranial response to treatment was an endpoint for the current analysis and was investigator-assessed using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria based upon serial magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography scans. For this analysis, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1per investigator assessment was used for target lesions that were not measurable with RANO at baseline or for tumor types for which RANO measurement is difficult (e.g. pediatric high- and low-grade gliomas, leptomeningeal tumors). Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The 24-week disease control rate, defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting 24 weeks or more (measured from the date of the first dose of larotrectinib) following the initiation of larotrectinib, was calculated for the overall cohort as well as separately for adult and pediatric patients. The main safety endpoint of these trials was toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.

All studies were done in accordance with the standard of good clinical practice, the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable country and local regulations. Protocols were approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each investigative site. All patients (or parents or guardians of minor patients) provided written informed consent before the initiation of any study-related procedures.

Approval of larotrectinib and entrectinib for treating tumors with NTRK fusion

In November 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for larotrectinib — a potent and selective inhibitor of all three TRK proteins — for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors harboring NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation with metastatic disease or for whom surgical resection would likely result in severe morbidity, and who had no satisfactory alternative treatments available or whose cancer had progressed following treatment. This approval was based on the results of three multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trials that evaluated 55 patients treated with larotrectinib and demonstrated an ORR of 75%, with median duration of response and PFS not reached. In an expanded pooled efficacy analysis of 159 patients recently published, the ORR was 79%, and complete responses were achieved in 16% of patients with a median PFS of 28.3 months and median OS of 44.4 months.

In 2019, another NTRK inhibitor, entrectinib, was granted FDA approval for the same therapeutic indications as larotrectinib. Data from a pooled analysis from three phase 1–2 trials, including 54 patients with advanced or metastatic disease presenting with an NTRK fusion, showed an objective response of 57% for the overall population, with 7% of patients achieving a complete response with a median PFS of 11.2 months and a median OS of 21 months.

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^111V3KZT]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that in adults, larotrectinib was safe and well tolerated. Larotrectinib-related toxicities were most often grade 1 or 2, were reversible, and were easily managed. Since the MTD was not reached, 100 mg b.i.d. was set as the recommended phase II dose based on its tolerability and on the durability of response in patients with TRK fusion cancer. The 100 mg b.i.d. dosing regimen has since been investigated in a combined analysis of larotrectinib administered to 55 adult and paediatric patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions.

By independent radiology review, all eight patients with TRK fusion cancer were deemed to have had an objective response. One patient had punctate brain metastases at baseline that appeared to respond while on treatment, which suggests that larotrectinib can cross the blood–brain barrier. Indeed, the larotrectinib phase I paediatric study confirmed the presence of free drug within the CNS. Six of eight patients are continuing on larotrectinib with a median time on treatment of 28.4 months, which is markedly longer than observed for patients whose tumours did not harbour NTRK gene fusions (1.8 months). These data demonstrate the significantly robust and prolonged durability of response to larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion cancer, consistent with the findings of the paediatric phase I/II trial and the ongoing phase II larotrectinib adult/adolescent basket trial (NCT02576431).

Implications for Practice

Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase gene fusions are known oncogenic drivers and have been identified by genomic testing in salivary gland cancer, regardless of histology. Larotrectinib is a highly selective tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor that demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland tumors with a favorable safety profile. Our findings support appropriate routine testing of patients with salivary gland cancer to identify those who may benefit from TRK inhibitors.

Lay Summary

Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions occur when part of an NTRK gene joins with part of another gene to produce a new protein, resulting in a cancer-causing TRK fusion protein. NTRK gene fusions or TRK fusion proteins can be detected in tumors and help to identify patients who are suitable for therapies that specifically target the TRK fusion protein. Larotrectinib is such a drug and has been approved by the FDA to treat patients who have cancer and have tested positive for TRK fusion proteins in a variety of different tumor types. This article focuses on patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer who received larotrectinib, aiming to better understand the benefits and side effects of this drug in the context of treating this disease. Twenty-four patients with various types of salivary gland tumors were identified from two larotrectinib clinical trials. All had TRK fusions identified in their tumors. After starting treatment with larotrectinib, 22 of 24 patients (92%) had a rapid and long-lasting benefit (ie, tumor shrinkage). The response occurred quickly, with 19 of 24 patients responding within 2 months. Most patients had a continued benefit, with some patients still benefiting after more than 4 years of treatment. During treatment, 8 patients had progression of their disease, but 5 of the 8 continued treatment due to ongoing clinical benefit. The most common side effects were increased liver enzymes, dizziness, and tiredness, but overall, these side effects were not severe. No patient stopped treatment due to side effects. These results demonstrate that larotrectinib is an effective treatment option for TRK fusion-positive salivary gland tumors and strongly support that testing salivary gland cancer for NTRK gene fusions is critically important to identify the patients who can benefit from this targeted cancer therapy.

Presenting data on 50 of 55 patients with advanced TRK fusion-positive tumors, researchers reported that 76% of patients responded to the selective pan-TRK inhibitor larotrectinib, and 12% of patients experienced complete responses; 93% of responders remain on therapy. The targeted therapy was well tolerated, with just 13% of patients requiring a dose modification. None of the patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

### Tumour-agnostic drugs in paediatric cancers [^112rtSy3]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

The first ever approved tumour-agnostic drug was the monoclonal anti-programmed cell death protein-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Although developed and initially approved in 2014 for specific indications including advanced melanoma, in 2017 the FDA broadened the approval of this immune checkpoint inhibitor to include adult and paediatric patients with microsatellite instability-high and mismatch repair-deficient tumours. In reality, these latter tumour-agnostic indications are rare in children, and other drugs in the same class (e.g. nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab) are currently approved only for (different) tumour-specific indications.

Larotrectinib was the next drug to receive tumour-agnostic approval and entrectinib, an inhibitor of TRK, ROS1 and ALK, was FDA approved in 2019 for selected patients aged > 12 years with NTRK fusions and adults with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer whose tumours are ROS1 positive. Entrectinib was granted EMA Priority Medicines Designation in October 2017, potentially accelerating assessment of its European Marketing Authorisation Application and is currently being tested in paediatric patients with NTRK and ROS aberrations (NCT02650401). Continued FDA approval of both larotrectinib and entrectinib may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.

NTRK gene fusions are found in about 1% of solid tumours across multiple different adult histiotypes. In children, NTRK fusions are characteristic of infantile fibrosarcoma and cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma, occur very frequently (> 75%) in secretory breast carcinoma and mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland, are frequent (10–40%) in infant high-grade gliomas, spitzoid melanoma and papillary thyroid tumours, and can occur rarely (< 5%) in undifferentiated/spindle cell soft tissue sarcomas and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours. The fusions result in constitutive activation of the TRK A/B/C protein kinases, protein products of the genes NTRK 1/2/3, respectively. The objective response rate to larotrectinib in 122 patients whose tumours harbour a NTRK fusion was 81% across all ages and independent of tumour histiotype. Thus the authorisation of larotrectinib realises a paradigm shift towards the availability of drugs developed and authorised based on their mechanism of action.

NTRK fusion–positive solid tumors — larotrectinib efficacy and safety are as follows: Among 153 evaluable patients, 129 (79%; 95% CI, 72 to 85) had an objective response (OR), including 24 (16%) complete responses (CR) and 97 (63%) partial responses (PR); median duration of response was 35.2 months (95% CI, 22.8 to not estimable [NE]), median time to response 1.8 months (interquartile range, 1.7–1.9 months; range, 0.9–6.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) 28.3 months (95% CI, 22.1 to NE), and median overall survival (OS) 44.4 months (95% CI, 36.5 to NE). In the safety population (n = 260), grade 3 or grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurred in 39% (101/260) and 7% (17/260) patients, respectively.

### Larotrectinib treatment for patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers [^112VPJrc]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The ETV6 - NTRK3 gene fusion is a distinctive molecular alteration that is often diagnostic of secretory carcinomas, having been identified in ≥ 80% of salivary gland secretory carcinomas. By contrast, they are rarer (1%-11%) in other types of salivary gland tumors.,

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective, and central nervous system (CNS)-active tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved in more than 40 countries, including the United States, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion. Larotrectinib has been evaluated in three single-arm studies: a phase I study of adults with advanced solid tumors regardless of NTRK gene fusion status, comprising an initial dose-escalation phase, followed by an expansion phase in subjects with solid tumors and an NTRK gene fusion (NCT02122913); a phase I/II pediatric study of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or CNS tumors, regardless of NTRK gene fusion status (NCT02637687); and a phase II basket study of adults/adolescents with TRK fusion cancer (NCT02576431). In a pooled analysis of these studies, larotrectinib demonstrated robust tumor-agnostic efficacy regardless of age, NTRK gene, or fusion partner. Objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment was 79% and the median duration of response (DoR) was 35.2 months. Adverse events (AEs) were predominantly grade 1–2.

Salivary gland cancer was the third most common tumor type (13%) in these tumor-agnostic studies (soft tissue sarcoma and thyroid cancer occurred more frequently in 43% and 16% of patients, respectively). We conducted this current analysis to describe the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in the subset of patients from these studies with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer. We ultimately aim to optimize the use of larotrectinib in clinical practice in this patient population.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^111NPBHV]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

NTRK gene fusions have been identified in a variety of adult and pediatric tumors and are estimated to occur in up to 1% of all solid tumors. Importantly, NTRK gene fusions are found in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, particularly in children. NTRK gene fusions occur in up to 2% of adult primary brain tumors (e.g. gliomas of all grades), while in the pediatric population NTRK gene fusions have been observed in up to 5.3% of high-grade gliomas and 2.5% of low-grade gliomas. Of note, in children, high-grade gliomas harboring NTRK gene fusions appear to be enriched in patients with non-brainstem tumors and in those < 3 years old.

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. It was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in November 2018 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation that are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity and who have no satisfactory alternative treatments or have progressed following treatment. As of October 2021, larotrectinib was subsequently approved for use in more than 40 countries, notably being the first tumor-agnostic therapy to be approved by the European Medicines Agency. A combined analysis of 159 patients with solid non-CNS tumors from three adult/pediatric phase I/II trials of larotrectinib (NCT02122913, NCT02637687, NCT02576431) showed a durable objective response rate (ORR) by investigator assessment of 79%, regardless of age or tumor type. At the data cutoff date of February 2019, 69% were still receiving treatment or had undergone surgery with curative intent. Adverse events (AEs) related to larotrectinib were predominantly grade 1 or 2.

### Efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in TRK fusion-positive primary central nervous system tumors [^117SxzJm]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points
Larotrectinib demonstrated rapid and durable responses in TRK fusion-positive primary CNS tumors.
Responses were seen in patients with low- and high-grade gliomas as well as non-gliomas.
This analysis is the largest report to date of a TRK inhibitor studied in primary CNS cancers.

Importance of the Study

There is a high unmet need for tolerable targeted therapeutic options for patients with tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion-positive primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, particularly for pediatric patients for whom radiotherapy may have significant negative long-term consequences on neurocognitive functions. Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective TRK inhibitor approved to treat adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer. In patients with TRK fusion-positive CNS tumors, larotrectinib demonstrated rapid and durable responses with a high disease control rate and favorable safety profile in various tumor types including low- and high-grade gliomas as well as non-gliomas. All complete and partial responses in this analysis occurred in pediatric patients, suggesting that larotrectinib may be a valuable therapeutic option for delaying or avoiding the need for radiotherapy in this population. This is the largest report to date of a TRK inhibitor studied in primary CNS cancers.

The tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family of receptors is composed of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, which are neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) proteins encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes, respectively. TRK receptors are predominantly expressed in neuronal tissue and play an essential role in the normal development and function of the nervous system. Activation of TRK receptors by their respective ligands (neurotrophins) affects various neuronal events during embryogenesis and beyond, including neuronal cell differentiation, survival and proliferation, synaptic formation and plasticity, membrane trafficking, and axon and dendrite formation.TRK receptors play important roles in nociception, proprioception, memory formation and retention, pain and temperature sensation, appetite control, and learning.

NTRK gene fusions occur when the 3' region of the NTRK gene encoding the tyrosine kinase domain is joined in-frame with the 5' end of a fusion partner gene, either by intra- or interchromosomal rearrangement. The resulting fusion oncogene leads to the expression of a chimeric protein that retains the tyrosine kinase domain, is constitutively active, and drives downstream signaling.

Materials and Methods

All patients with primary CNS tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion detected by local/regional molecular testing and treated with larotrectinib in two clinical trials (NCT02637687 [SCOUT; phase I/II] and NCT02576431 [NAVIGATE; phase II]) as of July 20, 2020, were identified and included in the current analysis. Both trials included pediatric patients: SCOUT enrolled patients from 0–21 years of age and NAVIGATE enrolled patients ≥ 12 years of age. Eligibility criteria for both trials allowed patients with primary CNS tumors, regardless of histology and grade, who had progressed or were non-responsive to available therapies, were unfit for standard chemotherapy, or for whom no standard or curative therapy was available. Patients with neurologically unstable or rapidly progressive primary CNS tumors were not eligible. Patients who had previously experienced progression while receiving approved or investigational TRK inhibitors were also excluded. Patients who had received a TRK inhibitor for < 28 days of treatment and discontinued because of intolerance remained eligible. Larotrectinib was administered at the recommended dose of 100 mg (adult patients) or 100 mg/m 2 (pediatric patients; maximum of 100 mg) twice daily and continued until disease progression, withdrawal, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit. Patients could continue larotrectinib post-progression if, in the opinion of the investigator, they continued to derive clinical benefit.

### Elective discontinuation of larotrectinib in pediatric patients with TRK fusion sarcomas and related mesenchymal tumors [^111gYQd8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Larotrectinib is a highly selective tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor with efficacy in children with TRK fusion tumors. We evaluated patient outcomes after elective discontinuation of larotrectinib in the absence of disease progression in a protocol-defined wait-and-see subset analysis of eligible patients where treatment resumption with larotrectinib was allowed if disease progressed. We also assessed the safety and efficacy of larotrectinib in all pediatric patients with sarcoma. This cohort included 91 patients (younger than 18 years) from two clinical trials: infantile fibrosarcoma (49), other soft tissue sarcomas or related mesenchymal tumors (41), and bone sarcoma (1). Treatment-related adverse events were of maximum grade 1 or 2 in 25% and 25% of patients, respectively. The overall response rate was 87% (95% CI, 78 to 93). In the wait-and-see analysis, 47 patients discontinued larotrectinib. Median time from discontinuation to disease progression was not reached. Sixteen patients had tumor progression during the wait-and-see period. All 16 patients resumed larotrectinib, and 15 (94%) achieved disease control, with 11 objective responses. Larotrectinib continues to demonstrate durable responses with favorable safety in children with TRK fusion sarcomas. Treatment discontinuation is feasible in select patients with objective response and clinical benefit noted in those who have disease progression after elective treatment discontinuation.

Table 2.
Treatment-emergent adverse events

Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters for larotrectinib across the six dose escalation cohorts are summarised in supplementary Table S4 and Figure S2, available at Annals of Oncology online. The rate and extent of exposure to larotrectinib following QD and b.i.d. administration at doses up to 200 mg increased with increasing dose. The estimates of exposure were generally proportional to the administered dose. Larotrectinib was rapidly eliminated from plasma and its half-life appeared to be independent of the administered dose. Following repeated administration of larotrectinib, minimal accumulation was evident in plasma, consistent with its short half-life.

Of the 70 patients enrolled, 67 patients were assessable for objective response, with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 at enrolment; 3 patients without measurable disease were excluded from this assessment. The ORR among assessable patients as assessed by investigators was 12% (8 of the 67 patients); responses were seen in 7 of 8 patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions and in one patient with a tumour harbouring an NTRK1 gene amplification. The responding patient with the NTRK1 gene amplification had a single, small target lesion (11 mm) that shrank by 5 mm (45.5%) and a duration of response of 3.7 months. None of the patients with NTRK point mutations had an objective response, consistent with prior analyses suggesting that NTRK point mutations are generally not activating oncogenic events. Following independent, central radiology review, eight (100%) of eight patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions were deemed to have had an objective response, including two with complete responses and six with partial responses (Table 3; supplementary Figure S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).

Clinical Importance of Identifying Tumors Harboring NTRK Gene Fusions

There are several small-molecule inhibitors of TRK tyrosine kinases at various stages of clinical development and regulatory approval, some of which target multiple kinases, such as entrectinib, TPX-0005, and DS-6051b, and one of which, larotrectinib, is specific for TRK kinases. Published data from phase 1 and 2 trials of larotrectinib and entrectinib have suggested the potential effectiveness of such agents in the treatment of patients with TRK fusion cancer. Larotrectinib is a highly selective, orally administered, ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values in the low nanomolar range and minimal off-target activity against other kinases. Entrectinib is an orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase receptor, which also has IC 50 values for the TRK kinases in the low nanomolar range.

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^112Q7QaW]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 gene fusions (NTRK gene fusions) occur in a range of adult cancers. Larotrectinib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of TRK kinases and has demonstrated activity in patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions.

Patients and Methods

This multi-centre, phase I dose escalation study enrolled adults with metastatic solid tumours, regardless of NTRK gene fusion status. Key inclusion criteria included evaluable and/or measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2, and adequate organ function. Larotrectinib was administered orally once or twice daily, on a continuous 28-day schedule, in increasing dose levels according to a standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme. The primary end point was the safety of larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity.

Results

Seventy patients (8 with tumours with NTRK gene fusions; 62 with tumours without a documented NTRK gene fusion) were enrolled to 6 dose cohorts. There were four dose-limiting toxicities; none led to study drug discontinuation. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Larotrectinib-related adverse events were predominantly grade 1; none were grade 4 or 5. The most common grade 3 larotrectinib-related adverse event was anaemia [4 (6%) of 70 patients]. A dose of 100mg twice daily was recommended for phase II studies based on tolerability and antitumour activity. In patients with evaluable TRK fusion cancer, the objective response rate by independent review was 100% (eight of the eight patients). Eight (12%) of the 67 assessable patients overall had an objective response by investigator assessment. Median duration of response was not reached. Larotrectinib had limited activity in tumours with NTRK mutations or amplifications. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed exposure was generally proportional to administered dose.

Conclusions

Larotrectinib was well tolerated, demonstrated activity in all patients with tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions, and represents a new treatment option for such patients.

### Larotrectinib treatment for patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers [^114DK3ed]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Larotrectinib is a first-in-class, highly selective, and central nervous system-active tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with TRK fusion cancer. We report the efficacy and safety of larotrectinib in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancers.

Patients and Methods

Patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer treated with larotrectinib were identified from two clinical trials (NCT02122913 and NCT02576431). Patients received larotrectinib 100 mg twice daily (BID) except for one patient who received 150 mg BID in the phase I trial. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1.

Results

At the data cut-off (July 20, 2020), 24 patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland cancer had been treated. The most common histologies were secretory carcinoma (54%), adenocarcinoma (25%), and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (13%). All 24 patients had an ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. The ORR was 92% (95% confidence interval, 73–99). Best overall response was complete response in three (13%) patients, partial response in 19 (79%), and progressive disease in two (8%). The rate of progression-free survival at 24 months was 78% (median follow-up 30.9 months). Most treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were grade 1–2, and no patients discontinued treatment due to AEs.

Conclusion

Larotrectinib demonstrated robust and durable efficacy in patients with TRK fusion-positive salivary gland tumors of various histologies, and a favorable safety profile. These findings support NTRK gene fusion testing in patients with advanced salivary gland cancers.

NTRK fusions — The US FDA has approved entrectinib and larotrectinib for unresectable and/or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK fusions after standard therapy or when no alternatives exist, and these indications include unresectable and/or metastatic melanoma that has progressed after recommended therapies; therefore, offering NTRK fusion testing and, if positive, one of these therapies may be reasonable, recognizing the estimated 0.2% prevalence in cutaneous melanoma and that higher prevalence has been found in spitzoid melanoma.

### Biomarkers for systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^114iqBJJ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

NTRK fusions testing in metastatic breast cancer — recommendation and supporting evidence: Clinical Question 8 asks about testing for NTRK fusions in patients with MBC to identify candidates for tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and Recommendation 8.1 states that clinicians may test for NTRK fusions in patients with metastatic cancer who are candidates for a regimen including a TRK inhibitor to determine eligibility for larotrectinib or entrectinib (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). The systematic review did not identify any studies, either RCTs or prospective-retrospective, that used biomarker results to inform TRK inhibitor use in MBC with NTRK fusions; instead, the recommendation is based on phase I-II studies and Expert Panel informal consensus. In an integrated analysis of 55 patients with TRK fusion–positive unresectable or metastatic solid tumors (17 unique tumor types, including one breast tumor), larotrectinib achieved an ORR of 75% (95% CI, 61 to 85) by independent review and 80% (95% CI, 67 to 90) by investigator assessment, with durability shown by 71% of responses ongoing at 1 year and 55% of patients still progression-free; no grade 3 AEs related to treatment were seen in more than 5% of patients. An expanded efficacy population included five breast tumors.

NTRK fusions

The neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) genes NTRK1–3 encode separate TRK proteins that are cell surface receptors with similar structural domains. Once activated, they are auto-phosphorylated leading to the activation of downstream proliferative pathways. In cancer, there are multiple mechanisms to activate the TRK proteins, but the most common mechanisms are fusions that lead to ligand-independent activation of the TRK kinase that promotes oncogenesis.

Larotrectinib

Larotrectinib is a highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of all 3 TRK proteins. In a pooled analysis of 3 trials, larotrectinib displayed an overall response rate of 75%. At 1 year, 71% of the responses were ongoing and 55% of the patients remained progression-free. A total of 12 adult and pediatric tumor types were represented (Table 2). The FDA granted accelerated approval to Larotrectinib for adult and pediatric malignancies that are metastatic or where surgical resection would result in severe morbidity. Multiple follow-up studies focused updated analysis of these trials across cancer types demonstrated benefit in NTRK -fusion positive solid tumors (Table 2).

Entrectinib

Entrectinib is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the TRK, ROS1, and ALK proteins and was designed to penetrate the central nervous system. In a pooled analysis of 3 single-arm trials, 54 adult patients with advanced solid tumors with NTRK fusions were treated with entrectinib and the overall response rate was 57%. The median duration of response was 10 months. The FDA granted accelerated approval for entrectinib for solid tumors with NTRK gene fusion with advanced solid tumors that did not have known acquired mutation. Updated analysis with a larger cohort of 121 patients across 14 tumor types showed a response rate of 61.2%. Of note, the intracranial response rate in 11 patients with CNS disease was 63.6%. There were also individual updates published for specific histologic types showing consistent response (Table 2).

### Updated integrated analysis of the efficacy and safety of entrectinib in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors [^112HuwSB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Larotrectinib is a TRK inhibitor also approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors. In updated results from the phase I/II integrated analysis of larotrectinib in 116 adult patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, ORR per investigator was 71%, median DoR 35.2 months, and median PFS 25.8 months. Overall efficacy was reported for the 14 (12%) patients with baseline CNS metastases, but intracranial efficacy was not a predefined study endpoint. NTRK gene fusions occur in less than 1% of tumors, therefore the larotrectinib and entrectinib trials used single-arm study designs and integrated analyses to evaluate efficacy and safety. The study designs and patient populations differ substantially between the entrectinib and larotrectinib trials. For example, the entrectinib studies included a lower proportion of pediatric malignancies and a higher proportion of patients with CNS metastases at baseline (21% vs. 12% for larotrectinib). The utility of cross-study comparisons is therefore limited and further complicated by the fact that reporting methods differ between studies. For example, entrectinib studies primarily used BICR, whereas larotrectinib studies primarily used investigator-assessed response. This leads to slight discrepancies for ORR: in the larotrectinib studies, ORR was 71% by investigator and 66% by BICR.

Current Oncologic Drug Development Landscape

The traditional drug development paradigm partitioned primary evaluations of safety in phase I from analysis of preliminary efficacy in phase II and assessment of benefit relative to the existing standard of care with randomized comparison in phase III. Conventional discrete development programs have intrinsic inefficiencies and pause between phases of research while investigators interpret results, design, and initiate the next study. Moreover, while enrolling trial participants exhibiting diverse comorbidities, treatment histories, and cancer microenvironments, conventional designs rely on sample averages to guide dose selection and project benefit to the broader target patient population. Trials devised to infer average behavior may not elucidate the extent to which a treatment strategy confers benefit to individual patients and specific subpopulations.

Recent emphasis on precision medicine, with drugs targeting particular genetic alterations that activate pathways mediating proliferation and cell survival or promote anti-cancer immunity, has accelerated the development of tumor agnostic noncytotoxics and prompted innovations in trial design. Pembrolizumab achieved the first tissue-agnostic drug approval in 2017, expanding the indication to any unresectable or metastatic solid tumor with microsatellite instability. The tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitor larotrectinib received priority review status from the FDA for tumors with an neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinases gene fusion, regardless of tissue of origin.

Regarding medical management for cholangiocarcinoma, more specifically with respect to definitive systemic therapy, second- and later-line therapy, ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend to offer entrectinib, larotrectinib, or repotrectinib in patients with NTRK fusions who have progressed on or are intolerant to prior treatment.

### Systemic therapy for melanoma: ASCO guideline update [^115eHFV6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Noncutaneous melanoma (other forms) — Recommendation 4.3 states: "No recommendation for or against any specific systemic therapy for patients with any other form of noncutaneous melanoma may be made at this time. Patients should be offered or referred for enrollment in clinical trials where possible (Type: No recommendation; Evidence quality: Not applicable; Strength of recommendation: Not applicable)". No randomized trials were identified for these forms for either the 2020 guideline or the 2022 update, and the Panel notes that because these forms are rare it is unlikely that high-quality randomized data will be available; unlike uveal or mucosal melanoma, the Panel did not feel they could recommend the evidence-based cutaneous melanoma therapies. Testing for NTRK fusion and offering larotrectinib or entrectinib "may be reasonable" in patients with noncutaneous unresectable and/or metastatic melanoma where no other therapy is supported or who have progressed on other therapies, but the prevalence of NTRK fusion in noncutaneous melanoma is not well understood.

### Detection of tumor NTRK gene fusions to identify patients who may benefit from tyrosine kinase (TRK) inhibitor therapy [^115nAkzB]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical impact of TRK inhibition was initially suggested in case reports of patients with TRK fusion cancer treated with larotrectinib, and entrectinib. This potential impact was subsequently confirmed in an integrated analysis of the first 55 adult and pediatric patients with tumors of 17 different types harboring NTRK gene fusions. Larotrectinib demonstrated an objective response rate of 75%. In an updated analysis with a median follow-up of 17.6 months, the median duration of response had not been reached. Larotrectinib was generally well tolerated, with most of the adverse events (93%) being of grade 1 or 2. In the pediatric phase 1 study, the best response in seven patients without documented tumor NTRK gene fusions was progressive disease. Larotrectinib was US Food and Drug Administration approved in November 2018 for adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion and meet other specified criteria (VITRAKVI Prescribing Information, last accessed February 5, 2018). The activity of entrectinib in patients with tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions has also been confirmed in an integrated analysis of 54 adult patients with TRK fusion cancer of 10 different tumor types enrolled into one of three phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. After 15.5 months of follow-up, the objective response rate in this cohort was 57%. The median duration of response was 10.4 months. Entrectinib was also generally well tolerated, with most treatment-related adverse events being grade 1 or 2. In addition to these agents, outcome data are also beginning to emerge from ongoing phase 1/2 studies of TPX-0005and DS-6051b, with both agents initially reported as being well tolerated.

2.1	 Patient Selection

Select patients for treatment with VITRAKVI based on the presence of a NTRK gene fusion in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In patients with secretory breast cancer, mammary analogue secretory cancer (MASC), congenital mesoblastic nephroma (CMN), or infantile fibrosarcoma, consider treatment without confirmation of NTRK rearrangements in tumor specimens.

Information on FDA-approved tests is available at http://www.fda.gov/companiondiagnostics.

2.2	 Recommended Dosage

Recommended Dosage in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Body Surface Area of 1 Meter-Squared or greater

The recommended dosage of VITRAKVI is 100 mg orally twice daily, with or without food, until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity.

Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients with Body Surface Area Less Than 1 Meter-Squared

The recommended dosage of VITRAKVI is 100 mg/m2orally twice daily, with or without food, until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity.

2.3 	Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions

For Grade 2 and higher liver function test abnormalities, refer to Section 2.4, Table 2, Dosage Modifications for Hepatotoxicity.

For all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions:

Withhold VITRAKVI until adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or Grade 1. Resume at the next dosage modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks.
Permanently discontinue VITRAKVI if an adverse reaction does not resolve within 4 weeks.

The recommended dosage reductions for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.

Permanently discontinue VITRAKVI in patients who are unable to tolerate VITRAKVI after three dose modifications.

2.4	 Dosage Modifications for Hepatotoxicity

The recommended dosage modifications for VITRAKVI liver function test abnormalities are provided in Table 2.

For CTCAE Grade 2 ALT and/or AST elevation, monitor liver function frequently as clinically indicated, to establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.5	 Dosage Modifications for Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with VITRAKVI. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the VITRAKVI dose by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the VITRAKVI dose that was used prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Outcomes

The primary end point was the safety of oral larotrectinib, including the MTD and recommended dose for further clinical investigation. Secondary end points included pharmacokinetics, objective response and duration of response. A post hoc analysis of the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with TRK fusion cancer was carried out.

DLT was assessed during the dose escalation phase and was defined as any of the following treatment-emergent adverse events, if they occurred during the first cycle: grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity, with the exception of fatigue, asthenia, nausea or other manageable constitutional symptom; grade 3 or 4 vomiting or diarrhoea persisting for more than 24 h; any toxicity, regardless of grade, resulting in discontinuation or dose reduction of larotrectinib; grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia with grade 1 or worse bleeding; grade 4 anaemia lasting more than 7 days; or grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days.

Statistical considerations

Safety and antitumour activity data were summarised descriptively. Adverse events were summarised using the standardised preferred term assigned by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18.1. The safety population comprised all patients who received one or more doses of larotrectinib. It was anticipated that enrolment of up to 60 patients might be required to define the MTD of larotrectinib, with the actual number dependent on the safety profile. A safety review committee considered safety and pharmacokinetic data and rendered dose-escalation decisions before each dose escalation. Antitumour activity was assessed in all enrolled patients; the ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline by RECIST v1.1 with a complete or partial response. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (version 9.4).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

Central Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Skeletal Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Unless noted, data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflects exposure to VITRAKVI in 444 patients, including 62% patients exposed for greater than 6 months, 44% patients exposed for greater than 1 year, and 30% patients exposed for greater than 2 years. VITRAKVI was studied in one adult dose-finding trial [LOXO-TRK-14001 (n = 75)], one pediatric dose-finding trial [SCOUT (n = 154)], and one single arm trial [NAVIGATE (n = 215)]. All patients had an unresectable or metastatic solid tumor and no satisfactory alternative treatment options or disease progression following treatment.

Across these 444 patients, the median age was 44 years (range: 18 days to 90 years); 35% were younger than 18 years; 53% were female; 59% were White, 24% were Asian and, 4% were Black; and 7% were Hispanic/Latino. Most adults (91%) received VITRAKVI 100 mg orally twice daily and 91% of pediatrics (< 18 years) received VITRAKVI 100 mg/m2twice daily up to a maximum dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose ranged from 50 mg daily to 200 mg twice daily in adults and 9.6 mg/m2twice daily to 120 mg/m2twice daily in pediatrics [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) [^111KPfgQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The assessment of efficacy was based on 339 patients with solid tumors with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled across the three clinical trials. Baseline characteristics were: median age 38 years (range: 18 days to 90 years); 39% < 18 years of age; 51% female; 57% White, 28% Asian, 2.4% Black or African American; 6% Hispanic or Latino and ECOG performance status (PS) 0–1 (88%) or 2 (10%). Sixty-three percent of patients had metastatic disease, including patients with brain metastases, and 22% had locally advanced, unresectable disease. Ninety-two percent of patients had received prior treatment for their cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy, including RAI. Seventy percent of all patients had received prior systemic therapy in the unresectable or metastatic setting excluding RAI; 30% were treatment naive, 33% had received 1 prior therapy and 37% percent had received 2 or more prior therapies with a median of one prior systemic regimen.

Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 5, 6, and 7.

The ORR for patients with NTRK1 fusions (n = 142) was 59% (95% CI: 51, 67), NTRK2 fusions (n = 44) was 32% (95% CI: 19, 48) and NTRK3 fusions (n = 142) was 67% (95% CI: 59, 75).

### Larotrectinib in adult patients with solid tumours: a multi-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study [^113qVb2L]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our next generation sequencing data suggest that patients with TRK fusion cancer are unlikely to harbour other actionable alterations within their tumours. This argues for careful consideration when screening patients. In particular, it is crucial that the specific platform chosen for genetic screening is able to capture the entire spectrum of NTRK gene fusions.

The combined results of the current study and the paediatric larotrectinib trial show that larotrectinib is effective against TRK fusion cancer, regardless of patient age. These studies also demonstrate the robust efficacy of larotrectinib against 17 unique TRK fusion tumour types, regardless of NTRK gene and 5′ fusion partner.

In conclusion, larotrectinib was well tolerated and provided consistent and durable antitumour activity in adults with TRK fusion cancer, giving an ORR of 100% (eight of eight patients) by independent central assessment. This first-in-class, highly selective TRK inhibitor is the only one of its kind, to our knowledge, that is currently in clinical development simultaneously for both adult and paediatric cancers. Larotrectinib offers a potential new standard of care for patients with TRK fusion cancer, which is contingent on effective tissue-agnostic routine screening to detect tumours harbouring NTRK gene fusions.
