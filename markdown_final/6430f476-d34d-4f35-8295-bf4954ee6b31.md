## Question

Iron deficiency anemia with macrocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a reasoning pathway to evaluate and manage iron deficiency anemia that presents with macrocytosis, and to reconcile why this seemingly contradictory pattern occurs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the laboratory abnormality and excluding spurious macrocytosis. Then, I should verify true iron deficiency using iron studies and account for inflammation. Next, I will consider the pathophysiology that allows iron deficiency and macrocytosis to coexist. After that, I need to identify the most likely causes of macrocytosis in this context, including medications, alcohol, liver disease, hypothyroidism, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Finally, I will outline a targeted diagnostic workup and a management plan that treats iron deficiency while addressing the cause of macrocytosis, with special attention to high-risk groups and monitoring for response to therapy [^111bDP7o] [^115bHVQo].

> Let me first confirm the hematologic pattern and exclude artifacts that can mimic macrocytosis; I need to check the reticulocyte count and examine a peripheral smear because reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs and can spuriously elevate the automated MCV, and I should also consider cold agglutinins or other preanalytical issues that distort cell sizing, since confirming true macrocytosis is essential before proceeding to etiologic workup [^111etdk1] [^111bDP7o].

> Wait, let me verify the iron deficiency before I anchor on macrocytosis; serum ferritin is the most useful initial test, but I should double-check for inflammation because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be misleadingly normal or elevated in inflammatory states, so in the presence of inflammation a ferritin below about 100 ng/mL with low transferrin saturation supports iron deficiency, and a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks of iron therapy is highly suggestive of true iron deficiency even if baseline studies are equivocal [^114N2wZa] [^1171wSFX] [^114J4SK1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about morphology; I initially thought macrocytosis rules out iron deficiency, but that would be an oversimplification because mixed or multifactorial anemias are common, and relying on MCV alone to exclude iron deficiency leads to frequent misclassification, so I should confirm iron status with ferritin, transferrin saturation, and, when needed, soluble transferrin receptor or reticulocyte hemoglobin content to distinguish absolute from functional iron deficiency, especially in inflammatory or CKD contexts [^112FPnFF] [^112knLuE] [^1171wSFX].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology that allows iron deficiency and macrocytosis to coexist; iron deficiency impairs heme synthesis and produces microcytosis, but if there is concurrent impairment of nuclear DNA synthesis from B12 or folate deficiency, alcohol, liver disease, hypothyroidism, or myelodysplasia, RBCs can be larger and the net MCV may be normal or macrocytic, so the final MCV reflects the balance between these opposing forces rather than a single process [^111sFJG3] [^111bDP7o] [^1138Uw7L].

> Next, I should review the most likely causes of macrocytosis in someone who also has iron deficiency; let me consider medications such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or hydroxyurea, alcohol use disorder, liver disease with round macrocytes, hypothyroidism, and myelodysplastic syndrome, and I should confirm or exclude these with targeted testing including B12, RBC folate, TSH, liver enzymes, and a careful medication and alcohol history, because identifying the driver of macrocytosis changes management and prognosis [^111bDP7o] [^1114iuj8] [^116UL4QN].

> But wait, what if the macrocytosis reflects ineffective erythropoiesis rather than a nutritional or toxic cause; I should double-check the reticulocyte count and smear for dysplastic features, and if the reticulocyte response is inappropriately low for the degree of anemia and the smear shows macro-ovalocytes or dysplasia, I need to consider MDS or congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and proceed to bone marrow evaluation with cytogenetics to clarify the diagnosis and guide therapy [^116UL4QN] [^115QWr96].

> Let me think about the diagnostic workup in a stepwise fashion; I should confirm anemia and indices with a repeat CBC and smear, obtain ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and TIBC with CRP to contextualize ferritin, add B12, RBC folate, TSH, and liver tests, and if macrocytosis persists without a clear cause, obtain a reticulocyte count and consider soluble transferrin receptor or reticulocyte hemoglobin content to refine iron status; in men and postmenopausal women with confirmed iron deficiency, I should evaluate for gastrointestinal blood loss with upper and lower endoscopy unless there is an obvious non-GI source [^115bHVQo] [^116NsNUx] [^1171wSFX].

> I need to ensure the management plan addresses both the iron deficiency and the cause of macrocytosis; oral iron is first-line for most patients, but if there is malabsorption, intolerance, or failure to respond, intravenous iron is appropriate, and I should monitor for a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks to confirm response, while simultaneously treating B12 or folate deficiency, addressing alcohol or liver disease, adjusting culprit medications when feasible, and arranging oncology or hematology follow-up if MDS is suspected [^114J4SK1] [^114ZYX35] [^116UL4QN].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts that modify thresholds and urgency; in inflammatory bowel disease, macrocytosis should prompt annual B12 and folate checks and iron deficiency is common, so I should integrate disease activity, CRP, and ferritin with transferrin saturation to guide therapy and surveillance, and in older adults with confirmed iron deficiency, I should maintain a low threshold for gastrointestinal evaluation given malignancy risk while individualizing invasive testing based on comorbidity and patient preferences [^115gHTs2] [^115gs2r8] [^113iohMv].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaway to avoid premature closure; macrocytosis does not exclude iron deficiency, and the most efficient way to prevent diagnostic error is to combine careful morphology review with iron studies interpreted in clinical context, recognizing that a brisk hemoglobin response to iron is a powerful confirmatory signal even when baseline labs are equivocal, and that mixed etiologies are common enough to mandate parallel evaluation for both iron deficiency and macrocytic drivers [^114J4SK1] [^112FPnFF] [^1138Uw7L].

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is classically **microcytic** [^111sFJG3], but macrocytosis can occur due to **coexisting B12/folate deficiency** [^111bDP7o], liver disease [^1114iuj8], alcohol use and medications [^111bDP7o], or reticulocytosis [^111etdk1]. Macrocytosis in IDA is uncommon and should **prompt evaluation for these causes** [^115bHVQo]. Management includes confirming iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation [^112knLuE], treating the cause, and correcting deficiencies; if macrocytosis persists, assess for myelodysplastic syndrome or other marrow disorders [^116UL4QN].

## Pathophysiology of macrocytosis in iron deficiency anemia

Macrocytosis reflects **increased red cell size (MCV > 100 fL)** [^111bDP7o] and is uncommon in IDA. When present, it reflects concurrent processes that increase RBC size or alter erythropoiesis [^116116vp]:

- **Coexisting B12/folate deficiency**: Impaired DNA synthesis causes megaloblastic anemia with macrocytosis [^111bDP7o].
- **Liver disease**: Alcohol-related or cirrhosis-associated macrocytosis is common [^1114iuj8].
- **Medications**: Methotrexate, azathioprine, and others can cause macrocytosis [^114AKt1p].
- **Reticulocytosis**: Larger reticulocytes can raise MCV, especially with hemolysis or bleeding [^111etdk1].

---

## Clinical significance of macrocytosis in iron deficiency anemia

Macrocytosis in IDA signals **coexisting conditions** and warrants targeted evaluation:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: B12/folate deficiency is common and should be assessed [^111bDP7o].
- **Liver disease**: Alcohol use or cirrhosis should be considered [^1114iuj8].
- **Medication effects**: Review drugs that cause macrocytosis [^111bDP7o].
- **Bone marrow disorders**: Persistent macrocytosis suggests MDS or other marrow failure syndromes [^115QWr96].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential to identify **coexisting causes**:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | CBC, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear | Confirm macrocytosis and assess morphology [^111bDP7o] |
| 2 | Iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, TIBC) | Confirm iron deficiency [^114N2wZa] |
| 3 | Vitamin B12 and folate levels | Exclude megaloblastic anemia [^117St36s] |
| 4 | Liver function tests | Assess liver disease [^notfound] |
| 5 | Medication review | Identify drug-induced macrocytosis [^111bDP7o] |
| 6 | Bone marrow biopsy (if persistent macrocytosis) | Evaluate for MDS or other marrow disorders [^116UL4QN] |

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on correcting **iron deficiency** and addressing coexisting causes:

- **Iron replacement**: Oral iron is first-line; IV iron for intolerance or malabsorption [^114ZYX35].
- **Treat underlying causes**: Manage B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, or medication effects [^111bDP7o].
- **Monitor response**: Track hemoglobin, MCV, and reticulocyte count to gauge recovery [^114J4SK1].
- **Persistent macrocytosis**: Evaluate for MDS or other marrow disorders if unresolved [^116UL4QN].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause** and response to therapy. Persistent macrocytosis may indicate MDS or other marrow disorders, which carry higher morbidity and mortality [^111bDP7o]. Untreated IDA increases risks of cardiovascular complications, impaired cognition, and poor pregnancy outcomes [^111sFJG3].

---

Iron deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, but macrocytosis can occur with coexisting B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, medications, or reticulocytosis. Persistent macrocytosis warrants evaluation for marrow disorders, and management should address both iron deficiency and the underlying cause.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^117Vr9jF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation. Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred. With contemporary formulations, allergic reactions are rare.

### Disorders of iron metabolism: new diagnostic and treatment approaches to iron deficiency [^117G1BYP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Blood transfusion in obstetrics [^113Ch7CH]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, iron supplementation, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a trial of oral iron supplementation as first-line therapy in patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. Obtain further testing if there is no demonstrable rise in hemoglobin at 2 weeks and compliance has been assured.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10 9 /L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^111sFJG3]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^116ve3vu]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Several causes have been identified including iron deficiency, reduced production of erythropoietin, shortened red cell survival and folate deficiency. Among these, endogenous erythropoietin deficiency is the predominant cause.

Erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) have been effective in treating the anemia of ESRD. However, despite their use, anemia may still occur and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Furthermore, higher ESA doses have also been associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. Whether the increase in mortality observed with ESAs is due to achieved hemoglobin, ESA resistance due to inflammation, a direct effect of erythropoietin, concurrent administration of intravenous iron or some other mechanism, is unclear.

Morphologically, the anemia of ESRD is typically normocytic and normochromic, but up to 30% may have macrocytosis. Proposed causes of macrocytosis in dialysis patients include intravenous iron, megaloblastic anemia due to B12 and folate deficiency or dialysis-induced changes in red cell volume. Reticulocytosis is associated with macrocytosis in the general population and initial studies of ESAs suggested stable and predictable increases in reticulocyte levels with maintenance erythropoietin therapy. However, reticulocytes can also be smaller than mature red cells, and no studies have specifically addressed the relationship between ESAs and macrocytosis.

While several studies have suggested causes, no studies have examined for clinical associations with macrocytosis in dialysis patients. Furthermore, an association between red cell size and mortality has not been identified in previous study.

In our hemodialysis population, we have observed that many patients have an unexplained macrocytosis. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence and distribution of macrocytosis, to identify its clinical associations and to determine if macrocytosis is associated with mortality in stable, chronic hemodialysis patients.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112yP5vv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Screening

As outlined above, patients with IBD have a high risk of anemia, and if present, anemia is a main factor contributing to morbidity. It is therefore important that every patient with IBD is screened for anemia. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) recommend a laboratory screening using complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) for every patient with IBD in their 2015 guidelines. Screenings should be repeated every 6–12 months for patients in remission or with mild disease and at least every 3 months for patients with active disease in the outpatient setting. Vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be tested at least once a year if a patient has risk factors (e.g. extensive small bowel disease or resection, ileoanal pouch) or if macrocytosis is present. Figure 1 in section 'Summary' visualizes the recommended screening algorithm.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^1171wSFX]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus Statements: Diagnosis

All patients with anemia should be evaluated for the cause of anemia — wherever possible, early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful.
It is important to identify iron deficiency, including in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease).
Patients with IDA should be evaluated for the cause of the iron deficiency, whereas patients with anemia and normal iron studies should be evaluated for coexisting causes of anemia (ie, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, and nutrition deficiency).
Evaluation for iron deficiency should include iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin); if available, reticulocyte Hb content and/or serum hepcidin should be considered in inflammatory states.
The most important criteria for defining absolute iron deficiency were ferritin < 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT < 20%; ferritin < 100 ng/mL may define iron deficiency in inflammatory states. If available, either a reticulocyte Hb < 29 pg or a serum hepcidin level < 20 µg/L also suggest the presence of iron deficiency in inflammatory states.

Supporting Evidence: Diagnosis

In a study of 3342 patients undergoing major elective surgery, the overall prevalence of anemia was 36%. Of the patients with anemia, 62% had absolute iron deficiency and another 5% had low iron stores. Therefore, all patients with anemia should be screened for iron deficiency. In some circumstances (eg, planned surgery associated with large blood loss), it may also be appropriate to evaluate nonanemic surgical patients for iron deficiency. Patients with anemia who are not iron deficient should be evaluated for other causes of anemia (eg, renal disease, primary hematologic disease, nutritional deficiencies). Determination of whether anemia is microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (in patients with reticulocyte production index < 2) may help identify likely causes. Wherever possible, evaluations should be performed early enough preoperatively to enable sufficient time for treatment to be successful. In patients undergoing urgent/emergency procedures, blood samples for evaluation and classification of anemia should be drawn preoperatively, with the aim of testing promptly (preoperatively if possible).

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia [^117GJGKa]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) occurs in 2–5% of adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world and is a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss from colonic cancer or gastric cancer, and malabsorption in coeliac disease are the most important causes that need to be sought. DEFINING IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: The lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test should be used to define anaemia (B). Any level of anaemia should be investigated in the presence of iron deficiency (B). The lower the haemoglobin the more likely there is to be serious underlying pathology and the more urgent is the need for investigation (B). Red cell indices provide a sensitive indication of iron deficiency in the absence of chronic disease or haemoglobinopathy (A). Haemoglobin electrophoresis is recommended when microcytosis and hypochromia are present in patients of appropriate ethnic background to prevent unnecessary GI investigation (C). Serum ferritin is the most powerful test for iron deficiency (A).

Investigations

Upper and lower GI investigations should be considered in all postmenopausal female and all male patients where IDA has been confirmed unless there is a history of significant overt non-GI blood loss (A). All patients should be screened for coeliac disease (B). If oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) is performed as the initial GI investigation, only the presence of advanced gastric cancer or coeliac disease should deter lower GI investigation (B). In patients aged > 50 or with marked anaemia or a significant family history of colorectal carcinoma, lower GI investigation should still be considered even if coeliac disease is found (B). Colonoscopy has advantages over CT colography for investigation of the lower GI tract in IDA, but either is acceptable (B). Either is preferable to barium enema, which is useful if they are not available. Further direct visualisation of the small bowel is not necessary unless there are symptoms suggestive of small bowel disease, or if the haemoglobin cannot be restored or maintained with iron therapy (B). In patients with recurrent IDA and normal OGD and colonoscopy results, Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated if present. (C). Faecal occult blood testing is of no benefit in the investigation of IDA (B). All premenopausal women with IDA should be screened for coeliac disease, but other upper and lower GI investigation should be reserved for those aged 50 years or older, those with symptoms suggesting gastrointestinal disease, and those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (B). Upper and lower GI investigation of IDA in post-gastrectomy patients is recommended in those over 50 years of age (B). In patients with iron deficiency without anaemia, endoscopic investigation rarely detects malignancy. Such investigation should be considered in patients aged > 50 after discussing the risk and potential benefit with them (C). Only postmenopausal women and men aged > 50 years should have GI investigation of iron deficiency without anaemia (C). Rectal examination is seldom contributory, and, in the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding and tenesmus, may be postponed until colonoscopy. Urine testing for blood is important in the examination of patients with IDA (B).

Management

All patients should have iron supplementation both to correct anaemia and replenish body stores (B). Parenteral iron can be used when oral preparations are not tolerated (C). Blood transfusions should be reserved for patients with or at risk of cardiovascular instability due to the degree of their anaemia (C).

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with IBD, evaluation, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116sTZky]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

When evaluating for the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient's microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost 4 years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than an iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

Learning points

Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation.
Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin.
Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology.
Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

Discussion

In general, microcytosis results from conditions that lead to a disruption of alpha or beta-globin-chain production. Most commonly, microcytosis is the result of decreased iron availability or an underlying inherited haemoglobinopathy such as thalassemia. The Mentzer index is one way of quickly discerning between thalassemia and iron-deficiency, with an MCV/RBC ratio < 13 suggesting thalassemia. In our patient, the value of 11.7 in conjunction with his iron studies was consistent with thalassemia.

Decreased iron availability may be due to an absolute lack of iron stores (ie, iron deficiency), or to a functional lack of available iron. A functional iron deficiency can manifest in the setting of a chronic inflammatory state where serum hepcidin levels are elevated or in the setting of sideroblastic anaemia. In this case, the patient's other comorbidities may have precipitated some chronic inflammation, though his erythrocyte sedimentation rate of only 13 mm/hour argues against an overwhelming inflammatory state.

The exact mechanism by which red blood cells become microcytic is not well documented. The predominant theory is that red blood cells stop dividing once they reach a certain concentration of intracellular haemoglobin. As the production of haemoglobin slows down, more divisions occur before this concentration is reached, resulting in smaller cells. For this reason, microcytosis serves as a loose indicator of decreased haemoglobin synthesis, and macrocytosis an indicator of decreased DNA production.

Diagnosing the aforementioned conditions is fairly standard, with evaluation of the peripheral blood smear, a complete CBC, reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate stores, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A bone marrow biopsy is required for identification of ringed sideroblasts in clinching the diagnosis of a sideroblastic anaemia. The haemoglobin electrophoresis is useful in cases of beta-thalassemia and certain cases of alpha-thalassemia (where 3 or 4 copies of the alpha-globin gene are defective resulting in the production of HbH). Alpha-globin and/or beta-globin gene sequencing can also be undertaken, though this is most often done as part of family planning when both parents are suspected of being carriers of a silent mutation.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Macrocytic anemia in lesch-nyhan disease and its variants [^1155XUzo]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lesch-Nyhan disease is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by overproduction of uric acid and neurobehavioral abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to describe macrocytic erythrocytes as another common aspect of the phenotype.

Methods

The results of 257 complete blood counts from 65 patients over a 23-year period were collected from 2 reference centers where many patients are seen regularly.

Results

Macrocytic erythrocytes occurred in 81–92% of subjects with Lesch-Nyhan disease or its neurological variants. After excluding cases with iron deficiency because it might pseudonormalize erythrocyte volumes, macrocytosis occurred in 97% of subjects. Macrocytic erythrocytes were sometimes accompanied by mild anemia, and rarely by severe anemia.

Conclusion

These results establish macrocytic erythrocytes as a very common aspect of the clinical phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan disease and its neurological variants. Macrocytosis is so characteristic that its absence should prompt suspicion of a secondary process, such as iron deficiency. Because macrocytosis is uncommon in unaffected children, it can also be used as a clue for early diagnosis in children with neurodevelopmental delay. Better recognition of this characteristic feature of the disorder will also help to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing and unnecessary attempts to treat it with folate or B12 supplements.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^117Legtq]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^115mu9nU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^1126FS2E]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ring sideroblasts were not identified in PIII‐A, who had bone marrow studies at 18 years old, though it may have been too early; in contrast, RS have been noted in older patients with ALAS2 ‐CDA and more significant iron overload. Genetic causes for macrocytic anemia caused by CDA or inherited BMFS are less common than acquired nutritional deficiencies or those secondary to medications. Moreover, acquired MDS with clonal hematopoiesis is more likely in middle‐age or older adults like P‐II and P‐I, who would have been in risk of misdiagnosis with MDS with or without ringed sideroblasts if they had been evaluated before P‐IIIA. Iron overload is a common comorbidity in macrocytic anemias with stress and especially ineffective, erythropoiesis such as CDAs and MDS, even without concurrent transfusions, since increased erythroferrone suppresses hepcidin. Therefore, ferritin, TIBC, transferrin, and iron saturation monitoring are necessary, preferably with further evaluation of tissue iron with appropriate imaging (MRI T2✱), if ferritin is persistently > 400 ng/mL, in order to proceed to appropriate treatment.

After nutritional deficiencies and HHAs with reticulocytosis have been ruled out in macrocytic anemias, it is reasonable to proceed to bone marrow studies, since BMFS may underlie macrocytosis. Yet even marrow studies may not be adequate, either because CDA‐associated dyserythropoiesis may be subtle or because it may be falsely interpreted as acquired MDS.

Evaluation of related anemia — Major morbidities of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include symptomatic anemia and associated fatigue; the health care provider must also identify and treat any coexisting causes of anemia, and standard assessments should be performed to look for gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolysis, renal disease, and nutritional deficiency. If needed, iron, folate, or vitamin B12 studies should be obtained and the cause of depletion corrected, if possible, after which further consideration for treating MDS-related anemia should be undertaken. Anemia related to MDS commonly presents as a hypoproductive macrocytic anemia, often associated with suboptimal elevation of sEPO levels, and bone marrow aspiration with iron stain, biopsy, and cytogenetics should be used to determine WHO subtype, iron status, and the level of RS.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^1159a5aK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Association of liver cirrhosis severity with anemia: does it matter? [^1114iuj8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and is seen in 75% of cases. The etiology of anemia in liver disease is diverse and often multifactorial. Common causes include acute and chronic blood loss due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, malnutrition, hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension, and impaired coagulation. Alcohol causes anemia by its direct bone marrow toxicity, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency due to poor oral intake, and intestinal malabsorption. Treatment-related anemia is seen in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving ribavirin and interferon. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia, characterized by pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow, is an entity seen concurrently with or within 6 months of infection with hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and Epstein–Barr virus. Given the diverse and sometimes multifactorial etiology (alcohol and hepatitis B) of cirrhosis, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of anemia in these groups of patients.

The most common type of anemia encountered in liver cirrhosis is normocytic normochromic anemia, attributable to the chronic inflammatory state. Acute and chronic blood loss from varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy and gastric antral vascular ectasia can give rise to iron-deficiency anemia, in which the picture is one of microcytic hypochromic anemia. Another common hematological abnormality seen in liver cirrhosis is macrocytosis. The causes of macrocytosis in liver cirrhosis are also multifactorial. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is also frequently seen in liver cirrhosis, particularly of alcoholic origin, due to malnutrition and intestinal malabsorption. However, liver cirrhosis is characteristically associated with round macrocytes, whereas B12 and folate deficiency show oval macrocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear (PBS), along with megaloblastic erythropoiesis on bone marrow examination.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1138Uw7L]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 3

This is a case of multifactorial anemia, which is a common finding in older adults. Iron-restricted erythropoiesis from malabsorption, anemia of CKD, and anemia of chronic inflammation (ACI) from RA and CKD. Patients with multifactorial anemia should be evaluated and managed in a stepwise approach. Our patient presented with macrocytosis, which can occur in the setting of megaloblastic anemia, MDS, hypothyroidism, alcoholism, and reticulocytosis. B12 and folate deficiencies were excluded, her thyroid studies were normal, and her BM biopsy was not consistent with a primary hematologic neoplasm.

The markedly elevated CRP suggests an active inflammatory process, probably primarily from RA and CKD. ACI is a common cause of anemia in older adults. Iron-restricted erythropoiesis constitutes a major component of ACI. Increased hepcidin (a hepatically synthesized acute phase reactant) induces degradation of ferroportin in enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes. The reduction in ferroportin reduces intestinal iron absorption and decreases release of iron from macrophages into circulation, which leads to lower serum iron levels and iron-restricted erythropoiesis, even when the body's iron stores are adequate.

The patient also has concurrent anemia of CKD. There is a decline in hemoglobin as eGFR declines, which is caused by a reduction in endogenous EPO, decreased hematopoietic response to EPO because of uremic toxins, and absolute and functional iron defiicicency. Severe EPO deficiency occurs when eGFR is < 30 mL/min per 1.73m 2.

In older adults with inflammation and CKD, ferritin levels indicating iron-restricted anemia can be variable; ferritin < 100 μg/dL if not 200 μg/dL may be amenable to IV iron.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^116WBw1N]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

Results

Patient characteristics

Among the 181 patients enrolled 168 were males and 13 were females. The mean age was 49.7 years. Alcohol was the most common etiology (166 patients), followed by cryptogenic (12 patients), Budd–Chiari syndrome (2 patients) and hepatitis B (1 patient).

Distribution of anemia types

The mean Hb levels in males and females were 10.51 g/dL and 10.48 g/dL, respectively. Macrocytosis (MCV > 98 fL) was seen in 58 (32%) patients. On anemia typing, a total of 93 (51.4%) patients had normocytic normochromic anemia, 56 (30.9%) had macrocytic anemia, 29 (16.0%) had microcytic anemia and 3 (1.7%) had dimorphic anemia (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographic profile

Of the patients who had microcytic anemia on PBS, only 1 had iron-deficiency anemia (serum ferritin < 16 µg/L in males and < 10 µg/L in females). Of the patients who had macrocytic anemia on PBS, 29 had low serum B12 levels (< 220 ng/mL).

Macrocytosis and MELD score

Of the 58 patients with macrocytosis, 45 (77.6%) had a MELD score of > 12, whereas only 13 (22.4%) had a MELD score of < 12. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^112onirs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that hemoglobin and MCV are insensitive predictors of iron deficiency in the first trimester and throughout pregnancy. Based on the testing characteristics observed in our cohort, if we screen for first-trimester iron deficiency using microcytosis or anemia, 59 of 100 patients with iron deficiency will go undetected. This screening failure becomes even more concerning as pregnancy progresses and iron deficiency becomes more prevalent.

Given the retrospective study design, iron deficiency could be accurately determined only for the patients with ferritin results in our health care system, meaning that the true prevalence across our population might be obscured by selection bias. However, because sensitivity is an intrinsic test characteristic unaffected by prevalence, our primary hypothesis that hemoglobin and MCV are poor screening tools to detect iron deficiency in pregnancy should remain relatively unaffected by this selection bias.

The 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' practice guidance document for anemia in pregnancy recommends a first-trimester screening CBC but does not recommend evaluating iron status (ferritin) directly in the absence of anemia or microcytosis. However, our study demonstrates that hemoglobin (anemia) and MCV (microcytosis) are poor predictors of iron deficiency throughout pregnancy. Therefore, our institution's iron deficiency screening policy for pregnant women now aligns with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommendations.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^112dnZYE]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Given the potential consequences of missed or underevaluated IDA and the complexities of test interpretation, clinicians may benefit from tools within the electronic health record to help improve diagnosis and reduce medical errors. For example, instead of displaying individual laboratory values in isolation, a computer-assisted diagnostic tool could be developed to display an individualized interpretation of the most likely cause of anemia in a patient. This would allow for more precise interpretation of laboratory studies for individuals, such as interpreting iron studies for a patient with inflammation. In addition, automated "trigger tools", or detection algorithms for abnormal laboratory patterns, may help identify cases of new-onset anemia that had been potentially missed by busy clinicians. After abnormalities are identified by these tools, a common set of clinical actions could be presented (eg, for ordering endoscopic testing) to help facilitate obtainment of appropriate tests and minimize additional tasks for clinicians. Reducing unnecessary CBC ordering through education or displaying cost of the laboratory testing alone is unlikely to be sufficient, but a multilevel intervention incorporating education, price information, feedback, and financial incentives has demonstrated success in an inpatient setting.

Limitations

This study has limitations. Respondents may have answered questions based on what they believed was the correct evidence-based practice rather than what was reflective of their actual clinical practice, potentially introducing response bias. Other limitations include the possibility that participants in the ACP Insiders Panel were more engaged with the organization and thus more aware of current evidence-based practices. Both of these biases would suggest that the knowledge gaps identified in our study are underestimates of those seen in actual practice. The results may not apply to other professionals who provide primary care, such as family medicine physicians or advanced practice physicians. A potential for nonresponse bias exists, and those who did not respond may have been less knowledgeable about the topic or may have differed in other ways related to the outcomes of interest. However, we attempted to mitigate this bias through systematic efforts to increase responses. In addition, we analyzed available demographic data for respondents and nonrespondents and found no significant differences in age, geographic location, or career stage; however, respondents were more likely to be White and male than were nonrespondents. Survey methods may not be as well suited for the study of actual practice behaviors as other methods. However, our survey allowed us to indirectly assess physician knowledge and behavior with uniform, ideal clinical scenarios, which is not possible when secondary data are used.

### Iron refractory iron deficiency anemia: a heterogeneous disease that is not always iron refractory [^112D4cHW]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Taken together, in the present study we further substantiate previous observations that (i) mono‐allelic TMPRSS6 defect may result in a clinical phenotype of IRIDA that is generally milder than in patients with a bi‐allelic TMPRSS6 defect, (ii) IRIDA is a defect of cellular iron release as shown by ferrokinetic studies, (iii) despite the acronym IRIDA, some patients benefit from treatment with oral iron, (iv) IRIDA due to (a) TMPRSS6 defect(s) is a phenotypically and genotypically heterogeneous disease.

Our novel observations include: (i) identification of nine not previously described TMPRSS6 defects, (ii) the presence of country/region specific TMPRSS6 defects, (iii) a relatively high number of patients (all females) were only mono‐allelically affected, and (iv) in the absence of inflammation, a low TSAT/hepcidin ratio was associated with TMPRSS6 defects and an IRIDA phenotype, even after iron supplementation has been given. Implications of our findings for clinical management of IRIDA patients may comprise: (i) the TSAT/hepcidin ratio may prove to be a suitable parameter to detect IRIDA patients among patients presenting with unexplained microcytic anemia with a low TSAT and (ii) oral iron with vitamin C treatments should be (re)considered prior to starting iv iron.

In time, suppression of the hepcidin pathway may become an alternative therapeutic approach, especially for severely affected patients to prevent iron overload, but to date safety and benefits remain unknown, especially for pediatric patients. Further studies are required to (i) assess the value of the TSAT/hepcidin ratio in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia, (ii) elucidate the contribution of other (epi)genetic and environmental factors in the pathophysiology and clinical penetrance of TMPRSS6 defects, and to (iii) determine the optimal treatment regimen. However, in order to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary invasive diagnostic work up, the first challenge for the clinician remains the recognition of the disorder and differentiation from other common causes of microcytic anemia.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90·4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

A 16‐year‐old female (P‐IIIA) with a past medical history of asthma presented to the hematology clinic with mild macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL, red blood cells [RBC] 3.19 × 10 6 /μL, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 103 femtoliters [fL], and red cell distribution width [RDW] of 12.9%). Platelet and white blood cell counts were normal. Two complete blood counts (CBC) tested within the previous 3 years on two occasions, once for a syncopal episode and the other for abdominal pain, had demonstrated similar findings. She was referred to hematology after her macrocytic anemia was noted during an attempted blood donation. At the hematology clinic, along with the CBC results noted above, she was found to have a negative direct antiglobulin test, a mildly elevated ferritin (158 ng/mL), with normal renal function, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC, 322 μg/dL), and iron saturation (30%). She reported mild occasional fatigue and intermittent thoracic back pain but was otherwise asymptomatic. She denied bleeding symptoms. Her examination was unremarkable, and she did not have evidence of splenomegaly. At the time of evaluation, she had transitioned to a pescatarian diet for 7 months, eating also vegetables and dairy. Her grandmother (P‐I), mother (P‐II), and younger sister (P‐IIIB) were also noted to have mild macrocytic anemia, while P‐II had also been found to have elevated ferritin of unclear etiology (reaching 646 ng/mL, but improved after phlebotomy every 6 weeks for a year).

In patients with ferritin levels available, hemoglobin and MCV each had a sensitivity for first-trimester iron deficiency of 30% (95% CI, 20–41%) and negative likelihood ratios of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.77–1.05) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73–0.99) respectively; throughout pregnancy the sensitivity of hemoglobin and MCV was 46% (95% CI, 43–50%) and 11% (95% CI, 9–13%), respectively, with respective negative likelihood ratios of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78–0.91) and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.99–1.06) (Appendix 4, available online at).

Preoperative management — risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

### Prevalence of iron deficiency in children with down syndrome [^116XJGiT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in a sample of children with Down syndrome (DS) and to evaluate the effect of macrocytosis on the diagnosis of ID/IDA in these children.

Study Design

Children with DS ≥ 12 months of age who were followed at the Duke University Medical Center Comprehensive DS Clinic from December 2004 to March 2007 were screened for ID/IDA with a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, iron panel, and erythrocytic protoporphyrins.

Results

A total of 114 children were enrolled, with a median age of 4.7 years. ID was identified in 12 subjects (10%), and IDA was identified in 3 subjects (3%). ID/IDA would not have been accurately diagnosed in 13 of 15 subjects (86%) if red blood cell (RBC) indices alone had been used for screening. Abnormal RBC indices with low transferrin saturation were 100% sensitive for ID/ IDA screening.

Conclusions

Prevalence of ID/IDA in children with DS was comparable with that in the general pediatric population. Macrocytosis had implications for screening of ID/IDA with only RBC indices. We suggest ID/IDA screening in DS children be done with a laboratory panel at least including complete blood count, reticulocyte count, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease-a practical approach [^114JCsrn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostic work-up of iron deficiency in IBD

Anemia is defined by the WHO as a decline in blood hemoglobin to a concentration of < 12 g/dL (120 g/L) in women and < 13 g/dL (130 g/L) in men, parameters which are equally applicable to patients with IBD. When anemia is assessed on the basis of hemoglobin levels, the influence of a range of other factors must, however, be taken into account: pregnancy, altitude, cigarette smoking, and possibly ethnicity. The WHO has therefore additionally issued respective international minimum levels for hemoglobin and hematocrit (Table 2).

Table 2
Minimum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels used to define anemia in people living at sea level

The standard parameters of iron deficiency, low MCV and low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) are generally reliable. However, iron deficiency as the cause of anemia cannot be ruled out on the grounds of a normal MCV, since up to 40% of "pure" IDA cases are normocytic (e.g. in IBD patients treated with azathioprine or 6-MP). Conversely, low MCV does not necessarily indicate ID, as the presence of ACD can cause it to be normal or low. A substantially more accurate IDA diagnosis can be attained by the additional determination of iron metabolism parameters. In principle, all components of the body's iron metabolism can be conveniently monitored using routine laboratory methods:

Iron stores: serum ferritin
Iron transport: transferrin saturation
Iron utilization: erythropoiesis: i.e. proportion of hypochromic erythrocytes or reticulocytes

Serum iron concentrations are governed by a circadian rhythm and can be low even in cases of anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Its role in the work-up of iron deficiency therefore, obsolete.

Methods

Patients and relatives

We included 21 IRIDA patients and their relatives. All IRIDA patients were inhabitants of the Netherlands and consecutively diagnosed between 2010 and 2015.

IRIDA probands were defined as patients with both an "IRIDA phenotype" (detected after clinical presentation, microcytic anemia, TSAT < 10%, in the absence of inflammation, Hb and MCV not or partially responsive to oral iron) and an "IRIDA genotype" (a mono‐ or bi‐allelic TMPRSS6 variant that — probably, possibly — affects function, called "defect" hereafter). Iron deficiency anemia in these patients could not be explained (exclusively) by increased physiological needs (growth, menstrual blood loss in premenopausal women), by gastrointestinal disease like Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease of atrophic gastritis 18 or by gynecological problems. Responsiveness to oral iron treatment was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) increment of 2 g/dL after 3 weeks of oral iron supplementation 19. A positive family history for unexplained iron deficiency anemia and anemia presenting in childhood were considered as suspect for IRIDA.

Who to investigate

The investigation of IDA potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases — and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do on occasion develop cancer in the GI tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women — particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables — specifically age, sex, MCV and Hb concentration. The IDIOM Apphas been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process with the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

### Microcytosis and possible early iron deficiency in paediatric inpatients: a retrospective audit [^115jYrek]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Microcytosis was not an uncommon finding amongst the paediatric inpatients who had blood tests performed; overall, 61 out of 701 inpatients (8.7%) that had FBCs performed across both audit periods had microcytosis. 30 of these patients (49%) had MCV values that were 2 fL or more below the age-adjusted lower MCV limit. The proportion of patients identified as having microcytosis that was 'explicable' remained consistent across both audits at around 15%. Since these patients' results could be clearly explained, they would not require any additional follow-up or treatment, other than that already arranged for their known illnesses.

The remaining 85% in each audit had microcytosis that was either 'potentially explicable' or 'explanation unknown'. Both groups of patients might have had iron deficiency (particularly in the 'explanation unknown' group), but diagnosis would require further dietary history from the parents and blood tests from the patients once well in order to confirm or rule out this possibility. Further testing might also reveal other disorders associated with microcytosis, such as thalassaemia. However, this must be balanced against having to do a large number of potentially unnecessary and unpleasant blood tests in order to detect the relatively small proportion of children that have true iron deficiency.

The elderly

28. Iron deficiency is common in the elderly, and is often multifactorial in aetiology (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

29. We recommend that the risks and benefits of invasive endoscopic and alternative investigation(s) are carefully considered in those with major comorbidities and/or limited performance status (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia is common in older people, affecting more than 20% of those over the age of 85 years, and more than 50% of residential/nursing home residents. The aetiologies responsible for anaemia in this age group are complex, and often multiple. Iron deficiency is however a contributory factor in about half of cases, sometimes associated with deficiencies of vitamin B12 and/or folate. Anaemia in older patients has been shown to contribute to worsening of physical performance, cognitive function and frailty.

Iron deficiency in the elderly has many potential contributory causes including poor diet, reduced iron absorption, occult blood loss, medication (eg, aspirin) and chronic disease (eg, CKD, CHF). Blood loss from mucosal lesions may be compounded by concurrent antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy. Older patients are more likely than younger ones to have more than one contributing cause. The diagnosis can be confirmed by measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation, though the former may be difficult to interpret in the presence of coexisting inflammatory conditions.

Evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract should be considered if IDA has been confirmed, though CT colonography may be a more attractive alternative to colonoscopy for some older individuals. The prevalence of malignancy and of dual unrelated pathology in this age group strengthens the case for imaging both the upper and lower GI tract. However, the potential risks and benefits of invasive investigation should be carefully weighed up in older adults, particularly those who are frail, have significant comorbidities or reduced life expectancy. Furthermore, these considerations should be discussed with each patient and his/her family, taking their views into account.

As in other age groups, the cause of IDA cannot always be established despite thorough investigation. Oral iron administration remains the standard first-line treatment in most patients, but parenteral iron is a convenient and relatively safe alternative if oral iron is not tolerated.

### Microcytosis and possible early iron deficiency in paediatric inpatients: a retrospective audit [^1156bFEQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The use of the MCV as a tool for guiding selection of inpatients for further investigation of possible iron deficiency has been questioned, mainly due to its moderately poor sensitivity in detecting iron deficiency despite its apparent high specificity. These studies however were done in a non-paediatric population, and used a cut-off point of 80 fL which may not be applicable to other population groups. One study that was performed on an outpatient population of children aged between one and six years did show much higher sensitivity and specificity values (both close to 100%) for a MCV cut-off value of 75 fL when used for detecting iron-deficiency anaemia, as opposed to iron deficiency without anaemia. One suggested reasoning for this phenomenon is that very early iron deficiency develops prior to any reduction in MCV or Hb. Occasionally, pre-analytical factors can affect the accuracy of the MCV reading by the automated red cell counter; these include auto-reactive red blood cell antibodies leading to red blood cell agglutination, and osmotic effects on red blood cells in the presence of extreme hyperglycaemia.

We were interested to see whether our department was adequately detecting and following up paediatric inpatients that might have iron deficiency, given the important consequences of this condition if allowed to progress to frank iron-deficiency anaemia. The department receives about 3500 inpatient admissions per year from a mixed urban and rural setting in Eastern England. Given that a substantial proportion of these patients will have blood tests, we decided to use the MCV as an indicator of whether a patient might have iron deficiency. The MCV was chosen since other tests commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency are not routinely performed in the inpatient setting at our hospital, whereas nearly every inpatient who has blood taken will have a full blood count performed and will have a MCV readily available. Further tests (including RDW, blood films, serum ferritin levels etc) might then be added to existing blood samples or performed following recovery to further characterise whether an iron-deficient state or alternative explanation for the microcytosis is present.

### What do we know about micronutrients in critically ill patients? A narrative review [^115fUwBF]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Plasma concentrations in critically ill patients

Critical illness alters iron metabolism, and its specific requirements during ICU stay are not well defined.

Ferroptosis

Acute disease can disrupt the redox systems, causing intracellular iron overload and lipid peroxide accumulation in ferroptosis, an iron‐dependent, nonapoptotic cell death. Ferroptosis has been linked to sepsis, viral infections, and ALI, and may contribute to multiorgan dysfunction in practically every ICU patient.

Anemia

Anemia may affect up to 90% of ICU patients, requiring blood transfusion in 15%–35%. The two leading causes of iron‐related anemia are
Iron deficiency anemia: absolute iron deficiency owing to poor intake/adsorption or increased loss owing to phlebotomiesand hemorrhages, affecting 20%–40% of ICU patients.
Anemia of inflammation: Inflammation causes iron storage in the macrophages to reduce redox stress and hide iron from infectious pathogens, leading to iron‐deficient erythropoiesis independently from erythropoietin levels.

The most used biomarkers to determine iron status are iron plasma levels, ferritin, and transferrin, which enable the calculation of transferrin saturation. These are highly affected by inflammation and poorly differentiate between anemia because of inflammation or iron deficiency in acute phases of disease. The newer biomarkers hepcidin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) are expensive but increasingly available; they are less affected by inflammation, making these biomarkers promising in critically ill patients. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed by microcytic hypochromic anemia, increased sTfR, and reduced ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation is diagnosed by normocytic normochromic anemia, normal sTfR, and increased ferritin and hepcidin levels. Anemia of inflammation in patients with non–iron deficiency anemia develops within 8 days of ICU admission.

Low plasma iron levels and iron deficiency are associated with worsening of chronic cardiac dysfunction. Decreased hepcidin levels are associated with ICU mortality. At ICU discharge, hemoglobin (Hb) < 100 g/L affects up to 53.3% of patients and persists in 46% at hospital discharge and up to 12 months later. Post‐ICU anemia correlates with increased ICU readmission rates, prolonged hospital length of stay, increased mortality, and lower quality of life,(see Table S20).

### Marked reactive thrombocytosis in a female with iron deficiency anaemia [^115HbiS5]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This case report presents the clinical evaluation and management of a female patient from a rural background who presented with leg pain, headache, weakness and irritability. Initial investigations revealed iron deficiency anaemia accompanied by a significantly elevated platelet count, prompting suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder. However, subsequent genetic testing ruled out these mutations, suggesting a reactive response to iron deficiency anaemia rather than an independent neoplastic process. Treatment was focused on addressing the underlying iron deficiency anaemia, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's blood profile and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up assessments demonstrated a complete normalisation of the blood profile and platelet counts, further supporting the efficacy of the treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive thrombocytosis in the context of iron deficiency anaemia and emphasises the favourable response achieved through appropriate management strategies.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^117Uffh4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies assessed the efficiency of Ret-He in diagnosing ID. The suggested cutoff values for Ret-He range from 25.7 pg with an AUC of 0.931 (71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity), 28.5 pg with an AUC of 0.902 (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity), 32.4 pg with an AUC of 0.753 (72.5% sensitivity and 70% specificity), to 35.5 pg with an AUC of 0.881 (100% sensitivity and 55.6% specificity). This variability is likely due to the use of different ferritin thresholds to diagnose ID. A higher ferritin cutoff might lead to capturing more mild cases of ID, which can cause the Ret-He cutoff to shift to maintain a balance between correctly identifying iron deficiency (sensitivity) and avoiding false positives (specificity).

Three hundred seventy patients had anemia but no ID according to the definition we used in this study. Of these, 131 patients had Ret-He levels below 33.5 pg. The combination of low transferrin saturation, high ferritin, normal transferrin receptor levels, and elevated CRP in these patients suggests anemia of chronic disease rather than classic IDA. Anemia of chronic disease is common in conditions characterized by chronic inflammation, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or malignancies, where iron metabolism is disrupted due to the inflammatory response. In these cases, iron becomes sequestered in storage sites, leading to reduced availability for red blood cell production, despite overall iron stores being sufficient or even elevated. The normal MCV and MCH further support the diagnosis of anemia of chronic disease. Additionally, there may be some degree of functional ID, where iron is present but not readily available for use by the bone marrow. This may explain the low Ret-He and transferrin saturation, despite adequate or elevated ferritin levels.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children… [^112k4h31]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Microcytic Anemia DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The U. S. prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children one to five years of age is estimated to be 1% to 2%. 10 A child with microcytic anemia and a history of poor dietary iron intake should receive a trial of iron supplementation and dietary counseling. Iron deficiency anemia is likely if the hemoglobin level increases by more than 1. 0 g per dL after one month of presumptive treatment. Although iron deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, some patients may have normocytic red blood cells. 11 Further testing may also be necessary if suspected iron deficiency anemia does not respond to treatment. Ferritin measurement is the most sensitive test for diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. 2, 10 Ferritin is a good reflection of total iron storage and is also the first laboratory index to decline with iron deficiency.

3 It may be less accurate in children with infectious or inflammatory conditions because ferritin is also an acute phase reactant. 3, 34 Infants and children with β-thalassemia trait or β-thalassemia minor may have increased hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F on electrophoresis, with asymptomatic, mild anemia. Those with β-thalassemia intermedia or major usually have moderate to severe anemia complications, including hypersplenism, endocrinopathies, cardiac complications, and hypercoagulopathy due to iron overload from repeated transfusions.
34. Normocytic Anemia Iron deficiency anemia and acute blood loss are the most common causes of normocytic anemia in infants and children. Evaluation of normocytic anemia begins with examination of a peripheral blood smear for hypersegmented neutrophils, which indicate megaloblastic anemia. 5 If megaloblastic anemia is shown, folate and vitamin B 12 measurements are indicated. Low vitamin B 12 levels may be nutrition/absorption related or congenital and have neurologic consequences, ranging from growth retardation to seizure disorders.

### Evaluation of microcytosis… [^1163Uzk6]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 is a suggested algorithm for diagnosing the cause of microcytosis in adults. 1, 2, 5, 17, 18, 20, 21 After confirmation of microcytosis on CBC, physicians should first order a serum ferritin level. 18–20 If the ferritin level is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, identifying the underlying cause of the anemia is the priority. It is critical to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy in men and nonmenstruating women. 5, 9, 21, 22 Gastrointestinal sources of blood loss should also be considered in menstruating women and adolescent girls when the anemia is refractory to iron treatment or when gastrointestinal symptoms are present. 23, 24. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased.

On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely. Specific Causes of Microcytosis IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deficiency anemia occurs when the absorption of iron through dietary intake does not match the needs of the body. The mismatch occurs from inadequate dietary intake or increased needs, which usually cause only mild anemia, or from blood loss or malabsorption, which can lead to more significant anemia. Young children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women have the highest prevalence of the condition. 1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31. ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Anemia of chronic disease can be caused by chronic infections or inflammatory processes.

Increased levels of cytokines cause a decrease in erythropoietin production, a decreased response to erythropoietin, and interference with iron metabolism. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.
