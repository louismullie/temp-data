## Question

What is proper use of Flonase?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the proper use of Flonase (fluticasone propionate nasal spray). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the correct formulation and labeled indications. Then, I should verify age-specific dosing and titration. Next, I will review priming, administration technique, and adherence. After that, I need to check onset, duration, and when to escalate or stop therapy. I will then examine safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. Finally, I should consider special populations and summarize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring points.

> Let me first confirm the product and its intended use, because I need to ensure we are not mixing up the inhaled asthma formulation with the intranasal spray; Flonase refers to fluticasone propionate nasal spray, indicated for allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis in patients aged 4 years and older, and it is not the same as the inhaled fluticasone used for asthma maintenance therapy, which has different dosing and delivery systems [^d22d49d4] [^a0baced6].

> Now, I should verify age-specific dosing, and I need to be precise: for adults and adolescents, the recommended starting dose is 2 sprays per nostril once daily, totaling 200 mcg/day, with the option to reduce to 1 spray per nostril once daily after symptom control; for children aged 4 years and older, the starting dose is 1 spray per nostril once daily, totaling 100 mcg/day, and if control is inadequate, it can be increased to 2 sprays per nostril once daily, but the maximum daily dose should not exceed 200 mcg total, and exceeding this does not improve efficacy, so I should emphasize not to go beyond the labeled maximum [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2].

> Wait, let me verify the priming and administration steps, because technique materially affects delivery and safety: before first use or after a week or more of nonuse, shake gently and prime with 6 sprays into the air away from the face; shake gently before each use; aim away from the nasal septum toward the lateral nasal wall to minimize irritation and epistaxis; and if a dose is missed, do not double up, just resume the next scheduled dose, as doubling increases the risk of local side effects without added benefit [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2] [^1e2cf519].

> I should confirm onset and duration expectations to set realistic goals: onset is variable, often within 3 to 5 hours but sometimes up to 36 hours, and continuous daily use is more effective than intermittent use; if there is no meaningful improvement after about 1 week of consistent use, I should reassess the diagnosis, adherence, or technique before escalating dose, and if control is achieved, consider tapering to the lowest effective dose [^bfed042c] [^8912fee7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping therapy; I need to check the guidance on duration and discontinuation: continue daily use during the allergy season or as long as symptoms persist, and do not stop abruptly if used chronically, instead taper to the lowest effective dose or to as-needed use if clinically appropriate, with close follow-up if symptoms recur [^8912fee7] [^cac13e68].

> Next, I should review safety, contraindications, and key warnings, and I need to ensure I separate local from systemic risks: contraindications include hypersensitivity to any ingredient; common local adverse effects include epistaxis, nasal irritation, and rarely nasal septal perforation with prolonged use; systemic corticosteroid effects are uncommon at recommended intranasal doses but can occur, especially with high-dose or prolonged use, so monitor for rare growth effects in children and be cautious in patients with ocular herpes, untreated infections, or recent nasal trauma; importantly, fluticasone is a CYP3A4 substrate, and coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors like ritonavir can markedly increase systemic exposure and cause adrenal suppression, so avoid such combinations when possible [^ac654baf] [^878212aa] [^222048a5] [^2fdd84ea].

> I will now examine special populations, and I should double-check pregnancy and pediatric considerations: in pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh risks, given animal data and limited human data, and monitor neonates for hypoadrenalism if exposure is significant; in children, routine growth monitoring is prudent with prolonged use, and the product is approved from age 4 years, with the pediatric maximum dose matching the adult maximum at 200 mcg/day; in older adults, no routine dose adjustment is required, but I should remain vigilant for local tolerability and epistaxis, especially with concomitant anticoagulants or antiplatelets [^5aa8d222] [^8912fee7] [^222048a5].

> But wait, what if the patient has chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal polyps; I should confirm whether intranasal steroids are still appropriate: guidelines support topical intranasal corticosteroids, including sprays, rinses, or exhalation delivery systems, for symptom relief in chronic rhinosinusitis with or without polyps, with shared decision-making about delivery method and duration, and sprays offer the advantage of OTC availability and favorable safety at standard doses [^26f7f2b5] [^ea55900e].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each step: confirm the diagnosis and that the nasal spray formulation is appropriate; start adults at 2 sprays per nostril once daily and children 4 years and older at 1 spray per nostril once daily; prime correctly and teach lateral-wall aiming; reassess at 1 week and titrate to 2 sprays per nostril in children if needed, but never exceed 200 mcg/day; once controlled, reduce to the lowest effective dose; continue through the symptomatic period; monitor for epistaxis, septal irritation, and rare systemic effects; avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; and in pregnancy, individualize risk–benefit with obstetric input [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2] [^2fdd84ea] [^5aa8d222].

---

Flonase (fluticasone propionate nasal spray) is used for **allergic and non-allergic rhinitis** in adults and children aged 4 years and older [^d22d49d4] [^a0baced6]. The **proper dose** is 2 sprays per nostril once daily for adults and adolescents, and 1 spray per nostril once daily for children aged 4–11 years; after control, reduce to the lowest effective dose [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2]. Prime the pump before first use or after ≥ 1 week of nonuse, shake gently, and spray away from the septum toward the outer nasal wall [^8912fee7] [^1e2cf519]. Common side effects include mild epistaxis, nasal irritation, and headache; avoid use if there is a known hypersensitivity to fluticasone or if there are untreated nasal infections [^878212aa] [^ac654baf]. Use cautiously in pregnancy and in patients on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [^5aa8d222] [^2fdd84ea].

---

## Indications

Flonase is indicated for the following conditions:

- **Allergic rhinitis**: Seasonal or perennial, in adults and children aged ≥ 4 years [^d22d49d4] [^a0baced6].
- **Non-allergic rhinitis**: In adults and children aged ≥ 4 years [^d22d49d4] [^a0baced6].

---

## Dosage and administration

Proper dosing and administration are essential for **optimal therapeutic outcomes**:

| **Age group** | **Recommended starting dose** | **Maximum daily dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults and adolescents (≥ 12 years) | 2 sprays per nostril once daily (200 mcg/day) | 2 sprays per nostril once daily (200 mcg/day) |
| Children aged 4–11 years | 1 spray per nostril once daily (100 mcg/day) | 2 sprays per nostril once daily (200 mcg/day) |

---

After achieving symptom control, the dose should be reduced to the **lowest effective dose** (often 1 spray per nostril once daily) [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2].

---

## Administration technique

Correct administration technique is critical for **efficacy and safety**:

- **Prime the pump**: Before first use or after ≥ 1 week of nonuse, shake gently and release 6 sprays into the air away from the face [^8912fee7] [^c28250c2].
- **Positioning**: Gently blow the nose to clear nasal passages. Tilt the head slightly forward and insert the nozzle into the nostril, aiming away from the nasal septum toward the outer nasal wall [^1e2cf519].
- **Spraying**: Close the other nostril, inhale gently, and spray while breathing in slowly. Repeat for the other nostril [^1e2cf519].
- **Avoid**: Do not spray into the eyes or mouth [^8912fee7] [^cac13e68].

---

## Onset of action and duration of therapy

Flonase typically begins to relieve symptoms within **12–24 hours**, with full benefit after several days of regular use. Continuous daily use is recommended during the allergy season or as long as symptoms persist. Therapy may be continued for several weeks to months, depending on symptom severity and response [^bfed042c] [^8912fee7].

---

## Side effects and precautions

Common side effects include:

- **Mild epistaxis (nosebleeds)**
- **Nasal irritation or dryness**
- **Headache**
- **Sneezing**
- **Unpleasant taste or smell**

Rare but serious side effects include **nasal septal perforation**, **glaucoma**, **cataracts**, and **adrenal suppression** with prolonged high-dose use [^878212aa] [^7071a121].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **hypersensitivity to fluticasone propionate** or any formulation component [^ac654baf]. Use with caution in patients with **untreated nasal infections**, **recent nasal surgery**, or **trauma**. In pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh potential risks; animal studies show fetal harm, but human data are limited [^5aa8d222].

---

## Drug interactions

Fluticasone propionate is metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, **strong CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole) can increase systemic exposure and risk of adrenal suppression. Caution is advised when coadministered with these agents [^2fdd84ea].

---

## Special populations

- **Pediatric patients**: Growth velocity may be reduced with prolonged use; monitor growth regularly [^222048a5].
- **Elderly patients**: No specific dose adjustment is required, but monitor for systemic corticosteroid effects with prolonged use.
- **Pregnant and lactating women**: Use only if clearly needed, weighing potential risks and benefits [^5aa8d222].

---

## Patient counseling points

Patients should be counseled on the following:

- **Regular use**: Use daily for best results, even if symptoms improve [^8912fee7] [^cac13e68].
- **Proper technique**: Follow priming and administration instructions carefully [^8912fee7] [^1e2cf519].
- **Side effects**: Report persistent nosebleeds, vision changes, or signs of infection [^878212aa].
- **Duration**: Continue therapy through the allergy season or as long as symptoms persist [^8912fee7].

---

Flonase is a **safe and effective** intranasal corticosteroid for allergic and non-allergic rhinitis when used correctly. Proper dosing, administration technique, and patient counseling are essential for optimal outcomes and minimal side effects.

### A randomized comparison of the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of fluticasone propionate delivered via xhance exhalation delivery system versus flonase nasal spray and flovent HFA inhalational aerosol [^ff54521a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The exhalation delivery system with fluticasone propionate (Xhance®) has been shown to deliver drug substantially more broadly in the nasal cavity (particularly into superior/posterior regions), with less off-target loss of drug to drip-out and swallowing, than conventional nasal sprays. This open-label study evaluated the systemic bioavailability of Xhance® by comparing the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of a single dose of fluticasone from 3 products administering the drug using 3 different devices: Xhance®, Flonase® (fluticasone propionate inhalational nasal spray), and Flovent® HFA (fluticasone propionate inhalational aerosol).

Methods

This open-label study was conducted in 2 parts. Study part 1 compared systemic exposure with a single dose of Xhance® 186 or 372 μg versus Flonase® 400 μg (3-way, 3-treatment, 3-sequence, randomized crossover in healthy subjects; n = 90). A separate study, part 2, under the same umbrella protocol, compared systemic exposure with Xhance® 372 μg versus Flovent® HFA 440 μg (2-way, 2-treatment, 2-sequence, randomized crossover in patients with mild to moderate asthma; n = 30).

Findings

With Xhance® 186 μg, the geometric least squares mean (LSM) C max was higher than with Flonase® 400 μg (16.02 vs 11.66 pg/mL, respectively; geometric mean ratio [GMR], 137.42%) and the geometric LSM AUC 0-∞ values were similar (97.30 vs 99.61 pg · h/mL; GMR, 97.78%). With Xhance® 372 μg, the geometric LSM C max and AUC 0-∞ were higher than with Flonase® 400 μg (C max, 23.50 vs 11.66 pg/mL [GMR, 201.53%]; AUC 0-∞, 146.61 vs 99.61 pg · h/mL [GMR, 147.19%]). In part 2, the geometric LSM C max and AUC 0-∞ values were lower with Xhance® 372 μg than with Flovent® HFA 440 μg (C max, 25.28 vs 40.02 pg/mL [GMR, 63.18%]; AUC 0-∞, 205.78 vs 415.16 pg · h/mL [GMR, 49.57%]).

Implications

Similar intranasal doses of Xhance® (372 μg) and Flonase® (400 μg) are clearly not bioequivalent. Systemic exposure is very low with all products. Systemic exposure is higher with Xhance® than with Flonase® and substantially lower than with Flovent® HFA 440 μg and, based on dose normalization, Flovent® HFA 220 μg. ClincalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02266927.

2.1 Administration Information

FLOVENT HFA should be administered by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, rinse mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.

A valved holding chamber and mask may be used to deliver FLOVENT HFA to young patients.

Priming

Prime FLOVENT HFA before using for the first time by releasing 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by shaking well for 5 seconds and releasing 1 spray into the air away from the face. Avoid spraying in eyes.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older

The recommended starting dosage for patients aged 12 years and older who are not on an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS): 88 mcg (2 inhalations of 44 mcg fluticasone propionate) twice daily by oral inhalation, approximately 12 hours apart.

The maximum recommended dosage for patients aged 12 years and older is 880 mcg twice daily.

Pediatric Patients Aged 4 to 11 Years

The recommended dosage for patients aged 4 to 11 years: 88 mcg (2 inhalations of 44 mcg fluticasone propionate) twice daily by oral inhalation, approximately 12 hours apart.

General Dosing Recommendations

The starting dosage is based on previous asthma therapy and asthma severity, including consideration of patients' current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.

If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist should be used for immediate relief.

Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment.

For other patients, and for patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, higher dosages may provide additional asthma control.

If a dosage regimen fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength with a higher strength, initiating an ICS and long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids, should be considered.

After asthma stability has been achieved, titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.

### The rising cost of rhinologic medications [^fffef6ce]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The high prescription drug cost in the United States may negatively affect patient prognosis and treatment compliance.

Objective

To fill the knowledge gap and inform clinicians regarding rhinology medications price changes by evaluating trends in price changes of highly used nasal sprays and allergy medications.

Methods

The 2014–2020 Medicaid National Average Drug Acquisition Cost database was queried for drug pricing information for the following classes of medications: intranasal corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, antileukotrienes, intranasal antihistamines, and intranasal anticholinergics. Individual medications were identified by Food and Drug Administration-assigned National Drug Codes. Per unit, drug prices were analyzed for average annual prices, average annual percentage price changes, and inflation-adjusted annual and composite percentage price changes.

Results

Beclometasone (Beconase AQ, 56.7%, QNASL, 77.5%), flunisolide (Nasalide, -14.6%), budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua, -1.2%), fluticasone (Flonase, -6.8%, Xhance, 11.7%), mometasone (Nasonex, 38.2%), ciclesonide (Omnaris, 73.8%), combination azelastine and fluticasone (Dymista, 27.3%), loratadine (Claritin, -20.5%), montelukast (Singulair, 14.5%), azelastine (Astepro, 21.9%), olopatadine (Patanase, 27.3%), and ipratropium bromide (Atrovent, 56.6%) had an overall change in inflation-adjusted per unit cost between 2014 and 2020 (% change). Of 14 drugs evaluated, 10 had an increase in inflation-adjusted prices, for an average increase of 42.06% ± 22.27%; 4 of 14 drugs had a decrease in inflation-adjusted prices, for an average decrease of 10.78% ± 7.36%.

Conclusion

The rising cost of highly used medications contributes to increased patient acquisition costs and may pose barriers of drug adherence to particularly vulnerable populations.

### Cost savings analysis for otolaryngologic medications using direct-to-consumer models [^c511974b]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Savings profile for the top 10 otolaryngologic medications meeting inclusion criteria by total 2022 prescription fills.

When sorted by prescriptions accounting for the highest expenditure, the following 8 medications show total potential savings of $48,866,237.58: Fluticasone Propionate — Flonase ($22,450,486.03), Azelastine HCL — Optivar ($11,764,242.03), Azelastine HCL — Astelin ($11,109,460.47), Mometasone Furoate — Nasonex ($1,479,453.81), Dexlansoprazole ($1,171,407.62), Azelastine/Fluticasone ($565,438.43), Omeprazole ($188,128.86), and Levothyroxine Sodium ($137,620.33). The following 2 medications show total potential losses of −$27,076,449.82: Ofloxacin — Floxin (−$21,137,120.77), Amoxicillin/Potassium Clavulanate (−$5,939,329.05) (Table S1).

MCCPDC and coupon models aim to bypass administrative inefficiencies and pharmaceutical middlemen to achieve affordable prices for consumers, warranting specialty‐specific investigations regarding the efficiency of choosing such DTC models. Similar studies have shown annual potential savings of $141.5 million in ophthalmologic drugs, $661.8 million in oncologic drugs, $1.29 billion in urologic drugs, and $8.6 billion on medications across all primary subspecialties.

Our findings suggest that potential savings under MCCPDC, GoodRx, or SingleCare procurement for some otolaryngologic medications may be offset by significant losses for others, underscoring the complexity of transitioning entirely to a direct‐to‐consumer model. As previous studies have discussed, the efficiencies of discount options are heterogeneous, with a lack of universal applicability across all medications. In particular, our results showed that antibiotics generally were less expensive within Medicare Part D rather than DTC platforms. This discrepancy may be influenced by Medicare Part D plans leveraging various factors to receive more discounts for particular medication categories within drug distribution models, such as rebates and volume‐based discounts.

The outlook for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved considerably as a result of conventional therapies including aerosolized agents for airway clearance. These will continue to play a significant role in maintaining well-being and improving survival, even as newer agents emerge that correct the underlying CF defect. In this review, we explore the evidence supporting the use of dornase alfa, hypertonic saline, and mannitol in improving mucus clearance in patients with CF from different age groups with differing disease severity. We also discuss the clinical use of these agents in the context of available international guidelines as well as practical considerations in the clinic, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and shared decision-making. Unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of these agents are highlighted.

### Fluticasone propionate (Flovent) [^222048a5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Controlled clinical trials have shown that ICS may cause a reduction in growth in pediatric patients. In these trials, the mean reduction in growth velocity was approximately 1 cm/year (range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm/year) and appeared to depend upon dose and duration of exposure. This effect was observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for "catch-up" growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The effects on growth velocity of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids for over 1 year, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The growth of children and adolescents receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT HFA, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks associated with alternative therapies. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including FLOVENT HFA, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her symptoms.

Figure 3
Systemic bioavailability of intranasal steroids.

It is vital to explain the safety and correct use of INS to children and their carers. The delay in onset of action should be explained, plus the need for regular treatment, how to administer the spray (figure 4) and linking use to a regular daily activity, such as teeth cleaning. Provision of contact details for advice should also aid concordance, since well-meaning uninformed relatives, friends and even primary care practitioners may state that temporary use is all that is allowed, or may switch the prescription to an older, cheaper, more bioavailable molecule.

Figure 4
(A) shows how to use a nasal spray so as to avoid the septum and spray as much of the lateral wall mucosa as possible, allowing subsequent mucociliary clearance to distribute the liquid all over the mucosa. (B) shows how nasal drops (superior for rhinosinusitis) should be used with the head completely upside down so that drops reach the ostiomeatal complex in the upper nose where sinuses drain and ventilate (adapted from Scadding et al [1] (with permission)).

Nasal biopsies do not show mucosal atrophy after 1 year of regular INS use in adults. INS improve mucociliary clearance, and have shown benefits when used in acute rhinosinusitis, so continuation during viral colds is recommended.

A combined nasal spray containing fluticasone propionate and azelastine, an antihistamine, is under trial for use in children.

Systemic corticosteroid is available as a brief rescue therapy for very severe symptoms, the lowest dose for the shortest time should be accompanied by an INS. Depot corticosteroid injections are not recommended, as risk outweighs benefit.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists have similar effects as oral antihistamines, with minimal additional benefit when the two are used in combination. Use in children with seasonal AR, in preschool children with persistent AR and in children with AR and concomitant asthma, where concerns exist about the use of glucocorticoids, is suggested by ARIA 2010.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Administer Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray by the intranasal route only. Prime Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray before using for the first time or after a period of non-use (1 week or more) by shaking the contents well and releasing 6 sprays into the air away from the face. Shake Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray gently before each use.

Patients should use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray at regular intervals since its effectiveness depends on its regular use. Maximum effect may take several days and individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and different degree of symptom relief.

For intranasal use only. Recommended starting dosages:

Adults: 2 sprays per nostril once daily (200 mcg per day). (2.1)
Adolescents and children aged 4 years and older: 1 spray per nostril once daily (100 mcg per day). (2.2)

2.1 Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults is 2 sprays (50 mcg of fluticasone propionate each) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 200 mcg). The same total daily dose, 1 spray in each nostril administered twice daily (e.g., 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) is also effective. After the first few days, patients may be able to reduce their dose to 1 spray in each nostril once daily for maintenance therapy.

Maximum total daily doses should not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril (total dose, 200 mcg/day). There is no evidence that exceeding the recommended dose is more effective.

2.2 Adolescents and Children (Aged 4 Years and Older)

The recommended starting dosage in adolescents and children, aged 4 years and older is 1 spray in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 100 mcg). Patients not adequately responding to 1 spray in each nostril may use 2 sprays in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 200 mcg). Once adequate control is achieved, the dosage should be decreased to 1 spray in each nostril once daily.

The maximum total daily dosage should not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril (200 mcg/day). There is no evidence that exceeding the recommended dose is more effective.

### IL-11 and IL-17 expression in nasal polyps: relationship to collagen deposition and suppression by intranasal fluticasone propionate [^f681eae2]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Chronic hyperplastic sinusitis (CHS) with nasal polyps (NP) is characterized by extensive mucosal thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, and subepithelial fibrosis. These features are described to be part of remodeling in the lower airways. The cytokines interleukin (IL)-11 and IL-17 are believed to play a role in lower airway remodeling, but there has been very little work so far examining these cytokines and their relationship to fibrosis in CHS/NP. The aims of this study were to examine the deposition of collagens types I, III, and V in CHS/NP, evaluate the relationship of collagen deposition to expression of IL-11 and IL-17, and to examine the effect of treatment with intranasal fluticasone on these features.

Study Design

Sixteen subjects were included in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. NP biopsies were obtained at the baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate (FP, Flonase) or placebo. Normal control middle turbinate biopsies from eight nonallergic subjects without sinusitis were used as a control for cytokine and collagen expression.

Methods

Tissues were assessed for deposition of collagen types I, III, and V using immunocytochemistry. The expression of the cytokines IL-11 and IL-17 was examined by immunostaining or in situ hybridization. The pre- to posttreatment results were analyzed using paired t test, and the magnitude of changes were estimated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test followed by least significance difference post hoc comparisons of means.

Results

Compared with normal control nasal turbinate tissues, collagen types I, III, and V were increased in all NP tissues, with a predominance of types III and V. Collagen deposition was most abundant in the submucosal connective tissue and in the basement membrane zone. FP treatment had no significant effect on deposition of any collagen type. Expression of IL-11 and IL-17 was also greatly increased in NP compared with control nasal turbinate tissues. IL-11 expression was observed in both inflammatory cells and the epithelium, whereas IL-17 expression was primarily associated with inflammatory cells. In the pretreatment NP, a correlation was found between the presence of IL-11 and collagen type I (r = 0.59, P = 0.02) and also between IL-17 and both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes (r = 0.52, P = 0.05; r = 0.60, P = 0.02, respectively). Treatment with FP significantly reduced IL-11 expression in subepithelial inflammatory cells and in the epithelial compartment. In contrast, although IL-17 expression was reduced by FP, this effect did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

NP manifest an increased expression of collagen types III, V, and I and an increase in profibotic cytokines IL-11 and IL-17. A correlation exists between deposition of collagen type I and expression of IL-11, suggesting a possible role for IL-11 in NP remodeling. Collagen deposition was not reversed by FP treatment, whereas IL-11 expression was suppressed. These results are consistent with a partial insensitivity of NP to FP treatment but also suggest that longer-term treatment or perhaps earlier intervention with FP might reduce proinflammatory cytokine signals and ultimately have a beneficial effect in preventing airway remodeling in NP.

No history of trauma was noted, and her pain was localized to the medial and anterior aspects of the knee. On examination, the patient walked with antalgic gait. Localized medial tenderness was elicited. No swelling nor signs of internal derangement were noted. She was able to extend to 0° and flex to 135°. Knee radiographs were negative with maintained joint space and without evidence of fracture or notable osteoarthritis (Figure 1, A). The patient was presumed to have mild degenerative joint disease; therefore, she was prescribed naproxen and was sent to physical therapy for 4 weeks. On the follow-up, the pain did not improve, and she started to complain of similar pain affecting her right knee. MRI of the left knee was done that showed a large area of acute bone marrow edema with abnormal signal intensity in the medial tibial plateau measuring 6.5 × 5.2 cm, suggestive of insufficiency fracture (Figure 2, A and B). The knee was placed in a hinged brace, and the patient started to use a walker for protected weight-bearing. Medial history and medications were reviewed. She had hypothyroidism, hypertension, depression, and allergic rhinitis. Her medication included levothyroxine, escitalopram, hydrochlorothiazide, and intranasal corticosteroids (fluticasone propionate [Flonase] two puffs each nostril twice a day) for several years. She never smoked and often drank 1 to 2 glasses of wine a day.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^bfed042c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intranasal steroids (INS) dosing and expected response — onset, duration, and use pattern: Onset of action starts at time points ranging from 3–5 hours to 36 hours after first dosing, and the continuous use of INS is recommended and more efficacious than intermittent use, although studies of as-needed use of intranasal fluticasone have shown that intermittent use is better than placebo; based on the available data, it is reasonable to assume that efficacy would be reached after 1 week of therapy at the most and, if none is observed, the treatment might be considered ineffective.

### Dornase alfa for cystic fibrosis [^a584a767]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dornase alfa is currently used as a mucolytic to treat pulmonary disease (the major cause of morbidity and mortality) in cystic fibrosis. It reduces mucus viscosity in the lungs, promoting improved clearance of secretions. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To determine whether the use of dornase alfa in cystic fibrosis is associated with improved mortality and morbidity compared to placebo or other medications that improve airway clearance, and to identify any adverse events associated with its use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstracts from conferences. Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Register: 12 October 2020. Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also searched to identify unpublished or ongoing trials. Date of most recent search: 08 February 2021.

Selection Criteria

All randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing dornase alfa to placebo, standard therapy or other medications that improve airway clearance.

Data Collection and Analysis

Authors independently assessed trials against the inclusion criteria; two authors carried out analysis of methodological quality and data extraction. GRADE was used to assess the level of evidence.

Main Results

The searches identified 74 trials, of which 19 (2565 participants) met our inclusion criteria. 15 trials compared dornase alfa to placebo or no dornase alfa (2447 participants); two compared daily dornase to hypertonic saline (32 participants); one compared daily dornase alfa to hypertonic saline and alternate day dornase alfa (48 participants); one compared dornase alfa to mannitol and the combination of both drugs (38 participants). Trial duration varied from six days to three years. Dornase alfa compared to placebo or no treatment Dornase alfa probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1) at one month (four trials, 248 participants), three months (one trial, 320 participants; moderate-quality evidence), six months (one trial, 647 participants; high-quality evidence) and two years (one trial, 410 participants). Limited low-quality evidence showed treatment may make little or no difference in quality of life. Dornase alfa probably reduced the number of pulmonary exacerbations in trials of up to two years (moderate-quality evidence). One trial that examined the cost of care, including the cost of dornase alfa, found that the cost savings from dornase alfa offset 18% to 38% of the medication costs. Dornase alfa: daily versus alternate day One cross-over trial (43 children) found little or no difference between treatment regimens for lung function, quality of life or pulmonary exacerbations (low-quality evidence). Dornase alfa compared to other medications that improve airway clearance Results for these comparisons were mixed. One trial (43 children) showed dornase alfa may lead to a greater improvement in FEV 1 compared to hypertonic saline (low-quality evidence), and one trial (23 participants) reported little or no differences in lung function between dornase alfa and mannitol or dornase alfa and dornase alfa plus mannitol (low-quality evidence). One trial (23 participants) found dornase alfa may improve quality of life compared to dornase alfa plus mannitol (low-quality evidence); other comparisons found little or no difference in this outcome (low-quality evidence). No trials in any comparison reported any difference between groups in the number of pulmonary exacerbations (low-quality evidence). When all comparisons are assessed, dornase alfa did not cause significantly more adverse effects than other treatments, except voice alteration and rash.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence to show that, compared with placebo, therapy with dornase alfa may improve lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in trials lasting from one month to two years. There was a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations in trials of six months or longer, probably due to treatment. Voice alteration and rash appear to be the only adverse events reported with increased frequency in randomised controlled trials. There is not enough evidence to firmly conclude if dornase alfa is superior to other hyperosmolar agents in improving lung function.

Blood samples

Peripheral blood will be being collected as fasting morning samples when possible, especially between ages 8–17 years to enable measurement of sex hormones, insulin and glucose. Approximately 15 mL will be obtained at each annual clinic visit. These samples will be transported to the center's laboratory on the day of collection and at room temperature. At the center-specific laboratories, blood will be processed and aliquots of serum and plasma will be cryopreserved at − 80 °C. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be separated from heparinized blood and cryopreserved in aliquots using pre-chilled alcohol reservoirs. A complete blood count and differential will be performed, and plasma will be analyzed for allergen-specific IgE (Uni-CAP, ThermoFisher). DNA from peripheral blood samples will be stored for studies of epigenetic regulation.

Airway samples

Nasal wash, blow or lavage specimens will be collected using techniques that are tailored to the age of the child. For young children (birth to age 3–4 years), we will collect a nasal wash specimen by instilling 2 mL of buffered saline into the nose using a modified bulb syringe, followed by gentle suctioning is applied to recover the sample. For capable preschool children, we will use a nasal blow technique. The procedure involves wetting the nose with normal saline spray, followed by blowing the nose into a collection tube.

For adults and children over the age of 8 years, a nasal lavage will be performed. Following a nasal blow while in a sitting position, saline is introduced into the one nostril, and nasal lavage fluid is passively recovered from the other nostril. This is repeated on the other side.

For each of these nasal samples, separate aliquots will be prepared for analyses of virology, microbiome, host cell gene expression, proteins and other analytes.

Nasal epithelial cells will be obtained brushing the inferior turbinate of one nasal passage using a nylon flocked swab. The epithelial cells will be a source for mRNA and DNA (epigenetics) isolation.

Treatment of Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia is treated through the ingestion of glucose- or carbohydrate-containing foods. HCPs should counsel individuals with diabetes to treat hypoglycaemia with fast-acting carbohydrates at the hypoglycaemia alert value of ≤ 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l); 15–20 g glucose is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with blood glucose < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l). Even if SMBG shows hypoglycaemia 15 min after the treatment, the same treatment should be repeated. When the blood glucose returns to normal, the individual should consume a meal or snack rich in complex carbohydrates, like cereal, to avoid hypoglycaemic relapse. One must repeat snacks at 3-h intervals till the effect of the offending drug wanes.

Glucagon is the choice of treatment for blood glucose < 54 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l). If the individual is unable to consume carbohydrates by mouth, the use of glucagon is indicated for the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Caregivers, school staff and family members should be able to access and be aware of when and how to administer it.

For severe hypoglycaemic episodes, injectable glucagon has been the standard of care. Commonly, injectable glucagon comes in a vial with 1 mg lyophilised human synthetic glucagon and a syringe pre-filled with 1 mL sterile saline, which is to be reconstituted prior to usage. More recently, ready-to-use glucagon in pre-filled syringes has become more available. In December 2020, a generic version was also approved.

Glucagon also comes in an intranasal ready-to-use 3 mg dosing spray bottle. The bottle's tip is inserted into the nostril and sprayed. The powdered glucagon is designed to be absorbed in the mucosal lining of the nasal cavity without having to reach the respiratory or olfactory mucosa. So, intranasal glucagon works even if the person is not conscious or is experiencing nasal congestion. Evidence suggests that nasal glucagon can be delivered in well under a minute by untrained individuals and is effective within 5 min of administration but does not sustain the effect as seen with injectable glucagon. As the nasal glucagon has a shorter duration of action than intramuscular glucagon.

### Fluticasone propionate (Flovent) [^e6277051]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Two long-term safety trials (Trial 4 and Trial 5) of ≥ 6 months' duration were conducted in 507 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma. Trial 4 was designed to monitor the safety of 2 doses of FLOVENT HFA, while Trial 5 compared fluticasone propionate HFA with fluticasone propionate CFC. Trial 4 enrolled 182 subjects who were treated daily with low to high doses of ICS, beta-agonists (short-acting [as needed or regularly scheduled] or long-acting), theophylline, inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil sodium, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors at baseline. FLOVENT HFA at dosages of 220 and 440 mcg twice daily was evaluated over a 26-week treatment period in 89 and 93 subjects, respectively. Trial 5 enrolled 325 subjects who were treated daily with moderate to high doses of ICS, with or without concurrent use of salmeterol or albuterol, at baseline. Fluticasone propionate HFA at a dosage of 440 mcg twice daily and fluticasone propionate CFC at a dosage of 440 mcg twice daily were evaluated over a 52-week treatment period in 163 and 162 subjects, respectively. Baseline FEV1values were similar across groups (mean 81% to 84% of predicted normal). Throughout the 52-week treatment period, asthma control was maintained with both formulations of fluticasone propionate compared with baseline. In both trials, none of the subjects were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy.

14.2 Pediatric Subjects Aged 4 to 11 Years

A 12-week clinical trial conducted in 241 pediatric subjects with asthma was supportive of efficacy but inconclusive due to measurable levels of fluticasone propionate in 6/48 (13%) of the plasma samples from subjects randomized to placebo. Efficacy in subjects aged 4 to 11 years is extrapolated from adult data with FLOVENT HFA and other supporting data [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Fluticasone [^2fdd84ea]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

For the proper use of Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP and to attain maximum improvement, the patient should read and follow carefully the patient's instructions accompanying the product.

Drug Interactions

Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4. A drug interaction study with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a highly potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interactions). During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.

In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in 8 healthy volunteers, coadministration of a single dose of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg; 5 times the maximum daily intranasal dose) with multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg) to steady state resulted in increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, a reduction in plasma cortisol AUC, and no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. Caution should be exercised when Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, USP is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Administer fluticasone propionate nasal spray by the intranasal route only. Prime fluticasone propionate nasal spray before using for the first time or after a period of non-use (1 week or more) by shaking the contents well and releasing 6 sprays into the air away from the face. Shake fluticasone propionate nasal spray gently before each use.

Patients should use fluticasone propionate nasal spray at regular intervals since its effectiveness depends on its regular use. Maximum effect may take several days and individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and different degree of symptom relief.

For intranasal use only. Recommended starting dosages:

Adults: 2 sprays per nostril once daily (200 mcg per day). (2.1)
Adolescents and children aged 4 years and older: 1 spray per nostril once daily (100 mcg per day). (2.2)

2.1 Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults is 2 sprays (50 mcg of fluticasone propionate each) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 200 mcg). The same total daily dose, 1 spray in each nostril administered twice daily (e.g., 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) is also effective. After the first few days, patients may be able to reduce their dose to 1 spray in each nostril once daily for maintenance therapy.

Maximum total daily doses should not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril (total dose, 200 mcg/day). There is no evidence that exceeding the recommended dose is more effective.

2.2 Adolescents and Children (Aged 4 Years and Older)

The recommended starting dosage in adolescents and children, aged 4 years and older is 1 spray in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 100 mcg). Patients not adequately responding to 1 spray in each nostril may use 2 sprays in each nostril once daily (total daily dose, 200 mcg). Once adequate control is achieved, the dosage should be decreased to 1 spray in each nostril once daily.

The maximum total daily dosage should not exceed 2 sprays in each nostril (200 mcg/day). There is no evidence that exceeding the recommended dose is more effective.

### Management of chronic rhinosinusitis in CF [^1a9a563c]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2009). Low credibility.

Routine CF management often does not include upper airway (UAW) assessment although CFTR defects equally affect the sinonasal mucosa. Up to 50% of CF patients have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and/or nasal polyps, and almost 100% reveal UAW abnormalities on CT scan. CRS impairs quality of life. UAW dysfunction in filtering, humidifying, and warming inspired air affects lower airways and the UAW is a potential site of first colonization and a reservoir for opportunistic bacteria. Therefore, UAW pathology substantially affects overall health in CF. Standard treatments are scarce and mostly lack evidence. Nasal douche can remove mucus and crusts. Recently, delivery of dornase alfa using a vibrating aerosol has shown potential as treatment for CF-related CRS. Surgery is indicated when conservative approaches fail but postoperative relapse is frequent. In summary, upper airway involvement in CF is undertreated and requires prospective investigation and an interdisciplinary consensus on diagnosis and therapy.

5.4 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy

Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Suppression/Adrenal Insufficiency

Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.

Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although FLOVENT HFA may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.

Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to FLOVENT HFA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with FLOVENT HFA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.

Unmasking of Allergic Conditions Previously Suppressed by Systemic Corticosteroids

Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to FLOVENT HFA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).

Corticosteroid Withdrawal Symptoms

During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^c7a14237]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Calcitonin (nasal spray) in postmenopausal osteoporosis — conditional role, effects, and safety are specified. In postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture with osteoporosis, we suggest that nasal spray calcitonin be prescribed only in women who cannot tolerate raloxifene, bisphosphonates, estrogen, denosumab, tibolone, abaloparatide, or teriparatide or for whom these therapies are not considered appropriate. A meta-analysis comparing calcitonin with placebo showed a 46% reduction in vertebral fracture risk (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.82) with no significant effect on hip or nonvertebral fractures; the Prevent Recurrence of Osteoporotic Fractures (PROOF) trial showed efficacy for vertebral fracture reduction at the dose of 200 IU but not 100 or 400 IU of nasal spray calcitonin per day. There is weak evidence for vertebral fracture pain relief, with one randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 68 postmenopausal women showing efficacy. For patients who cannot tolerate other therapies, nasal spray calcitonin may be used and is well tolerated; however, there is considerable doubt about its benefit in reducing fractures, particularly nonvertebral fractures. Safety concerns include an increased risk of prostate and liver cancer and other malignancies, and the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada have both withdrawn nasal spray calcitonin from the market.

Additional evidence found increased symptom improvement from 66% to 74% after 15 to 21 days (risk ratio 1.1, 95% CI 1.02–1.18) with aNNT of 11 across all doses. As adjunct therapy, adding fluticasone nasal spray to oral cefuroxime increased treatment success at 3 weeks from 74% to 93% in patients with a history of CRS or RARS, whereas another study in non-RARS found no benefits and likely included many with VRS given symptoms for less than 10 days (median of 7 days).

### Washing illness away: a systematic review of the impact of nasal irrigation and spray on COVID-19 [^a062be0b]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In this review, SNI was the best studied intervention and had the best evidence for reducing SARS‐CoV‐2 NVL. The data surrounding the use of PVP‐I present mixed results, and it remains unclear if the benefit is from potential virucidal activity or from irrigation alone. This study did not yield any evidence for the use of INCS for reducing viral load in patients with COVID‐19, and future clinical trials are warranted.

### Examinee nondisclosure of relevant medical information during transportation-related regulatory examinations: a case series [^8a3da73f]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

NTSB Record Number: HWY19MH007

On January 3, 2019, a Freightliner tractor-trailer crossed the median and struck an oncoming van as well as a second tractor-trailer. This accident was likely related to the severe cardiopulmonary pathology of the inciting vehicle's driver. The driver had a two-vessel coronary artery bypass graft procedure in 2010, which he initially reported to the certified medical examiners completing his DOT medical certification examination. In 2014, he was seen by a different provider and, at this time, did not report his past cardiopulmonary diagnoses. The driver continued to not report this medical history until his last examination in 2018, even though he was taking several medications and was continued to be treated by his personal health care providers. The month prior to the accident, he presented at an emergency room with a persistent cough that had lasted for several weeks. The emergency room record showed that he was on Lisinopril, rosuvastatin, aspirin, Flonase, ProAir, and Levaquin, and documented a worsening of his coronary artery disease with 100% occlusion in two marginal branches of the left circumflex and right coronary respectively. The autopsy of the driver demonstrated severe coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease that was identified as contributing factor to his death. It is likely that this driver sustained a sudden exacerbation of his cardiac symptoms that incapacitated him. This accident caused seven fatalities, five serious injuries, and three minor injuries.

NTSB Record Number: HWY17MH007

On December 18, 2017, a school bus crashed into a private vehicle and Maryland Transit Administration bus. It was discovered that the school bus driver had a significant history of epilepsy since childhood that he had never reported to his certified medical examiners. He also had a history of hepatitis C, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which were treated with medications. The driver also took daily medication for his epilepsy and had been treated for acute seizures as an adult by his personal health care providers. Some of these providers documented his occupation as a commercial driver, but there is no documentation that they had discussed with the driver the risks of his diagnosis and continued driving behavior. It is not required to report this driver's diagnosis to the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration, but these reporting requirements vary by treating jurisdiction. This accident caused six fatalities, five serious injuries, and six minor injuries.

### A survey: understanding the health and perspectives of people with CF not benefiting from CFTR modulators [^8c1129a7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

3.4 Impact of disease and burden of therapy

The symptoms that were most commonly reported to occur on a regular basis were gastrointestinal issues (n = 216/334, 64.7%), excessive cough (n = 180/334, 53.9%), fatigue (n = 170/334, 50.9%), shortness of breath (n = 134/334, 40.1%), mental health issues (n = 116/327, 34.7%), chest tightness (n = 113/334, 33.8%), and chronic pain (n = 60/334,18.0%). Individuals reported use of both pulmonary and non‐pulmonary treatments to manage the signs and symptoms of CF and its complications (Table S2). Respiratory therapies used by more than 50% of pwCF (n = 323) included airway clearance, oral/inhaled bronchodilators, dornase alfa, hypertonic saline, and sinus rinses. Gastrointestinal therapies used by more than 50% of pwCF (n = 323) included fat‐soluble vitamins and pancreatic enzymes. While only 4.3% (n = 14/323) of individuals spend more than 4 h per day doing medical treatments, 76.5% (n = 247/323) spend between 1 and 4 h (Figure S2). On an annual basis (for a time period that included the COVID pandemic), more than half of individuals with CF spent one to four nights in the hospital for a CF‐related concern (n = 184/334, 55.1%), and 13.8% (n = 46/334) spent five or more nights in the hospital. More than 86.1% (n = 267/310) of those surveyed reported that CF has a moderate to significant impact on their or their family member's life, and 93.5% (n = 188/201) of caregivers reported that CF had a moderate to significant impact on daily life, with mental (n = 136/204, 66.7%) and physical (n = 83/204, 40.7%) health impacts being highly reported by caregivers. Respondents rated the four most burdensome aspects of CF to be treatment burden and time required for daily therapies (n = 218/310, 70.3%), avoiding germs (n = 178/310, 57.4%), feeling isolated or like a burden on others (n = 166/310, 53.6%) and disruption of hospitalizations to daily life and obligations (n = 140/310, 45.2%). Financial concerns such as fear of running out of treatments, ability to afford prescribed drugs, vitamins, and treatments, and obtaining and keeping insurance coverage were also frequently reported (Table S3).

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^75aeefee]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

How often should patients carry out airway clearance techniques? How long should an airway clearance session last?

Good practice points

The frequency and duration of the airway clearance technique should be tailored to the individual and may alter during periods of exacerbation.
Advise individuals to perform their airway clearance technique for a minimum of 10 min (up to a maximum of 30 minutes). After this time, they should continue until two clear huffs or coughs are completed, or until the patient is starting to become fatigued.

How soon should the patient be reviewed after the initial assessment?

Good practice points

Individuals whot have been assessed and taught an airway clearance technique should be reviewed by a respiratory physiotherapist within 3 months of their initial assessment.
Individuals with bronchiectasis who are followed up in secondary care should be assessed by a respiratory physiotherapist as part of their annual clinical review to ensure their airway clearance regimen is optimised.
All individuals with a deterioration in their condition (increased frequency of exacerbations and/or worsening of symptoms) should have their airway clearance technique reviewed by a respiratory physiotherapist (see figure 1 –management of the deteriorating patient).

Mucoactives in bronchiectasis

Recommendations

Do not routinely use recombinant human DNase in adults with bronchiectasis (A).
Consider the use of humidification with sterile water or normal saline to facilitate airway clearance (D).

Good practice points

Consider a trial of mucoactive treatment in patients with bronchiectasis who have difficulty in sputum expectoration.
Perform an airway reactivity challenge test when inhaled mucoactive treatment is first administered.
Consider pretreatment with a bronchodilator prior to inhaled or nebulised mucoactive treatments especially in individuals where bronchoconstriction is likely (patients with asthma or bronchial hyper-reactivity and those with severe airflow obstruction FEV 1 < 1 litre).
If carbocysteine is prescribed, a 6-month trial should be given and continued if there is ongoing clinical benefit.
See figures 3 and 4.
See Full Guideline appendix 2: Challenge test details.

Research recommendation

Randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the long-term impact of mucoactive therapies.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation otolaryngology care multidisciplinary consensus recommendations [^8009a32f]. International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis in cystic fibrosis — intranasal corticosteroid irrigation evidence and consensus: Statement 25 ("Should intranasal corticosteroids administered by irrigation versus no treatment with intranasal corticosteroids administered by irrigation be used in individuals with cystic fibrosis?") did not reach consensus with a vote of 75.86%, and the committee "was unable to come to a ≥ 80% consensus to recommend or recommend as an option" intranasal corticosteroid (INC) by irrigation in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The page notes "There is insufficient evidence regarding the role of INC irrigation in individuals with CF-CRS", with potential benefits extrapolated from spray or drops, and cites a prospective cohort in 33 adults with CF after prior sinus surgery in which INC use resulted in "a nonstatistically significant SNOT-22 reduction of nine points". Reported safety issues include that topical nasal corticosteroid drops and sprays "have been associated with mild adverse effects, including nasal bleeding, burning, and tingling, compared with placebo", and with long-term corticosteroid use "there is concern for the development of adrenal suppression, adverse effects, or drug interactions, although the risk for INC is generally accepted to be lower", with "two case reports" of drug interactions "mostly implicating inhaled budesonide and not INC". The committee also notes CF-CRS is "typically a neutrophilic inflammation" versus non–CF-CRS being "eosinophilic", and that individuals with CF-CRS and nasal polyps "may experience a better response to INC than the average individual with CF-CRS".

### Mometasone furoate (Nasonex) [^ec3ffce2]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

2.4	Treatment of Nasal Polyps

Adults 18 Years of Age and Older:

The recommended dose for the treatment of nasal polyps is 2 sprays (50 mcg of mometasone furoate in each spray) in each nostril twice daily (total daily dose of 400 mcg). A dose of 2 sprays (50 mcg of mometasone furoate in each spray) in each nostril once daily (total daily dose of 200 mcg) is also effective in some patients.
