## Question

cortisol fatigue

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "cortisol fatigue" (often labeled "adrenal fatigue") is a real medical condition and how to interpret fatigue in relation to cortisol physiology and testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and terminology. Then, I should verify what major endocrine societies and systematic reviews conclude. Next, I will examine the evidence base for HPA axis changes in fatigue syndromes and whether they imply a disease entity. After that, I need to distinguish "adrenal fatigue" from true adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndromes. Finally, I will consider appropriate diagnostic pathways, red flags, and evidence-based management for fatigue, including when cortisol testing is warranted and when it is not.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't talk past each other. "Cortisol fatigue" is a lay term that maps onto the concept of "adrenal fatigue", which claims chronic stress "wears out" the adrenal glands and causes fatigue; however, this is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by endocrine societies, whereas adrenal insufficiency is a well-defined endocrine disorder with established diagnostic criteria and treatment standards [^116H5P2E] [^114R7WKR].

> Wait, let me verify the consensus from authoritative sources before drawing conclusions. Multiple systematic reviews and endocrine society statements conclude there is no substantiation for "adrenal fatigue" as a distinct disease, citing methodological flaws, inconsistent findings, and lack of validated diagnostic criteria; in contrast, adrenal insufficiency is a rare but life-threatening condition with clear diagnostic algorithms and replacement therapy [^1157vXwH] [^11439KHb] [^114R7WKR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about fatigue and cortisol being unrelated; I should review the HPA axis data in fatigue syndromes. In chronic fatigue syndrome, some studies describe mild hypocortisolism, attenuated diurnal variation, and blunted HPA responsiveness, but these findings are heterogeneous, often confounded by sleep, inactivity, depression, and medications, and do not establish a uniform adrenal disease; importantly, low-dose hydrocortisone has not shown durable benefit in CFS and carries risks of adrenal suppression, so it is not recommended as treatment for "adrenal fatigue" [^1113Yy3j] [^116n4UpX] [^1123td66].

> I need to ensure I distinguish "adrenal fatigue" from true adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency presents with weight loss, orthostatic hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperpigmentation; secondary adrenal insufficiency lacks mineralocorticoid deficiency; both are diagnosed with morning cortisol and ACTH, and confirmed with cosyntropin stimulation testing, followed by physiologic glucocorticoid replacement and patient education on stress dosing and emergency management [^114R7WKR] [^112ik7E1].

> But wait, what if symptoms reflect glucocorticoid withdrawal rather than adrenal failure; I should double-check that distinction. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome produces fatigue, myalgias, mood changes, and sleep disturbance during taper and can overlap with adrenal insufficiency; however, hypotension and hypoglycemia point toward adrenal insufficiency, and guidelines recommend managing withdrawal with slower taper, temporary dose increases, and clinical judgment rather than routine HPA testing during supraphysiologic therapy [^1142FRtj] [^114h7pGF].

> Next, I should review when cortisol testing is actually indicated in fatigued patients. Morning 8 am cortisol and ACTH are appropriate when there are red flags for adrenal insufficiency such as unintentional weight loss, orthostatic symptoms, salt craving, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, or recent prolonged glucocorticoid use; in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, guidelines advise checking morning cortisol and ACTH for new fatigue given the risk of hypophysitis and secondary adrenal insufficiency; outside these contexts, routine cortisol testing for nonspecific fatigue is not recommended [^114R7WKR] [^111b4xzm] [^115rtjWZ].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach so I don't miss true disease. If morning cortisol is low or indeterminate, proceed to cosyntropin stimulation testing; primary adrenal insufficiency shows low cortisol with high ACTH, whereas secondary or glucocorticoid-induced forms show low or inappropriately normal ACTH; in patients exposed to supraphysiologic glucocorticoids, avoid testing until tapering near physiologic doses and provide stress coverage when clinically indicated [^112ik7E1] [^1142FRtj] [^111TnnR9].

> Let me consider evidence-based management of fatigue, and I should confirm that I'm not conflating treatments for adrenal insufficiency with treatments for nonspecific fatigue. For fatigue without confirmed adrenal insufficiency, prioritize sleep optimization, graded exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, nutrition, and treatment of comorbidities such as anemia, thyroid disease, depression, and sleep apnea; corticosteroids are not indicated for "adrenal fatigue", and even in cancer-related fatigue, benefits of corticosteroids are modest, short-term, and reserved for select contexts like end-of-life care due to adverse effects [^1113Yy3j] [^115cWi4b] [^115QByWr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought some integrative approaches might endorse "adrenal fatigue" as a diagnosis; let me reconsider. While integrative reviews discuss HPA axis dysregulation and lifestyle interventions, they do not validate "adrenal fatigue" as a disease entity, and they align with the broader conclusion that current evidence does not support this diagnosis or routine cortisol testing in its name [^115cWi4b] [^11439KHb].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. "Cortisol fatigue" or "adrenal fatigue" is not a recognized medical diagnosis; fatigue is multifactorial and may coexist with subtle HPA axis changes, but these are not evidence of adrenal gland failure; reserve adrenal testing for patients with clinical features of true adrenal insufficiency or specific iatrogenic risks, and manage fatigue with comprehensive, non-steroid strategies unless a confirmed endocrine deficiency is documented [^116H5P2E] [^114R7WKR].

---

Cortisol fatigue, more accurately termed **HPA axis dysfunction**, describes a pattern of altered cortisol signaling that can contribute to fatigue, sleep disturbance, and stress intolerance [^1113Yy3j]. It is not a recognized endocrine diagnosis, and routine cortisol testing is not recommended for general fatigue without specific clinical clues. Management focuses on **lifestyle and behavioral strategies** — sleep hygiene, stress reduction, regular exercise, and balanced nutrition — with limited, short-term cortisol therapy reserved for carefully selected cases under specialist supervision [^notfound] [^1113Yy3j].

---

## Physiological role of cortisol

Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that regulates metabolism, immune function, and the stress response; its secretion follows a diurnal rhythm with a peak after waking and a nadir at night, which coordinates sleep–wake cycles, metabolism, and immune activity [^117Pk7MJ]. Disruption of this rhythm is associated with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and metabolic dysregulation [^112zKy3X].

---

## Evidence for cortisol dysregulation in fatigue-related conditions

Several conditions show altered cortisol patterns that may contribute to fatigue:

- **Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)**: Mild hypocortisolism, attenuated diurnal variation, and blunted HPA axis responsiveness are common and correlate with symptom severity and disability [^1113Yy3j].

- **Burnout syndrome**: Blunted cortisol awakening response and altered diurnal profiles are reported, though findings are inconsistent and confounded by stress, sleep, and psychiatric comorbidity [^115rtjWZ].

- **Cancer-related fatigue**: HPA axis dysregulation and cytokine-mediated inflammation are implicated, with cortisol abnormalities observed in some patients [^11334TbC].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biomarkers

There are **no universally accepted diagnostic criteria** for "cortisol fatigue". Commonly used biomarkers include:

| **Biomarker** | **Description** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Morning serum cortisol | Reflects baseline HPA axis activity | Variable; influenced by stress, sleep, medications |
| Salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR) | Measures cortisol rise after awakening | Inconsistent findings; confounded by sleep, stress |
| 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) | Assesses total daily cortisol output | Limited utility for mild HPA dysfunction |
| Dexamethasone suppression test (DST) | Evaluates HPA axis feedback | Not validated for fatigue syndromes |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Management centers on **lifestyle and behavioral interventions**:

- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep–wake schedules and avoidance of caffeine/alcohol improve cortisol rhythm and fatigue [^1127JFoT].

- **Stress reduction**: Mindfulness, meditation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) improve HPA axis function and fatigue [^1113Yy3j].

- **Exercise**: Moderate aerobic activity improves fatigue and HPA axis regulation [^11711cFZ].

- **Nutrition**: Balanced meals with complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and omega-3s support HPA axis function [^1127JFoT].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Short-term, low-dose hydrocortisone may benefit select patients with documented HPA dysfunction, but risks (e.g. adrenal suppression) limit use to specialists [^1123td66].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Controversies include the **lack of standardized diagnostic criteria**, heterogeneity of study populations, and confounding by stress, sleep, and psychiatric comorbidity [^116Uksqr]. Many studies are small, cross-sectional, and use nonstandardized cortisol assays, limiting reproducibility and clinical applicability [^11439KHb].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Key gaps include the need for **prospective, longitudinal studies** to clarify causality between cortisol dysregulation and fatigue; development of standardized diagnostic criteria and biomarkers; and exploration of personalized interventions targeting HPA axis dysfunction [^112karUa].

---

Cortisol fatigue reflects HPA axis dysfunction rather than a discrete endocrine diagnosis. Management emphasizes **lifestyle and behavioral strategies**, with limited, short-term cortisol therapy for carefully selected cases under specialist supervision.

### Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in chronic fatigue syndrome [^1113Yy3j]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

The weight of current evidence supports the presence of the following factors related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): mild hypocortisolism; attenuated diurnal variation of cortisol; enhanced negative feedback to the HPA axis; and blunted HPA axis responsiveness. Furthermore, HPA axis changes seem clinically relevant, as they are associated with worse symptoms and/or disability and with poorer outcomes to standard treatments for CFS. Regarding etiology, women with CFS are more likely to have reduced cortisol levels. Studies published in the past 8 years provide further support for a multifactorial model in which several factors interact to moderate HPA axis changes. In particular, low activity levels, depression and early-life stress appear to reduce cortisol levels, whereas the use of psychotropic medication can increase cortisol. Addressing these factors-for example, with cognitive behavioral therapy-can increase cortisol levels and is probably the first-line approach for correcting HPA axis dysfunction at present, as steroid replacement is not recommended. Given what is now a fairly consistent pattern of findings for the type of HPA axis changes found in CFS, we recommend that future work focuses on improving our understanding of the cause and relevance of these observed changes.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

Participants

The Task Force included a chair, selected by The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The co-sponsoring associations (European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry) had participating members. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

Conclusions

We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposing factors. This is also recommended for pregnant women with unexplained persistent nausea, fatigue, and hypotension. We recommend a short corticotropin test (250 μg) as the "gold standard" diagnostic tool to establish the diagnosis. If a short corticotropin test is not possible in the first instance, we recommend an initial screening procedure comprising the measurement of morning plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Diagnosis of the underlying cause should include a validated assay of autoantibodies against 21-hydroxylase. In autoantibody-negative individuals, other causes should be sought. We recommend once-daily fludrocortisone (median, 0.1 mg) and hydrocortisone (15–25 mg/d) or cortisone acetate replacement (20–35 mg/d) applied in two to three daily doses in adults. In children, hydrocortisone (∼8 mg/m²/d) is recommended. Patients should be educated about stress dosing and equipped with a steroid card and glucocorticoid preparation for parenteral emergency administration. Follow-up should aim at monitoring appropriate dosing of corticosteroids and associated autoimmune diseases, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^1166jAYR]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

SITC guideline — primary adrenal insufficiency after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is rare but can cause life-threatening adrenal crisis. Symptoms may include nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, light-headedness, hypoglycemia, and hypotension, and primary adrenal insufficiency would be associated with high serum ACTH together with low morning serum cortisol. Adrenal insufficiency occurs in 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 or CTLA-4 therapies and is estimated at 5% with combination ICIs; a review of case reports found a median onset of 10 weeks from the first ICI dose.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^115iYStS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Therefore, is "adrenal fatigue" an actual disorder? Is fatigue related to depleted adrenal function? Does fatigued healthy subjects present relative adrenal failure? Is adrenal involved in the pathophysiology of fatigue in diseases? Which tests were performed in order to establish markers or triggers? The aim of this systematic review was to determine the correlation between adrenal status and fatigue states, including the recently described "burnout" or "burnout syndrome", and other fatigue-related diseases. The primary objective was to evaluate the methodology for fatigue status assessment, including cortisol tests, and to examine the results of studies involving cortisol and fatigue correlation.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^116H5P2E]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The term "adrenal fatigue" ("AF") has been used by some doctors, healthcare providers, and the general media to describe an alleged condition caused by chronic exposure to stressful situations. According to this theory, chronic stress could potentially lead to "overuse" of the adrenal glands, eventually resulting in their functional failure. In a recent search on Google (April 22, 2016), "adrenal fatigue" provided 640,000 results, and the association of the two words exhibited 1,540,000 findings. Despite this, "adrenal fatigue" has not been recognized by any endocrinology societies to date, who claim there is no evidence for the existence of this syndrome.

Conversely, some medical societies, although unrecognized by American Board of Medical Specialties and Association of American Medical Colleges, claim that adrenal fatigue is a real and underdiagnosed disease. According to these societies, to screen for "AF" in patients, a questionnaire developed by Dr. Wilson, who is reportedly the first person to describe this supposed syndrome, is recommended to be used. In addition, patients suspected of "AF" are now being tested for serum basal cortisol levels and salivary cortisol rhythm. Those who present impaired results from these tests are then treated with corticosteroids, regardless of the etiology. As a result, corticosteroids (mainly hydrocortisone) are probably being prescribed to a large number of patients, as at least 24,000 health providers are instructed by one medical society (The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine – A4M) to prescribe corticosteroids in these cases.

Arguments for corticosteroid use as a treatment for "claimed AF" include: the immediate and significant improvement seen in patients who are prescribed corticosteroid, and the long and extensive clinical symptomatology of this alleged disease, which shows a slow depletion before clinical and severe hypocortisolism ensues. Moreover, others claim that endocrinologists use much too strict diagnostic criteria before prescribing corticosteroids, and thus, many sufferers would not be receiving adequate treatment. However, there are logical counterarguments to routine corticosteroid use in these patients. First, corticosteroids promote a sense of wellbeing (usually temporary), regardless of the patient's condition. Second, even at low and physiological doses, corticosteroids increase the risk for several disorders, such as psychiatric disorders, osteoporosis, myopathy, glaucoma, metabolic disorders, sleep disturbances and cardiovascular diseases.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012? [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm and patients still have an increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-h cortisol production rate with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice daily, weight-related, dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm is associated with ill health, and the few studies that have compared different treatment regimens. Further studies are required to definitively test the benefits of replacing the cortisol circadian rhythm in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^111aHRUH]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is caused by either primary adrenal failure (mostly due to autoimmune adrenalitis) or by hypothalamic-pituitary impairment of the corticotropic axis (predominantly due to pituitary disease). It is a rare disease, but is life threatening when overlooked. Main presenting symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss are non-specific, thus diagnosis is often delayed. The diagnostic work-up is well established but some pitfalls remain, particularly in the identification of secondary adrenal insufficiency. Despite optimised life-saving glucocorticoid-replacement and mineralocorticoid-replacement therapy, health-related quality of life in adrenal insufficiency is more severely impaired than previously thought. Dehydroepiandrosterone-replacement therapy has been introduced that could help to restore quality of life. Monitoring of glucocorticoid-replacement quality is hampered by lack of objective methods of assessment, and is therefore largely based on clinical grounds. Thus, long-term management of patients with adrenal insufficiency remains a challenge, requiring an experienced specialist. However, all doctors should know how to diagnose and manage suspected acute adrenal failure.

### An integrative approach to HPA axis dysfunction: from recognition to recovery [^1127JFoT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays a central role in the stress response and is implicated in a wide range of chronic health conditions. This review explores evidence-based perspectives on HPA axis dysregulation, its pathophysiology, diagnostic strategies, and integrative therapeutic approaches. Key contributing factors include psychological stress, genetic and epigenetic influences, dietary factors, gut health, immune system interactions, inflammation, toxins, and hormonal influences. Diagnostic methods such as serum cortisol levels, diurnal salivary cortisol profiles, and other tests are outlined. Therapeutic approaches emphasize the importance of the patient-provider relationship, stress reduction techniques, lifestyle modifications, dietary interventions, supplements, adaptogenic herbs, and other integrative therapies. Understanding HPA axis dysfunction through an integrative lens fosters individualized care and bridges the gap between conventional endocrinology and functional models, empowering providers to support patients with often-dismissed symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, mood instability, and impaired stress tolerance.

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^115cWi4b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer-associated fatigue, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, ASCO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering corticosteroids for symptoms of cancer-related fatigue in patients at the end of life where no contraindications exist. Assess the risk/benefit ratio of corticosteroid use over time.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^11439KHb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Limitations

Some limitations of this review include: (1) our inability to perform a meta-analysis due to heterogeneity of the study design; (2) the descriptive nature of most studies, and the reporting of a condition that has not been scientifically proven without adding new data nor providing solid arguments; (3) the fact that most studies were published in low impact journals; (4) the inadequate and poor quality assessment of fatigue; (5) the use of an unsubstantiated methodology in terms of cortisol assessment; (6) the lack of concern regarding validated adrenal assessment (as endorsed by endocrinologists); (7) false premises leading to an incorrect sequence of thinking and research direction; and, (8) inappropriate/invalid conclusions regarding causality and association between different information, in particular, whether any abnormalities would be a marker or a potential target for treatment.

Final discussions

Our results corroborate an Endocrine Society warning statement regarding adrenal fatigue (1), as saying that "adrenal fatigue is not a real medical condition". While a recent systematic review on burnout was published (109) that implicated some HPA dysfunctions as markers or triggers of burnout, there were important bias selection regarding the articles chosen. Therefore, we recommend that for further prospective studies aiming to correlate fatigue, exhaustion, or burnout status with impairment of the HPA axis, an ITT or a 250 μg CST should be performed to evaluate the adrenocortical ability to release cortisol, measurements of ACTH, DHEA-S, and corticosterone (an intermediate steroid product that is impaired earlier than cortisol), the adoption of the most validated questionnaires, particularly Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Chalder Fatigue Scale, SF-36 or the General Fatigue Scale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventor, and considering different study populations, including: (a) healthy subjects; (b) burnout healthy subjects; (c) subjects with overtraining syndrome; (d) subjects post-chemotherapy; (e) subjects with CFS; and (f) subjects with fibromyalgia.

In addition, we do not recommend the use of the many methods reported in the articles evaluated in this systematic review, as they are not accurate to determine whether a patient has or has not adrenal failure.

The answer to whether "adrenal fatigue" or depletion exists or not may not be simple, but different answers can be offered according to the presence of an underlying disease. However, so far, there is no substantiation to show its existence.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114h7pGF]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^111b4xzm]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–related fatigue — incidence and panel recommendations note that fatigue occurs in 21% (1% grade ≥ 3), 25% (2% grade ≥ 3), and 36% (4% grade ≥ 3) of patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1, anti-CTLA-4, and combination ICIs, respectively. Evaluation for patients with new or worsening ICI-related fatigue should include CBC, CMP, TSH, fT4, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). If other organ-specific toxicities are ruled out, ICI-related fatigue should be managed similarly to cancer-related fatigue. Patients with fatigue should also be evaluated for comorbidities that commonly cluster with fatigue, including pain, insomnia, depression, and anxiety, and patients experiencing fatigue should be evaluated for comorbid conditions that may contribute to fatigue, including hypoxemia, obstructive sleep apnea, anemia, heart failure, liver insufficiency, renal insufficiency, reduced pulmonary function, electrolyte disturbance, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, nutritional deficiency, or sedating medications. Management of fatigue may include non-pharmacological strategies such as energy conservation, energy-level diaries, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, and nutritional evaluation, which have been shown to be helpful in cancer-related fatigue and are likely to be helpful for ICI-related fatigue.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^114RmsKu]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency:

- **Definition**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, also known as adrenal suppression, is a condition arising from prolonged or high-dose exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to a decrease in endogenous cortisol production.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves the inhibition of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH due to the exogenous corticosteroids, leading to reduced production and secretion of cortisol from the adrenal glands. When the exogenous corticosteroids are reduced or stopped, the suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may not immediately resume normal function, leading to a deficiency in cortisol, especially during times of stress.
- **Epidemiology**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adult patients. Long-term oral corticosteroid use in the general population is estimated at 0.5–1.8%, with an absolute risk of 48.7% for developing adrenal insufficiency.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency include prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy, high-dose ICSs, and abrupt cessation of corticosteroids after prolonged use. Other risk factors include underlying diseases, age, and the number of treating clinicians involved in the care of the patient, as these factors may increase the likelihood of polypharmacy and the risk of iatrogenic events.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. These symptoms can be exacerbated by stress or infection, potentially leading to an adrenal crisis characterized by severe hypotension and shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is generally good with appropriate management, which involves gradual tapering of the exogenous corticosteroids and supportive care. If left untreated or if treatment is delayed, the condition can lead to severe complications, such as adrenal crisis.

### Yoga effectively reduces fatigue and symptoms of depression in patients with different types of cancer [^11711cFZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The overall survival rate in cancer is rising steadily due to better early detection and treatment options. Therefore, not only the treatment itself but also side effects of cancer and its treatment are gaining more and more attention. Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer, which is perceived by patients as even more distressing than pain. Fatigue is characterized by an intense and chronic sense of tiredness that is not associated with previous stress and cannot completely be eliminated by rest. On the physical level, fatigue expresses as tiredness and lack of bodily strength, on the emotional level as demotivation and depressed mood, and on the cognitive level as difficulty concentrating. It considerably reduces the quality of life and prevents patients from living a normal life. Fatigue poses a high risk for the development of clinical depression and anxiety due to the loss of positive experience and increasing avoidance behavior. Prevalence and subjective evaluation of fatigue differ between different types of cancer: patients with breast or colorectal cancer report a higher burden of fatigue than prostate cancer patients.

Despite the high prevalence and impairments, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. A multimodal etiology including physical and psychosocial factors is assumed. On the physical level, pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and skeletal muscle dystrophy might play a role. On the psychosocial level, low social and emotional support, low income, and high catastrophizing thoughts can be risk factors for fatigue. As the etiology of fatigue comprises multiple levels, a multimodal approach to reduce fatigue is recommended in various meta-analyses. According to NCCN guidelines, non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical activation management, cognitive behavioral therapy, or mind-body interventions, should be applied before pharmacological ones. Moderate effects of mind-body interventions such as yoga on fatigue are reported in meta-analyses. Yoga combines both psychological ("Mind") and physical ("Body") aspects and is becoming increasingly important in supportive cancer research. Even compared with a supportive or psychoeducative group of patients with fatigue, yoga therapy showed significant effects in reducing fatigue symptoms. Besides direct effects on the self-reported fatigue symptoms, yoga also showed positive effects on the assumed physical background by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreasing salivary cortisol level, and restoring HPA balance. It also helped to increase muscle strength and to reduce musculoskeletal symptoms such as muscle pain.

### Management of fatigue in adult survivors of cancer: ASCO-Society for Integrative Oncology guideline update [^115DreNX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

New cancer therapies — immunotherapy-related fatigue incidence and evaluation: In patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), fatigue occurs in 21%, 25%, and 36% of patients treated with anti–PD–(L)1, anti–cytotoxic T–lymphocyte–associated protein 4, and combination of ICIs, respectively, and fatigue is most likely to occur after the first month after initiation of ICI therapy; the most common symptom identified by patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T–cell therapy was fatigue in 62% of patients. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer recommends that an evaluation for patients with new or worsening ICI–related fatigue should include CBC count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, morning cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, and if other organ–specific toxicities are ruled out, ICI–related fatigue should be managed similar to cancer-related fatigue (CRF).

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^111PwUk9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Theories on adrenal impairment as the genesis for fatigue are tempting, as they allow for a treatable condition. Despite the widespread use of the term "adrenal fatigue" by the general media and certain health practitioner groups, in this systematic review, only ten citations were found with this exact expression, and they were all only descriptive and did not perform any test regarding the HPA axis and "adrenal fatigue". Studies that tried to correlate the HPA axis and fatigue states used the term "burnout" instead of "adrenal fatigue" to denote adrenal depletion. Therefore, a distinction between the "general information" and the actual scientific literature regarding this condition is evident. First, this suggests that the terminology of a hypothetical adrenal depletion should be normalized, with a suitable name given for the purported condition, as "adrenal fatigue" has been already been stigmatized and lacks proper scientific support. Second, methodology employed to evaluate the proposed correlation between fatigue and adrenal function should be standardized among physicians and medical associations that claim for the existence of adrenal impairment in patients with fatigue before evident clinical hypocortisolism manifests, in order to strength eventual evidence, in case one finds actual and proper causal correlation.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^1157vXwH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The term "adrenal fatigue" ("AF") has been used by some doctors, healthcare providers, and the general media to describe an alleged condition caused by chronic exposure to stressful situations. Despite this, "AF" has not been recognized by any Endocrinology society, who claim there is no hard evidence for the existence. The aim of this systematic review is to verify whether there is substantiation for "AF".

Methods

A systematic search was performed at PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco) and Cochrane databases, from the beginning of the data until April 22nd, 2016. Searched key words were: "adrenal" + "fatigue", "adrenal" + "burnout", "adrenal" + "exhaustion", "hypoadrenia", "burnout" + "cortisol", "fatigue" + "cortisol", "clinical" + "burnout", "cortisol" + "vitalility", "adrenal" + "vitality", and "cortisol" + "exhaustion". Eligibility criteria were: (1) articles written in English, (2) cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the primary outcome, (3) performed tests for evaluating the adrenal axis, (4) absence of influence of corticosteroid therapy, and (5) absence of confounding diseases. Type of questionnaire to distinct fatigued subjects, population studied, tests performed of selected studies were analyzed.

Results

From 3,470 articles found, 58 studies fulfilled the criteria: 33 were carried in healthy individuals, and 25 in symptomatic patients. The most assessed exams were "Direct Awakening Cortisol" (n = 29), "Cortisol Awakening Response" (n = 27) and "Salivary Cortisol Rhythm" (n = 26).

Discussion

We found an almost systematic finding of conflicting results derived from most of the studies methods utilized, regardless of the validation and the quality of performed tests. Some limitations of the review include: (1) heterogeneity of the study design; (2) the descriptive nature of most studies; (3) the poor quality assessment of fatigue; (4) the use of an unsubstantiated methodology in terms of cortisol assessment (not endorsed by endocrinologists); (5) false premises leading to an incorrect sequence of research direction; and, (6) inappropriate/invalid conclusions regarding causality and association between different information.

Conclusion

This systematic review proves that there is no substantiation that "adrenal fatigue" is an actual medical condition. Therefore, adrenal fatigue is still a myth.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^116wsoVT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: (1) whole article written in English, (2) cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the primary outcome, (3) specific tests performed for evaluating the adrenal axis, (4) absence of corticosteroid therapy, (5) absence of confounding diseases that would lead to an impaired cortisol status caused by the disorder itself (such as depression, alcoholism, and morbid obesity). Studies with a merely description about adrenal axis impairment with no tests performed were excluded.

Quality assessment

The abstract of each of identified study was analyzed by one of the authors (F. A.C.), and was excluded if it did not meet the eligibility criteria. The studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were entirely evaluated regarding the rationale, method design, primary outcome, assessment of fatigue, statistical analysis, results, discussion, and conclusions, in order to improve data quality. Those studies that presented any bias in the methodology, results, or interpretation of the exposed data, which could be reflected in the analysis of the study as a whole, were also excluded.

Statistical analysis

Each of the studied populations, each of the questionnaires and each of the tests performed were quantified, whereas tests results were analyzed in terms of percentage of type of responses for each of the tests performed. Results were analyzed in general and according to the underlying disease.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^112FhmmH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The term "adrenal fatigue" ("AF") has been used by some doctors, healthcare providers, and the general media to describe an alleged condition caused by chronic exposure to stressful situations. Despite this, "AF" has not been recognized by any Endocrinology society, who claim there is no hard evidence for the existence. The aim of this systematic review is to verify whether there is substantiation for "AF".

Methods

A systematic search was performed at PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco) and Cochrane databases, from the beginning of the data until April 22nd, 2016. Searched key words were: "adrenal"+"fatigue", "adrenal"+"burnout", "adrenal"+"exhaustion", "hypoadrenia", "burnout"+"cortisol", "fatigue"+"cortisol", "clinical"+"burnout", "cortisol"+"vitalility", "adrenal"+"vitality", and "cortisol"+"exhaustion". Eligibility criteria were: (1) articles written in English, (2) cortisol profile and fatigue or energy status as the primary outcome, (3) performed tests for evaluating the adrenal axis, (4) absence of influence of corticosteroid therapy, and (5) absence of confounding diseases. Type of questionnaire to distinct fatigued subjects, population studied, tests performed of selected studies were analyzed.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1159BDJJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome occurs due to dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while decreasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Patients should be informed that glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur during the glucocorticoid dose reduction and what the differences are between glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and underlying disease flare. It should be emphasized that an insufficient glucocorticoid supply is not expected to occur when the glucocorticoid dose is greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent. As exceptions, it should be noted that the glucocorticoid requirement may be significantly higher in the case of critical illness or that glucocorticoid absorption is not guaranteed in gastroenteritis. Many of the symptoms of the withdrawal syndrome are nonspecific and overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease, especially in inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Managing glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and glucocorticoid taper in these patients may be especially challenging. Patients should be educated on symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal to avoid anxiety related to unexpected symptoms or reactive, unnecessary, or excessive increase in glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome. Duration of exogenous glucocorticoid use, glucocorticoid dose and type, and individual susceptibility likely impact the severity and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal, but systematic studies are lacking. In a recent study investigating glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome in patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. Symptoms are thought to occur due to an abrupt decrease in glucocorticoid exposure leading to an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome overlap with those seen in patients with untreated or not optimally treated adrenal insufficiency (Table 5), and most patients with glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome do have concomitant adrenal insufficiency. Since symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal significantly overlap, good clinical guidance to differentiate between those is to consider the total daily dose of glucocorticoids with high doses making adrenal insufficiency less likely. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117YAXkg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — definition, pathophysiology, and clinical features: PAI is defined by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids and needs to be distinguished from secondary adrenocortical insufficiency due to insufficient production of ACTH and without impact on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The signs of PAI are mainly based on deficiency of gluco- and mineralocorticoids and include weight loss, orthostatic hypotension due to dehydration, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, changes in blood count (anemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis), and hypoglycemia; enhanced secretion of ACTH and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides leads to characteristic hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, and in women loss of adrenal androgens results in loss of axillary and pubic hair. Symptoms are nonspecific and include weakness, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, weight loss, abdominal pain, depression, and anxiety; diagnosis is frequently delayed with potential presentation as an acute life-threatening adrenal crisis, and even with treatment health-related quality of life in Addison's disease on standard replacement therapy is often reduced.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering any of the following in patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent aiming to discontinue corticosteroid therapy:

- continued gradual taper in conjunction with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency

- testing with a morning serum cortisol.

B. Chronopharmacotherapy of adrenal insufficiency

GC replacement therapy has drastically improved survival and reduced morbidity in patients with adrenal insufficiency who, until about 1949, ie, before the era of hydrocortisone substitution, would have faced an average survival span after diagnosis of just 1–2 years. But still, excess morbidity and mortality of patients with adrenal insufficiency on GC replacement persists even under state-of-the-art replacement regimens. Mortality risk remains elevated more than 2-fold, and ample evidence documents increased long-term morbidity in patients with adrenal insufficiency of any cause, with an excess risk of cardiovascular disease, psychological disorders, and a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life.

Major treatment goals of GC substitution for adrenal insufficiency include the recreation of physiological 24-hour cortisol exposure profiles in the circulation and at target organs to guarantee adequate stress reactivity, avoiding life-threatening acute adrenal insufficiency, and preventing symptoms and adverse consequences of chronic adrenal insufficiency, eg, fatigue, nausea, and weight loss. At the same time, care must be taken to administer as little hydrocortisone as possible to avert detrimental psychological, metabolic, and cardiovascular side effects of iatrogenic GC excess. This delicate balance between overtreatment and undertreatment of adrenal insufficiency makes reliable monitoring instruments very desirable. Current evaluation of treatment adequacy is based primarily on clinical criteria including changes in weight, blood pressure, electrolyte levels, and quality of life assessments. A significant problem in using clinical criteria as the sole monitoring instrument and guide to treatment lies in the fact that clinical evidence for GC overdose (eg, glucose intolerance, weight gain, trophic skin changes) or GC under-replacement (eg, daytime fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea) lacks specificity. Therefore, biochemical monitoring in the form of blood or salivary cortisol profiles has been employed to assess the adequacy of GC replacement. The validity of using daytime profiles of salivary cortisol for monitoring GC substitution regimens is still controversial. Ceccato et al found that two salivary cortisol measurements in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency were as good as six measurements to predict the area under the curve during oral treatment with cortisone acetate. The same authors have suggested that a single measurement of saliva cortisol upon awakening can facilitate the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. In contrast, Thomson et al found a significant interindividual variation in plasma and salivary cortisol profiles subsequent to oral hydrocortisone treatment for adrenal insufficiency of primary or secondary origin. Furthermore, resulting plasma and salivary cortisol levels correlated only poorly, leading the authors to conclude that salivary cortisol measurement is not a sufficient tool for monitoring the adequacy of hydrocortisone substitution. In contrast, more recent work found an excellent correlation between levels of total cortisol in plasma and free cortisol in saliva, both sampled at 20-minute intervals from early afternoon until bedtime in healthy young adults (illustrated in Figure 6). In a direct comparison, Arlt et al, correlating a self-developed clinical score to timed cortisol serum measurements in the assessment of GC replacement quality, found that three timed cortisol serum measurements were of very limited practical value in guiding replacement therapy because cortisol levels of patients determined as under- and oversubstituted with cortisone acetate largely overlapped with those of well-replaced patients. Unfortunately, the most precise method of gauging the adequacy ofrecreating physiological, circadian systemic cortisol profiles remains highly repetitive blood or saliva sampling, which, due to cost and labor, does not represent a feasible, clinical biomarker. In sum, the existing monitoring tools are far from perfect in accurately assessing treatment quality, emphasizing the importance of characterizing new biomarkers of treatment quality.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency and is categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting less than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

Observations

Primary adrenal insufficiency, which involves deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones, is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (eg, high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (eg, hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 am) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically characterized by low morning cortisol levels (< 5 µg/dL), high corticotropin levels, and low DHEAS levels. Patients with secondary and glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency typically have low or intermediate morning cortisol levels (5–10 µg/dL) and low or low-normal corticotropin and DHEAS levels. Patients with intermediate early-morning cortisol levels should undergo repeat early-morning cortisol testing or corticotropin stimulation testing (measurement of cortisol before and 60 minutes after administration of cosyntropin, 250 µg). Treatment of adrenal insufficiency involves supplemental glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 15–25 mg daily, or prednisone, 3–5 mg daily). Mineralocorticoids (eg, fludrocortisone, 0.05–0.3 mg daily) should be added for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal crisis, a syndrome that can cause hypotension and shock, hyponatremia, altered mental status, and death if untreated, can occur in patients with adrenal insufficiency who have inadequate glucocorticoid therapy, acute illness, and physical stress. Therefore, all patients with adrenal insufficiency should be instructed how to increase glucocorticoids during acute illness and prescribed injectable glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone, 100 mg intramuscular injection) to prevent or treat adrenal crisis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a common condition. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency involves early-morning measurement of cortisol, corticotropin, and DHEAS. All patients with adrenal insufficiency should be treated with glucocorticoids and instructed how to prevent and treat adrenal crisis.

### Corticosteroids for the management of cancer-related fatigue in adults with advanced cancer [^115QByWr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in people with advanced cancer. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is pervasive and debilitating, and can greatly impact quality of life (QoL). CRF has a highly variable clinical presentation, likely due to a complex interaction of multiple factors. Corticosteroids are commonly used to improve CRF, but the benefits are unclear and there are significant adverse effects associated with long-term use. With the increasing survival of people with metastatic cancer, the long-term effects of medications are becoming increasingly relevant. Since the impact of CRF can be immensely debilitating and can negatively affect QoL, its treatment warrants further review.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of corticosteroids compared with placebo or an active comparator in adults with advanced cancer and CRF.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science), LILACS, and two clinical trial registries from inception to 18 July 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials in adults aged ≥ 18 years. We included participants with advanced cancer who were suffering from CRF. We included trials that randomised participants to corticosteroids at any dose, by any route, administered for the relief of CRF; compared to placebo or an active comparator, including supportive care or non-pharmacological treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed titles identified by the search strategy; two review authors assessed risk of bias; and two extracted data. We extracted the primary outcome of participant-reported fatigue relief using validated scales and secondary outcomes of adverse events, serious adverse events and QoL. We calculated the risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between groups for dichotomous outcomes. We measured arithmetic mean and standard deviation, and reported the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI between groups for continuous outcomes. We used standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs when an outcome was measured with different instruments measuring the same construct. We used a random-effects model to meta-analyse the outcome data. We rated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and created two summary of findings tables. MAIN RESULTS: We included four studies with 297 enroled participants; data were available for only 239 participants. Three studies compared corticosteroid (equivalent ≤ 8 mg dexamethasone) to placebo. One study compared corticosteroid (dexamethasone 4 mg) to an active comparator (modafinil 100 mg). There were insufficient data to evaluate subgroups, such as dose and duration of treatment. One study had a high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding, and one study had a high risk of attrition bias. Otherwise, we assessed risks of bias as low or unclear. Comparison 1: corticosteroids compared with placebo Participant-reported fatigue relief The was no clear difference between corticosteroids and placebo (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.14; 3 RCTs, 165 participants, very low-certainty evidence) for relief of fatigue at one week of the intervention. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence three times for study limitations due to unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Adverse events There was no clear difference in the occurrence of adverse events between groups, but the evidence is very uncertain (3 RCTs, 165 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events There was no clear difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events between groups, but the evidence is very uncertain (2 RCTs, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of lIfe One study reported QoL at one week using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) well-being, and found no clear difference in QoL between groups (MD -0.58, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.77). Another study measured QoL using the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs (QoL-ACD), and found no clear difference between groups. There was no clear difference between groups for either study, but the evidence is very uncertain (2 RCTs, 118 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Comparison 2: corticosteroids compared with active comparator (modafinil) Participant-reported fatigue relief There was improvement in fatigue from baseline to two weeks in both groups (modafinil MD 10.15, 95% CI 7.43 to 12.87; dexamethasone MD 9.21, 95% CI 6.73 to 11.69), however no clear difference between the two groups (MD -0.94, 95% CI -4.49 to 2.61; 1 RCT, 73 participants, very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence three times for very serious study limitations and imprecision. Adverse events There was no clear difference in the occurrence of adverse events between groups, but the evidence is very uncertain (1 RCT, 73 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events There were no serious adverse events reported in either group (1 RCT, 73 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of lIfe One study measured QoL at two weeks, using the ESAS-well-being. There was marked improvement in QoL from baseline in both groups (modafinil MD -2.43, 95% CI -2.88 to -1.98; dexamethasone MD -2.16, 95% CI -2.68 to -1.64), however no clear difference between the two groups (MD 0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.93; 1 RCT, 73 participants, very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of systemic corticosteroids in adults with cancer and CRF. We included four small studies that provided very low-certainty of evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids in the management of CRF. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in this setting.

### A case series of adrenal insufficiency (likely due to hypophysitis) in cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^11124N2Q]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The number of approved immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and their indications have significantly increased over the past decade. Immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) of ICIs vary widely in presentation and symptoms and can present diagnostic challenges to emergency department (ED) physicians. Moreover, when ICIs are combined with radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, or targeted therapy, the attribution of signs and symptoms to an immune-related cause is even more difficult. Here, we report a series of 5 ED cases of adrenal insufficiency in ICI-treated cancer patients. All 5 patients presented with severe fatigue and nausea. Four patients definitely had and one patient possibly had central adrenal insufficiency, and 4 patients had undetectable serum cortisol levels. The majority of the patients had nonspecific symptoms that were not recognized at their first ED presentation. These cases illustrate the need for a heightened level of suspicion for adrenal insufficiency in ICI-treated cancer patients with hypotension, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, or hypoglycemia. As ICI use increases, irAE-associated oncologic emergencies will become more prevalent. Thus, ED physicians must update their knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of irAEs and routinely inquire about the specific antineoplastic therapies that their ED patients with cancer are receiving. A random cortisol level (results readily available in most EDs) with interpretation taking the circadian rhythm and the current level of physiological stress into consideration can inform the differential diagnosis and whether further investigation of this potential irAE is warranted.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^114FRD79]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategies

The PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews was utilized for this study design. A systematic search was conducted through the electronic PUBMED, MEDLINE (Ebsco), and COCHRANE databases, from the beginning of the data until April 22, 2016. The search strategy included the following keywords: (1) "adrenal + fatigue"; (2) "adrenal + burnout"; (3) "adrenal + exhaustion"; (4) "adrenal" + "fatigue"; (5) "hypoadrenia"; (6) "cortisol" + "fatigue"; (7) "cortisol" + "burnout"; (8) "clinical" + "burnout"; (9) "cortisol" + "vitality"; (10) "adrenal" + "vitality"; and (11) "cortisol" + "exhaustion", where "a + b" means "a" and "b" together in the exact expression, and "a" +"b" means that both words needed to be contained in the article, but not necessarily together. Although the terms "adrenal + fatigue" and "adrenal" + "fatigue" were searched, as articles found using the first criteria were also found using the second criteria, further analysis were performed for the exact expression that matched with the disease. We also analyzed articles mentioned within identified studies whenever the alleged disorder, or a similar situation, were described (such as cortisol profile and exhaustion or fatigued patients).

Data extraction

All studies were evaluated by the two reviewers (F. A.C. and C.E.K.) after removal of duplicate articles, according to: (1) authorship, (2) journal, (3) publication date, (4) studied population, (5) definition of "fatigue", "exhaustion", and "burnout", (6) study design and methods, (7) analysis methods to assess adrenal axis, (8) results, (9) conclusions, and (10) study variables and bias.

### Cortisol deficiency in lenvatinib treatment of thyroid cancer: an underestimated common adverse event [^111G6GVg]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lenvatinib is an oral, multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), approved for the treatment of progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). In the study of (E7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid, the median progression-free survival was 18.3 months using lenvatinib, and 3.6 months using placebo. However, adverse events (AEs) occurred in almost all patients (97.3%) treated with lenvatinib.

Although supportive care may be an option for managing AEs, according to the severity of AEs, lenvatinib must be discontinued, interrupted, or administered at a reduced dosage, which decreases treatment efficacy. Fatigue is one of the most frequent AEs that lead to discontinuation of lenvatinib treatment.

In 2017, at our Endocrine Center, a patient with lenvatinib-related fatigue developed primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI); cortisone acetate (CA) therapy improved fatigue in the patient (unpublished observation). In 2019, Colombo et al. demonstrated PAI in four of the seven patients affected by RR-DTC during treatment with lenvatinib; CA relieved fatigue in them.

PAI is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. The majority of PAI symptoms are nonspecific, and diagnosis is frequently delayed. The simultaneous presence of undiagnosed PAI in patients with RR-DTC may have a strongly negative impact on the morbidity and mortality of patients treated with lenvatinib.

We evaluated the pituitary/adrenal axis before and during treatment to clarify the incidence, development, and time course of PAI during lenvatinib treatment. In addition, the possible impact of PAI on lenvatinib-related fatigue was evaluated.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^11349uVG]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

SITC guideline — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypophysitis is an uncommon but important immune-related adverse event (irAE) that can present with fatigue, nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and gonadotrophic deficiency; it most frequently manifests as secondary adrenal insufficiency due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency. It is vital that a brain scan, preferably a pituitary-protocol MRI, be conducted to distinguish hypophysitis from alternative causes such as brain metastases, and cortisol and ACTH testing may be inaccurate in patients receiving baseline steroids with dexamethasone premedication. Incidence is 1% with anti-PD-(L)1 ICIs and 4% with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs (0% and 2% grade ≥ 3, respectively), rising to 9%–11% with combination ICIs; in an analysis of 689 patients, the median time from ICI initiation to diagnosis was 76 days.

### Combination therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone does not improve symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study [^116n4UpX]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic fatigue syndrome has been associated with decreased function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Although neurally mediated hypotension occurs more frequently in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome than in controls, attempts to alleviate symptoms by administration of hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone have not been successful. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of combination therapy (5 mg/d of hydrocortisone and 50 microg/d of 9-alfa-fludrocortisone) on fatigue and well-being in chronic fatigue syndrome.

Methods

We performed a 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study in 100 patients who fulfilled the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Between-group differences (placebo minus treatment) were calculated on a 10-point visual analog scale.

Results

Eighty patients completed the 3 months of placebo and 3 months of active treatment in a double-blind fashion. There were no differences between treatment and placebo in patient-reported fatigue (mean difference, 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.3 to 0.6) or well-being (mean difference, -0.4; 95% CI: -1.0 to 0.1). There were also no between-group differences in fatigue measured with the Abbreviated Fatigue Questionnaire, the Short Form-36 Mental or Physical Factor scores, or in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.

Conclusion

Low-dose combination therapy of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone was not effective in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^114R7WKR]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can arise from a primary adrenal disorder, secondary to adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, or by suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone by exogenous glucocorticoid or opioid medications. Hallmark clinical features are unintentional weight loss, anorexia, postural hypotension, profound fatigue, muscle and abdominal pain, and hyponatraemia. Additionally, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually develop skin hyperpigmentation and crave salt. Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is usually delayed because the initial presentation is often non-specific; physician awareness must be improved to avoid adrenal crisis. Despite state-of-the-art steroid replacement therapy, reduced quality of life and work capacity, and increased mortality is reported in patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. Active and repeated patient education on managing adrenal insufficiency, including advice on how to increase medication during intercurrent illness, medical or dental procedures, and profound stress, is required to prevent adrenal crisis, which occurs in about 50% of patients with adrenal insufficiency after diagnosis. It is good practice for physicians to provide patients with a steroid card, parenteral hydrocortisone, and training for parenteral hydrocortisone administration, in case of vomiting or severe illness. New modes of glucocorticoid delivery could improve the quality of life in some patients with adrenal insufficiency, and further advances in oral and parenteral therapy will probably emerge in the next few years.

### Cancer-related fatigue – mechanisms, risk factors, and treatments [^11334TbC]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cancer-associated fatigue:

- **Definition**: Cancer-associated fatigue is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion associated with cancer and/or cancer treatment, which is non-proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cancer-associated fatigue is multifactorial and involves medical factors (comorbidities, medications, nutritional disorders), psychosocial factors (mood disturbance), behavioral factors (physical deconditioning), and biological factors (anemia, cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, 5-HT neurotransmitter dysregulation, and alterations in ATP and muscle metabolism).
- **Disease course**: Cancer-associated fatigue and exhaustion is often accompanied by pain, mood changes, sleep disturbances, lack of appetite, decreased activity, and reduced QoL and performance.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cancer-associated fatigue is associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with solid tumors.

### The neuroendocrinology of chronic fatigue syndrome [^116Uksqr]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a common and disabling problem; although most likely of biopsychosocial origin, the nature of the pathophysiological components remains unclear. There has been a wealth of interest in the endocrinology of this condition, which will be reviewed in this article. Most studied has been the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis; although the quality of many studies is poor, the overall balance of evidence points to reduced cortisol output in at least some patients, with some evidence that this is linked to symptom production or persistence. There is evidence for heightened negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor function and for impaired ACTH and cortisol responses to a variety of challenges. However, there is no evidence for a specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis. Given the many factors that may impinge on the HPA axis in CFS, such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, medication, and ongoing stress, it seems likely that HPA axis disturbance is heterogeneous and of multifactorial etiology in CFS. Studies assessing GH, dehydroepiandrostenedione and its sulfate, melatonin, leptin, and neuroendocrine-monoamine interactions are also reviewed. There is some evidence from these studies to suggest alterations of dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate function and abnormal serotonin function in CFS, but whether these changes are of functional importance remains unclear. To obtain a clearer assessment of the etiological and pathophysiological relevance of endocrine changes in CFS, it is suggested that more prospective cohort studies be undertaken in groups at high risk for CFS, that patients with CFS are followed up into recovery, and that multidimensional assessments are undertaken to unravel the influence of the various confounding factors on the observed endocrine changes in CFS.

### Cancer-related fatigue: persistent, pervasive, and problematic [^112NDDoe]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is commonly reported by patients with cancer before, during, and after treatment. It is a persistent sense of tiredness that interferes with function, is distressing, and requires monitoring and, possibly, treatment. Fatigue assessment requires objective measures and self-reports, such as Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue. Significant contributors to CRF include anemia, pain, insomnia, depressive symptoms, and elevated BMI. Elevated inflammatory cytokines, diabetes mellitus, cortisol, and cellular dysregulation have been associated with CRF. None is causal. Effective treatments include correction of other medical problems, especially anemia, cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, modafinil, and corticosteroids for short-term use.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117GbmF6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid replacement after surgery — We recommend that hypocortisolemic patients receive glucocorticoid replacement and education about adrenal insufficiency after surgical remission. We recommend follow-up morning cortisol and/or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests or insulin-induced hypoglycemia to assess the recovery of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with at least one intact adrenal gland, assuming there are no contraindications, and we recommend discontinuing glucocorticoid when the response to these test(s) is normal. We recommend re-evaluating the need for treatment of other pituitary hormone deficiencies in the postoperative period. After successful surgery, HPA axis recovery in adults occurs about 6–12 months after resecting ACTH-producing tumors and about 18 months after unilateral adrenalectomy; in a large pediatric series, recovery occurred at a mean of 12.6 ± 3.3 months after surgery. Bilateral adrenalectomy results in a need for lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Despite physiological replacement, many patients suffer glucocorticoid withdrawal with symptoms including anorexia, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, flu-like myalgias and arthralgias, lethargy, and skin desquamation, often feeling worse within a few days or weeks after successful surgery; recovery from the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome may take 1 year or longer.

### The pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue: current controversies [^113bsyHw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating cancer symptoms, and is associated with impaired quality of life. The exact pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is poorly understood, but in any individual, it is likely multifactorial and involves inter-related cytokine, muscular, neurotransmitter, and neuroendocrine changes. Underlying CRF mechanisms proposed include central and peripheral hypotheses. Central mechanisms include hypotheses about cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis disruption, circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin, and vagal afferent nerve function while peripheral mechanisms include hypotheses about adenosine triphosphate and muscle contractile properties. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidence from other conditions in which fatigue is characteristic. The purpose of this article is to provide a narrative review of the literature and present the current controversies in the pathophysiology of CRF, particularly in relation to central and peripheral hypotheses for CRF. An understanding of pathophysiology may facilitate direct and simple therapeutic interventions for those with cancer.

Programmed infusion of HC delivered in a circadian fashion to poorly controlled patients with CAH resulted in nearly normal ACTH and 17OHP, and in a phase 2 study, eight adults with classic CAH experienced significant reduction in adrenal androgens with significant improvement in quality of life parameters and fatigue following 6 months of subcutaneous HC infusion; however, parenteral HC hemisuccinate preparations are not designed or approved for subcutaneous administration, infusion site reactions occur, and pump management is complex, though this approach may have value for motivated patients, particularly those with rapid HC metabolism.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112iUoH9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric primary adrenal insufficiency — glucocorticoid therapy and monitoring — In children with PAI, we suggest avoiding synthetic, long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, prednisolone, dexamethasone), and we suggest monitoring glucocorticoid replacement by clinical assessment, including growth velocity, body weight, blood pressure, and energy levels; the daily hydrocortisone dose is usually divided into two or preferably three doses, with a typical daily dose of about 8 mg/m², and growth suppression is possible because dosages above 8 mg/m²/d may exceed the physiological range; in patients with CAH, glucocorticoid dosages exceeding 20 mg/m²/d in infants and 15 to 17 mg/m²/d in adolescents have been shown to result in loss of height and shorter adult stature; excessive weight gain with decreased height velocity or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate excessive glucocorticoid replacement, plasma ACTH is typically above the normal range and is not useful for routine monitoring, and inadequate weight gain, fatigue, anorexia, and hyperpigmentation suggest the need for increased medication dose.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcome.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — future research priorities include improving the evidence base and harmonizing cortisol testing. The document states that evidence for most recommendations is low or very low and calls for epidemiology research to define the true risk of adrenal clinical crisis and long-term consequences. It indicates that biomedical and psychosocial research to understand glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted to better differentiate it from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and that more research is needed to identify glucocorticoids with less hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and to explore therapeutic strategies such as concurrent HPA axis stimulation to prevent suppression. For diagnostics, it notes a need for harmonization of cortisol assays and asks for cut-off values to be established using mass spectrometry and for clinical care to adapt this measurement for routine cortisol measurements.

### Addison disease: early detection and treatment principles [^113uWUxQ]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison disease, has many causes, the most common of which is autoimmune adrenalitis. Autoimmune adrenalitis results from destruction of the adrenal cortex, which leads to deficiencies in glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens. In the United States and Western Europe, the estimated prevalence of Addison disease is one in 20,000 persons; therefore, a high clinical suspicion is needed to avoid misdiagnosing a life-threatening adrenal crisis (i.e., shock, hypotension, and volume depletion). The clinical manifestations before an adrenal crisis are subtle and can include hyperpigmentation, fatigue, anorexia, orthostasis, nausea, muscle and joint pain, and salt craving. Cortisol levels decrease and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels increase. When clinically suspected, patients should undergo a cosyntropin stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency requires replacement of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. During times of stress (e.g., illness, invasive surgical procedures), stress-dose glucocorticoids are required because destruction of the adrenal glands prevents an adequate physiologic response. Management of primary adrenal insufficiency or autoimmune adrenalitis requires vigilance for concomitant autoimmune diseases; up to 50% of patients develop another autoimmune disorder during their lifetime.

### The relationship between sleep, fatigue and quality of life in young adults with autoimmune Addison's disease [^112C5SNF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Autoimmune Addison′s disease (AAD), the most common form of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), results from autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands and necessitates lifelong glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy. While lifesaving, current GC regimens fail to replicate natural cortisol rhythmicity, causing predictable periods of infra‐ and supra‐physiological cortisol levels, particularly overnight and before the morning dose. Despite treatment adherence, patients with AAD report persistent symptoms including poor sleep, fatigue, reduced vitality, depressive symptoms, and impaired physical and mental health, ultimately lowering health‐related quality of life (HRQoL).

Sleep is a complex biological process tightly synchronized with the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis, and circadian HPA disruption has been associated with sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and fatigue. Cortisol plays a vital role in maintaining sleep architecture by regulating the timing, transitions and duration of different sleep stages. These processes rely on precisely regulated cortisol levels, with natural oscillations being essential for healthy sleep.

Although cortisol′s impact on complex brain functions is well established, its influence on sleep, neurobiology, and wellbeing in AAD remains unclear. A few studies have assessed sleep impairments in PAI using actigraphy, EEG, sleep diaries, and self‐questionnaires. However, findings are inconsistent and often limited by small samples (3–60 patients), with reported outcomes varying from general sleep disruptions and reduced efficiency to no AAD‐specific abnormalities. Given the rarity of the disease, cohorts encompass heterogeneous PAI populations with varying aetiologies and comorbidities, complicating isolation of AAD‐specific effects. Larger studies (20–60 patients) typically focus on middle‐aged adults (mean age 45–50 years), while research on younger patients with AAD is scarce. Despite the well‐established relationship between sleep, fatigue and HRQoL, few studies have directly examined their interplay in AAD.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between sleep, fatigue and HRQoL in a cohort of young adults with AAD and few comorbidities. Guided by the theoretical framework where (a) cortisol imbalances disrupt sleep, and (b) sleep disturbances contribute to fatigue and impaired HRQoL, we hypothesized that poor sleep may serve as a biological mechanism partially mediating the negative impact of AAD on wellbeing. Using self‐reported data on sleep, fatigue and HRQoL, we explored these interrelated factors. As the largest study to date on this topic, we focused on a younger cohort managing disease‐related challenges alongside education, work, and family life – highlighting the need to address sleep disturbances to support HRQoL in this population.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^11578iuE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Methods used to evaluate fatigue in the general study population

Some authors utilized more than one method to compare the different patients and were included in multiple groups. A summary of all the methods used to assess fatigue, and their results, is shown in Table 2. Among the 58 studies, 27 (46.6%) utilized the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) to assess the HPA axis. This method is based on previous studies that indicate cortisol levels rise by 50% on average within 30 min of waking as a physiological response to stay alert, with a blunted CAR resulting in fatigue symptoms. For the CAR, salivary cortisol is collected immediately on waking (t = 0) and again 30 min later (t = 30), and the difference (delta cortisol) between the two measurements are analyzed. Among the 27 studies that employed CAR, fourteen (51.9%) showed a normal response, nine (23.3%) had a diminished delta cortisol, and four (14.8%) demonstrated an increased delta cortisol.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^115rtjWZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Adrenal size could be considered another marker of adrenal activity, as hypertrophic/hyperplastic adrenal glands could be the result of an ACTH over-stimulation by the pituitary, as seen in subjects exposed to chronic stress, whereas a diminished or atrophic gland may reflect adrenal insufficiency at any level of the HPA axis. However, not a single study could be identified in which the adrenal size has been checked in fatigued or exhausted patients. Similarly, although DHEA-S could also be a potential marker for adrenal atrophy or dysfunction, is still uncertain whether it plays any pathophysiological role in fatigue. Finally, none of the abovementioned methods were accurate markers of fatigue, nor could they be correlated with the HPA axis dysfunction as an etiology of fatigue.

It is also important to note that once adrenal impairment is confirmed using any of these tests, the etiology should also be elucidated. As the HPA axis can be affected by several chronic and/or metabolic disorders, other primary conditions must be excluded before intrinsic disorders of the HPA axis are deemed responsible. Typical differential diagnosis of "adrenal fatigue" and related states are: (1) sleep obstructive apnea syndrome; (2) adrenal insufficiency; (3) mental illnesses; (4) excessive working (overwork); (5) night-shift workers; (6) other hormonal deficiencies; (7) liver and kidney dysfunctions; (8) heart conditions; (9) chronic pulmonary obstructive disease; (10) autoimmune diseases.

Although conflicting data were reported, patients with CFS tend to have a normal cortisol profile, and the abnormalities found can be typically be explained by a poor quality sleeping patterns. Therefore, health providers should not be concerned about adrenal function in CFS subjects once they had been already excluded to other conditions prior to the diagnosis of CFS. Similarly, studies investigating patients with the burnout syndrome were greatly inconsistent So far, HPA axis tests should not be used as markers for burnout syndrome by health practitioners. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the use of HPA axis tests as markers for fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases, which tend to demonstrate inconsistent findings, whereas studies that were performed in breast cancer subjects tended to show depletion of cortisol levels; however, studies in breast cancer were performed while administering chemotherapy, which can introduce a confounding bias.

Therefore, based on our current knowledge, cortisol tests should not yet be used in clinical practice for examining any condition, except if adrenal impairment is suspected. Moreover, glucocorticoid therapy should be avoided in patients, as it can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis, even in low doses.

### Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in chronic fatigue syndrome, and the effects of low-dose hydrocortisone therapy [^112ewwpm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

These neuroendocrine studies were part of a series of studies testing the hypotheses that 1) there may be reduced activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in chronic fatigue syndrome and 2) low-dose augmentation with hydrocortisone therapy would improve the core symptoms. We measured ACTH and cortisol responses to human CRH, the insulin stress test, and D-fenfluramine in 37 medication-free patients with CDC-defined chronic fatigue syndrome but no comorbid psychiatric disorders and 28 healthy controls. We also measured 24-h urinary free cortisol in both groups. All patients (n = 37) had a pituitary challenge test (human CRH) and a hypothalamic challenge test [either the insulin stress test (n = 16) or D-fenfluramine (n = 21)]. Baseline cortisol concentrations were significantly raised in the chronic fatigue syndrome group for the human CRH test only. Baseline ACTH concentrations did not differ between groups for any test. ACTH responses to human CRH, the insulin stress test, and D- fenfluramine were similar for patient and control groups. Cortisol responses to the insulin stress test did not differ between groups, but there was a trend for cortisol responses both to human CRH and D-fenfluramine to be lower in the chronic fatigue syndrome group. These differences were significant when ACTH responses were controlled. Urinary free cortisol levels were lower in the chronic fatigue syndrome group compared with the healthy group. These results indicate that ACTH responses to pituitary and hypothalamic challenges are intact in chronic fatigue syndrome and do not support previous findings of reduced central responses in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or the hypothesis of abnormal CRH secretion in chronic fatigue syndrome. These data further suggest that the hypocortisolism found in chronic fatigue syndrome may be secondary to reduced adrenal gland output. Thirty-two patients were treated with a low-dose hydrocortisone regime in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, with 28 days on each treatment. They underwent repeated 24-h urinary free cortisol collections, a human CRH test, and an insulin stress test after both active and placebo arms of treatment. Looking at all subjects, 24-h urinary free cortisol was higher after active compared with placebo treatments, but 0900-h cortisol levels and the ACTH and cortisol responses to human CRH and the insulin stress test did not differ. However, a differential effect was seen in those patients who responded to active treatment (defined as a reduction in fatigue score to the median population level or less). In this group, there was a significant increase in the cortisol response to human CRH, which reversed the previously observed blunted responses seen in these patients. We conclude that the improvement in fatigue seen in some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome during hydrocortisone treatment is accompanied by a reversal of the blunted cortisol responses to human CRH.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome with osilodrostat: practical applications of recent studies with case examples [^116TdFGg]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency vs steroid withdrawal

Another challenge related to dose titration is differentiating glucocorticoid withdrawal vs AI, as both are conditions that can be observed along the same clinical continuum with overlapping symptoms (e.g. fatigue, lack of energy, nausea, loss of appetite, weight loss, myalgia, and abdominal pain). Glucocorticoid withdrawal (i.e. symptoms associated with reduction in cortisol levels after pathological elevation for a prolonged period of time) is seen in many patients treated effectively for CS with either surgery or medication. Although the features of AI are similar to those of steroid withdrawal, AI is usually diagnosed on the basis of symptoms that may additionally include dizziness associated with lower blood pressure or postural vital signs, hypoglycemia, and very low morning cortisol values. Notably, symptoms of AI are usually, but not always, worse than steroid withdrawal symptoms. Hypotension and hypoglycemia can be particularly helpful for distinguishing these two conditions, as they are only observed in AI. In the example case study, the patient was not hypotensive or hypoglycemic, but a low morning cortisol level confirmed AI. When it is difficult to determine whether a patient has steroid withdrawal vs mild AI, down-titration of osilodrostat for a few days may improve symptoms and clinical status while follow-up biochemical evaluation is performed. Alternatively, if the symptoms are moderate to severe, interfering with the patients' daily activities, discontinuation of osilodrostat and initiation of supplemental glucocorticoid replacement is advised. Supplemental glucocorticoids are always advised if suspicion for AI is high, while awaiting biochemical confirmation. As this case illustrates, monitoring patients for symptoms of AI during times of stress (i.e. fever, infection, physical stress/acute illness) is warranted because hypocortisolism can occur at any time during treatment with osilodrostat and particularly when there would normally have been HPA axis activation.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^11352xqb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

In this review, we also examined whether cortisol markers can be used to assess cortisol impairment. The results of our review indicate that the three major tests (CAR, DAC and SCR) used to identify the underlying causes of the fatigue/exhaustion state failed to do so, since they were unable to demonstrate significant differences or proper causality. CAR and DAC frequently showed inconsistent results in studies that used heterogeneous groups of subjects. CAR and DAC are not necessarily indicatives of the etiology and pathogenesis of the fatigue status, since both can be consequences of other disorders, such as sleep disturbances. Indeed, a recent study was the first to use CAR as a marker of improvement of burnout syndrome, which reinforces the use of this method for monitoring the consequences of fatigue states, but not for its etiology.

With regards to the SCR, the results may be misleading if they are not analyzed together with the total 24 h cortisol release. This is because a non-physiological blunted rhythm can be due either to an impairment of the lowering cortisol trend throughout the day or due to a lower morning cortisol level. Despite this, studies that evaluated total 24 h cortisol by measuring serial salivary cortisol levels also showed conflicting findings. Our systematic review corroborates another systematic review that shows inconsistency regarding measuring methods among across different randomized controlled trials. Similarly, baseline MSC and NSC were poor markers of fatigue status as it failed to reveal any differences in burnout/exhaustion/fatigue patients compared to healthy subjects.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^116CcXQt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review made by endocrinologists to examine a possible correlation between the HPA axis and a purported "adrenal fatigue" and other conditions associated with fatigue, exhaustion or burnout. So far, there is no proof or demonstration of the existence of "AF". While a significant number of the reported studies showed differences between the healthy and fatigued groups, important methodological issues and confounding factors were apparent. Two concluding remarks emerge from this systematic review: (1) the results of previous studies were contradictory using all the methods for assessing fatigue and the HPA axis, and (2) the most appropriate methods to assess the HPA axis were not used to evaluate fatigue. Therefore, "AF" requires further investigation by those who claim for its existence.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^115SknBX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a pituitary peptide hormone that stimulates cortisol production by the adrenocortical zona fasciculata. Elevated ACTH occurs early in primary adrenal insufficiency, whereas inappropriate (normal) ACTH levels in the presence of low serum cortisol are found in secondary adrenal failure. Although, normal ACTH levels with normal cortisol levels does not exclude the possibility of relative adrenocortical failure. Six (10.3%) studies employed the morning ACTH levels to compare fatigued and non-fatigued patients; no significant differences for ACTH, as well as for cortisol, were found in five studies (83.3%), meanwhile one showed elevated ACTH levels in burnout patients (16.7%).

On the other hand, three studies (5.2%) used the low-dose cosyntropin (a synthetic 1–24 ACTH) stimulation test (CST), in which 1 μg of cosyntropin is used instead of the classic 250 μg dose, based on the premise that the CST is more accurate and sensitive for verifying the adrenocortical cortisol reserve, even though most findings indicate that both doses have similar accuracy. Surprisingly, one of three (33.3%) studies disclosed a paradoxically higher cortisol increase compared to controls, while in two (66.7%) lower levels were observed. Conversely, impaired cortisol and ACTH responses was observed in the fatigued group in a single study in which corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) was used to stimulate the HPA axis.

### Does hypocortisolism predict a poor response to cognitive behavioural therapy in chronic fatigue syndrome? [^115gJFAS]. Psychological Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have mild hypocortisolism. The clinical significance of this is unclear. We aimed to determine whether hypocortisolism exerted any effect on the response of CFS to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

Method

We measured 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) in 84 patients with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined CFS (of whom 64 were free from psychotropic medication) who then received CBT in a specialist, tertiary out-patient clinic as part of their usual clinical care. We also measured salivary cortisol output from 0800 to 2000 h in a subsample of 56 psychotropic medication-free patients.

Results

Overall, 39% of patients responded to CBT after 6 months of treatment. Lower 24-h UFC output was associated with a poorer response to CBT but only in psychotropic medication-free patients. A flattened diurnal profile of salivary cortisol was also associated with a poor response to CBT.

Conclusions

Low cortisol is of clinical relevance in CFS, as it is associated with a poorer response to CBT. Hypocortisolism could be one of several maintaining factors that interact in the persistence of CFS.

### A phase 2 study of continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion in adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113tvhtQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) management remains challenging, given that supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses are often needed to optimally suppress the ACTH-driven adrenal androgen overproduction.

Objective

This study sought to approximate physiologic cortisol secretion via continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) and evaluate the safety and efficacy of CSHI in patients with difficult-to-treat CAH.

Design

Eight adult patients with classic CAH participated in a single-center open-label phase I-II study comparing CSHI to conventional oral glucocorticoid treatment. All patients had elevated adrenal steroids and one or more comorbidities at study entry. Assessment while receiving conventional therapy at baseline and 6 months following CSHI included: 24-hour hormonal sampling, metabolic and radiologic evaluation, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL), and fatigue questionnaires.

Main Outcome Measures

The ability of CSHI to approximate physiologic cortisol secretion and the percent of patients with 0700-hour 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) ≤ 1200 ng/dL was measured.

Results

CSHI approximated physiologic cortisol secretion. Compared with baseline, 6 months of CSHI resulted in decreased 0700-hour and 24-hour area under the curve 17-OHP, androstenedione, ACTH, and progesterone, increased osteocalcin, c-telopeptide and lean mass, and improved HRQoL (and SF-36 Vitality Score), and fatigue. One of three amenorrheic women resumed menses. One man had reduction of testicular adrenal rest tissue.

Conclusions

CSHI is a safe and well-tolerated modality of cortisol replacement that effectively approximates physiologic cortisol secretion in patients with classic CAH poorly controlled on conventional therapy. Improved adrenal steroid control and positive effects on HRQoL suggest that CSHI should be considered a treatment option for classic CAH. The long-term effect on established comorbidities requires further study.

### Severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a melanoma patient treated with ipilimumab + nivolumab [^115vAa5T]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

As anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies lead to immune activation, inflammatory effects can occur in any organ system. The majority of patients on single-agent immunotherapy do not experience any side effects and the most common side effects are rash and mild fatigue, likely related to increased circulating cytokines. When specific immune-related toxicity occurs, frequently affected systems include the endocrine organs, gastrointestinal tract, integument, and lungs. Thus, in additional to history and physical exam, thyroid function studies, complete blood counts, and metabolic panels including liver function are generally checked at each treatment and at intervals of 6 to 12 weeks for the first 6 months after finishing treatment, when the risk of toxicity is highest. In patients with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, evaluation of adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin, testosterone in men, and estradiol in women is typically pursued. Treatment with corticosteroids regimens, such as intravenous methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg per day for 3–5 days, followed by prednisone, 1–2 mg/kg per day gradually tapered over 4 weeks can reverse the vast majority of toxic manifestations of these drugs; prolonged tapers are recommended as shorter tapers can lead to a recurrence of symptoms or adrenal crisis. Generally, systemic corticosteroids are used only for grade 3 to 4 or prolonged grade 2 immune-related side effects.

### The approach to the adult with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency [^1151VFKR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, and hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, with an open eye for other differential diagnostic possibilities. Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids requires careful monitoring. However, current replacement strategies still require optimization as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will have to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

No confirmed methods of clinical screening for AF are available. Indeed, the popular questionnaire developed by Dr. Wilson and published in the first book exclusively dedicated to the description of this supposedly disease has not been cited in any indexed databases. Another theory, the "Thompson cortisol hypothesis", suggests that cortisol is responsible for yawning and fatigue; however, again, no studies that tested this theory have been published in indexed journals. Validated surveys have been used in studies that investigate fatigue states, but they were not correlated with proper cortisol assessment methods. The TSST is the only survey to have enough credibility to be officially tested and standardized as a trigger of stress.

Functional tests are the only methods to assess adrenal cortisol production endorsed by endocrinology societies. Although, the ITT is considered the gold standard test to evaluate the entire HPA axis, neither the ITT (or the similar LPS stimulation test) was performed in any studies investigating the correlation between fatigue states and adrenocortical function. Moreover, we generally found conflicting data using most of the functional tests when trying to differentiate exhausted, fatigued, and burnout individuals from healthy patients. For example, using the low-dose CST, we found an unexpected increase in cortisol levels in fatigued subjects in the selected studies. This may have been perhaps the result of a relative secondary adrenal insufficiency, which leads to an amplified adrenal cortisol response due to an upregulation of ACTH receptors, but this sounds unjustifiable since the lack of continuous stimulation of the adrenal cortices would cause atrophy, rendering them non-responsive to a low- (and even high) dose of cosyntropin stimulation in the long run. Regardless of the theoretical explanation, CST has shown to be not a good marker of fatigue. Similarly, ACTH levels were also poorly studied and did not show significant correlations in most fatigued subjects. In addition, despite its lack of standardization, the DST was performed in nine studies, but conflicting results invalidated attempts to establish this as a new marker for fatigue states. Moreover, the 24 h-UFC has been shown to be so far inaccurate for investigation of adrenal impairment. Findings were also contradictory in the six studies that calculated cortisol AUC as well as in the four studies that performed MAUC. Therefore, the above methods cannot be used to differentiate fatigued from non-fatigued individuals.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111TnnR9]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid therapy, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to administer stress dose coverage in case of being exposed stress in patients with current or recent corticosteroid use who have not undergone biochemical testing to rule out corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### Primary adrenal insufficiency during lenvatinib or vandetanib and improvement of fatigue after cortisone acetate therapy [^1132zRcY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lenvatinib and vandetanib, are often used to treat advanced radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC) and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), respectively. Fatigue is a common adverse event during treatment with these and other TKIs and a common cause of drug discontinuation or dosage reduction.

Cases Description

We evaluated the basal and stimulated adrenal function in 12 patients with advanced RAI-R DTC and MTC treated with lenvatinib or vandetanib, respectively. Ten patients complaining of fatigue showed a progressive ACTH increase with normal cortisol levels. Moreover, six of 10 patients had a blunted cortisol response after ACTH stimulation, thus confirming the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). The causal relationship between TKIs and PAI onset was also demonstrated by the repeated testing of adrenal function before and during treatment. Patients with PAI received cortisone acetate replacement therapy, with a substantial and prompt improvement in the degree of fatigue, as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, thus supporting the major impact of impaired adrenal function in the genesis of this adverse event.

Conclusions

We show that the occurrence of PAI may be a common cause of fatigue during lenvatinib and vandetanib treatment, and we therefore recommend testing adrenal function for a prompt start of replacement therapy to avoid treatment discontinuation, dosage reduction, and potentially severe PAI complications.

### Pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction induced by tislelizumab immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: a case series and literature review [^114ipjoF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

During immunotherapy, irAEs in the endocrine system are common. However, pituitary inflammation is relatively rare, especially in patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 alone. In RATIONALE-303/307, not detail of pituitary inflammation reported. It is more common in patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, particularly in those receiving ipilimumab, and may be associated with high CTLA-4 expression in the pituitary. The secretion of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal cortex is vital for the body's metabolism, immune function, and water-electrolyte balance. Early detection of adrenal crisis is clinically important if adrenal cortical insufficiency occurs.

Among the three patients, the first patient received first-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, the second patient received third-line monotherapy immunotherapy, and the third patient received perioperative immunotherapy as neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant treatment. The median time from the start of immunotherapy was 7 cycles, and the median number of immunotherapy cycles was seven. Previous reports suggest that pituitary inflammation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors typically occurs after seven cycles of treatment, which is consistent with our reports. Laboratory tests indicated decreased morning cortisol and ACTH levels in all three patients, but only the third patient exhibited clinical symptoms of fatigue, anorexia, and vomiting. Case 3 suffered vomiting and weight loss, which were more substantial than in the other two cases. However, in Case 3, serum cortisol decreased subclinical levels. We considered to be related to tumor stage and individual differences.

Clinical symptoms of anti-PD-1-related pituitary inflammation often manifest as nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and blurred vision. These irAEs tend to involve the adrenal cortex axis. Regular monitoring of adrenal cortex-related hormones is necessary for patients with atypical clinical symptoms. If cortisol and ACTH levels decrease, along with thyroid hormone or sex hormone levels, the possibility of pituitary inflammation should be considered. Immune-related pituitary inflammation can have varying effects on the damage and recovery of the adrenal axis, thyroid axis, and gonadal axis. Patients with hormone deficiency caused by adrenal axis damage often have difficulty recovering. Therefore, regular monitoring of hormone levels is crucial, and if necessary, pituitary MRI should be performed to evaluate pituitary lesions. Immunotherapy was discontinued in all three patients, and hormone replacement therapy was initiated.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^117D9rXR]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The circadian rhythm of cortisol is important for health in humans, and there is evidence of deleterious effect when this rhythm is disrupted. Many of the symptoms that patients with adrenal insufficiency complain of such as fatigue, sleep disturbance and poor concentration are seen when the cortisol circadian rhythm is disrupted in jetlag. It is therefore a reasonable hypothesis that replacing cortisol in a circadian manner should be superior to current therapy. This should be no less true in a paediatric than adult population and the sleep cycle may be more important in a developing individual than adult. Improvements in biochemical, auxological and quality-of-life measures were reported in a 12-month study of patients with Addison's disease treated with Plenadren. In the only double-blind study of hydrocortisone infusion, there was no clear impact on patients' well-being despite this treatment offering the benefit of a physiological early morning rise in cortisol and a smoother cortisol profile; however, this was a small group of patients with good baseline quality of life and the study may have been underpowered to detect a change. In CAH, there is a need for circadian therapy to suppress the overnight ACTH drive and reduce androgen production. This is demonstrated by case studies of hydrocortisone infusions in CAH and a phase II study of Chronocort. Future studies will need to demonstrate clinical benefit associated with improved biochemical control of CAH. Cortisol and cortisone concentrations in saliva and cortisol concentrations in dried blood spots are reported to be robust measures of blood cortisol concentrations, and are particularly attractive for the study of new hydrocortisone formulations in children. However, the relationship between cortisol profiles and medium-term and long-term health outcomes is likely to be complex. It is important to note that the majority of data regarding physiological glucocorticoid replacement is from adult patients and there is a need for further studies in paediatrics to better understand the needs of paediatric patients with adrenal insufficiency.

Table 2
Assessed methods and results of all selected studies (N = 58)

Legends: (*): DAC direct awakening cortisol, CAR cortisol awakening response, SCR salivary cortisol rhythm, MSC morning serum (& salivary) cortisol, NSC night salivary cortisol, AUC area under-the-curve (Estimated Cortisol Release), DST dexamethasone suppression test, DHEA - S dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone, MST mental stress test, UFC 24 h-urinary free cortisol, CST cosyntropin stimulation test, MAUC morning area under-the-curve (morning estimated cortisol release), CRH corticotropin releasing hormone, TCM total urinary cortisol metabolites, CRST corticotropin releasing stimulation test (?), OGTT oral glucose tolerance test

Another method that became widely used to evaluate exhaustion/burnout/fatigue states is the salivary cortisol rhythm (SCR), which evaluates the change in cortisol levels between morning, afternoon, and late night. A total of 26 studies evaluated SCR (44.8%). Some heterogeneity in the method was found between studies, but in general, salivary cortisol was collected at 8 AM, 4 PM, and 10–11 PM. While the SCR is considered as another fatigue marker, like the CAR, there is no justification for considering this as an etiology for "adrenal fatigue". Sixteen (61.5%) studies showed no difference between fatigued and control patients, whereas seven (26.9%) demonstrated an impaired decrease in the circadian SCR. The remaining three (11.6%) studies disclosed a more pronounced decrease in cortisol level.

### Is physiological glucocorticoid replacement important in children? [^117Pk7MJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Cortisol has a distinct circadian rhythm with low concentrations at night, rising in the early hours of the morning, peaking on waking and declining over the day to low concentrations in the evening. Loss of this circadian rhythm, as seen in jetlag and shift work, is associated with fatigue in the short term and diabetes and obesity in the medium to long term. Patients with adrenal insufficiency on current glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone have unphysiological cortisol concentrations being low on waking and high after each dose of hydrocortisone. Patients with adrenal insufficiency complain of fatigue, a poor quality of life and there is evidence of poor health outcomes including obesity potentially related to glucocorticoid replacement. New technologies are being developed that deliver more physiological glucocorticoid replacement including hydrocortisone by subcutaneous pump, Plenadren, a once-daily modified-release hydrocortisone and Chronocort, a delayed and sustained absorption hydrocortisone formulation that replicates the overnight profile of cortisol. In this review, we summarise the evidence regarding physiological glucocorticoid replacement with a focus on relevance to paediatrics.

### Pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction induced by tislelizumab immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: a case series and literature review [^117AdLPy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Combined with the case series and literature review, the irAE of pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction was relatively rare in the treatment of anti-PD-1, and the symptoms were usually non-specific manifestations, e.g. nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. Considering that the asymptomatic hypophysitis may be life-threatening, when laboratory tests showed decreased morning cortisol and ACTH levels, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms, the possibility of pituitary inflammation should be considered. We recommend that regular laboratory test results should be conducted during every cycle from the initiation of immune treatment to early detect of adrenal cortex dysfunction. Hormone replacement therapy may be the best treatment for pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction.

Results

Study selection

In total, 3,470 articles were identified. A summary of the study selection is shown in Fig. 1. The search for "adrenal" + "burnout" yielded 56 studies; "adrenal" + "exhaustion" yielded 446 articles; "adrenal" + "fatigue" yielded 1,353 articles; "fatigue" + "cortisol" yielded 1,128 articles; "cortisol" + "burnout" yielded 102 articles; "cortisol" + "vitality" yielded 37 articles; "adrenal" + "vitality" yielded 53 articles; "hypoadrenia" yielded 9 articles articles ("hypoadrenocorticism" yielded 1,302 articles but is used to refer to hypocortisolism in animals, and therefore, was not included here); and "cortisol" + "exhaustion" yielded 286 articles. Twelve studies were excluded because they were written in languages other than English, 1,989 were excluded because there was no relation with the purpose of the systematic review, whereas 905 articles of interest were duplicates. Of the 564 remaining studies, 504 had only descriptive characteristics or contained results already presented in another study (in which tests were performed), and therefore were excluded. Two studies were excluded because despite of the correlation between cortisol profile and burnout or multiple sclerosis, they did not perform correlation between fatigue and cortisol, but other aspects, as depression and pain. For the systematic review, we analyzed all the included and not excluded studies, which represent a total of 58 articles (1.67% of the original search) (Table 1).

### Mifepristone [^116QCDiW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Adrenal Insufficiency

Patients receiving mifepristone may experience adrenal insufficiency. Because serum cortisol levels remain elevated and may even increase during treatment with mifepristone, serum cortisol levels do not provide an accurate assessment of hypoadrenalism in patients receiving mifepristone. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, including weakness, nausea, increased fatigue, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, discontinue treatment with mifepristone immediately and administer glucocorticoids without delay. High doses of supplemental glucocorticoids may be needed to overcome the glucocorticoid receptor blockade produced by mifepristone. Factors considered in deciding on the duration of glucocorticoid treatment should include the long half-life of mifepristone (85 hours).

Treatment with mifepristone at a lower dose can be resumed after resolution of adrenal insufficiency. Patients should also be evaluated for precipitating causes of hypoadrenalism (infection, trauma, etc.).

5.2 Hypokalemia

In a study of patients with Cushing's syndrome, hypokalemia was observed in 44% of subjects during treatment with mifepristone. Hypokalemia should be corrected prior to initiating mifepristone. During mifepristone administration, serum potassium should be measured 1 to 2 weeks after starting or increasing the dose of mifepristone and periodically thereafter. Hypokalemia can occur at any time during mifepristone treatment. Mifepristone-induced hypokalemia should be treated with intravenous or oral potassium supplementation based on event severity. If hypokalemia persists in spite of potassium supplementation, consider adding mineralocorticoid antagonists.

5.3 Vaginal Bleeding and Endometrial Changes

Being an antagonist of the progesterone receptor, mifepristone promotes unopposed endometrial proliferation that may result in endometrium thickening, cystic dilatation of endometrial glands, and vaginal bleeding. Mifepristone should be used with caution in women who have hemorrhagic disorders or are receiving concurrent anticoagulant therapy. Women who experience vaginal bleeding during mifepristone treatment should be referred to a gynecologist for further evaluation.

### Salivary cortisol output before and after cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome [^116KUf5L]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There is evidence that patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have mild hypocortisolism. One theory about the aetiology of this hypocortisolism is that it occurs late in the course of CFS via factors such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, chronic stress and deconditioning. We aimed to determine whether therapy aimed at reversing these factors — cognitive behavioural therapy for CFS — could increase cortisol output in CFS.

Methods

We measured diurnal salivary cortisol output between 0800 and 2000 h before and after 15 sessions (or 6 months) of CBT in 41 patients with CDC-defined CFS attending a specialist, tertiary outpatient clinic.

Results

There was a significant clinical response to CBT, and a significant rise in salivary cortisol output after CBT.

Limitations

We were unable to control for the passage of time using a non-treated CFS group.

Conclusions

Hypocortisolism in CFS is potentially reversible by CBT. Given previous suggestions that lowered cortisol may be a maintaining factor in CFS, CBT offers a potential way to address this.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1178EJPP]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112RBXX5]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

### The link between multiple sclerosis and depression [^117QBLbo]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Depression — be it a formal diagnosis based on consensus clinical criteria, or a collection of symptoms revealed by a self-report rating scale — is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and adds substantially to the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. This Review discusses the prevalence and epidemiology of depression in patients with MS, before covering aetiological factors, including genetics, brain pathology, immunological changes, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and psychosocial influences. Treatment options such as antidepressant drugs, cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, exercise and electroconvulsive therapy are also reviewed in the context of MS-related depression. Frequent comorbid conditions, namely pain, fatigue, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction and alcohol use, are also summarized. The article then explores three key challenges facing researchers and clinicians: what is the optimal way to define depression in the context of diseases such as MS, in which the psychiatric and neurological symptoms overlap; how can current knowledge about the biological and psychological underpinnings of MS-related depression be used to boost the validity of this construct; and can intervention be made more effective through use of combination therapies with additive or synergistic effects, which might exceed the modest benefits derived from their individual components?

### Child with suspected adrenal insufficiency [^1177pEWz]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected adrenal insufficiency — key clinical features and initial evaluation are outlined as follows: Symptoms and signs include fatigue, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, salt craving, morning headaches, hyperpigmentation of gums, palmar creases, scars, elbows, areolae, scrotum, sun UN-exposed areas, dizziness, dehydration, hypoglycemia with pallor, seizures/LOC and moodiness, and orthostatic hypotension; family history items listed are autoimmune diseases and adrenal disease. Initial laboratory and/or radiologic work-up can include blood tests for sodium, potassium, glucose, cortisol (7–8 am), ACTH, and renin. Other tests to consider after consultation with Pediatric Endocrinologist include adrenal autoantibodies (anti-CYP11 [21-hydroxylase Ab] and anti-cortex adrenal Ab), ACTH stimulation test, and very long chain fatty acids. When to refer is stated as nearly always urgent referral and treatment needed. Items useful for consultation include previous growth data/growth charts, pertinent medical records, and recent laboratory and radiologic studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111SaswP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement is suggested as a trial in women with PAI who have low libido, depressive symptoms, and/or low energy levels despite otherwise optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. We suggest an initial period of 6 months of DHEA replacement, and if the patient does not report a sustained, beneficial effect after 6 months, the DHEA should be discontinued; we suggest monitoring by measuring morning serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels aiming at the midnormal range before the daily dose. Evidence notes that serum DHEAS concentrations physiologically peak between ages 20 and 30 years, a single oral dose of DHEA has been shown to restore circulating levels of androgen precursors and androgens back to the normal range, and a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo controls of DHEA treatment have not shown any substantial clinical benefit, suggesting that the current evidence is insufficient to support routine use of DHEA in women with adrenal insufficiency.

### Chronic fatigue in cancer survivorship: psychiatry versus oncology or psychiatry with oncology? [^116WniMu]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Biological Mechanisms

The etiology of CRF is multifactorial, involving complex interactions between biological and non -biological psychosocial processes. A leading hypothesis implicates persistent immune activation and inflammation triggered by cancer and its treatment. Survivors with CRF often exhibit elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) and C-reactive protein, supporting an "inflammatory signature" in fatigue. These cytokines can signal the central nervous system to induce fatigue and sickness behavior, a pathway analogous to mechanisms seen in chronic inflammatory and infectious conditions.

Literature suggests a conceptual model in which cancer and its treatments initiate an inflammatory cascade that leads to neurotransmitter alterations (notably in dopaminergic pathways) and fatigue​. More specifically, host factors such as genetic predispositions (e.g. cytokine gene polymorphisms), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, and comorbid medical conditions can modulate this inflammation-fatigue pathway​. For instance, blunted HPA axis responsiveness or mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to fatigue by impairing stress tolerance and cellular energy production. Additionally, cancer treatments can produce direct physiologic deficits – for example, chemotherapy-induced anaemia or thyroid dysfunction – which exacerbate fatigue. Reversible medical contributors such as anaemia and endocrine disorders should be evaluated in any survivor reporting significant fatigue​. Figure 1 illustrates this model.

Beyond inflammation, other biological mechanisms have been proposed. Dysregulation of the HPA axis (e.g. abnormal cortisol rhythms or glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) has been observed in fatigued survivors. Mitochondrial DNA damage and impaired ATP synthesis in skeletal muscle have also been reported, suggesting a component of cellular energy depletion in CRF. Autonomous dysregulation can also account for some of the perceived or objective disturbances seen by those patients. Additionally, premature ovarian failure or androgen deprivation (from cancer therapies) can produce hormonal changes associated with fatigue – for example, abrupt menopause in women or testosterone deficiency in men may precipitate lethargy and muscle weakness. These diverse biological factors are not mutually exclusive; they likely interact in contributing to an individual patient's fatigue.

Conceptual model linking cancer and cancer treatments to inflammation and fatigue, with potential mediating pathways and host factors (adapted with permission from Bower et al. 2011). Pro-inflammatory cytokine activity triggered by the tumor or therapy can lead to central fatigue via neurotransmitter changes (e.g. dopaminergic alterations). Host factors (non colored) – including genetic variants, HPA axis and immune system changes, and biobehavioral factors (such as depression, sleep disturbance, stress, and high body mass index) – may influence the onset and persistence of inflammation and fatigue

### Levoketoconazole (Recorlev) [^112ER1TQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypocortisolism

RECORLEV lowers cortisol levels and may lead to hypocortisolism with a potential for life-threatening adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency was observed in 7% of patients during the clinical program of RECORLEV [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Lowering of cortisol levels can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and dizziness. Significant lowering of serum cortisol levels may result in adrenal insufficiency that can be manifested by hypotension, abnormal electrolyte levels, and hypoglycemia.

Hypocortisolism may occur at any time during RECORLEV treatment. Evaluate patients for precipitating causes of hypocortisolism (infection, physical stress, etc.). Monitor 24-hour urine free cortisol, morning serum or plasma cortisol, and patient's signs and symptoms periodically during RECORLEV treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Decrease the dosage or temporarily discontinue RECORLEV if urine free cortisol or morning blood cortisol levels fall below the target range, there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels, or if signs and/or symptoms consistent with hypocortisolism are reported [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Stop RECORLEV and administer exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy if morning serum or plasma cortisol levels are below target range and signs and/or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism, are present. After RECORLEV discontinuation, cortisol suppression may persist beyond the 4- to 6- hour half-life of RECORLEV.

If treatment is interrupted due to hypocortisolism, re-initiate RECORLEV at a lower dosage when cortisol levels are within target ranges and patient's signs and/or symptoms have resolved [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The dosage may be titrated to the previous dose associated with hypocortisolism if the reduced dosage has been well tolerated and the reduced dosage does not achieve an adequate clinical response.

Educate patients on the symptoms associated with hypocortisolism and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

### Osilodrostat (Isturisa) [^116CUhXC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypocortisolism

ISTURISA lowers cortisol levels and can lead to hypocortisolism and sometimes life-threatening adrenal insufficiency. Lowering of cortisol can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dizziness. Significant lowering of serum cortisol may result in hypotension, abnormal electrolyte levels, and hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Hypocortisolism can occur at any time during ISTURISA treatment. Evaluate patients for precipitating causes of hypocortisolism (infection, physical stress, etc.). Monitor 24-hour urine free cortisol, serum or plasma cortisol, and patient's signs and symptoms periodically during ISTURISA treatment.

Decrease or temporarily discontinue ISTURISA if urine free cortisol levels fall below the target range, there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels, and/or patients report symptoms of hypocortisolism. Stop ISTURISA and administer exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy if serum or plasma cortisol levels are below target range and patients have symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. After interruption or discontinuation of ISTURISA, cortisol suppression may persist beyond the 4 hour half-life. Monitor patients regularly and re-initiate ISTURISA at a lower dose when urine free cortisol, serum or plasma cortisol levels are within target range, and/or patient symptoms have resolved.

Educate patients on the symptoms associated with hypocortisolism and advise them to contact a healthcare provider if they occur.

5.2	QTc Prolongation

ISTURISA is associated with a dose-dependent QT interval prolongation (maximum mean estimated QTcF increase of up to 5.3 ms at 30 mg), which may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Perform an ECG to obtain a baseline QTc interval measurement prior to initiating therapy with ISTURISA and monitor for an effect on the QTc interval thereafter. Correct hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia prior to ISTURISA initiation and monitor periodically during treatment with ISTURISA. Correct electrolyte abnormalities if indicated. Consider temporary discontinuation of ISTURISA in the case of an increase in QTc interval > 480 ms.

Use caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, (such as congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities, and concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval) and consider more frequent ECG monitoring.

### The relationship between sleep, fatigue and quality of life in young adults with autoimmune Addison's disease [^11296wkn]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.3 Broader Implications

Healthy sleep is vital for wellbeing, supporting recovery, mental restoration, and cognitive‐emotional health, while disruptions in sleep or circadian rhythms are linked to metabolic imbalances, fatigue, and reduced HRQoL. Given cortisol′s key role in sleep‐wake regulation and the misalignment of GC therapy with natural rhythms in AAD, patients may be particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances, which in turn may exacerbate fatigue and worsen HRQoL.

Our findings support prior research linking sleep disturbances to fatigue and poorer physical health in AAD, but add nuance: despite similar sleep quality, sleep impairments corresponded to a greater decline in physical health in patients compared to controls. This suggests a heightened physical vulnerability, where even mild sleep issues may have amplified effects.

Notably, this increased vulnerability did not extend to mental health outcomes. Although sleep impairments were associated with poorer physical health, mental health scores remained similar to controls, even when sleep impairments were present. This may reflect psychological coping mechanisms that preserve mental wellbeing despite physical strain.

Importantly, the relationship between sleep and physical health is likely bidirectional. AAD, marked by fluctuating symptoms and reduced physical resilience, may itself disrupt sleep and increase fatigue. Rather than sleep being the sole driver of impaired HRQoL, disease‐related challenges may equally degrade sleep and recovery. This self‐reinforcing interplay highlights the importance of holistic management targeting both physiological and behavioral aspects of AAD.

4.4 Clinical and Research Implications

Our findings highlight the need for greater clinical attention to sleep in AAD. While sleep impairments may not be more frequent or severe than in the general population, non‐restorative sleep is a distinctive concern. Moreover, the negative effect of sleep disturbances on physical health appears disproportionately greater in AAD, suggesting that even modest disturbances warrant attention.

Future research should explore the mechanisms behind these associations and evaluate interventions optimizing GC regimens to improve sleep and HRQoL. Although evidence is limited, promising physiological approaches like CSHI and modified‐release preparations mimicking the early morning cortisol rise (e.g. Chronocort®), may offer benefits and call for further investigation. Meanwhile, early identification and targeted strategies ‐ including treatment optimization, sleep hygiene, and behavioral or pharmacological support ‐ may help reduce fatigue and improve daily functioning in AAD.

### Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy secondary to adrenocortical adenoma: a case series and review [^116UwA8y]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

As a result of hypercortisolism and the suppression of ACTH, patients commonly experience contralateral adrenal atrophy and tertiary hypoadrenalism after undergoing adrenalectomy. However, its nonspecific symptoms are easily overlooked, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness. In some severe cases, these symptoms can worsen and lead to shock, coma or even death. As a result, it is extremely important hormone replacement therapy after surgery and consistently monitors cortisol levels to track the recovery of the HPA axis. The administration of hydrocortisone as a glucocorticoid replacement therapy is recommended. This treatment aims to address the deficit in cortisol caused by corticotrope insufficiency. It is crucial to provide comprehensive education to the patient regarding adrenal insufficiency, ensuring that they have a thorough understanding of their condition and the necessary management strategies.

The common complications, hypertension and diabetes, usually resolve or ameliorate after surgery or medication therapy of CS. However, it is usually necessary to take blood pressure medication during treatment. Combination therapy with adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers may be useful to control blood pressure. Most diuretics are typically not administered during pregnancy to manage blood pressure to avoid haemoconcentration and a decrease in effective circulation, especially thiazides, which may potentially worsen hypokalaemia. However, spironolactone may be used for the control of blood pressure, the amelioration of hypokalaemia and the contribution to antiandrogenic effects in women. Some individuals have suggested utilising angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as the initial treatment option due to their potential for cardiovascular protection, but it is prohibited in pregnancy.

CS in pregnancy is often associated with elevated blood glucose levels, which may be related to increased cortisol and the presence of insulin resistance. Thus, the first step in enhancing glucose metabolism in individuals with endogenous CS is to regulate hypercortisolism. Drugs that inhibit steroidogenesis, such as metyrapone, and medications that antagonise the glucocorticoid receptor, such as mifepristone, have a positive impact on glucose metabolism to enhance insulin sensitivity and control glucose, but mifepristone is prohibited in pregnancy. Meanwhile, availably controlled blood glucose needs antidiabetic treatment. Metformin is commonly prescribed as the first‐line therapy due to the dominant influence of hypercortisolism on insulin resistance. However, insulin therapy may be necessary instead of other drugs if the glucose level in blood is hazardous, especially considering safety during pregnancy.

Glucocorticoid therapy — clinician-delivered patient education includes the directive, "We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)", with emphasis to educate on adverse manifestations of exogenous Cushing syndrome during long-term supraphysiologic use, inform about the risk of adrenal insufficiency especially when tapering below a physiologic daily dose equivalent, provide guidance on stress dosing, and anticipate glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome; education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crisis.

### Adrenal fatigue does not exist: a systematic review [^114uoqHe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Three (5.2%) studies measured 24 h-urinary free cortisol (UFC) in an attempt to correlate cortisol excretion rates with intensity of fatigue. Although the 24 h-UFC reflects the total cortisol produced per day, it was initially conceived to investigate cortisol excess syndromes, although diminished levels could hypothetically imply subnormal adrenal function, despite of lack of any evidence. One of these studies (33.3%) found no correlation between 24 h-UFC and energy status, whereas two studies (66.7%) showed reduced values in fatigued patients.

Thirteen studies (22.4%) estimated total cortisol release (AUC) by calculating the areas under the curves for the whole day salivary cortisol collection by using three or more daily salivary cortisol levels over four or more days. Assessment of the total 24 h cortisol release by this method would complement the SCR, since the lack of the expected decrease throughout the day observed in some studies can be due either to a non-elevated morning serum cortisol (MSC) level or to a full day elevated cortisol, although three daily levels of cortisol is probably too few for a minimally precise AUC; herein, findings are conflicting. AUC was elevated in two (15.4%) studies, normal in eight (61.5%), and reduced in another three (23.1%).

Twenty-two studies (37.9%) compared baseline MSC between controls and fatigued patients; traditionally, this is the initial cortisol assessment to investigate possible hypocortisolism. Basal MSC was not different between individuals in fourteen (63.6%) of these studies, was significantly reduced in fatigued patients in three (23.1%), and was elevated in two (15.4%).

Twenty-two articles (37.9%) correlated late night salivary cortisol (11 PM NSC) and fatigue status. The NSC was initially validated to assess cortisol excess, as physiologically, one expects lower cortisol levels at the end of the day; although, NSC has been extended to investigate hypocortisolism in these studies, despite of lack of validation. Three studies (13.6%) showed a lower cortisol level in fatigued subjects compared to controls, thirteen (59.1%) found no differences, and six (27.3%) showed increased levels in fatigued subjects.

### Efficacy and safety of vamorolone vs placebo and prednisone among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a randomized clinical trial [^114ga5sD]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Corticosteroid drugs (and endogenous cortisol) potently, broadly, and acutely inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and long-term use can lead to adrenal insufficiency. In this trial, boys with DMD showed an unexpected high incidence of adrenal insufficiency at baseline by both ACTH-stimulation and morning cortisol measures. All drug treatment groups showed further suppression of the HPA axis from baseline ACTH stimulation tests and morning cortisol compared with placebo (Table 3). The incidental finding of adrenal insufficiency at baseline needs further study. Clinical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency overlap with those of DMD (poor growth, fatigue), and the treatment for adrenal insufficiency is supplemental glucocorticoids. It is intriguing to speculate that some of the efficacy of both corticosteroids and vamorolone may be treatment of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, a gene variation that causes congenital adrenal hypoplasia, NR0B1 (encoding DAX1), is adjacent to the DMD gene on the X chromosome, providing a potential mechanistic link between DMD and adrenal insufficiency.

Limitations

Limitations of the study include the relatively short study period (24 weeks) — in part to limit length of the placebo group and the withholding of standard of care — use of a single corticosteroid regimen, narrow age range of the study population (4 to < 7 years at enrollment), relatively small number of participants per group (although well powered), and missing data on some secondary efficacy outcomes owing to COVID-19 pandemic limitations on participant research visits. The analysis presented here was limited to treatment period 1 (24 weeks). Analysis of treatment period 2 (24 weeks) inclusive of longer-term treatment and crossover groups (placebo to vamorolone; prednisone to vamorolone), and more complete risk/benefit assessments are underway.

Low blood electrolyte levels of potassium and magnesium can increase your chances of QT prolongation during treatment with RECORLEV.

Your healthcare provider will check your heart with a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG) and do blood tests to check your blood electrolyte levels before and during treatment with RECORLEV.

RECORLEV should not be taken with certain other medicines that cause QT prolongation. Talk to your healthcare provider about the medicines you are taking before you start taking RECORLEV.

Low cortisol levels (adrenal insufficiency). Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones, such as cortisol. RECORLEV may cause adrenal function insufficiency by excessively lowering production of cortisol.

Call your healthcare provider right away if you have one or more of the following symptoms, as these may be symptoms of reduced adrenal function:

nausea or vomiting

dizziness

unusual fatigue

low blood pressure (hypotension)

unexplained stomach pain (abdomen)

abnormal electrolyte levels

loss of appetite

low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)

body aches

Your healthcare provider will collect blood or urine samples to measure your cortisol.

What is RECORLEV?

RECORLEV is a prescription medicine used to treat high cortisol (endogenous hypercortisolemia) levels in adult patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) who cannot have surgery or who have had surgery that did not cure their Cushing's syndrome.
It is not known if RECORLEV is safe and effective for the treatment of fungal infections. RECORLEV is not to be used for treatment of fungal infections.

Fatigue in burnout syndrome

Burnout syndrome or clinical burnout, or simply "burnout", refers to a decrease in the cognitive functions, emotional exhaustion, and physical fatigue that is triggered by stressful situations associated with excessive working. However, there is no pathognomonic marker for burnout. For practical purposes, we considered non-CFS burnout patients as "healthy", as burnout is yet to be considered a disease and its characterization is still heterogeneous. A summary of the performed methods and their respective results in non-CFS burnout/healthy patients are shown in Table 3. Assessment of the HPA axis integrity in burnout patients (at the pituitary and hypothalamic levels) has not been determined.

Table 5.
Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and common underlying conditions

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (Table 5).

Slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (eg, 7.5 prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess, and may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with slower taper in patients with high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily to the most recent dose prior to onset of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome will usually alleviate the symptoms.

R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

If the glucocorticoid dose is in the supraphysiologic range, suppression of the HPA axis is expected and it is unnecessary to test adrenal function. Similarly, testing is unnecessary in patients unable to stop glucocorticoid treatment, for example patients with organ transplants and in cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. These patients should be educated on management of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (see section R.3).

R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○)

### Autoimmune thyroid disorders in autoimmune addison disease [^115x6TuX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Very few patients were observed without treatment, indicating that even if the treatment is started on an uncertain indication, it is rarely reevaluated and stopped. Levothyroxine is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world and often leads to lifelong replacement therapy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that up to one-third of patients remained euthyroid after thyroid hormone discontinuation, with a higher proportion of patients with an initial diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism compared to overt hypothyroidism. Our data indicate that more patients can be observed without treatment, especially if TPOAb is negative. However, the number of individuals observed without treatment may be underestimated because of the possibility that those with untreated subclinical disease were not registered as such.

International guidelines state that if TSH is in the range of 4.1 to 10 mU/L and the patient has symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, clinicians can consider treatment with levothyroxine. However, the relation between symptoms and TSH levels remains unclear. The question of starting treatment is especially challenging in AAD patients, who often experience fatigue and reduced quality of life due to adrenal insufficiency, and are themselves eager to start treatment. Thus, the threshold to start treatment is probably lower than what would be the situation in a non-AAD patient. We suggest that clinicians should optimize the treatment of adrenal insufficiency and observe slightly elevated TSH levels over time before they consider levothyroxine treatment. Similarly, clinicians should consider cortisol deficiency in non-AAD patients with mild subclinical hypothyroidism and high symptom burden. This is clinically important since initiation of levothyroxine in untreated AAD patients could lead to an adrenal crisis. Taken together, there seems to be a considerable risk of overprescription of levothyroxine in AAD patients.

Adrenal Function Is Preserved in Patients With Persistent Fatigue Following COVID-19

In our cohort, post hoc analysis revealed that 62.9% (n = 44) of patients reported persistent fatigue on direct questioning ≥ 3 months after presentation with COVID-19 (Fatigue cohort), with median (IQR) time since presentation of 209 (102, 281) days (Table 1). In the Fatigue cohort there was a slight predominance of male patients reflecting the composition of the cohort as a whole (male gender in total cohort 67.1% vs 54.5% in the Fatigue cohort), but in the No fatigue cohort, there was a more marked predominance of male patients (No fatigue 88.5% vs Fatigue 54.5%, P = 0.004). The patients in the Fatigue cohort were younger (mean ± SD age 52.8 ± 12.9 years, vs 61.1 ± 11.6 years for the No fatigue cohort, P = 0.009) (Table 1). In the fatigue cohort, 27.3% had had severe COVID-19 illness, compared with 34.6% of those in the No fatigue cohort, and 50.0% had received dexamethasone during their treatment, compared with none of those without fatigue (Table 1). There was no difference in serum cortisol or change in serum cortisol from baseline at any time point following Synacthen between the Fatigue and No Fatigue cohorts (Fig. 4A, Table 2). Peak cortisol at either 30 or 60 minutes following Synacthen also did not differ between the 2 groups (Fig. 4B). There was no correlation between either baseline cortisol or peak cortisol and fatigue severity or frequency (Fig. 4C-4E). Additionally, median (IQR) ACTH concentrations were not different between those who did not receive dexamethasone, compared with those who did (no dexamethasone 16.05 [9.05, 22.13] ng/L; dexamethasone 14.05 [7.53, 21.75], P = 0.54). No significant differences between the ACTH concentrations were seen between the Fatigue and No Fatigue cohorts: 12.35 (7.55, 21.55) ng/L and 19.15 (14.03, 22.80) respectively, P = 0.06.

Multiple daily dosing was reported as a problem by 38% of the participants whereof 15% were on OD, 35% on BID, 32% on TID and 17% on another regimen. Of those who did not find multiple daily dosing to be a problem 7% were on OD, 45% on BID, 32% on TID and 16% on another regimen. Among respondents answering that multiple daily dosing was a problem 94% reported one or more of the following: difficulties to remember/forgetting doses (particularly the midday and afternoon doses), difficulties in taking the medication at a specific time every day and/or difficulties to remember to bring the medication. Many reported that their days are planned according to their dose intake and for those who lead a busy life and are working, this was found to be challenging as some also reported that they do not want to be seen by their colleagues when taking their medication. Several reported that multiple daily dosing becomes very restrictive to an active life and that multiple daily dosing is a reminder several times per day that they have this disease. Many also reported health issues such as being fatigue and exhausted in the day, evening and the following day(s) if missing a dose. In addition, many reported that taking a missed dose too late disrupts their sleep and causes issues with insomnia. Some reported instability of physical and mental well-being with mood swings and ups and downs in energy levels. The patients who reported multiple daily dosing to be a problem also reported higher frequencies of impacted QoL, more fatigue and more activities altered due to their disease (data not shown).

Enduring efficacy over 24 hours was considered the most important feature of an optimal replacement medication (29%) followed by few side effects (25%) and low risk of adrenal crisis (22%). Similar responses were obtained from patients with primary and secondary AI.

The fact that there was evidence of symptomatic benefit in hydrocortisone recipients, however, is concordant with this hypothesis, and yet the limited benefit indicates that mere supplementation of cortisol is not sufficient.

### NCT03459183 | Effects of infra-and ultrasound on the brain… [^112NYcED]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Research also indicates that low intensity focused ultrasound modulates the BOLD signal. However, the impact of ultrasound on auditory and other brain regions remains broadly unclear until today. Regarding adverse effects of low frequency noise on health and cognitive functions, preliminary evidence suggests mainly negative effects on sleep, stress levels, headaches, fatigue, concentration, and memory. These reviews do however not explicitly address audible low frequency noise vs. non-audible infrasound. Research on the effects of infra- and ultrasound on cognitive functioning and well-being is in the fledgling stage. The few studies published so far vary strongly in their applied methods and results. Repeatedly, the media has covered stories about individuals suffering from 'ultrasound-sickness', a condition where the affected person suffers from headache, nausea and pain.

In line with these subjective accounts, a review paper suggested that ultrasound exposure can be associated with hyperthermia, nausea, headaches, tinnitus and low blood pressure, as well as with neural excitability, irritation, memory problems and difficulties with concentration and learning, suggesting adverse effects of ultrasound exposure regarding health and cognition. First, participants, age 18–40, will be screened for eligibility. In addition, a hearing assessment will be conducted to assure normal auditory ability of all participants. Before and after the sound exposure period, participants will be tested using psychological and cognitive test batteries and questionnaires in order to assess psychiatric and somatic symptoms, well-being and cognitive functioning;.
