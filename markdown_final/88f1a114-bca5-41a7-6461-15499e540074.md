## Question

Poc a1c

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c testing, including its accuracy, regulatory status, appropriate clinical uses, limitations, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why POC A1c is attractive. Then, I should verify the regulatory and guideline stance on using POC A1c for diagnosis. Next, I will examine accuracy and standardization issues, followed by a careful review of the evidence base. After that, I need to consider special populations and interferences. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a bottom-line conclusion, making sure each claim is supported by current guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. POC A1c offers immediate results during the visit, enabling real-time counseling and faster therapy adjustments, which can improve workflow and potentially glycemic outcomes, especially in settings with limited access to centralized labs or where follow-up is uncertain [^0fc63125] [^7a45fb25].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory and guideline position on diagnosis before drawing conclusions. The ADA 2025 Standards restrict POC A1c for screening and diagnosis to devices that are FDA-cleared for diagnosis and are used in CLIA-certified, moderate-complexity laboratories by trained personnel, underscoring that most POC platforms are not appropriate for diagnosis today [^9f05259f] [^aa2582f1]. Historically, the ADA and international expert committees advised against POC A1c for diagnosis due to insufficient accuracy and lack of mandated proficiency testing, and while some POC devices have since obtained FDA clearance, the bar remains high and method-specific [^e532d8e4] [^09f9e67b] [^bc832dce].

> I need to check the accuracy and standardization landscape carefully. Many POC A1c assays have higher coefficients of variation and less robust quality assurance than laboratory methods, and CAP survey data show persistent analytical variability across laboratories, with even greater concerns for waived POC methods that often lack routine proficiency testing, which can lead to misclassification near diagnostic thresholds [^137c6f9c] [^454be14c]. Hold on, I should verify device-level data: head-to-head comparisons show that some POC devices correlate reasonably with laboratory A1c in mid-ranges but diverge at extremes, and early POC devices like A1cNow demonstrated clinically meaningful differences that could alter decisions in a subset of patients, reinforcing the need for caution when results are discordant or near cut points [^622f8ce4] [^01667dc6].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for clinical utility. Observational and implementation studies suggest that POC A1c can increase testing frequency, facilitate timely therapy intensification, and may modestly improve glycemic control, but these are largely nonrandomized and confounded by concurrent care processes, so causality is uncertain and should be interpreted cautiously [^7a45fb25] [^d5f3c0ca]. Let me reconsider: while real-time results can drive action, the magnitude of benefit depends on system-level factors and the reliability of the specific POC method, which varies across devices and settings [^0fc63125].

> I will now examine special populations and interferences that could undermine POC A1c accuracy. Conditions altering red cell turnover (hemolysis, recent blood loss, erythropoietin, pregnancy), hemoglobinopathies, and CKD can yield spurious A1c results; in these settings, plasma glucose criteria should be used for diagnosis and fructosamine or glycated albumin considered for monitoring when A1c is unreliable, which is especially pertinent for POC where method interference may be less well characterized [^aa2582f1] [^d48bd14e]. But wait, what if the patient is older or from a population with higher prevalence of hemoglobin variants? I should double-check: guidelines explicitly advise using glucose-based criteria when A1c–glycemia discordance is likely, and this applies regardless of whether A1c is measured in the lab or at POC [^aa2582f1].

> Let me think about pediatric and adolescent care, since practice patterns differ. ISPAD supports frequent A1c monitoring and acknowledges POC availability, yet it does not endorse POC for diagnosis; given physiologic and assay variability in youth, diagnosis should still rely on standardized laboratory A1c or glucose testing, with POC reserved for monitoring when quality is assured [^0d1882b1]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader guidance: yes, major guidelines consistently restrict diagnostic use to certified, quality-assured methods rather than routine POC devices [^9f05259f] [^aa2582f1].

> I should confirm practical recommendations for clinicians. For monitoring, POC A1c can be used if the device is NGSP-certified, FDA-cleared for monitoring, operated in a quality-controlled setting with proficiency testing, and results are interpreted alongside clinical context and, when available, CGM or SMBG data to assess variability and hypoglycemia risk [^aa2582f1] [^b69c2f1e]. For diagnosis, I need to ensure two abnormal results using the same or different tests, and if results are discordant, repeat testing and consider alternative markers; importantly, do not diagnose diabetes on a single POC A1c unless the device and setting meet diagnostic criteria, which most do not [^83e42e55] [^9f05259f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that any NGSP-certified POC could be used for diagnosis; that would be incorrect — clearance for diagnostic use and CLIA complexity requirements are essential, and most NGSP-certified POC devices are cleared only for monitoring, not diagnosis [^aa2582f1] [^9f05259f].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. POC A1c is a valuable tool for monitoring when quality-assured, but it is not ready for routine diagnostic use outside of specifically FDA-cleared, moderate-complexity POC platforms in accredited settings; accuracy concerns, method variability, and population-specific interferences justify a conservative approach to diagnosis while leveraging POC to improve care processes and access [^0fc63125] [^9f05259f] [^aa2582f1]. I should double-check that this aligns with the totality of evidence: yes, the balance of guidelines, regulatory status, and performance data supports selective, quality-controlled POC use for monitoring and restricts diagnostic use to exceptional, approved configurations, with glucose-based testing remaining the fallback when A1c is unreliable or discordant [^aa2582f1] [^83e42e55].

---

Point-of-care A1c testing is **FDA-cleared for monitoring** [^aa2582f1] but **not for diagnosis** unless the device is FDA-cleared for diagnosis and used in a CLIA-certified, moderate-complexity lab with trained personnel [^9f05259f]. POC A1c is **less accurate than lab methods** [^0fc63125], with higher variability and potential interferences (e.g. hemoglobinopathies, anemia) [^8e2725e5]; results should be confirmed by lab testing if unexpected or discordant [^83e42e55]. Use POC A1c for monitoring when rapid results will change management, but **confirm diagnosis with lab A1c or glucose tests** [^5eb155a8].

---

## Clinical utility and advantages

POC A1c testing offers several **clinical advantages**:

- **Rapid results**: Immediate feedback enables timely clinical decisions and patient counseling [^0fc63125].

- **Improved adherence**: Real-time results may enhance patient engagement and adherence to therapy [^d5f3c0ca].

- **Convenience**: No fasting is required, facilitating testing during routine visits [^c85d6568].

---

## Limitations and accuracy concerns

Despite its advantages, POC A1c testing has **important limitations**:

- **Accuracy and precision**: POC devices generally have higher variability and lower accuracy than laboratory-based methods [^0fc63125] [^137c6f9c].

- **Interferences**: Hemoglobinopathies, anemia, and altered red cell turnover can affect results [^8e2725e5] [^93a691dc].

- **Quality control**: Variable adherence to quality control and proficiency testing can compromise reliability [^bc832dce].

---

## Regulatory status and guidelines

The **regulatory status and clinical guidelines** provide clear guidance on POC A1c use:

- **FDA clearance**: Some POC devices are FDA-cleared for monitoring, but few are cleared for diagnosis [^aa2582f1].

- **ADA guidelines**: POC A1c is not recommended for diagnosis unless the device is FDA-cleared for diagnosis and used in a CLIA-certified, moderate-complexity laboratory with trained personnel [^9f05259f] [^aa2582f1].

- **Confirmatory testing**: Discordant results should be confirmed with laboratory A1c or glucose-based tests [^83e42e55].

---

## Clinical scenarios for POC A1c testing

POC A1c testing is **appropriate in specific clinical scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Appropriateness of poc a1c** |
|-|-|
| Routine monitoring of known diabetes | Appropriate, with awareness of limitations [^0fc63125] |
| Adjusting therapy during clinic visits | Appropriate, especially when rapid results are needed [^d5f3c0ca] |
| Screening for undiagnosed diabetes | Not recommended unless FDA-cleared for diagnosis and strict quality controls are in place [^9f05259f] |
| Patients with hemoglobinopathies or anemia | Not recommended due to potential interferences [^aa2582f1] |

---

## Comparison with laboratory-based A1c testing

Laboratory-based A1c testing remains the **gold standard** due to higher accuracy, precision, and robust quality control [^454be14c]. POC A1c is best viewed as an adjunct, not a replacement, for laboratory testing [^0fc63125].

---

## Clinical decision-making and patient management

When using POC A1c results, clinicians should:

- **Consider clinical context**: Integrate results with patient history, symptoms, and other clinical data [^b69c2f1e].

- **Confirm discordant results**: Repeat testing with laboratory methods if results are unexpected or discordant [^83e42e55].

- **Educate patients**: Explain the limitations of POC testing and the importance of confirmatory testing when indicated [^0fc63125].

---

## Future developments and recommendations

Continued **advancement in POC technology** and standardization may improve accuracy and expand diagnostic use. Until then, **adherence to guidelines** and **quality assurance** are essential [^aa2582f1].

---

Point-of-care A1c testing is a **useful tool for monitoring** glycemic control, offering rapid results and improved patient engagement. However, it is **not currently recommended for diagnosing diabetes** unless strict regulatory and quality criteria are met. Clinicians should use POC A1c judiciously, confirm discordant results, and continue to rely on laboratory-based testing for definitive diagnosis and management decisions [^9f05259f].

### Is there a relationship between mean blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin? [^ad3378b5]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2011). Low credibility.

Measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is considered the gold standard for monitoring chronic glycemia of diabetes patients. Hemoglobin A1c indicates an average of blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. Its close association with the risk for the development of long-term complications is well established. However, HbA1c does not inform patients about blood glucose values on a daily basis; therefore, frequent measurements of blood glucose levels are necessary for the day-to-day management of diabetes. Clinicians understand what HbA1c means and how it relates to glucose, but this is not the case with patients. Therefore, the translation of the HbA1c results into something more familiar to patients seemed a necessity. The scope of this article is to review the literature to search for enough scientific evidence to support the idea of a close relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose (MBG), and to justify the translation of HbA1c into something that reflects the MBG. Most studies confirm a close relationship between HbA1c and MBG, although different studies result in different linear equations. Factors affecting this relationship may limit the usefulness and applicability of a unique mathematical equation to all diabetes populations.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^1f3955f8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the product of a non-enzymatic chemical reaction between hemoglobin (Hb) and glucose. However, the association between Hb and HbA1c remains to be fully elucidated in view of the controversial findings reported to date. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults using cross-sectional data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey 2009.

Methods

Our analysis was based on the data of 1659 non-diabete adults 20-49years of age. Multivariable linear models were applied to examine the association between Hb and HbA1c levels. Subgroup analyses stratified by age and sex were also performed.

Results

The association between Hb and HbA1c levels was positive in the unadjusted model (β = 0.020, 95% CI: 0.008, 0.032). However, this association did not remain significant when the regression model was minimally adjusted for age and sex (β = 0.006, 95% CI: -0.014, 0.024); this association became negative when the model was further adjusted for covariates whose effect estimates of HbA1c levels more than 10% (β = -0.042, 95% CI: -0.064, -0.020). The association remained negative on subgroup analyses stratified by age (20-34years: β = -0.052, 95% CI: -0.091, -0.013; 35-49years: β = -0.041, 95% CI: -0.068, -0.014) and sex (men: β = -0.042, 95% CI: -0.074, -0.010; women: β = -0.042, 95% CI: -0.073, -0.012) when controlling for covariates.

Conclusions

Our findings revealed that Hb levels within the normal range were negatively associated with HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults. Confounding factors, such as red blood cell counts can affect the association between Hb and HbA1c levels.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^71eb38c5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Almost 10% of the world's adult population (nearly 500 million individuals) live with diabetes, with the prevalence expected to increase to 700 million by 2045. Moreover, although the prevalence of diabetes is high, nearly half of the individuals living with diabetes are unaware of their disease status. If left untreated, diabetes is associated with devastating short- and long-term complications. As early interventions might delay or even prevent full-blown diabetes, it is important to identify individuals at high risk of diabetes. Accordingly, ongoing studies are assessing the utility of novel and less studied biomarkers of diabetes.

Hemoglobin (Hb), a protein only found in red blood cells, becomes glycated or coated with glucose from the bloodstream. As the extent of Hb glycation is influenced by the amount of blood glucose, increased blood glucose levels are reflected on the surface of the Hb protein. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the product of a non-enzymatic chemical reaction between Hb and glucose. The HbA1c level reflects the average level of blood glucose over the past 90 days. As a measure of blood glucose, HbA1c has several advantages over fasting plasma glucose generally used in practice: greater convenience as no fasting is required; greater pre-analytical stability; and less day-to-day variability due to stress, diet, or illness. However, previous studies that focused on the relationship between Hb and HbA1c in patients with anemia yielded inconsistent findings. Moreover, the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels remains to be clarified. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels among Chinese non-diabetes adults using cross-sectional data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^ed042eb7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Importantly, the relation of A1C to average glucose levels, while good, is not perfect. On the other hand, it is conceivable that this "glycation gap" may actually offer an advantage in that it might better predict the risk of complications in individuals more susceptible to nonenzymatic glycation of a variety of proteins, including those fundamentally important to vascular biology. Nevertheless, we expect a significant amount of controversy in this regard.

Cost and lack of standardization of the A1C test in some countries are likely to be additional contentious issues following the recommendations of the committee. The experts do, however, recognize the difficulty and therefore envision a reasonably balanced approach: for those unable to obtain a standardized A1C test (or an affordable one), to continue to use the well-established methods of glucose testing — fasting and postchallenge glucose — the older diagnostic criteria of which will remain in place. A similar approach should apply to individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other disorders of red cell life span, particularly common in certain ethnic groups, because A1C measurement here may be unreliable.

There is likely to be some initial debate concerning the cut point — A1C of 6.5% — chosen to define diabetes. This is, of course, a problem whenever one coerces a diagnosis, which by definition must be dichotomous, from a continuous variable. Yet, one might argue that even the fasting glucose threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l), while not entirely arbitrary, represents a point along a continuum of metabolic derangement. Concern will be compounded by the fact that the upper limit of normal for A1C is 6.0%, leaving something of a gray zone between this value and the 6.5% cut point for diabetes. Values herein are not quite normal and yet not high enough to qualify as diabetes. This will predictably create the same confusion that may have arisen in individuals in the categories of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance using the current guidelines. Moreover, the sensitivity of the A1C test in this specific range may be less than optimal. (In this context, it is also very important to recognize that point-of-care testing is not recommended; the standardized assay, which makes the new recommendations feasible, is only available through a clinical laboratory.)

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: caveats and considerations for optimal use [^0fc63125]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen. In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories. We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated a large sample of Chinese non-diabetes adults to explore the association between Hb levels within the normal range and HbA1c levels. Our results showed that Hb levels were independently and negatively associated with HbA1c levels in both men and women.

Anemia is a common condition, clinically defined as a hematocrit value or blood Hb level that is below the normal range. Anemia is often associated with diabetes and is known to increase the risk of diabetes-related complications. However, previous studies that investigated the association between Hb and HbA1c levels in patients with anemia have yielded contradictory conclusions. While several studies have reported that HbA1c level was significantly higher in individuals with anemia, others did not identify a difference in HbA1c levels between individuals with anemia and healthy controls, or found a lower HbA1c level in patients with anemia.

Recently, Grossman et al. conducted a large retrospective cohort study including 11,352 elderly non-diabetic community individuals to evaluate the association between Hb and HbA1c levels. Although they found that Hb levels were significantly lower among individuals in the highest HbA1c quintile than among individuals in the other quintiles, the correlation between HbA1c and Hb levels was negligible. In our study, the correlation between Hb levels in the normal range and HbA1c levels was positive in the unadjusted model but became non-significant after adjusting for age and sex and became negative after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Differences in the reported association between Hb and HbA1c levels between studies might reflect the differences in study design and confounding variables used for adjustment.

The HbA1c test is easy to perform, making it widely available as an ideal tool for busy primary care and endocrine practices. However, the HbA1c level is impacted by numerous factors, such as race, RBC disorders, and hemoglobinopathies. Moreover, iron deficiency anemia may cause a spurious increase in HbA1c values. Our findings supported an independent negative association between Hb and HbA1c levels among non-diabetes adults with normal Hb levels, with this relationship being stable in both men and women.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^176aeb82]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### Implications of using hemoglobin A1c for diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^808e61f3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Until 2010, the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was based solely on glucose concentration, but the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendations now include a new criterion: hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.5%. Because this change may have significant implications for diabetes diagnosis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review including peer-reviewed articles not referenced in the ADA report. We conclude that A1C and plasma glucose tests are frequently discordant for diagnosing diabetes. A1C ≥ 6.5% identifies fewer individuals as having diabetes than glucose-based criteria. Convenience of A1C test might increase the number of patients diagnosed, but this is unproven. Diagnostic cut-points for both glucose and A1C are based on consensus judgments regarding optimal sensitivity and specificity for the complications of hyperglycemia. A1C may not accurately reflect levels of glycemia in some situations, but in comparison with glucose measurements, it has greater analytic stability and less temporal variability. When choosing a diagnostic test for diabetes, the limitations of each choice must be understood. Clinical judgment and consideration of patient preference are required to appropriately select among the diagnostic alternatives.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: when results may be misleading [^8e2725e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results. The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^747e1b73]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^f0fddb2a]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission definitions — consensus statements state that remission is broadly defined as the disappearance of related signs and symptoms for a specified minimum time without excluding recurrence, and that remission requires achieving, for a specified minimum time, normal glycemic measures defined as normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and normal fasting blood glucose with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose; additional statements specify normal glycemic measures for at least 6 months without such interventions and that remission of T2D should be defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy, with consensus that remission of T2D should include a specific threshold or cut point for HbA1c and that remission of T2D requires HbA1c < 6.5%, and that remission is the optimal outcome for adults with T2D and is a realistic and achievable goal for some adults with T2D.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^09f9e67b]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What are the practical issues related to A1C testing?

A1C tests to diagnose diabetes should be performed using clinical laboratory equipment. Point-of-care instruments have not yet been shown to be sufficiently accurate or precise for diagnosing diabetes. Although this International Expert Committee has concluded that the attributes of the A1C assay with regard to diagnosing diabetes and detecting individuals at high risk support its use over the FPG or 2HPG tests, the superiority of A1C testing does not invalidate the diagnostic criteria based on glucose testing. In circumstances when A1C testing cannot be performed, the diagnostic glucose tests are acceptable alternatives.

Whichever of the three different tests now available to diagnose diabetes (A1C, FPG, and 2HPG) is used, both initial and confirmatory testing should be performed with the same test. As the three tests are not completely concordant, using different tests could easily lead to confusion. The only exception to the need to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes with the same test would be the presence of clinical symptoms characteristic of diabetes and glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (> 11.1 mmol/l). Confirmatory testing is also not required to establish risk status in individuals identified as in the highest-risk group for diabetes (A1C of 6.0 to < 6.5%).

Most cases of type 1 diabetes, particularly in children and adolescents, are diagnosed by the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, unexplained weight loss, and a casual glucose > 200 mg/dl. If diabetes is suspected in the absence of those conditions, A1C testing is warranted.

Methods

Study population

The CHNS is an ongoing, open, population-based study conducted by the National Institute for Nutrition and Food Safety at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), designed to examine the health and nutrition status of the Chinese population. In 2009, the Department of Laboratory Medicine of China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health joined this project as the lead agency for the collection, storage and analysis of biospecimens. The CHNS protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety at Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Ministry of Health, China. All participants provided written informed consent for the use of their data in research.

A total of 10 waves of the survey have been conducted since 1989. Notably, blood samples were collected as part of the CHNS for the first time in the 2009 survey. In this study, 3926 adults aged 20–49 years, with available data on both Hb and HbA1c levels were deemed eligible. We excluded individuals with missing weight or height data (n = 1804); a diagnosis of diabetes (n = 28), an HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% (n = 85), or glucose level ≥ 7.0 mol/L (n = 28); and a Hb level outside the normal range (n = 322). The data for the remaining 1659 non-diabetes adults were included in our final analysis (Fig. 1).

### The clinical use of hemoglobin A1c [^65f309d6]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been accepted as an index of glycemic control since the mid-1970s and is the best marker for diabetic microvascular complications. Clinically, it is now used to assess glycemic control in people with diabetes. Assays are most reliable when certified by the National Hemoglobin Standardization Program but are subject to confounders and effect modifiers, particularly in the setting of hematologic abnormalities. Other measures of chronic glycemic control-fructosamine and 1,5-anhydroglucitol-are far less widely used. The relationship of HbA1c to average blood glucose was intensively studied recently, and it has been proposed that this conversion can be used to report an "estimated average glucose, eAG" in milligrams/deciliter or millimolar units rather than as per cent glycated hemoglobin. Finally, HbA1c has been proposed as a useful method of screening for and diagnosing diabetes.

At that time, these guidelines stated that "POC assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes. " In 2013, the ADA revised the wording of the guidelines to state that "although POC assays may be NGSP certified, proficiency testing is not mandated for performing the test, so use. diabetes.

To facilitate discussion on this topic and to give the panel members the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the agency has included the ADA on the agenda for this panel meeting to present their rationale for recommending against POC HbA1c assays to diagnose diabetes. The sponsor's current submission is for a HbA1c test for use in moderately complex POC. consider POC tests to monitor HbA1c levels beneficial to patients as they provide the opportunity to discuss results with the patient during their appointment and, when needed, make more timely treatment changes. III. Regulation of HbA1c Assays There are two separate FDA regulations pertaining to HbA1c tests. HbA1c tests intended. assays intended for use at POC sites. To obtain clearance of a new diagnostic HbA1c test, sponsors submit data that complies with the special controls listed above for FDA review.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^4ed0afa3]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the above limitations of A1C testing, the assay has numerous important advantages compared with the currently used laboratory measurements of glucose (Table 1). The prevalence of diabetes in some populations may not be the same when diagnosis is based on A1C compared with diagnosis with glucose measurements, and one method may identify different individuals than the other. Because the measurements of glucose levels and A1C reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, this is to be expected. However, establishing identical prevalences should not be the goal in defining a new means of diagnosing diabetes. The ultimate goal is to identify individuals at risk for diabetes complications so that they can be treated. The A1C diagnostic level of 6.5% accomplishes this goal.

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes, we recommend fasting plasma glucose and/or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) screening to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes, noting that the measurement of HbA1c may be inaccurate in some older adults due to comorbidities affecting red blood cell lifespan, and after a normal initial test the committee advocates repeat screening every 2 years; screening may not be appropriate for those with end-stage cancer or organ system failure, and shared decision-making with the patient is recommended.

### Hemoglobin A1c time-in-range, mortality, and diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes [^e954f2be]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Associations among chronic hyperglycemia, mortality, and diabetes complications are complex. Higher average hemoglobin A1c (A1c) is associated with microvascular (eg, kidney and eye) complications. However, there is a non-linear and perhaps a U-shaped relationship between average A1c and mortality. Treating patients with new-onset diabetes to lower A1c levels may accrue benefits over time, but targeting near-normal A1c levels in those with established type 2 diabetes does not reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) or mortality. In addition, increased A1c variability is associated with higher risks of mortality, CVD, kidney disease, and retinopathy.

Diabetes clinical practice guidelines account for these complexities by recommending different A1c treatment goals based on life expectancy, comorbidities, and complications. Nonetheless, clinical treatment strategies often focus on reducing elevated A1c levels without considering the risks associated with increasing A1c variability or whether treatment goals should include a lower threshold. This approach may lead to potential overtreatment.

To address the need for a clinical measure that captures A1c cadence and stability, we developed a measure of A1c time-in-range (A1c TIR). A1c TIR represents the percentage of time over a 3-year period that A1c levels are within patient-specific and guideline-directed ranges. In an initial cohort of veterans, we showed that higher A1c TIR is associated with lower risk of mortality and several diabetes complications.

The generalizability and utility of A1c TIR as a risk predictor depend on its confirmation in other patient cohorts and stronger evidence of potential causal associations with major adverse outcomes. The objectives of this study are to examine A1c TIR as risk predictors for mortality and diabetes complications in different patient cohorts and apply methods that account for unmeasured confounding. We studied patients with diabetes from two large healthcare systems that included two Kaiser Permanente (KP) health systems and an updated cohort from the Veterans Health Administration (VA).

Currently, 99% of laboratories in the United States use a standardized and certified assay traced to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c stability with mortality and diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes [^3b98f9bb]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes complications is complex. Several lines of evidence suggest that both the level of hemoglobin A1c (A1c) and its variability over time have clinical implications. Targeting A1c to < 7.0% in type 2 diabetes reduces the risk of microvascular complications but does not impact cardiovascular disease (CVD) or mortality, and there is a non-linear association between average A1c and mortality. Increased A1c variability is also associated with higher risk of CVD and mortality independent of A1c levels.

Many guidelines for treating older adults with diabetes recommend adjusting A1c goals based on life expectancy, comorbidities, and complications. In particular, the 2017 VA Department of Defense clinical practice guideline identifies specific A1c target ranges based on these clinical factors. However, clinicians and patients often focus on avoiding A1c upper limits without considering the risks and benefits of lower A1c levels. In addition, treatment decisions may be based on the most recent A1c level with less attention paid to its stability over time. This leads to many older adults being potentially overtreated, exposing them to polypharmacy, hypoglycemia risk, and increased A1c variability.

We developed a clinical measure that incorporates A1c levels and their stability over time, A1c time in range (TIR). A1c TIR represents the percentage of time that A1c levels fall within guideline-directed target rangesover a 3-year period. We showed that higher A1c TIR is associated with lower risk of mortality and macrovascular and microvascular complications independent of A1c mean and SD. However, patients with low A1c TIR may have patterns composed of varying times when A1c levels are mostly above, below, or fluctuating around their target ranges. Therefore, we evaluated the risks of mortality and macrovascular and microvascular complications among older adults with diabetes based on having A1c levels mostly within, above, or below their patient-specific target ranges.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^93a691dc]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Limitations of A1C as the recommended means of diagnosing diabetes

The A1C assay is the test of choice for the chronic management of diabetes and is now being recommended for its diagnosis; however, there are parts of the world where the costs of providing the assay preclude its routine use. In such circumstances, clinicians should continue to use the previously recommended approaches to diagnose diabetes based on glucose measurements. The International Expert Committee encourages clinicians worldwide to move as quickly as possible to A1C testing using standardized methods and instrumentation. However, the decision to change to A1C assays as the means of diagnosing diabetes should take into account the performance of local A1C assays and the local prevalence of conditions that may interfere with the assay. (See below.)

Although the discussion above argues for using the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals, there are patient conditions that either will require a specific A1C assay method or will preclude A1C testing. First, some hemoglobin traits, such as HbS, HbC, HbF, and HbE, interfere with some A1C assay methods. Currently, many assay methods can correct for the presence of the most common hemoglobin traits, and affinity assays that are unaffected by hemoglobin traits may be used. Second, any condition that changes red cell turnover, such as hemolytic anemia, chronic malaria, major blood loss, or blood transfusions, will lead to spurious A1C results. Clinicians must be aware of these conditions, particularly in populations in which they are more prevalent. As in the setting where A1C assays are unavailable, the traditional diagnostic tests (e.g. FPG, 2HPG) must be used in individuals in whom interpreting the A1C is problematic. Third, A1C levels appear to increase with age, but the extent of the change, whether it relates to factors other than glucose metabolism, and the effect of the age-related increases on the development of complications are not sufficiently clear to adopt age-specific values in a diagnostic scheme. Similarly, racial disparities in A1C, based on putative differences in the relationship between glucose levels and A1C, have been suggested; however, here too, their etiology and significance are unclear, and it is premature to establish race-specific diagnostic values. Finally, there are rare clinical settings, such as rapidly evolving type 1 diabetes, where the A1C level will not have had time to "catch up" with the acute elevations in glucose levels; however, in these very rare cases, diabetes should be diagnosable with typical symptoms and casual glucose levels > 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) despite a nondiagnostic A1C level.

### Association between hemoglobin within the normal range and hemoglobin A1c among Chinese non-diabetes adults [^7c59bb85]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Study variables

In the CHNS, blood samples (12 mL) were collected after overnight fasting for > 8 hours, and analyzed under strict quality control at the Beijing central laboratory as per previously described methods, using a 3- or 5-part classification automated hematology analyzer (Hitachi 7600 automated analyzer, Hitachi Inc. Japan).

The Hb level, considered as the variable of exposure in our study, was determined by the volume, conductivity, and scatter method for blood cell analysis using the LH750 hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA). The normal range for Hb levels is 13.3–17.7 g/dL for adult men and 11.7–15.7 g/dL for adult women. The HbA1c level, defined as the outcome variable, was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography using a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified automated analyzer (model HLC-723 G7, Japan). The level of fasting plasma glucose was measured using the GOD-PAP method (Randox Laboratories Ltd. UK). Diabetes was defined as an HbA1c level ≥ 6.5% or a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, following the 2019 American Diabetes Association criteria.

Data on the following covariates were extracted for inclusion in our analysis: age, sex, ethnicity, education level, activities (based on the question "How much do you like to participate in this activity"), smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), total protein, total cholesterol, blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, serum creatinine, white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, and platelet (PLT) count. Details regarding the acquisition process of data on Hb levels, HbA1c, and other covariates have been previously described in detail.

### Associations of glycemic measures in the normal range with all-cause mortality in the absence of traditional risk factors [^056e404b]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

The investigation of the association between blood glucose within normal range and all-cause mortality among individuals without traditional risk factors is limited.

Objective

To determine the associations of 3 glycemic measures (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], and 2-hour glucose) in the normal range with all-cause mortality among individuals without traditional risk factors.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1988–1994 and 1999–2018. Nonpregnant adults who had a measurement of 2-hour glucose, FPG, and HbA1c, and absence of traditional risk factors were included. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to examine the associations of normal FPG (n = 5793), normal HbA1c (n = 8179), and normal 2-hour glucose (n = 3404) with all-cause mortality.

Results

A significant association was found between 2-hour glucose within the normal range and all-cause mortality among those without traditional risk factors. Compared with participants with 2-hour glucose < 80mg/dL, participants with a higher normal 2-hour glucose level had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (110-139mg/dL; HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.03–3.15). In the subgroup analysis, significant associations were also found among people aged ≥ 60 years and men. No significant associations were found between normal FPG and HbA1c levels and all-cause mortality.

Conclusion

Among US adults without traditional risk factors, high normal 2-hour glucose level was positively associated with all-cause mortality. This result highlights the potential importance of maintaining a lower normal level of 2-hour glucose for preventing mortality in individuals who are conventionally considered to be cardiovascular healthy.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1c in clinical medicine: an American perspective [^35293398]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Therefore, particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly decided based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c. In this commentary, however, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell life span has been developed, we present evidence that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^859575ff]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large as to the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to an enhanced detection of diabetes has been inadequate screening using tests somewhat inconvenient to patients and clinicians and therefore often not optimally implemented. In this issue of Diabetes Care, a joint American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes International Expert Committee examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically, the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by either of the associations (or other organizations), it does represent a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), handy, and, ideally, inexpensive. While plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been dogged by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state (most people attend their outpatient visits in the fed state) or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, i.e. the oral glucose tolerance test. There also continues to be a degree of uncertainty concerning the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus that of the oral glucose tolerance test — the latter done rarely in clinical practice for obvious reasons: inconvenience and cost. In addition, considerable variability not only in 2-h postglucose load values but also in fasting glucose has been a problem. Appropriately, clinicians have long wondered why they cannot use another diagnostic index, such as A1C, an inherently attractive option because it recapitulates long-term ambient glycemia as opposed to a single point in time. With the recent introduction of the standardized global assay for the measurement of A1C, greater accuracy and precision than achieved with plasma glucose have been predicated. The overall edge of A1C over plasma glucose is accurately summarized in Table 1 of the International Expert Committee's report.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^e532d8e4]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

ADA has not previously recommended the use of A1C for diagnosing diabetes, in part due to lack of standardization of the assay. However, A1C assays are now highly standardized, and their results can be uniformly applied both temporally and across populations. In a recent report, after an extensive review of both established and emerging epidemiological evidence, an international expert committee recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes with a threshold of ≥ 6.5%, and ADA affirms this decision. The diagnostic test should be performed using a method certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes.

Epidemiologic datasets show a relationship between A1C and the risk of retinopathy similar to that which has been shown for corresponding FPG and 2-h PG thresholds. The A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required; evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability; and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages must be balanced by greater cost, limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies. For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list of A1C assays and whether abnormal hemoglobins impact them is available at). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as pregnancy or anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must use glucose criteria exclusively.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^db3a1420]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes, we recommend fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c screening to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Technical remark: The measurement of HbA1c may be inaccurate in some people in this age group because of comorbidities that can affect the lifespan of red blood cells in the circulation. Although the optimal screening frequency for patients whose initial screening test is normal remains unclear, the writing committee advocates repeat screening every 2 years thereafter, and such screening may not be appropriate for an older patient with end-stage cancer or organ system failure.

### The correlation of hemoglobin A1c to blood glucose [^924700aa]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

The understanding that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) represents the average blood glucose level of patients over the previous 120 days underlies the current management of diabetes. Even in making such a statement, we speak of "average blood glucose" as though "blood glucose" were itself a simple idea. When we consider all the blood glucose forms-arterial versus venous versus capillary, whole blood versus serum versus fluoride-preserved plasma, fasting versus nonfasting-we can start to see that this is not a simple issue. Nevertheless, it seems as though HbA1c correlates to any single glucose measurement. Having more than one measurement and taking those measurements in the preceding month improves the correlation further. In particular, by having glucose measurements that reflect both the relatively lower overnight glucose levels and measurements that reflect the postprandial peaks improves not only our ability to manage diabetes patients, but also our understanding of how HbA1c levels are determined. Modern continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices may take thousands of glucose results over a week. Several studies have shown that CGM glucose averages account for the vast proportion of the variation of HbA1c. The ability to relate HbA1c to average glucose may become a popular method for reporting HbA1c, eliminating current concerns regarding differences in HbA1c standardization. Hemoglobin A1c expressed as an average glucose may be more understandable to patients and improve not only their understanding, but also their ability to improve their diabetes management.

### Association of hemoglobin A1c time in range with risk for diabetes complications [^ac6b7720]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

We assessed the association between hemoglobin A1c time in range (A1c TIR), based on unique patient-level A1c target ranges, with risks of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications in older adults with diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We used a retrospective observational study design and identified patients with diabetes from the Department of Veterans Affairs (n = 397634). Patients were 65 years and older and enrolled in Medicare during the period 2004–2016. Patients were assigned to individualized A1c target ranges based on estimated life expectancy and the presence or absence of diabetes complications. We computed A1c TIR for patients with at least four A1c tests during a 3-year baseline period. The association between A1c TIR and time to incident microvascular and macrovascular complications was studied in models that included A1c mean and A1c SD.

Results

We identified 74016 patients to assess for incident microvascular complications and 89625 patients to assess for macrovascular complications during an average follow-up of 5.5 years. Cox proportional hazards models showed lower A1c TIR was associated with higher risk of microvascular (A1c TIR 0% to < 20%; HR = 1.04; 95%) and macrovascular complications (A1c TIR 0% to < 20%; HR = 1.07; 95%). A1c mean was associated with increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications but A1c SD was not. The association of A1c TIR with incidence and progression of individual diabetes complications within the microvascular and macrovascular composites showed similar trends.

Conclusions

Maintaining stability of A1c levels in unique target ranges was associated with lower likelihood of developing microvascular and macrovascular complications in older adults with diabetes.

A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia, and for individuals prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin deficiency and/or intensive insulin therapy) glycemic status is best evaluated by the combination of results from blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and A1C, because discordant results between A1C and BGM or CGM can occur due to high glycemic variability, inaccurate BGM or CGM measurement, or inaccurate A1C.

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^ccce3482]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

The guideline adds, "We discourage medication changes in response to a single HbA1c test that falls slightly outside target ranges, especially if it is discordant with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) results". It notes "African Americans, on average, have HbA1c levels about 0.4% higher than Whites", and "The VA/DoD DM CPG does not recommend the use of estimated average glucose derived from HbA1c levels".

### Association of hemoglobin A1c stability with mortality and diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes [^7285cf8f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) treatment goals in older adults should be individualized to balance risks and benefits. It is unclear if A1c stability over time within unique target ranges also affects adverse outcomes.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study from 2004 to 2016 of veterans with diabetes and at least four A1c tests during a 3-year baseline. We generated four distinct categories based on the percentage of time that baseline A1c levels were within patient-specific target ranges: ≥ 60% time in range (TIR), ≥ 60% time below range (TBR), ≥ 60% time above range (TAR), and a mixed group with all times < 60%. We assessed associations of these categories with mortality, macrovascular, and microvascular complications.

Results

We studied 397 634 patients (mean age 76.9 years, SD 5.7) with an average of 5.5 years of follow-up. In comparison to ≥ 60% A1c TIR, mortality was increased with ≥ 60% TBR, ≥ 60% TAR, and the mixed group, with HRs of 1.12 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.14), 1.10 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.12), and 1.06 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.07), respectively. Macrovascular complications were increased with ≥ 60% TBR and ≥ 60% TAR, with estimates of 1.04 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.06) and 1.06 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.09). Microvascular complications were lower with ≥ 60% TBR (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.00) and higher with ≥ 60% TAR (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.14). Results were similar with higher TIR thresholds, shorter follow-up, and competing risk of mortality.

Conclusions

In older adults with diabetes, mortality and macrovascular complications are associated with increased time above and below individualized A1c target ranges. Higher A1c TIR may identify patients with lower risk of adverse outcomes.

2. Testing frequency.

There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA 1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA 1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA 1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA 1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA 1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA 1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

3. Interpretation.

HbA 1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values (e.g. two- to threefold increases in some patients) that reflect an extreme degree of hyperglycemia. A proper interpretation of HbA 1c test results requires that physicians understand the relationship between HbA 1c values and mean plasma glucose, the kinetics of HbA 1c, and specific assay limitations/interferences. Small changes in HbA 1c (e.g. ± 0.3% HbA 1c) over time may reflect assay imprecision rather than a true change in glycemic status.

5. Emerging considerations

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c MAY BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES, WITH VALUES ≥ 6.5% BEING DIAGNOSTIC. AN NGSP-CERTIFIED METHOD SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY. ANALOGOUS TO ITS USE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE HbA 1c ASSAY WILL PRECLUDE ITS USE IN DIAGNOSIS A (moderate).

RECOMMENDATION: POINT-OF-CARE HbA 1c ASSAYS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE TO USE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES B (moderate).

4.1.2 Laboratory and practical considerations

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), continues to have a central role in setting glycemic targets, by virtue of several factors; (i) Definitive evidence of the association between HbA1c and the development of diabetes complications,(ii) a standardized reference method and procedure set by the IFCC and endorsed by all the major stakeholders,(iii) availability of point‐of‐care measurement in clinic and in outreach or remote settings, and (iv) barriers to universal access to CGM (and associated glycemic metrics). Every young person with diabetes should have a minimum of four HbA1c measurements per year (at ~3‐month intervals). It is recommended that centers regularly audit HbA1c levels, benchmark their data against consensus statements and, if possible, contribute their data to registries and quality improvement initiatives.

The maximum lifespan of erythrocytes is ~100–120 days with an average age at any given time ranging from 40 to 60 days. HbA1c reflects average blood glucose concentration in the preceding 8–12 weeks. More recent plasma glucose concentrations contribute proportionately more to the HbA1c concentration — estimated to be 50% contribution from the previous 30 days, with 40% and 10% contributions from the previous 31–90 days and 91–120 days, respectively.

### Hemoglobin A1c: need to standardize the term [^5593d763]. Endocrine Practice (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To discuss studies that investigate the understanding of patients with diabetes and the information provided by physicians regarding the terminology and meaning of tests for glycated hemoglobin.

Findings

Patients with diabetes seldom know or remember the terminology for glycated hemoglobin assay techniques, even when they are participating in self-monitoring of blood glucose. Physicians use a variety of terms for the glycated hemoglobin test and are not consistent in their terminology.

Conclusion

One term for glycated hemoglobin assay should be used and promoted by all health-care professionals and patients. Because it is most readily remembered, "A1C" is the preferred lay term.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) in older adults — hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) monitoring and self-monitoring: Older adults with DM whose individual targets are not being met should have their HbA1c levels measured at least every 6 months and more frequently as needed or indicated, and for those with stable HbA1c over several years, measurement every 12 months may be appropriate (IIIB). For older adults with DM, a schedule for self-monitoring of blood glucose should be considered depending on functional and cognitive abilities, and the schedule should be based on the goals of care, target HbA1c levels, potential for modifying therapy, and risk of hypoglycemia (IIIB).

American College of Lifestyle Medicine advocacy for lifestyle interventions in preventing and managing type 2 diabetes in adults states that by making positive lifestyle changes, people can prevent, manage, and in some cases even reverse type 2 diabetes. For some people, lifestyle changes can actually lead to full remission, which means achieving normal blood levels of a key diabetes marker (called hemoglobin A1c) for at least three months without any surgery, devices, or blood-sugar-lowering medications. The handout notes that making healthy lifestyle changes may actually work better than medication (like metformin) at stopping prediabetes from progressing into type 2 diabetes, that healthy lifestyle changes can make it less likely that gestational diabetes will turn into type 2 diabetes later on, and that for adults with type 2 diabetes healthy lifestyle changes can support weight loss, help control blood sugar, reduce the need for medication, and improve energy and quality of life.

In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Chang and colleagues evaluate the performance of the A1CNow® SELFCHECK device for measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The authors discuss the potential advantages of point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing and also mention the importance of accuracy and precision and provide some data to document the device's performance. There are specific criteria for HbA1c method evaluation and proficiency testing used by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program and the College of American Pathologists. Chang and colleagues mention these criteria but chose wider performance limits for their evaluation of the A1cNow SELFCHECK. Given the available data on the relationship between HbA1c and risk for complications, assay method performance is a vital consideration when HbA1c results, including those from POC methods, are used in the management of patients with diabetes.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^5242602f]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

An updated examination of the laboratory measurements of glucose and A1C by the current International Expert Committee indicates that with advances in instrumentation and standardization, the accuracy and precision of A1C assays at least match those of glucose assays. The measurement of glucose itself is less accurate and precise than most clinicians realize. A recent analysis of the performance of a variety of clinical laboratory instruments and methods that measure glucose revealed that 41% of instruments have a significant bias from the reference method that would result in potential misclassification of > 12% of patients. There are also potential preanalytic errors owing to sample handling and the well-recognized lability of glucose in the collection tube at room temperature. Even when whole blood samples are collected in sodium fluoride to inhibit in vitro glycolysis, storage at room temperature for as little as 1 to 4 h before analysis may result in decreases in glucose levels by 3–10 mg/dl in nondiabetic individuals.

By contrast, A1C values are relatively stable after collection, and the recent introduction of a new reference method to calibrate all A1C assay instruments should further improve A1C assay standardization in most of the world. In addition, between- and within-subject coefficients of variation have been shown to be substantially lower for A1C than for glucose measurements. The variability of A1C values is also considerably less than that of FPG levels, with day-to-day within-person variance of < 2% for A1C but 12–15% for FPG. The convenience for the patient and ease of sample collection for A1C testing (which can be obtained at any time, requires no patient preparation, and is relatively stable at room temperature) compared with that of FPG testing (which requires a timed sample after at least an 8-h fast and which is unstable at room temperature) support using the A1C assay to diagnose diabetes.

In summary, compared with the measurement of glucose, the A1C assay is at least as good at defining the level of hyperglycemia at which retinopathy prevalence increases; has appreciably superior technical attributes, including less preanalytic instability and less biologic variability; and is more clinically convenient. A1C is a more stable biological index than FPG, as would be expected with a measure of chronic glycemia levels compared with glucose concentrations that are known to fluctuate within and between days (Table 1).

### Hemoglobin A1c time-in-range, mortality, and diabetes complications in older adults with diabetes [^71326a52]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) treatment goals in older adults often consider life expectancy and comorbidities. A1c stability may also inform the risks of major outcomes. We studied the association of individualized A1c time-in-range (A1c TIR) with mortality and diabetes complications.

Research Design and Methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients with diabetes, 65 years or older, from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Kaiser Permanente (KP) from 2004 to 2018. Patients had at least four A1c tests during a 3-year baseline, and A1c TIR was calculated as the percentage of days when A1c levels were within patient-specific target ranges. We estimated associations among A1c TIR and mortality, cardiovascular, and microvascular outcomes using time to event models and instrumental variable (IV) models.

Results

We identified 386 287 VA patients and 24 885 KP patients with a mean age of 74.3 years (SD 5.8) and 72.3 years (SD 5.7), respectively. Among VA patients, when compared with higher A1c TIR (80–100%), lower A1c TIR (0% to < 20%) was associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.22; 95%CI 1.20 to 1.23) and cardiovascular outcomes (HR, 1.10; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.13). IV models showed similar associations. Among KP patients, lower A1c TIR (0% to < 20%) was associated with mortality (HR, 1.36; 95%CI 1.27 to 1.45). IV models showed associations with increased mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Among both VA and KP patients, greater A1c time below and time above range were associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

A1c stability within patient-specific target ranges is associated with a lower risk of major adverse outcomes among older adults with diabetes.

Other A1C topics at the ADA Scientific Sessions

At a National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program review at the ADA Scientific Sessions, Little discussed interesting observations based on CAP surveys of A1C assay performance. Average CV decreased from 6 to 7% in 2003 to current mean levels around 4%. An important statistical notion is that of critical difference — the difference for a given patient between two test results that should be considered significant. For A1C, at an average method CV of 4%, the critical difference is 0.8%, suggesting that the typical approach of clinicians in considering relatively small changes to be of consequence may not be statistically accurate. In fact, even if an A1C method had a 1% CV, the critical difference would still be an A1C change of at least 0.3%. In grading of the CAP A1C survey, the acceptable limit in 2009 is ± 10%, although the plan is to reduce this to ± 6% over coming years. Other characteristics of A1C assays were discussed at the session. Many methods do not show assay interference with hemoglobin variants, but 6.5% of labs use methods for which A1C of samples with hemoglobin S or C is incorrect by > 10%, 20% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin E causes interference, and 6% of labs use methods in which hemoglobin D causes interference. It should be noted that the CAP surveys do not include information on "point of care" A1C methods, as this is a "waived" test for quality standardization; the use of such methods may, if accuracy is limited, further limit the value of A1C.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^83e42e55]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.

Here we describe the current understanding of the performance of POCT for HbA1c, which areas need further studies, and the key requirements for future publications based on performance evaluations of these devices. These include studies in clinical settings, performance measured against internationally standardized reference methods, and the need to evaluate new to the market devices that do not currently have a detailed performance history. In addition we highlight the need for external quality assessment schemes that are designed to support POCT in a wide range of clinical settings.

### Interpretation of HbA1c: association with mean cell volume and haemoglobin concentration [^b9021731]. Diabetic Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The utility of HbA1c in diabetes diagnosis is reduced in settings associated with altered haemoglobin glycation. We have studied whether HbA1c varies with mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin concentration as measures of haemoglobin metabolism.

Methods

Randomly selected adults from rural Victoria, Australia, were invited for biomedical assessment. After excluding patients with known diabetes and/or serum creatinine ≥ 0.12 mmol/l, 1315 adults were included. Demography, arthropometric measurements, oral glucose tolerance test, analyses of full blood count and HbA1c were undertaken.

Results

After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, town and socio-economic status, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin, mean cell volume or mean cell haemoglobin concentration by glycaemic status (defined by oral glucose tolerance test). HbA1c was significantly and independently associated with fasting glucose, town, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, ethnicity, age and BMI among men < 50 years (R² = 33.8%); fasting glucose, 2-h glucose, mean cell haemoglobin concentration and town among men ≥ 50 years (R² = 47.9%); fasting glucose, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, town, 2-h glucose and age among women < 50 years (R² = 46.3%); fasting glucose, mean cell haemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume and 2-h glucose among women ≥ 50 years (R² = 51.6%). A generalized linear model showed a gradient from an adjusted mean HbA1c of 36 (95% CI 34–38) mmol/mol with a mean cell haemoglobin concentration of ≤ 320 g/l to 30 (95% CI 29–31) mmol/mol with a mean cell haemoglobin concentration of > 370 g/l. The gradient across mean cell volume was negative, but only by 1 mmol/mol (0.1%) HbA1c.

Conclusion

A mean HbA1c difference of 5 mmol/mol (0.5%) across the mean cell haemoglobin concentration reference range suggests that an accompanying full blood count examination may be required for its use in the diagnosis of diabetes. Further studies are required to confirm this.

Abstract

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) treatment goals in older adults often consider life expectancy and comorbidities. A1c stability may also inform the risks of major outcomes. We studied the association of individualized A1c time-in-range (A1c TIR) with mortality and diabetes complications.

Research design and methods

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of patients with diabetes, 65 years or older, from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Kaiser Permanente (KP) from 2004 to 2018. Patients had at least four A1c tests during a 3-year baseline, and A1c TIR was calculated as the percentage of days when A1c levels were within patient-specific target ranges. We estimated associations among A1c TIR and mortality, cardiovascular, and microvascular outcomes using time to event models and instrumental variable (IV) models.

Results

We identified 386 287 VA patients and 24 885 KP patients with a mean age of 74.3 years (SD 5.8) and 72.3 years (SD 5.7), respectively. Among VA patients, when compared with higher A1c TIR (80–100%), lower A1c TIR (0% to < 20%) was associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.23) and cardiovascular outcomes (HR, 1.10; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.13). IV models showed similar associations. Among KP patients, lower A1c TIR (0% to < 20%) was associated with mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI 1.27 to 1.45). IV models showed associations with increased mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Among both VA and KP patients, greater A1c time below and time above range were associated with increased mortality.

Conclusions

A1c stability within patient-specific target ranges is associated with a lower risk of major adverse outcomes among older adults with diabetes.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^c1b9701b]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

The A1C assay is widely accepted and used as the most reliable means of assessing chronic glycemia. Its close association with risk for long-term complications, established in epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, has lead to the establishment of specific A1C targets for diabetes care with the goal of preventing or delaying the development of long-term complications (,–). Diabetes treatment is adjusted based on the A1C results, expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated. The vast majority of assays have been standardized worldwide, through the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program, to the assay used in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which established the relationship between A1C levels and risk for long-term diabetes complications.

A new, more stable and specific method of standardization of the A1C assay, which is not intended for use in routine assays, has been developed and proposed to be used for global standardization by the International Federation of Clinical Chemists. However, the new method results in values that are 1.5–2.0 percentage points lower than current National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program values, potentially causing confusion for patients and health care providers. Moreover, the International Federation of Clinical Chemists results would be expressed in new units (millimoles per mole), which would add to the confusion. Chronic glycemia (A1C) is usually expressed as a percentage of hemoglobin that is glycated, whereas the day-to-day monitoring and therapy of diabetes are based on acute glucose levels expressed as milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter. This discrepancy has always been problematic. If we could reliably report chronic metabolic control and long-term management goals as average glucose (AG), i.e. in the same units of measurement as acute glycemia, it would eliminate these potential sources of confusion.

The relationship between A1C and chronic glycemia has been explored in several studies that have supported the association of A1C with AG levels over the preceding 5–12 weeks. However, the older studies have been limited, including relatively small homogeneous cohorts of patients, usually with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, almost all of the prior studies have relied on infrequent measures of capillary glucose levels, calling into question the validity of their assessment of chronic glycemia. We performed an international multicenter study to examine the relationship between average glucose, assessed as completely as possible with a combination of continuous glucose monitoring and frequent fingerstick capillary glucose testing, and A1C levels over time to estimate the relationship between the two.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^d5f3c0ca]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control). (E)
Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. (E)
Use of point-of-care testing for A1C allows for timely decisions on therapy changes, when needed. (E)

Because A1C is thought to reflect average glycemia over several months, and has strong predictive value for diabetes complications, A1C testing should be performed routinely in all patients with diabetes at initial assessment and then as part of continuing care. Measurement approximately every 3 months determines whether a patient's glycemic targets have been reached and maintained. For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician. Some patients with stable glycemia well within target may do well with testing only twice per year, while unstable or highly intensively managed patients (e.g. pregnant type 1 women) may be tested more frequently than every 3 months. The availability of the A1C result at the time that the patient is seen (point-of-care testing) has been reported to result in increased intensification of therapy and improvement in glycemic control.

Preoperative glycemic targets for elective surgery — For adult patients with diabetes undergoing elective surgical procedures, we suggest targeting preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) and blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L), and when targeting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) is not feasible, we suggest targeting preoperative blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L). These recommendations apply only to scheduled elective procedures where time allows therapy implementation, and BG concentrations should be within the targeted range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours prior to surgery.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^aa2582f1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C testing for screening/diagnosis, discordance management, and assay requirements specifies that "Point-of-care A1C testing for diabetes screening and diagnosis should be restricted to devices approved for diagnosis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratories that perform testing of moderate complexity or higher by trained personnel", and instructs to "Evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results". In conditions with an altered A1C–glycemia relationship (e.g., some hemoglobin variants; pregnancy [second and third trimesters and the postpartum period]; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; HIV; hemodialysis; recent blood loss or transfusion; hemolysis; erythropoietin therapy), "plasma glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes". Methodologically, "The A1C test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)… and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) reference assay". For point-of-care use, "A1C assays may be NGSP certified and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in monitoring glycemic management" and "FDA-approved point-of-care A1C testing can be used in laboratories or sites that are CLIA certified, are inspected, and meet the CLIA quality standards", which "include… participation three times per year in an approved proficiency testing program".

Glycemic goals for nonpregnant adults are outlined in Recommendations 6.3a–6.3c. An A1C goal of < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for many nonpregnant adults without severe hypoglycemia or frequent hypoglycemia affecting health or quality of life (A). For people using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), a goal time in range of > 70% is appropriate for many nonpregnant adults (B), and a goal percent time < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L) of < 4% (or < 1% for older adults) and a goal percent time < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L) of < 1% are recommended in people using CGM to prevent hypoglycemia; Intensify or modify therapy if these goals are not met (B).

### Diabetes control and complications: the role of glycated haemoglobin, 25 years on… [^3286f3a6]. Diabetic Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The long-term complications of diabetes have major consequences for individual subjects and growing healthcare delivery and cost implications for society. Evidence for the benefits of good glycaemic control, as monitored by glycated haemoglobin measurements, has been developed in the 25 years since they were introduced to the point where HbA(1c) assays play central roles in patient management, clinical guidance and audit, and clinical trial design. In this review this evidence is examined and three classes of uncertainty identified that diminish confidence in the effectiveness of these roles for HbA(1c). 1 Analytical variability between different methods for HbA(1c) has restricted the application of clinical targets and this problem has recently been addressed by reference method standardization. There are two approaches to this which result in different HbA(1c) values and this discrepancy needs to be resolved. 2 Biological variability in HbA(1c) values between individuals also restricts its predictive role when applied to populations. The correlations between HbA(1c) measurements and various components of glycaemia (overall, fasting, postprandial) are still uncertain and differences in protein glycation and de-glycation are greater between subjects than often thought. The influence of variability in erythrocyte life span is an area where research is needed, especially in diabetic subjects. 3 Clinical variability is the most important and complex area of uncertainty. A predictive link between HbA(1c) and clinical outcomes is not as clear-cut as often stated. The correlation with the development of microvascular disease is well established in Type 1 diabetes, but in Type 2 subjects (90% of those with diabetes) the evidence that HbA(1c) monitoring is of value in predicting or preventing macrovascular disease is not strong, although it is the major cause of morbidity and early death in this group. It is recommended that, as a matter of urgency, these issues be examined, particularly within the context of self-care in diabetes.

### Quality of HbA1c measurement in the practice: the German perspective [^49529a3c]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement has come to be a cornerstone in modern diabetes therapy. However, the methodological aspects of this type of measurement have been given little attention lately due to its position as an established method of choice. Nevertheless, quite a number of issues face practical application, such as clinically relevant differences between different measurement methods — both lab-based and point-of-care (POCT) systems will show better or worse diabetes management results after switching methods; and there are a number of possible reasons that need to be known and observed in practice. The aim of this review is to draw attention to these problems from a German point of view and provide suggestions for appropriate measures to improve the situation.

### Comparison of point-of-care HbA1c test versus standardized laboratory testing [^622f8ce4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) evaluation is an accepted standard of care for assessing diabetes control. Point-of-care HbA1c monitors are relatively new, and there are few published data on their accuracy.

Objective

To compare a point-of-care HbA1c monitor with standardized laboratory testing.

Methods

Twenty-three patients who had type 1 or 2 diabetes were identified from our pharmacy-run diabetes clinic at a primary care clinic as needing HbA1c evaluation based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines. All patients with diabetes who attended our clinic were invited to participate in the study. Patients were required to obtain both a standardized laboratory HbA1c evaluation and a point-of-care A1c Now value within a week of each other. An analysis evaluating both clinical and statistical significance was completed at the end of the study.

Results

The A1c Now monitor showed good correlation (r = 0.758) to the standardized laboratory test. We found that the most accurate A1c Now values were within a range of 6–8%. One patient's value would have resulted in a different clinical decision if the decision were based on the A1c Now value.

Conclusions

It appears that A1c Now may provide adequate accuracy and be useful for some patients. The monitor would be most beneficial for patients who cannot obtain standardized laboratory values secondary to either financial or transportation constraints. However, the decision to make adjustments in therapy should not be based solely on the A1c Now point-of-care result.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^6a64d0e6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — diagnostic tests and recommendations state that "Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria", with plasma glucose criteria including the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crises (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]). Recommendation 2.1a (B) directs to "Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria" with these plasma glucose options, and recommendation 2.1b (B) states that "In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing"; additionally, "FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis".

### Glucose abnormalities detected by continuous glucose monitoring in very old adults with and without diabetes [^b25bfe0b]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize the prevalence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-defined glucose abnormalities in a large, community-based population of very old adults (> 75 years).

Research Design and Methods

A cross-sectional analysis of 1,150 older adults with and without diabetes who attended the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (2021–2022). Diabetes was based on a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes by a health care provider, use of diabetes medication, or a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%. Prediabetes was defined as an HbA1c of 5.7% to < 6.5% and normoglycemia as an HbA1c of < 5.7%. We analyzed CGM metrics, including mean glucose, measures of hyperglycemia, and the coefficient of variation, by diabetes status.

Results

Of the 1,150 participants (mean age 83 years, 59% women, 26% who are Black), 35.1% had normoglycemia, 34.5% had prediabetes, and 30.4% had diabetes. The summary 24-h ambulatory glucose profile for participants with prediabetes was very similar to those with normoglycemia. No participants with normoglycemia or prediabetes had a CGM mean glucose > 140 mg/dL, while 32.7% of participants with diabetes had a CGM mean glucose > 140 mg/dL.

Conclusions

In very old adults with normal or prediabetes HbA1c, hyperglycemia detected by CGM was rare. This suggests that HbA1c adequately captures the burden of hyperglycemia for most people in this population.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d48bd14e]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Serum glycated proteins as alternatives to A1C — Fructosamine and glycated albumin are alternative measures of glycemia that are approved for clinical use for monitoring glycemic status in people with diabetes and, due to serum protein turnover, reflect glycemia over the past 2–4 weeks. However, there have been few clinical trials and the evidence base supporting their use to monitor glycemic status is much weaker than that for A1C, though in people with diabetes where A1C interpretation may be problematic or when A1C cannot be measured (e.g., homozygous hemoglobin variants), fructosamine or glycated albumin may be useful alternatives to monitor glycemic status.

### Translating the A1c assay into estimated average glucose values [^149b410d]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our results strongly support a simple linear relationship between mean glucose and A1C levels in a clinically relevant range of glycemia. Our data fulfilled the a priori quality criterion; i.e. 90% of the estimates fell within the ± 15% range of the regression line. This criterion was considered realistic, allowing for the imprecision of the A1C assay, CGM, and self-monitored blood glucose tests.

The large population allowed us to demonstrate that the relationship between A1C and AG was consistent across prespecified subgroups. The tight relationship and the consistency of the relationship across different subgroups suggest that for many, if not most, patients with diabetes, there are no important factors that affect the relationship between mean glucose levels and A1C. There was a suggestion (P = 0.07) that the regression line was different for African Americans such that for a given value of A1C, African Americans might have a slightly lower mean glucose level. This borderline result requires further study to be confident that there is no relationship between ethnicity and the relationship between mean glucose and A1C. There was also a suggestion that age may affect the relationship between AG and A1C; however, the effect was not monotonic. The regression lines for each age-group crossed at A1C of 7%, with the first and last tertile being similar and the middle tertile being different. We suspect that this is a spurious finding. There are other well-recognized clinical factors, such as anemia and altered erythrocyte turnover, which can affect A1C results measured with all assay methods, and hemoglobinopathies, which interfere with the measurement of A1C with specific methods. Potential subjects with these conditions were excluded from the study.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^5eb155a8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Table 2.1 — Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals — Diagnosis can be established by any of the following: A1C ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h; 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or, in an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnoses require two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained at the same time (e.g. A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^045088ad]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The A1C test is subject to certain limitations. Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis, blood loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient's clinical situation. In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia. For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 patients, or type 2 patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of SMBG testing and the A1C. The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient's meter (or the patient's reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.

Table 8 contains the correlation between A1C levels and mean plasma glucose levels based on data from the international A1C-Derived Average Glucose (ADAG) trial utilizing frequent SMBG and continuous glucose monitoring in 507 adults (83% Caucasian) with type 1, type 2, and no diabetes The ADA and American Association of Clinical Chemists have determined that the correlation (r = 0.92) is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose (eAG) result when a clinician orders the A1C test. The table in previous versions of the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes describing the correlation between A1C and mean glucose was derived from relatively sparse data (one seven-point profile over 1 day per A1C reading) in the primarily Caucasian type 1 participants in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) trial. Clinicians should note that the numbers in the table are now different, as they are based on ∼2,800 readings per A1C in the ADAG trial.

In the ADAG study, there were no significant differences among racial and ethnic groups in the regression lines between A1C and mean glucose, although there was a trend toward a difference between African/African-American and Caucasian participants' regression lines that might have been significant had more African/African-American participants been studied. A recent study comparing A1C to CGM data in 48 type 1 children found a highly statistically significant correlation between A1C and mean blood glucose, although the correlation (r = 0.7) was significantly lower than in the ADAG trial. Whether there are significant differences in how A1C relates to average glucose in children or in African-American patients is an area for further study. For the time being, the question has not led to different recommendations about testing A1C or to different interpretations of the clinical meaning of given levels of A1C in those populations.

### Impact of HbA1c testing at point of care on diabetes management [^7a45fb25]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease also implicated in the development of several other serious complications like cardiovascular or renal disease. HbA1c testing is a vital step for effective diabetes management, however, given the low compliance to testing frequency and, commonly, a subsequent delay in the corresponding treatment modification, HbA1c at the point of care (POC) offers an opportunity for improvement of diabetes care. In this review, based on data from 1999 to 2016, we summarize the evidence supporting a further implementation of HbA1c testing at POC, discuss its limitations and propose recommendations for further development.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^7b699780]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

2. Reference intervals.

A laboratory should determine its own reference interval according to CLSI guidelines (CLSI Document C28A), even if the manufacturer has provided one. Nondiabetic test individuals should be nonobese, have an FPG concentration < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and, ideally, have a 2-h post-OGTT plasma glucose value of < 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). For NGSP-certified assay methods, reference intervals should not deviate substantially (e.g. > 0.5%) from 4%–6% (20–42 mmol/mol). Note that treatment target values recommended by the ADA and other clinical organizations, not reference intervals, are used to evaluate metabolic control in patients.

RECOMMENDATION: SAMPLES WITH HbA 1c RESULTS BELOW THE LOWER LIMIT OF THE REFERENCE INTERVAL OR > 15% HbA 1c SHOULD BE VERIFIED BY REPEAT TESTING B (low).

RECOMMENDATION: HbA 1c VALUES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER GPP.

3. Out-of-range samples.

A laboratory should repeat testing for all sample results below the lower limit of the reference interval, and if these results are confirmed, the physician should be informed to determine whether the patient has a variant Hb or shows evidence of erythrocyte destruction. If possible, the repeat HbA 1c measurement should be performed with a method based on an analytical principle that is different from the initial assay. In addition, samples with results > 15% HbA 1c (140 mmol/mol) should be assayed a second time; if the results are confirmed, the possibility of an Hb variant should be considered. Any result that does not correlate with the clinical impression should also be investigated.

4. Removal of labile GHb.

The formation of HbA 1c involves an intermediate Schiff base, which is called "pre-A 1c " or "labile A 1c ". This Schiff base is formed rapidly with hyperglycemia and can interfere with some HbA 1c assay methods if it is not completely removed or separated. Most currently available automated assays either remove the labile pre-HbA 1c during the assay process or do not measure the labile product.

### Time in range-A1c hemoglobin relationship in continuous glucose monitoring of type 1 diabetes: a real-world study [^f01e19cc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of easily accessible continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics can improve glycemic control in diabetes, and they may even become a viable alternative to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) laboratory tests in the next years. The REALISM-T1D study (REAl-Life glucoSe Monitoring in Type 1 Diabetes) was aimed at contributing, with real-world data, to a deeper understanding of these metrics, including the time in range (TIR)–HbA1c relationship, to facilitate their adoption by diabetologists in everyday practice.

Research design and methods

70 adults affected by type 1 diabetes were monitored for 1 year by means of either flash (FGM) or real-time (rtCGM) glucose monitoring devices. Follow-up visits were performed after 90, 180 and 365 days from baseline and percentage TIR 70–180 evaluated for the 90-day time period preceding each visit. HbA1c tests were also carried out in the same occasions and measured values paired with the corresponding TIR data.

Results

A monovariate linear regression analysis confirms a strong correlation between TIR and HbA1c as found in previous studies, but leveraging more homogeneous data (n = 146) collected in real-life conditions. Differences were determined between FGM and rtCGM devices in Pearson's correlation (r FGM = 0.703, r rtCGM = 0.739), slope (β 1, FGM = −11.77, β 1, rtCGM = −10.74) and intercept (β 0, FGM = 141.19, β 0, rtCGM = 140.77) coefficients. Normality of residuals and homoscedasticity were successfully verified in both cases.

Conclusions

Regression lines for two patient groups monitored through FGM and rtCGM devices, respectively, while confirming a linear relationship between TIR and A1c hemoglobin (A1C) in good accordance with previous studies, also show a statistically significant difference in the regression intercept, thus suggesting the need for different models tailored to device characteristics. The predictive power of A1C as a TIR estimator also deserves further investigations.

### Racial differences in the relationship of glucose concentrations and hemoglobin A1c levels [^777ff095]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Debate exists as to whether the higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels observed in black persons than in white persons are due to worse glycemic control or racial differences in the glycation of hemoglobin.

Objective

To determine whether a racial difference exists in the relationship of mean glucose and HbA1c.

Design

Prospective, 12-week observational study.

Setting

10 diabetes centers in the United States.

Participants

104 black persons and 104 white persons aged 8 years or older who had had type 1 diabetes for at least 2 years and had an HbA1c level of 6.0% to 12.0%.

Measurements

Mean glucose concentration, measured by using continuous glucose monitoring and compared by race with HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine values.

Results

The mean HbA1c level was 9.1% in black persons and 8.3% in white persons. For a given HbA1c level, the mean glucose concentration was significantly lower in black persons than in white persons (P = 0.013), which was reflected in mean HbA1c values in black persons being 0.4 percentage points (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points) higher than those in white persons for a given mean glucose concentration. In contrast, no significant racial differences were found in the relationship of glycated albumin and fructosamine levels with the mean glucose concentration (P > 0.20 for both comparisons).

Limitation

There were too few participants with HbA1c levels less than 6.5% to generalize the results to such individuals.

Conclusion

On average, HbA1c levels overestimate the mean glucose concentration in black persons compared with white persons, possibly owing to racial differences in the glycation of hemoglobin. However, because race only partially explains the observed HbA1c differences between black persons and white persons, future research should focus on identifying and modifying barriers impeding improved glycemic control in black persons with diabetes.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^aef9b564]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

### Point-of-care glucose and hemoglobin A1c in emergency department patients without known diabetes: implications for opportunistic screening [^2ffa4de4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to evaluate the correlation between random glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in emergency department (ED) patients without known diabetes and to determine the ability of diabetes screening in the ED to predict outpatient diabetes.

Methods

This was a cross-sectional study at an urban academic ED. The authors enrolled consecutive adult patients without known diabetes during eight 24-hour periods. Point-of-care (POC) random capillary glucose and HbA1c levels were tested, as well as laboratory HbA1c in a subset of patients. Participants with HbA1c ≥ 6.1% were scheduled for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Results

The 265 enrolled patients were 47% female and 80% white, with a median age of 42 years. Median glucose and HbA1c levels were 93 mg/dL (interquartile range [IQR] = 82–108) and 5.8% (IQR = 5.5–6.2), respectively. The correlation between POC and laboratory HbA1c was r = 0.96, with mean difference 0.33% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27% to 0.39%). Glucose threshold ≥ 120 mg/dL had 89% specificity and 26% sensitivity for predicting the 76 (29%) patients with abnormal HbA1c; ≥ 140 mg/dL had 98% specificity and 14% sensitivity. The correlation between random glucose and HbA1c was moderate (r = 0.60) and was affected by age, gender, prandial status, corticosteroid use, and current injury. Only 38% of participants with abnormal HbA1c returned for OGTTs; 38% had diabetes, 34% had impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance, and 28% had normal glucose tolerance.

Conclusions

ED patients have a high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Although screening with POC random glucose and HbA1c is promising, improvement in follow-up with confirmatory testing and initiation of treatment is needed before opportunistic ED screening can be recommended.

8. HbA 1c

a. HbA 1c should be measured routinely in all patients with diabetes mellitus to document their degree of glycemic control. A (moderate)

b. Laboratories should use only HbA 1c assay methods that are certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) as traceable to the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) reference. The manufacturers of HbA 1c assays should also show traceability to the IFCC reference method. GPP

c. Laboratories that measure HbA 1c should participate in a proficiency-testing program, such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) HbA 1c survey, that uses fresh blood samples with targets set by the NGSP Laboratory Network. GPP

d. Laboratories should be aware of potential interferences, including hemoglobinopathies, that may affect HbA 1c test results, depending on the method used. In selecting assay methods, laboratories should consider the potential for interferences in their particular patient population. In addition, disorders that affect erythrocyte turnover may cause spurious results, regardless of the method used. GPP

e. Desirable specifications for HbA 1c measurement are an intralaboratory CV < 2% and an interlaboratory CV < 3.5%. At least two control materials with different mean values should be analyzed as an independent measure of assay performance. B (low)

f. Samples with HbA 1c results below the lower limit of the reference interval or > 15% HbA 1c should be verified by repeat testing. B (low)

g. HbA 1c values that are inconsistent with the clinical presentation should be investigated further. GPP

h. Treatment goals should be based on American Diabetes Association recommendations, which include generally maintaining HbA 1c concentrations at < 7% and more-stringent goals in selected individual patients if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse treatment effects. Somewhat higher intervals are recommended for children and adolescents and may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, extensive comorbid illnesses, a history of severe hypoglycemia, or advanced complications (note that these values are applicable only if the NGSP has certified the assay method as traceable to the DCCT reference). A (high)

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to individualize glycemic goals prioritizing avoidance of hypoglycemia, with less stringent goals (HbA1c < 8.0% or < 64 mmol/mol and/or time in range 70–180 mg/dL or 3.9–10.0 mmol of 50% and time below range < 70 mg/dL or 3.9 mmol/L of < 1%) in older patients with significant cognitive and/or functional limitations, frailty, severe comorbidities, and a less favorable risk-to-benefit ratio of diabetes medications.
