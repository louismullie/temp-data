## Question

Three hours after undergoing a total right hip replacement, a 71-year-old woman has tingling around the lips and numbness in her fingertips. Her surgery was complicated by unintentional laceration of the right femoral artery that resulted in profuse bleeding. She appears uncomfortable. Examination shows an adducted thumb, extended fingers, and flexed metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists. Tapping on the cheeks leads to contraction of the facial muscles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A. Acute kidney injury
B. Calcium chelation
C. Intravascular hemolysis
D. Parathyroid ischemia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains perioral tingling, fingertip numbness, a positive Chvostek sign, and carpopedal spasm in a 71-year-old woman who had massive hemorrhage and resuscitation after a femoral artery laceration during total hip arthroplasty. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits hypocalcemia with neuromuscular irritability. Then, I should verify the most plausible cause of acute hypocalcemia in this perioperative context. Next, I will review why the alternative options do not fit the phenotype. Finally, I will confirm the pathophysiology and outline immediate management implications, making sure I double-check for confounders like hypomagnesemia that can perpetuate hypocalcemia.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern. Perioral paresthesias, distal extremity numbness, a positive Chvostek sign, and carpopedal spasm with wrist and metacarpophalangeal flexion and finger extension are classic for hypocalcemia-induced neuromuscular excitability, and the Trousseau sign, when elicited by brachial artery occlusion, reproduces this posture and is highly supportive of hypocalcemia rather than primary neuromuscular disease [^113Vbd5C] [^112fJ1Au].

> Now, I need to check the most likely etiology in this scenario. Massive hemorrhage and transfusion often trigger citrate toxicity because citrate in blood products chelates ionized calcium, acutely lowering Ca2+ and causing neuromuscular irritability; the FDA labeling repeatedly warns that citrate toxicity begins with perioral and extremity paresthesias and can progress to hypotension and arrhythmias, especially in patients with impaired hepatic clearance or low calcium stores, which fits this postoperative, likely hypothermic, elderly patient after large-volume transfusion [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn] [^113Vbd5C] [^112fmzWv] [^116VL8rn].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives before concluding. Acute kidney injury alone would not produce this tetanic phenotype, and there is no mention of oliguria or uremic features; intravascular hemolysis would more typically cause dark urine, jaundice, and hemodynamic instability rather than focal neuromuscular signs; parathyroid ischemia is a recognized cause of hypocalcemia, but there is no neck surgery here to implicate parathyroid injury, making citrate toxicity from transfusion the more parsimonious explanation in this hip arthroplasty with arterial injury and resuscitation [^114tFU9o] [^113Vbd5C].

> Hold on, I should verify the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Citrate rapidly complexes ionized calcium, transiently lowering the Ca2+ available for voltage-gated channels and excitation–contraction coupling, thereby increasing neuromuscular irritability; the resulting perioral and digital paresthesias, Chvostek sign, and carpopedal spasm are expected manifestations, and the risk is amplified by hypothermia, hepatic dysfunction, and preexisting low calcium, all plausible in a bleeding, transfused, older adult [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn] [^111baw7D] [^112fmzWv].

> I should double-check for confounders that can worsen or mimic this picture. Hypomagnesemia both increases neuromuscular irritability and impairs parathyroid responsiveness, so if symptoms persist despite calcium repletion, I need to check magnesium and correct it; that said, the immediate, classic hypocalcemic signs here strongly point to citrate-mediated ionized calcium depression from transfusions as the primary driver in this time frame [^115op6oZ] [^112fmzWv].

> Let me reconsider the full differential briefly to ensure I'm not missing a local nerve injury masquerading as tetany. Femoral or sciatic neuropathies from hematoma or traction would produce focal motor and sensory deficits in specific distributions, not the diffuse perioral and distal paresthesias and tetanic hand posture seen here; similarly, carpal tunnel syndrome would be limited to the median nerve territory and would not explain perioral symptoms or a positive Chvostek sign, reinforcing that the global neuromuscular excitability is metabolic rather than compressive or focal [^116Viobg] [^113XuvuK] [^1124tJA8].

> Next, I should review immediate management implications, even though the question is about etiology. Empirically, I would obtain ionized calcium and magnesium urgently, anticipate the need for intravenous calcium gluconate for symptomatic hypocalcemia, and ensure ongoing monitoring for citrate accumulation if transfusion continues; I also need to ensure warming, optimize hepatic perfusion, and consider calcium chloride if there is concurrent acidosis or if rapid correction is required, while watching for arrhythmias and laryngospasm that can complicate severe hypocalcemia [^1161QHsQ] [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn].

> Final answer: The most likely cause is calcium chelation from citrate toxicity due to massive transfusion after hemorrhage, which explains the acute hypocalcemic tetany with perioral and digital paresthesias, positive Chvostek sign, and carpopedal spasm in this postoperative patient [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn] [^111baw7D] [^112fmzWv].

---

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **calcium chelation** from citrate toxicity due to massive blood transfusion [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn]. Citrate, used as an anticoagulant in blood products, binds ionized calcium, causing **hypocalcemia** that presents with perioral tingling, fingertip numbness, and neuromuscular irritability (positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs) [^112fmzWv] [^113Vbd5C]. This matches the patient's presentation and the clinical context of profuse bleeding and transfusion [^112fmzWv].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms

The patient's clinical findings are **highly suggestive of hypocalcemia** secondary to citrate toxicity:

- **Perioral tingling and fingertip numbness**: Early symptoms of hypocalcemia due to increased neuromuscular excitability [^113Vbd5C].

- **Positive Chvostek sign**: Facial muscle contraction upon tapping the cheek, indicating increased neuromuscular irritability [^113Vbd5C].

- **Positive Trousseau sign**: Carpopedal spasm induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff, characteristic of hypocalcemia [^113Vbd5C].

- **Adducted thumb, extended fingers, flexed metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists**: Classic posture of carpopedal spasm due to hypocalcemia [^113Vbd5C].

---

## Pathophysiology of citrate toxicity

Citrate is used as an anticoagulant in blood products because it chelates calcium, preventing coagulation. Normally, the liver rapidly metabolizes citrate, but in massive transfusions — especially with hepatic dysfunction or hypothermia — citrate can accumulate and bind ionized calcium, causing **hypocalcemia** [^115FdHZi] [^116cDCUn]. Hypocalcemia increases neuromuscular excitability, causing paresthesia, muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias [^113Vbd5C].

---

## Clinical context and risk factors

The patient's clinical context significantly increases the risk of citrate toxicity:

- **Massive transfusion**: Profuse bleeding from femoral artery laceration likely necessitated large-volume blood transfusion, increasing citrate load [^111baw7D].

- **Hypothermia**: Common in massive transfusion scenarios, reducing hepatic citrate metabolism.

- **Impaired liver function**: Elderly patients may have reduced hepatic reserve, further impairing citrate metabolism [^115FdHZi].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While other differential diagnoses were considered, they are less likely given the clinical presentation and context:

| **Differential diagnosis** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| Acute kidney injury | - Typically presents with oliguria, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte disturbances <br/> - Not associated with neuromuscular irritability or positive Chvostek/Trousseau signs [^notfound] |
| Intravascular hemolysis | - Presents with hemoglobinuria, jaundice, and anemia <br/> - Does not typically cause neuromuscular irritability or positive Chvostek/Trousseau signs |
| Parathyroid ischemia | - Rare complication of thyroid surgery <br/> - Not associated with massive transfusion or femoral artery injury |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is **calcium chelation** from citrate toxicity due to massive blood transfusion [^notfound]. Immediate management should include:

- **Ionized calcium measurement**: Confirm hypocalcemia [^111xhqNU].

- **Calcium supplementation**: Intravenous calcium gluconate or chloride to correct hypocalcemia and relieve symptoms [^1161QHsQ].

- **Monitoring and supportive care**: Continuous cardiac monitoring, temperature correction, and supportive measures to address underlying causes [^notfound].

---

Calcium chelation from citrate toxicity is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, given the clinical presentation and context of massive transfusion [^112fmzWv].

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

Brown-Séquard Syndrome (BSS) is a rare form of incomplete spinal cord injury and is characterized by ipsilateral motor deficit and contralateral sensory loss. BSS is commonly associated with traumatic etiologies, but non-traumatic causes should be considered as well. A 38-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of weakness in her right upper extremity, and she has developed numbness and tingling in her left upper and lower extremities over the past week and a half, along with some motor difficulty. Imaging showed a large right paracentral disc protrusion at the C3-C4 level causing severe spinal canal narrowing and resulting in abnormal cord signal. The patient subsequently underwent a C3–4 cervical total disk replacement. Hemovac placed during surgery was removed on post-op day one, and she was re-evaluated by PT/OT and recommended for outpatient therapies on post-op day two. Our case, along with a review of the literature, highlights those non-traumatic causes of BSS should be considered as a cause of BSS. BSS produced by a herniated cervical disc is extremely rare and is often misdiagnosed.

### Hypoparathyroidism: a rare treatable cause of epilepsy-report of two cases [^113v1kuB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism occurs due to insufficient production of parathyroid hormone to maintain extracellular calcium levels within the normal range. The acute clinical symptoms and signs of hypoparathyroidism are those of hypocalcaemia, ranging from tingling and numbness of limb extremities to intractable seizures. Often seizures are mistaken for epilepsy. Though hypoparathyroidism is not uncommon, the diagnosis is often missed due to its unusual clinical manifestation. This is the first documented report with vitamin D, Parathormone levels and urinary biochemical parameters from India. We present two cases of hypoparathyroidism who presented with seizures along with a short review of literature.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^115Mikbc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC GRADING SYSTEM FOR TN

Possible TN.

The minimum requirements for possible TN are pain distribution within the facial or intraoral territory of the trigeminal nerve and a paroxysmal character of pain (figure 1). The examining physician must ascertain that the pain does not extend to the posterior third of the scalp, the back of the ear, or the angle of the mandible, as these territories are innervated by cervical nerves (figure 2). The territory of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve reaches to the cranium; a patient with TN in the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve may therefore describe pain both in the lower lip and the temple. If the neuralgia involves 2 trigeminal divisions, they should be contiguous; a combination of the maxillary and mandibular divisions is most frequent. TN in the ophthalmic division or the tongue tends to be considered an indication of TN secondary to a major neurologic disease. However, this interpretation has not been adequately scrutinized. It is further important to note that both the affected division of the trigeminal nerve and the side of the face may change over the course of the disease.

Figure 1
New classification and diagnostic grading system for trigeminal neuralgia (TN)

a TN is typically a unilateral condition. Few patients develop TN on both sides of the face over the course of a disease, e.g. in multiple sclerosis, but they virtually never present with simultaneous bilateral pain. b The pain strictly follows the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. It does not extend to the posterior third of the scalp, the posterior part of the external ear, or the angle of the mandible (figure 2). c Paroxysmal pain is the main complaint, but it may be accompanied by continuous pain. d Trigger maneuvers include innocuous mechanical stimuli, facial or oral movements, or complex activities such as shaving or applying make-up. Confined trigger zones and a common combination with brisk muscle contractions (tics) help distinguish triggered TN from allodynia in other conditions of neuropathic pain. Trigger maneuvers may be tested by the examiner. e MRI readily identifies major neurologic diseases, such as tumors of the cerebellopontine angle or multiple sclerosis. Other investigations may include the neurophysiologic recording of trigeminal reflexes and trigeminal evoked potentials, which become necessary in patients who cannot undergo MRI. f Advanced MRI techniques are capable of demonstrating neurovascular compression with morphologic changes of the trigeminal nerve root.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the injection of blood products containing citrate anticoagulant. The recipient of the blood product containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity. The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia, a "tingling" sensation around the mouth or in the extremities, followed by severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia. Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients who are hypothermic, have impaired liver or renal function, or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^115op6oZ]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical signs of magnesium deficiency

'… magnesium is essential for the normal metabolism of potassium and of calcium… the occurrence in clinical situations of otherwise unexplained hypokalemia and hypocalcemia should suggest the possibility of significant magnesium depletion'.

Among the most common laboratory signs of magnesium deficiency are low potassium and calcium levels, as well as low urine and/or faecal magnesium. The most common neurological side effect with magnesium depletion is the Trousseau sign; that is, 'To elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 min. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct'. Other signs of magnesium deficiency included tremor, fasciculations ('a brief spontaneous contraction that affects a small number of muscle fibres'., spontaneous carpopedal spasm (painful cramps of the muscles in your hands and feet) and generalised spasticity. Other clinical features of magnesium deficiency include mental disturbances such as depression, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, weakness, neuromuscular irritability (tremor), athetoid movements and convulsive seizures.

Main text

Diagnosing hypocalcaemia

Calcium homeostasis is mediated by the effect of active vitamin D (calcitriol) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of calcium, renal excretion of calcium, and osteoclast/osteoblast activity in the skeleton (which is the main calcium sink in the body). Consequently, hypocalcaemia has many potential causes, such as vitamin D deficiency (which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism), abnormal magnesium or phosphate levels, and partial or complete hypoparathyroidism. Hypocalcaemia can range in severity from mild asymptomatic cases to acute life-threatening crises; the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) define grades of hypocalcaemia from mild (grade 1) to severe (grade 5) (Table 1).

Table 1
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading of hypocalcaemia

LLN lower limit of normal

Extracellular calcium is required for the normal functioning of muscles and nerves. Thus, signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia include muscle twitching, spasms, tingling, and numbness, and patients with severe hypocalcaemia may develop tetany, seizures, and cardiac dysrhythmias. The development of neuromuscular excitability depends on both the absolute concentration of calcium and how rapidly the concentration has fallen. Patients who experience a rapid fall in serum calcium concentration are often symptomatic, whereas those who develop hypocalcaemia gradually may be asymptomatic, with hypocalcaemia being diagnosed as an incidental biochemical finding. However, if asymptomatic hypocalcaemia is not treated, long-term consequences can include neuropsychiatric symptoms, cataract formation, and raised intracranial pressure. Such cases predominantly occur in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^112zMx6A]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — best-practice documentation advises that in the course of the examination and episode of care, clinicians should document results of the following questions, tests, and measures; upon completion of the clinical patient/client data, clinicians should differentiate CTS from other nerve injuries and then assess the CTS severity to determine if an immediate surgical referral is warranted. Patients may require electrodiagnostic studies when the clinical exam is inconclusive, and when assessing effectiveness of nonsurgical management, results should be documented again at discharge or at other follow-up point. Documentation of standard elements supports standardization for quality improvement in clinical care and research.

### Role of preoperative nerve conduction studies for penetrating hand injuries involving the median palmar cutaneous nerve [^112XrDYB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Report

The patient is a 42-year-old right hand-dominant woman who sustained a penetrating injury along the radial aspect of the left distal forearm/radial wrist caused by an accidental knife injury 2 days before presentation. The trajectory and depth of the injury extended toward the midline of the distal volar forearm. The patient presented to the emergency department that day where the wound was irrigated and sutured. On presentation in our office, the patient reported persistent pain across the radial aspect of the left wrist/distal forearm with radicular symptoms up the arm, numbness in the thenar eminence, and volar-radial wrist, and occasional pins and needles in the fingers. Functionally, she had difficulty opening her medication bottles and driving, secondary to pain.

Physical examination was notable for a 2 cm longitudinal laceration at the left radial wrist (Figure 1) along with diffuse paresthesias in the left median nerve distribution. Thumb to small finger opposition was 2 cm on the left and 0 cm on the right. Distance to palmar crease was within 0 for all fingers bilaterally. Given the patient's clinical examination, there was suspicion for median nerve and/or median or radial nerve branch injury and surgery was recommended. However, given the diffuse nature of the paresthesias and unclear involvement of median nerve, PCB mdn, or dorsal radial sensory nerve, preoperative neurodiagnostic testing was obtained to determine the location and extent of nerve injury more precisely.

### Clinical reasoning: a 65-year-old woman with cancer history and wrist drop [^1132B1co]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Wrist drop is a common presentation in neurology. To localize the lesion, clinicians can focus on testing finger extension, elbow flexion with semipronated forearm, and elbow extension among other muscle groups and identifying dermatomes of numbness. Once the lesion is localized, electrophysiology or imaging can guide to an underlying etiology. Here, we describe a case that illustrates the importance of using a stepwise approach to diagnose the etiology of wrist drop in a patient with a cancer history. A 65-year-old woman with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in remission presented with new onset wrist drop, severe pain, numbness, and tingling concerning for peripheral nerve injury. Imaging findings from PET, venous ultrasound, nerve conduction velocity study, and MRI were conflicting favoring deep venous thrombosis, cancer recurrence, or peripheral nerve sheath tumor. A biopsy was ultimately required to confirm the diagnosis.

### Foscarnet sodium (foscarnet) [^115Rfhk7]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Renal Impairment

THE MAJOR TOXICITY OF FOSCARNET IS RENAL IMPAIRMENT (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Renal impairment is most likely to become clinically evident during the second week of induction therapy, but may occur at any time during foscarnet treatment. Renal function should be monitored carefully during both induction and maintenance therapy (see PATIENT MONITORING section). Elevations in serum creatinine are usually, but not always, reversible following discontinuation or dose adjustment of foscarnet. Safety and efficacy data for patients with baseline serum creatinine levels greater than 2.8 mg/dL or measured 24-hour creatinine clearances < 50 mL/min are limited.

SINCE FOSCARNET HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE RENAL IMPAIRMENT, DOSE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON SERUM CREATININE IS NECESSARY. Hydration may reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. It is recommended that 750–1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution should be given prior to the first infusion of foscarnet to establish diuresis. With subsequent infusions, 750–1000 mL of hydration fluid should be given with 90–120 mg/kg of foscarnet, and 500 mL with 40–60 mg/kg of foscarnet. Hydration fluid may need to be decreased if clinically warranted.

After the first dose, the hydration fluid should be administered concurrently with each infusion of foscarnet.

Mineral and Electrolyte Abnormalities

Foscarnet has been associated with changes in serum electrolytes including hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section). Foscarnet may also be associated with a dose-related decrease in ionized serum calcium which may not be reflected in total serum calcium. This effect is likely to be related to chelation of divalent metal ions such as calcium by foscarnet. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of low ionized calcium such as perioral tingling, numbness in the extremities and paresthesias. Particular caution and careful management of serum electrolytes is advised in patients with altered calcium or other electrolyte levels before treatment and especially in those with neurologic or cardiac abnormalities and those receiving other drugs known to influence minerals and electrolytes (see PATIENT MONITORING and Drug Interactions sections). Physicians should be prepared to treat these abnormalities and their sequelae such as tetany, seizures or cardiac disturbances. The rate of foscarnet infusion may also affect the decrease in ionized calcium. Therefore, an infusion pump must be used for administration to prevent rapid intravenous infusion (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). Slowing the infusion rate may decrease or prevent symptoms.

### Omeprazole, sodium bicarbonate (omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate) [^114ZFuh5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate

for oral suspension and capsules, for oral use

What is the most important information I should know about Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate?

Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate may help your acid-related symptoms, but you could still have serious stomach problems. Talk with your doctor.

Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate can cause serious side effects, including:

A type of kidney problem (acute tubulointerstitial nephritis). Some people who take proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medicines, including Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate, may develop a kidney problem called acute tubulointerstitial nephritis that can happen at any time during treatment with Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate. Call your doctor right away if you have a decrease in the amount that you urinate or if you have blood in your urine.
Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate contains sodium bicarbonate. Long-term use of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause a condition called "milk-alkali syndrome". Long-term use of sodium bicarbonate can cause a condition called "systemic alkalosis". Talk to your doctor about any questions you may have. Too much sodium can cause swelling and weight gain. Tell your doctor if you are on a low-sodium diet or if you have Bartter's Syndrome (a rare kidney disorder). Tell your doctor right away if you have confusion, shaking hands, dizziness, muscle twitching, nausea, vomiting, and numbness or tingling in the face, arms, or legs.
Diarrhea caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines. Call your doctor right away if you have watery stools or stomach pain that does not go away. You may or may not have a fever.
Bone fractures (hip, wrist, or spine). Bone fractures in the hip, wrist or spine may happen in people who take multiple daily doses of PPI medicines and for a long period of time (a year or longer). Tell your doctor if you have bone fracture, especially in the hip, wrist, or spine. Certain types of lupus erythematosus. Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disorder (the body's immune cells attack other cells or organs in the body). Some people who take PPI medicines, including Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate, may develop certain types of lupus erythematosus or have worsening of the lupus they already have. Call your doctor right away if you have new or worsening joint pain or a rash on your cheeks or arms that gets worse in the sun.

### The tinel sign: a historical perspective [^115nszFM]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The Tinel sign is one of the most well-known and widely used clinical diagnostic tools in medicine. Aside from Jules Tinel, after whom the sign is named, several authors have described the famous "tingling" sign seen in regenerating injured nerves. In fact, Tinel was not the first to present the sign to the scientific community. The clinical value and utility of the Tinel sign have remained in question since its introduction; many may misinterpret the sign as a prelude to complete functional recovery of injured nerves, when in fact it only signals the progress of nerve regeneration. Today the Tinel sign is widely associated with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and in the evaluation of regenerating peripherally injured nerves. Knowledge of the history and misconceptions surrounding the sign provides clinicians today with a greater appreciation of current debates on the use of the Tinel sign.

If you take apixaban tablets and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots or bleeding. Tell your doctor right away if you have tingling, numbness, or muscle weakness, especially in your legs and feet.

- apixaban tablets is not for use in people with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), especially with positive triple antibody testing, who have a history of blood clots.

What are apixaban tablets? Apixaban tablets are a prescription medicine used to:

- reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation.

- reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery.

- treat blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or lungs (pulmonary embolism), and reduce the risk of them occurring again.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — symptoms and signs — Hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular excitability and cardiac electrical instability with early symptoms of paresthesias of the perioral region and fingertips, along with muscle stiffness, cramps, and spasms; neuropsychiatric symptoms include confusion, anger, depression, lightheadedness, and irritability. Classic bedside findings include a positive Chvostek sign, which is present at baseline in up to 25% of people, and a positive Trousseau sign described as flexion of the wrist, thumb, and metacarpophalangeal joints with hyperextension of the fingers during brachial artery occlusion. Progressive hypocalcemia can prolong the QT interval leading to torsades de pointes that may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.

### Hip arthroscopy… [^116vAHY6]. Wikipedia (2011). Low credibility.

This approach, although considered generally safe, carries with it inherent risks, which is the case with all large incision surgery. The risks of infection and blood clots are always present, and Ganz and his colleagues cite complications such as heterotopic ossification, nerve injuries, failure of the greater trochanter to heal back properly, persistent pain following the formation of scar tissue in the hip joint, and a small risk of damage of the blood supply to the femoral head. The patient usually needs to stay in hospital for a few days, and the post-operative rehabilitation after such extensive surgery can be prolonged. As a result, surgeons have looked to use the arthroscope more extensively in the hip joint in an attempt to avoid the possible pitfalls of large, open surgery. The perceived advantages of this are the avoidance of large scars, decreased blood loss, faster recovery periods and less pain.

Hip arthroscopy can be performed as an outpatient procedure. This leads to joint damage as a result of the non-spherical femoral head being forced into the acetabulum mainly with flexion and/or internal rotation. This may impart compression and shear forces to the articular cartilage, and may lead to labral tears and peeling away of the articular cartilage from the underlying bone, so-called cartilage delamination. Standard arthroscopic treatment of symptomatic cam FAI involves debridement or repair of any labral and chondral injuries in the central compartment of the hip, and subsequent reshaping of the head-neck junction of the upper femur in the peripheral compartment using high-speed motorised burrs that are similar in design to a dentist's drill.

This results in contact of the femoral neck against the labrum and rim of the acetabulum during hip movement earlier than might otherwise be the case. Repeated contact between the femoral neck and the edge of the acetabulum may lead to damage to the labrum and adjacent articular cartilage. Bone formation, or ossification within the labrum may be commonly seen as a result of this repeated contact. It is thought that this type of impingement may also predispose to the development of osteoarthritis. The goal of the arthroscopic treatment of pincer impingement is to reduce the acetabular over coverage of the hip. Methods to reduce this over coverage of the ball by the socket include labral detachment or peel back, acetabular rim trimming using burrs, often reattaching the labrum with anchors at the end of the procedure.

With the exception of cases of severe global over coverage of the hip, or situations in which the existing labrum has turned to bone, excessive acetabular rim resection should be avoided in order to prevent iatrogenic increases in hip joint contact pressures. The labrum has also been shown to have a nerve supply and as such may cause pain if damaged. The underside of the labrum is continuous with the acetabular articular cartilage so any compressive forces that affect the labrum may also cause articular cartilage damage, particularly at the junction between the two, the chondrolabral junction. The labrum may be damaged or torn as part of an underlying process, such as FAI or dysplasia, or may be injured directly by a traumatic event. Depending on the type of tear, the labrum may be either trimmed or repaired.

### Raynaud's phenomenon – or just skin with dye? [^114qNoau]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Munchausen's syndrome is a factitious disorder resulting in unnecessary investigations and operative treatments in a small and well-defined population. Autobiographical falsification is the characteristic of the entity. The case history is presented of a 28-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department with severe pain of acute onset in her fingers and discoloration while washing dishes. She had been diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon and had been on antiepileptic drugs. The fingertips of both hands looked cyanotic. Radial and ulnar pulses were intact. She had argued with the personnel obtaining vital signs and had a tendency to hide her right hand, which raised the suspicion that a psychiatric disorder was the primary cause of the visit to the emergency department. A blue piece of dirt on the left shoulder had also augmented these concerns. Munchausen's syndrome was suspected after careful handshaking with hands soaked in alcohol resulted in a blue discoloration on the doctor's palm and fingers. Emergency and primary care physicians should be alert to this type of situation, with a myriad possible scenarios to be differentiated from real conditions.

### Hip replacement… [^1174G5To]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Risks Risks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all joint replacements. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death. Weight loss surgery before a hip replacement does not appear to change outcomes. Edema appears around the hip in the hours or days following the surgery. This swelling is typically at its maximum 7 days after the operation, then decreases and disappears over the course of weeks. Only 5% of patients still have swelling 6 months after the operation. Dislocation Dislocation is one of the most common complications. Hip prosthesis dislocation mostly occurs in the first three months after insertion, mainly because of incomplete scar formation and relaxed soft tissues.

The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the cut tissue is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used. Surgeons who perform more operations tend to have fewer dislocations. Important factors which are related to dislocation are: component positioning, preservation of the gluteal muscles and restoration of leg length and femoral offset. Keeping the leg out of certain positions during the first few months after surgery further reduces risk. Dislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles. Risk factors of late dislocation mainly include: Infection Infection is one of the most common causes for revision of a total hip replacement. A 2009 study found that the incidence of infection in primary hip replacement was 1% or less in the United States.

Risk factors for infection include obesity, diabetes, smoking, immunosuppressive medications or diseases, history of infection and previous hip surgery. Limb length inequality Most adults have a limb length inequality of 0–2 cm which causes no deficits. It is common for people to sense a larger limb length inequality after total hip replacement. Sometimes the leg seems long immediately after surgery when in fact both are equal length. An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by six months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint.

The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than six months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction. The perceived difference in limb length for a patient after surgery is a common cause for lawsuits against the healthcare provider. Fracture Intraoperative fractures may occur. After surgery, bones with internal fixation devices in situ are at risk of periprosthetic fractures at the end of the implant, an area of relative mechanical stress. Post-operative femoral fractures are graded by the Vancouver classification. Vein thrombosis Venous thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relatively common following hip replacement surgery.

1 Introduction

Parathyroidectomy is a surgery to remove one or more parathyroid glands in a patient with hyperparathyroidism. It is considered the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. According to the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons' guidelines (AAES), the first indication for parathyroidectomy is symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. However, asymptomatic patients' management is still not clear. On the other hand, one of the major postoperative complications is hypocalcemia. The incidence of post‐parathyroidectomy hypocalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism is variable, with some investigators reporting a range of 12%–70%.

There was controversy over finding an agreed definition of hypocalcemia. Siyam et al. and Cooper et al. defined hypocalcemia as total serum calcium less than 2.10 mmol/L. At the same time, Pathy et al. assigned a hypocalcemia cutoff of 2.15 mmol/L. On the other hand, Pepe et al. defined it as corrected total serum calcium levels less than 2.12 mmol/L (8.5 mg/dL); however, measurement of ionised calcium (normal values of 1.17–1.33 mmol/L) is the gold standard for diagnosis in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Other studies defined hypocalcemia by determining cut‐off points accompanied by specific conditions (symptomatic patients, abnormal PTH, requiring treatment, duration).

Persistent hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia that develop as a consequence of comprehensive re‐mineralisation of the skeletal system after PTH suppression are considered a critical complications of parathyroidectomy. Hypocalcemia after parathyroidectomy was attributed to the rapid skeletal uptake of calcium as a result of a sudden decline in the highly elevated PTH levels. This decline was believed to induce suppression of bone resorption on top of enhanced bone formation. Symptomatic hypocalcemia patients may present with seizures, tetany, numbness, tingling, perioral paresthesia, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and laryngospasm.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is defined as long‐term excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as a result of an adenoma, hyperplasia, or, rarely, carcinoma. It is considered the third most common endocrine disease, with an incidence ranging from 4 to 112 per 100,000 in the USA. In addition, impaired renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients or vitamin D deficiency can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).

### Hypoparathyroidism [^114tFU9o]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion of blood products to patients. The recipient of the blood containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity. The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia, a "tingling" sensation around the mouth or in the extremities, followed by severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia. Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients who are hypothermic, have impaired liver or renal function, or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease.

The main symptoms are numbness and tingling of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the thumb side of the ring finger, as well as pain in the hand and fingers. Symptoms are typically most troublesome at night. Many people sleep with their wrists bent, and the ensuing symptoms may lead to awakening. People wake less often at night if they wear a wrist splint. Untreated, and over years to decades, CTS causes loss of sensibility, weakness, and shrinkage of the thenar muscles at the base of the thumb. Work-related factors such as vibration, wrist extension or flexion, hand force, and repetitive strain are risk factors for CTS. Other risk factors include being female, obesity, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, and genetics. Prolonged pressure can lead to a cascade of physiological changes in neural tissue. First, the blood-nerve barrier breaks down.

If the pressure continues, the nerves will start the process of demyelination under the area of compression. This will result in abnormal nerve conduction even when the pressure is relieved leading to persistent sensory symptoms until remyelination can occur. If the compression continues and is severe enough, axons may be injured and Wallerian degeneration will occur. At this point there may be weakness and muscle atrophy, depending on the extent of axon damage. Severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients may have degree II/III injuries, or axonotmesis, where the axon is injured partially or fully. With axon injury, there would be muscle weakness or atrophy, and with no further compression, the nerves may only partially recover. Signs and symptoms The characteristic symptom is numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring finger. These areas process sensation through the median nerve.

Numbness or tingling is usually worse with sleep. People tend to sleep with their wrists flexed, which increases pressure on the nerve. Ache and discomfort may be reported in the forearm or even the upper arm. Symptoms that are not as characteristic of CTS include pain in the wrists or hands, loss of grip strength, minor loss of sleep, and loss of manual dexterity. Severe CTS is associated with measurable loss of sensibility. As the median neuropathy progresses, there is loss of sensibility in the thumb, index, middle, and the thumb side of the ring finger. As the neuropathy progresses, there may be first weakness, then atrophy of the muscles of thenar eminence. The sensibility of the palm remains normal because the superficial sensory branch of the median nerve branches proximal to the transverse carpal ligament and travels superficial to it.

Median nerve symptoms may arise from nerve compression at the level of the thoracic outlet or the area where the median nerve passes between the two heads of the pronator teres in the forearm, although this is debated. Severe CTS is also associated with weakness and atrophy of the muscles at the base of the thumb. The ability to abduct the thumb may be lost. Prior carpal tunnel release is often noted in individuals who later present with transthyretin amyloid-associated cardiomyopathy. There is consideration that bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome could be a reason to consider amyloidosis, timely diagnosis of which could improve heart health. Amyloidosis is rare, even among people with carpal tunnel syndrome. In the absence of other factors associated with a notable probability of amyloidosis, it is not clear that biopsy at the time of carpal tunnel release has a suitable balance between potential harms and potential benefits.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion and return of blood containing citrate anticoagulant. The recipient of the blood containing citrate should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity. The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia, a "tingling" sensation around the mouth or in the extremities, followed by severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia. Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients who are hypothermic, have impaired liver or renal function, or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease.

### Management of carpal tunnel syndrome [^112RDizr]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome affects approximately 3 percent of adults in the United States. Pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve are the classic symptoms. While Tinel's sign and a positive Phalen's maneuver are classic clinical signs of the syndrome, hypalgesia and weak thumb abduction are more predictive of abnormal nerve conduction studies. Conservative treatment options include splinting the wrist in a neutral position and ultrasound therapy. Orally administered corticosteroids can be effective for short-term management (two to four weeks), but local corticosteroid injections may improve symptoms for a longer period. A recent systematic review demonstrated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pyridoxine, and diuretics are no more effective than placebo in relieving the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. If symptoms are refractory to conservative measures or if nerve conduction studies show severe entrapment, open or endoscopic carpal tunnel release may be necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome should be treated conservatively in pregnant women because spontaneous postpartum resolution is common.

Case presentation

A healthy 38-year-old man, presented with problems of occasional pain in his right wrist and tingling sensations in his right thumb, index and middle finger for a duration of 6 weeks. The symptoms had an insidious onset and progressed gradually over 6 weeks when the patient sought medical attention. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, multiple joint pain or morning stiffness. He had no history of any other medical illness. Physical examination revealed a mild, diffuse fullness over the volar aspect of the wrist. Mild tenderness was present on deep palpation. There was no local rise in temperature. Resisted active finger flexion elicited pain over the wrist. Tinel's sign was positive for the median nerve and Phalen's test was positive. The range of motion at the wrist was comparable to the left wrist. There was no hypoesthesia or motor weakness on the neurological examination.

Jersey finger — mechanism, presentation, and diagnosis describe flexor digitorum profundus tendon avulsion most common with contact sports when an athlete grasps an opponent's jersey, causing the finger to suddenly and forcibly extend against active flexion; this hyperextension causes the tendon to tear away from its insertion at the distal phalanx, and the injury can be purely tendinous or an avulsion fracture, most commonly occurs in the ring finger, and presents with pain, swelling, and inability to make a full fist due to failure to flex the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. A positive sweater finger sign is diagnostic, defined by inability to flex the DIP joint when the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints are held in extension, and a palpable lump on the volar side can indicate a retracted tendon.

Two Irish women presented with difficulty in completion of hair straightening, limited by upper limb dysaesthesiae due to claudication or brachial plexus entrapment induced by sustained shoulder abduction beyond 90 degrees. The first described arm pain precipitated by elevation and sustained abduction above shoulder level, particularly while using her GHD hair-straightener. Elevated arm stress test was positive and a left cervical rib was seen on chest x ray. Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) was diagnosed and the cervical rib was resected. The second described arm tingling and weakness when performing tasks involving shoulder abduction and elevation, limiting GHD use to 10 min before having to rest. Upper limb blood pressure and pulses were undetectable. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated and flow on radial Doppler disappeared on abduction and elevation of each arm. A CT pulmonary angiography demonstrated features of Takayasu's arteritis. Vascular TOS was diagnosed. Symptoms resolved with corticosteroids, followed by long-term immunosuppression and anti-coagulation.

### Perioperative symptoms in patients with thyroid cancer: a cross-sectional and longitudinal network analysis [^1161QHsQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to surgery, patients primarily experienced a loss of appetite due to anxiety and metabolic disorders. However, in the early postoperative period, they faced new challenges, with Numbness/tingling in the hands/feet becoming the core symptoms of stage T2. During this period, most of the patient's discomfort is directly caused by the surgical stimulus. Postoperative numbness/tingling in extremities may arise from surgical impact on parathyroid function, causing transient hypoparathyroidism. This often induces hypocalcemia, which directly triggers these symptoms. It is recommended that clinical preventive monitoring and early identification be conducted: routinely monitor blood calcium levels postoperatively and closely observe patients for early signs of hypocalcemia, such as numbness around the mouth and tingling in the fingertips. Develop a calcium supplementation plan based on blood calcium levels and symptom severity: Mild/asymptomatic hypocalcemia can be treated with oral calcium supplements and active vitamin D. Moderate to severe hypocalcemia or the presence of tetany requires intravenous calcium supplementation. And the surgical position of the thyroid is the neck hyperextension position, which may pull or compress the brachial plexus nerve, causing transient brachial plexus palsy, resulting in numbness of the upper extremities after surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to assess whether numbness is accompanied by motor impairment in order to identify the possibility of brachial plexus traction injury. Patients should engage in safe neck and upper limb movements under the guidance of professionals in the early postoperative period, avoiding excessive stretching. Physical therapy or acupuncture may be used to relieve numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.

### A new clinical sign of lumbrical plus Finger [^115bBYoU]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Paradoxical finger extension is the classical clinical presentation of the lumbrical plus syndrome. We report a new additional sign, increased metacarpophalangeal flexion of the involved finger when the patient tries to make a fist. Three cases of lumbrical tightness are discussed, illustrating this new sign in 3 different clinical settings. The new sign was present in all 3 cases. Lumbrical tenotomy corrected the paradoxical interphalangeal extension and partly the increased metacarpophalangeal flexion. The lumbrical tendon has a relatively high moment arm relative to the metacarpophalangeal joint, which could explain the basis of this clinical sign. This new physical examination sign may help in diagnosing the lumbrical plus syndrome, a subtle complication of flexor digitorum profundus lesions that is not easily diagnosed but which is easily addressed.

Case 2

A 75-year-old man with history of myelodysplastic syndrome presented 5 days following a right total knee arthroplasty with persistent fevers and purulent drainage along with superficial sloughing at the surgical site. Despite negative wound cultures and antibiotic coverage, he continued to spike fevers to 102 °F and had leukocytosis of 12.73 × 1000/mm 3. Dermatology was consulted.

Skin examination was notable for an exquisitely painful surgical wound on his right knee. Repeat wound cultures were negative. No biopsy was taken due to the assessment that the blistering was superficial. With consistent wound care, the patient's fevers, skin lesions, and knee pain resolved over 4 weeks.

Three years after the initial episode, a similar wound complication developed with persistent fevers after right femoral artery access during a cardiac catheterization. He had not received any prophylaxis prior to the procedure. Dermatology was consulted, and punch biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of SS. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids and dapsone 100 mg daily led to rapid resolution of erythema and pain. Two months later, he received IV methylprednisolone as prophylaxis prior to his transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The procedure was successful, and he did not experience any recurrence of SS.

Case 3

A 38-year-old healthy woman presented 6 days following left carpal tunnel release for severe edema and erythema of the left hand and wrist. She additionally had fevers, leukocytosis of 22 × 1000/mm 3, and lack of clinical improvement following multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement. Wound and blood cultures were negative. Dermatology was consulted, and the patient was diagnosed with necrotizing SS. She improved with prednisone 60 mg daily. One month later, her prednisone taper was extended in anticipation of her split thickness skin graft, with prednisone 20 mg daily given 3 days prior followed by a 14 day taper afterward. She tolerated the procedure with no SS recurrence.

Three months following the initial episode, she underwent electromyography without medication prophylaxis and did not develop any SS recurrence.

Five months following the initial episode, she underwent C4-C5 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with prednisone 60 mg daily starting 3 days before surgery, IV methylprednisolone the day of, and prednisone taper afterward. She did not experience any SS recurrence.

### Submassive pulmonary embolism with a right heart thrombus [^112FbjQk]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 49-year-old woman presented to the hospital with shortness of breath 2weeks after a left total hip replacement. She was found to have a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE), with her case complicated by the detection of a large mobile clot in transit extending through a patent foramen ovale between the right and left atria. The presence of this free-floating right heart thrombus (FFRHT) increases her risks of stroke and mortality, yet the optimal approach to her treatment was unclear. Ultimately, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered with resolution of the clot. Treatment was complicated by haemodynamically insignificant bleeding at the site of recent surgery. Herein, we further discuss the implications and treatment options for patients with an FFRHT in the setting of an acute PE.

### The value added by electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome [^111tezJT]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 6 (CTS-6)" for carpal tunnel syndrome.

The CTS-6, or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 6, is a clinical calculator used specifically for patients suspected of having Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS). This scoring system is designed to aid in the diagnosis of CTS, a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm.

The CTS-6 score is calculated based on six items: pain distribution, nocturnal symptoms, weakness or atrophy of the thenar eminence, Tinel's sign, Phalen's sign, and loss of two-point discrimination in the median nerve distribution. Each item is scored as either 0 or 1, with a higher total score indicating a higher likelihood of CTS.

The clinical utility of the CTS-6 is to provide a standardized, objective measure to assist in the diagnosis of CTS, which can be particularly useful in early or borderline cases. It can also be used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the CTS-6 include patients with other conditions that can mimic CTS, such as cervical radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy, or other types of peripheral nerve entrapment. Additionally, it may not be as accurate in patients with severe CTS,

The CTS-6 calculator is a tool designed to gauge the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome based on inputs related to symptoms and diagnostic tests. Users respond to six questions, and each positive answer contributes to a total score that reflects the possibility of having the condition. Here's how it works:

Each potential symptom or test response is assigned a specific point value:

- Numbness in the median nerve territory (thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers): 3.5 points
- **Prominent nocturnal numbness, often waking from sleep**: 4 points
- **Thenar atrophy or weakness in muscle strength**: 5 points
- A positive Phalen test (wrist flexion worsening median nerve numbness): 5 points
- Loss of 2-point discrimination (difficulty distinguishing two points < 5 mm apart): 4.5 points
- A positive Tinel sign (tingling with tapping over median nerve): 4 points

Users indicate the presence or absence of these clinical indicators. For each "yes" response, the designated score is added up to form a total, which can range from 0 to 26.

Interpretation of the calculated score is straightforward:

- With a total score of 12 or higher, there is a high probability (about 80%) of carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Scores ranging from 5 to 11.5 suggest a moderate probability, between 25% and 80%.
- Scores of 4.5 or lower indicate a lower probability, around 25%.

The score helps clinicians and patients discuss the likelihood of carpal tunnel syndrome by consolidating the significance of each symptom and test result into a singular, interpretable metric.

### Proximal muscle weakness [^1128NTy8]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

A 38-year-old woman gave a 1-year history of difficulties climbing stairs and walking long distances, needing a wheelchair at times. More recently, she had also experienced weakness of her arms with difficulties doing her hair or lifting light weights. She reported shortness of breath on mild exertion and had lost 12 pounds in weight because of muscle loss. She had no muscle pain, episodes of dark urine, muscle twitching, visual disturbances, hearing loss, speech difficulties, dysphagia, numbness or tingling, bladder or bowel difficulties, fevers, rash or joint pain. She had met all milestones at a normal age and had normal development.

Her medical history was unremarkable. She had not taken any lipid-lowering agents and there was no illicit drug use or toxic exposure. There was no relevant family history and no consanguinity.

On examination, she showed bilateral and symmetric scapular winging. There was no percussion or action myotonia or paramyotonia, and no fasciculations. Her muscle bulk and tone were normal. Cranial nerves were all normal. Manual muscle strength testing showed the following Medical Research Council (MRC) grades (right/left where applicable): neck flexion 4–, neck extension 5, shoulder abduction 4/4, external rotation of elbow 4/4, elbow flexion 4/4, elbow extension 4+/4+, wrist flexion 5/5, wrist extension 5/5, finger flexion 5/5, finger extension 5/5, hip flexion 4/4, hip extension 3/3, hip abduction 3/3, knee extension 4+/4+, knee flexion 4/4, ankle dorsiflexion 5/5 and ankle plantar flexion 5/5. Deep tendon reflexes were 1+ at triceps, brachioradialis and ankles, and 2+ at biceps and knees bilaterally. She had a waddling gait. Plantar responses were flexor. Sensory and coordination exams were normal.

### Peripheral neuropathy… [^114N9Qa5]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Common causes include systemic diseases, hyperglycemia-induced glycation, vitamin deficiency, medication), traumatic injury, ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or viral infection. Neuropathy may cause painful cramps, fasciculations, muscle loss, bone degeneration, and changes in the skin, hair, and nails.

Additionally, motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or, most commonly, muscle weakness; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration, reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance, reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain, spontaneous tingling or burning pain, or allodynia; and autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms, depending on the affected glands and organs, but common symptoms are poor bladder control, abnormal blood pressure or heart rate, and reduced ability to sweat normally. The effect of this is to cause symptoms in more than one part of the body, often symmetrically on the left and right sides.

As for any neuropathy, the chief symptoms include motor symptoms such as weakness or clumsiness of movement; and sensory symptoms such as unusual or unpleasant sensations such as tingling or burning; reduced ability to feel sensations such as texture or temperature, and impaired balance when standing or walking. In many polyneuropathies, these symptoms occur first and most severely in the feet. Autonomic symptoms also may occur, such as dizziness on standing up, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty controlling urination. Polyneuropathies usually are caused by processes that affect the body as a whole. Diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are the most common causes. Hyperglycemia-induced formation of advanced glycation end products is related to diabetic neuropathy.

Other causes relate to the particular type of polyneuropathy, and there are many different causes of each type, including inflammatory diseases such as Lyme disease, vitamin deficiencies, blood disorders, and toxins. Most types of polyneuropathy progress fairly slowly, over months or years, but rapidly progressive polyneuropathy also occurs. It is important to recognize that at one time it was thought that many of the cases of small fiber peripheral neuropathy with typical symptoms of tingling, pain, and loss of sensation in the feet and hands were due to glucose intolerance before a diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes. Electrodiagnostic medicine studies will show multifocal sensory motor axonal neuropathy. It is caused by, or associated with, several medical conditions: Neuritis Neuritis is a general term for inflammation of a nerve or the general inflammation of the peripheral nervous system.

### Hand pain and sensory deficits: carpal tunnel syndrome [^1178or92]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Carpal tunnel syndrome — Tinel sign diagnostic performance indicates lower sensitivity than specificity across sources: A pooled analysis reported sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 77%, respectively, based on 27 studies including 2640 CTS cases and 1614 controls, with specificity decreasing to 65% in symptomatic individuals with negative electrodiagnostic tests; another analysis reported sensitivity 39%–50% and specificity 65%–100%, and agreement between Tinel sign and nerve conduction study (NCS) results was substantial (k = 0.71).

The causes of such neuropathy can stem from both direct and indirect injuries, pressures and diseases. Physical examinations are usually first carried out, depending on the high severity of the injury. In the cases of patients with hemorrhage, imaging techniques are used before any physical examination. Another diagnostic method, electrodiagnostic studies, are recognized as the gold standard that is used to confirm the injury of the femoral nerve. After diagnosis, different treatment methods are provided to the patients depending upon their symptoms in order to effectively target the underlying causes. Currently, femoral neuropathy is highly underdiagnosed and its precedent medical history is not well documented worldwide. The femoral nerve travels posterior to the inguinal ligament within the muscular lacuna which contains the iliopsoas muscle.

It travels along with the femoral artery, vein and lymphatics in the femoral triangle which allows the supply of oxygenated blood to maintain its motor and sensory functions. For its motor sensory, the nerve controls the major hip flexor muscles as well as knee extension muscles to allow movement of the hips and straightening of the leg. As for its sensory processing, it has control over the anterior and medial thigh as well as the medial leg down to the hallux, providing sensation to the front of the thigh and part of the lower leg. Signs and symptoms Those with femoral nerve dysfunction may present problems of difficulties in movement and a loss of sensation. The patient, in terms of motor skills, may have problems such as quadriceps wasting, loss of knee extension and a lesser extent of hip flexion given the femoral nerve involvement of the iliacus and pectineus muscles.

One may experience numbness and tingling in any part of the leg, typically in the front and the inside of one's thighs and down to the feet. They may also experience a dull ache in the genital region given that the inguinal ligament is actually divided into the femoral and genital branches. Feelings of the patient's leg and knees giving out may also be prevalent due to lower extremity muscle weakness and quadriceps weakness. In terms of sensory skills, patients may observe a decrease in sensation over the front and medial sections of the thigh and medial aspects of the lower legs and feet due to their involvement of the anterior and medial cutaneous nerves of the thigh and the saphenous nerve respectively. Causes The symptoms of femoral neuropathy are due to either specifically just the femoral nerve or several damaged nerves. This local cause of damage to just the femoral nerve is termed mononeuropathy.

Although damage to the femoral nerve is uncommon due to its location, there are numerous risk factors including injuries, prolonged pressure and damage from diseases that can still lead to such neuropathy. These include:

- A direct physical sharp trauma, which is the most common etiology
- A tumor or other growth blocking or trapping part of the nerve.
- Intra abdominal, hip and other injuries and operations due to prolonged compression, retraction or stretching of the nerve, such as:

- Pelvic fracture
- Pelvic radiation therapy
- A catheter placed in the femoral artery
- Proximal interlocking screw placement through femoral IM nailing
- Growth of masses on the muscles in the thigh
- Bleeding in the abdomen
- Tumor or growth on the kidneys
- Complex anterior and posterior spinal surgery.
- Hemorrhage
- **Diabetes**: most common reason for peripheral neuropathy in people with diabetes for more than 25 years.

### Massive transfusion protocol in a 69 year old woman with alloantibodies [^112ua1X4]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Unlike routine blood transfusions that are managed by attending providers and rely on compatibility testing, massive transfusions are managed by the trauma team members, who usually do not have immediate access to compatibility testing. Incompatible C or E antigens, when present in uncrossmatched O positive blood, require transfusion support so that health care professionals can manage potential causes for extravascular hemolysis. Herein, we describe a massive transfusion situation in which immediate patient management was required to mitigate potentially fatal clinical consequences of transfused red blood cell antibodies. In addition, this case study shows how the utility of chemistry and hematology laboratory results can illustrate the complexities of massive transfusion management in the context of incompatible C or E antigens.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion of blood products containing citrate anticoagulant1. 9 11. The recipient of the citrated blood product should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity1. 9 11. The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia, a "tingling" sensation around the mouth or in the extremities, followed by severe reactions that are characterized by chills, stomach cramps, or pressure in the chest, followed by more severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia1. 9 11. Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients that are hypothermic10, have impaired liver or renal function10, or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease9.
