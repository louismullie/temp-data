## Question

Antihypertensive for renal hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antihypertensive management in "renal hypertension", spanning CKD-related hypertension and renovascular disease, with a clear stepwise plan that includes first-line choices, combination therapy, resistant hypertension, device and revascularization options, monitoring, and BP targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the phenotype and confirming the diagnosis. Then, I should verify initial pharmacologic choices by albuminuria status. Next, I will consider combination therapy and how to intensify safely. After that, I need to check the resistant hypertension pathway, including MRAs and candidacy for renal denervation. I will then examine renovascular disease and indications for revascularization. Finally, I should confirm safety monitoring, individualized BP targets, special populations, and end with a succinct algorithm and pitfalls, making sure each step aligns with high-credibility guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm terminology so I don't conflate distinct entities under "renal hypertension". Hypertension in CKD (with or without albuminuria), renovascular hypertension due to renal artery stenosis, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis are overlapping but mechanistically distinct, so I need to stage CKD (eGFR) and categorize albuminuria, verify diabetes status, and confirm true hypertension with standardized office and preferably ambulatory or home measurements, while also screening for resistant hypertension and secondary contributors such as NSAIDs and decongestants that elevate BP or blunt therapy, including when to image for renovascular disease with renal ultrasound/Doppler or CT/MR angiography when indicated [^116Uiyap] [^111b7tZD] [^1136t7QG].

> I will now examine first-line therapy in CKD with albuminuria because renoprotection beyond BP lowering is crucial here. For CKD with moderately or severely increased albuminuria (A2/A3), I should initiate a RAAS inhibitor (ACE inhibitor or ARB), as consistently recommended by KDIGO 2021, JNC 8, and primary care guidance; the AASK trial further reinforces ACE inhibitor renoprotection in hypertensive nephrosclerosis, particularly when proteinuria is present [^1131CjHu] [^117Qk1GA] [^115eF8X2] [^116VhNKh] [^113hhZjA] [^116gsgXk].

> Hold on, let me verify what to do when albuminuria is minimal or absent. In CKD without albuminuria (A1), there is no strong renoprotective advantage of RAAS blockade over other classes for kidney outcomes, so any guideline-endorsed first-line agent is reasonable (thiazide-like diuretic, dihydropyridine CCB, ACE inhibitor, or ARB), with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications; this aligns with ESC 2024, ESH 2023, and prior US guidance [^116Uiyap] [^111b7tZD] [^111b7tZD].

> Next, I should review combination therapy because most patients with CKD require two or more agents to reach targets. A standard backbone pairs a RAAS blocker with a dihydropyridine CCB and then adds a thiazide-like diuretic, and single-pill combinations can improve adherence and BP control in routine care, which is emphasized in recent European guidance for efficiency and adherence [^116Uiyap] [^111b7tZD].

> Let me think about stepwise intensification so I don't miss a sequencing nuance. If BP remains uncontrolled on a RAAS inhibitor, I should add a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB such as amlodipine, and if still uncontrolled, add a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlorthalidone or indapamide rather than hydrochlorothiazide due to greater potency and durability; this stepwise approach is recommended in ESC 2024 and supported by comparative pharmacologic reviews highlighting differential class and within-class effects [^116Uiyap] [^114yMY2E] [^111Me3C9].

> I should double-check that I am not inadvertently recommending harmful combinations. Dual RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitor plus ARB or adding a direct renin inhibitor to an ACE inhibitor/ARB is discouraged given lack of mortality benefit and elevated risks of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury seen in meta-analyses and regulatory reviews, so I will avoid that strategy entirely in CKD and renovascular phenotypes [^111Z3zt7] [^notfound].

> Now, I need to ensure I define and confirm resistant hypertension properly before escalating. True resistant hypertension means uncontrolled BP despite optimized doses of a RAAS blocker, a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, and a thiazide-like diuretic, after confirming adherence, excluding white-coat effect with ABPM/HBPM, removing BP-raising drugs, and evaluating for secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnea, and renovascular disease, consistent with ESH 2023 and nephrology practice synopses [^111b7tZD] [^114mZvNb] [^113RrpeN].

> For fourth-line therapy, I should confirm candidacy for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism. Spironolactone is the preferred next step for resistant hypertension if potassium is acceptable and eGFR permits, with careful potassium and creatinine monitoring and consideration of patiromer in CKD to mitigate hyperkalemia risk per AMBER; alternatives include amiloride, beta-blockers, alpha-1 blockers, or centrally acting agents when MRAs are not tolerated or contraindicated, which aligns with ESH 2023 and ERA synopses [^113ehTpj] [^114mZvNb].

> But wait, I should also consider device-based therapies only in properly selected patients. Renal denervation can be considered when eGFR is greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m² and BP remains uncontrolled despite combination therapy, or when drug intolerance limits quality of life; contemporary trials show consistent reductions in ambulatory BP, though sham-controlled variability complicates effect size estimation on background medication, and guideline endorsements remain selective and adjunctive, not first-line [^111b7tZD] [^117FvCcJ] [^112nsARW] [^114su84Y].

> Next, I should review renovascular disease specifically so I don't over- or under-treat. For atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, optimal medical therapy is foundational, and revascularization should be reserved for high-risk presentations such as flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension with high-grade stenosis (generally ≥ 70%), rapid loss of kidney function, or bilateral disease/solitary kidney with critical stenosis; routine revascularization has not improved major outcomes over medical therapy in trials including CORAL, whereas selected high-risk phenotypes appear to benefit observationally [^1115xpxa] [^115jTENw] [^115q2btt].

> I need to check safety monitoring when starting or uptitrating RAAS blockade in CKD and particularly in suspected renovascular disease. A creatinine rise up to approximately 30% and a mild potassium increase can be hemodynamic and acceptable; however, a greater than 30% decline in eGFR should prompt evaluation for bilateral renal artery stenosis, volume depletion, or other contributors, and significant hyperkalemia or symptomatic hypotension requires dose adjustment or cessation, in keeping with KDIGO and renovascular practice recommendations [^1131CjHu] [^115eF8X2] [^1115xpxa].

> Hold on, I should verify MRA monitoring cadence since hyperkalemia risk is nontrivial in CKD. After initiating or increasing spironolactone, I should check potassium and creatinine at approximately 1, 4, and 12 weeks, reducing dose or adding a potassium binder for K 5.5–6.0 mmol/L and discontinuing if K exceeds 6.0 mmol/L; the AMBER data and ERA synopsis underscore both efficacy and the need for proactive hyperkalemia mitigation in CKD [^114mZvNb].

> Let me reconsider diuretic selection across eGFR strata so I don't inadvertently under-diurese. Thiazide-like diuretics remain effective down to an eGFR near 30 mL/min/1.73 m², below which loop diuretics are preferred for volume management; careful titration and attention to sodium intake are essential in volume-expanded phenotypes common in CKD and renovascular hypertension, consistent with nephrology pharmacology guidance [^115qWDuQ] [^114yMY2E].

> I should double-check BP targets because an overly aggressive target may harm kidney perfusion in CKD. Although I initially thought to push for SBP less than 120 mmHg based on SPRINT, wait, that would be a mistake in most CKD since SPRINT excluded diabetes and significant proteinuria and was not powered for kidney outcomes; ESH 2023 synopses advise targeting office SBP below 130 mmHg if tolerated, and they explicitly do not recommend a routine SBP target below 120 mmHg in CKD, balancing cardiovascular benefit against renal hemodynamics and patient heterogeneity [^1112BQLb] [^116vyvd4].

> Next, I should review special populations to individualize therapy. In African American patients with proteinuric CKD, ACE inhibitor therapy demonstrated superior renoprotection in AASK, often necessitating higher diuretic doses for salt sensitivity; in diabetic CKD with albuminuria, KDIGO recommends ACE inhibitor or ARB initiation, while low-renin phenotypes may respond better to thiazide-like diuretics and CCBs, which warrants considering aldosteronism workup where appropriate [^116gsgXk] [^117Qk1GA] [^115Ewkok].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the final algorithm mirrors major guidelines. Assess CKD stage, albuminuria, diabetes, confirm hypertension with ABPM/HBPM; start ACE inhibitor or ARB for A2/A3 albuminuria and consider thiazide-like diuretics or CCBs for A1; titrate every 4 weeks; add a dihydropyridine CCB, then a thiazide-like diuretic; if still uncontrolled, confirm true resistance and add spironolactone if potassium allows; consider renal denervation when eGFR is greater than 40 mL/min/1.73 m² and medical therapy is truly inadequate or intolerable; monitor eGFR, potassium, and BP closely; target SBP under 130 mmHg if tolerated, avoiding routine SBP under 120 mmHg in CKD, all aligned with ESC 2024, ESH 2023, and KDIGO 2021 [^116Uiyap] [^111b7tZD] [^1131CjHu].

> Finally, I should confirm key pitfalls to avoid harm. Do not combine ACE inhibitor and ARB or add direct renin inhibition to RAAS blockade due to excess adverse events; do not stop RAAS inhibition for a creatinine rise under 30% without another red flag; do not pursue routine revascularization for asymptomatic or low-grade ARVD; do not add spironolactone without a monitoring plan; and do not overlook BP-raising medications like NSAIDs that can undermine control and create pseudo-resistance, as these cautions are consistently emphasized across the evidence base and guidelines [^111Z3zt7] [^1131CjHu] [^115jTENw] [^114mZvNb] [^112LryqS].

For renal hypertension, **ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line** [^1131CjHu] because they lower blood pressure and provide renal protection [^116VhNKh], especially in proteinuric CKD [^113hhZjA]. Monitor for a **≥ 30% rise in creatinine or hyperkalemia** after starting therapy [^1131CjHu] [^1115xpxa], and avoid dual ACEi/ARB use [^111Z3zt7]. Add a **calcium channel blocker** or **thiazide diuretic** if needed [^116Uiyap], and use loop diuretics in advanced CKD [^115qWDuQ]. Beta-blockers or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are options for resistant hypertension [^113ehTpj]. Revascularization is reserved for refractory cases or rapid renal decline [^1115xpxa], and renal denervation is considered only in resistant hypertension with eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m² [^111b7tZD] [^114su84Y].

---

## First-line antihypertensive therapy

- **ACE inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: These are the preferred initial therapy for renal hypertension due to their dual effect of lowering blood pressure and providing renal protection, particularly in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD) [^1131CjHu] [^113hhZjA]. ACEis and ARBs reduce intraglomerular pressure, proteinuria, and slow CKD progression [^115eF8X2].

- **Monitoring and precautions**: After initiating ACEis or ARBs, closely monitor renal function and serum potassium levels [^1131CjHu]. A rise in serum creatinine up to 30% from baseline is acceptable; however, increases beyond this threshold or significant hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mmol/L) necessitate dose adjustment or discontinuation [^1115xpxa].

- **Avoidance of dual RAAS blockade**: Combining ACEis and ARBs is not recommended due to increased risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal impairment without additional clinical benefit [^111Z3zt7] [^113ipxvw].

---

## Adjunctive antihypertensive agents

When ACEis or ARBs alone fail to reach target blood pressure, **add another antihypertensive class** [^116Uiyap]:

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Particularly dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. amlodipine) are effective adjuncts, especially in patients with CKD or those intolerant to ACEis/ARBs [^116Uiyap].

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Useful in early-stage CKD (eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) to manage volume overload and enhance antihypertensive efficacy [^115qWDuQ].

- **Loop diuretics**: Preferred in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) due to superior efficacy in managing fluid overload.

- **Beta-blockers**: Considered in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease or resistant hypertension [^113ehTpj].

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**: Spironolactone or eplerenone are effective in resistant hypertension but require careful monitoring for hyperkalemia, particularly in CKD patients [^114mZvNb].

---

## Special considerations in renal hypertension management

- **Bilateral renal artery stenosis**: ACEis and ARBs can precipitate acute renal failure in bilateral renal artery stenosis. Initiate therapy cautiously with close monitoring of renal function [^1158GvHE].

- **Resistant hypertension**: Defined as uncontrolled blood pressure despite optimal doses of three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic [^113ehTpj]. In such cases, MRAs, beta-blockers, or centrally acting agents (e.g. clonidine) may be added [^113RrpeN].

- **Renal denervation**: Considered in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR > 40 mL/min/1.73 m² who remain uncontrolled despite multiple antihypertensive agents or experience significant side effects [^111b7tZD] [^114su84Y].

---

## Role of revascularization

Revascularization (angioplasty or stenting) is **reserved for specific clinical scenarios**, such as refractory hypertension despite optimal medical therapy [^1115xpxa], rapidly declining renal function, or recurrent flash pulmonary edema [^111FbFMq]. Recent guidelines emphasize that most patients with renal hypertension can be effectively managed with medical therapy alone, with revascularization limited to high-risk cases [^115jTENw] [^112jEytt].

## Summary of antihypertensive therapy for renal hypertension

| **Drug class** | **Indication** | **Monitoring** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACEis/ARBs | First-line therapy | Renal function, potassium | Avoid dual blockade |
| CCBs | Adjunctive therapy | Blood pressure | Peripheral edema |
| Thiazide diuretics | Early CKD | Electrolytes | Ineffective in advanced CKD |
| Loop diuretics | Advanced CKD | Electrolytes | Hypokalemia |
| Beta-blockers | Resistant HTN, CVD | Heart rate | Bradycardia |
| MRAs | Resistant HTN | Potassium | Hyperkalemia |

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the **preferred initial therapy** for renal hypertension, with careful monitoring of renal function and potassium levels [^1131CjHu]. Adjunctive antihypertensive agents, including calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, beta-blockers, and MRAs, are added as needed to achieve blood pressure targets [^116Uiyap]. Revascularization is reserved for refractory cases, and renal denervation is considered in resistant hypertension with preserved renal function [^1115xpxa] [^111b7tZD].

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^111Z3zt7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials reported between January 1990 and August 2012 compared dual blockers of the RAS with monotherapy, reporting data on either long-term efficacy (≥ 1 year) or safety events (≥ 4 weeks), with a sample size of at least 50 (68,405 patients [mean age 61 years, 71% men] and mean duration of 52 weeks). The study showed that although dual blockade of the RAS had seemingly beneficial effects on certain surrogate endpoints, it failed to reduce mortality and was associated with an excessive risk of adverse events such as hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure compared with monotherapy.

The results of this most comprehensive meta-analysis at the time indicated that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual therapy. Based on these study results, the EMA recently started a review of the risks of combining certain medicines to block separate stages of the RAS in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.

Selection of the most appropriate antihypertensive combination should depend on a careful review of the individual patient and appropriate consideration of drug pharmacology. Existing evidence suggests that in cardiovascular high-risk patients and those with evidence of renal disease, the use of an ARB plus calcium channel blocker is the preferred combination. This preference is due to superior renoprotective and cardiovascular benefits and reduced metabolic side effects in patients with concomitant metabolic disorders.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^116NdMvi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Renin inhibitors, which inhibit the first and rate-limiting step in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are thought to be more effective than other RAS inhibitors in blocking the RAS. Previous meta-analyses have shown that these inhibitors have a favorable tolerability profile in people with mild-to-moderate hypertension and exhibit a blood-pressure-lowering magnitude similar to that of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ARBs inhibit the RAS by interfering with the binding of angiotensin II with its receptors and are widely prescribed and recommended as first-line therapy by some hypertension guidelines. However, the efficacy of a drug in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ARBs in treating hypertension are still unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to angiotensin receptor blockers in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: On 26 January 2024, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials: Cochrane Hypertension's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) were also searched for ongoing trials. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

### Impact of antihypertensive medication changes after renal denervation among different patient groups: SPYRAL HTN-ON MED [^117FvCcJ]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control rates in the treated hypertensive population are below 50% and contribute substantially to global morbidity and mortality, despite the availability of safe and effective drug therapies. Within the United States, hypertension disproportionately affects Black Americans, highlighting the potential benefit of adjunctive therapies to augment drugs and lifestyle modification, especially in socioeconomic groups with unequal access to health care. Several recent clinical trials have shown highly consistent reductions in both office and ambulatory BP following catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) in untreated patients with hypertension compared with the sham control group. Likewise, BP reductions following RDN have been consistent in patients simultaneously treated with antihypertensive drugs. However, several on-medication trials of RDN have shown variable BP changes following randomization in the sham control group, obfuscating the comparative efficacy of RDN therapy in the presence of antihypertensive medications.

In particular, primary analysis of the randomized sham-controlled SYMPLICITY HTN-3 (Renal Denervation in Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension) trial showed similar BP reductions in the RDN-treated and sham control groups. A further subanalysis identified several potential confounding factors that may have contributed to the neutral result, including changes in adherence to antihypertensive drugs during the follow-up period in the sham group. Recent results from the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED (Global Clinical Study of Renal Denervation) further elucidate these dynamics.

### Endovascular intervention in renovascular disease: A pictorial review [^1115Cjw6]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite the use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes or hypertension requiring four or more medications for effective management. RH affects 9% of all hypertensive patients and 13% of those receiving antihypertensive therapy, placing these patients at an increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events.

Various factors, including renal artery stenosis, have been implicated in the development of RH. Physiologically, RH has been associated with elevated activity in both the efferent and afferent renal sympathetic nerves. Fittingly, renal denervation is an emerging endovascular treatment modality in the management of this disease. The denervation procedure involves the delivery of catheter-based radiofrequency ablation through the main renal artery. Thermal energy generated in this process acts to effectively disrupt the sympathetic nerves in the adventitia, thus decreasing vascular tone.

While studies are ongoing, suggested indications for renal denervation include patients with uncontrolled systolic blood pressure (> 160 mmHg; > 150 mmHg in diabetics) despite optimized lifestyle factors and antihypertensive medications (> 3 synergistic drugs). Studies comparing the effectiveness of renal sympathetic denervation to standard medical therapy have demonstrated contradictory results. Early nonrandomized studies and randomized, unblinded trials have shown significant blood pressure reduction in denervation patients, with a BP reduction of 33/11 mmHg at 6 months.

For patients with hypertension, particularly those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2014 JNC 8 guidelines recommend initiating an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as the initial or add-on antihypertensive treatment. This approach is aimed at improving kidney outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of race or diabetes status.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically concerning the choice of antihypertensives and subsequent therapy, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend intensifying treatment to a three-drug combination. This typically involves a renin-angiotensin system blocker, a dihydropyridine CCB, and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, preferably in a single-pill combination, if blood pressure is not controlled with a two-drug combination.

### Intracranial pressure during the development of renovascular hypertension [^112W7t5Y]. Hypertension (2021). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) has been the subject of substantial research, particularly its role in the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension. Research has detailed how the mechanics of ICP fluctuate during the onset and progression of this condition, with significant implications for patient management and therapeutic intervention. The investigation into the correlation between ICP and systemic blood pressure can illuminate potential treatment pathways.

Evidence shows that variations in blood flow and vessel resistance are intimately linked to ICP changes in patients dealing with renovascular hypertension. Understanding these physiological interactions is crucial in the development of effective treatment protocols aimed at regulating blood pressure and mitigating related complications.

Overall, it is essential to continue exploring the comprehensive physiological changes associated with renovascular hypertension to enhance clinical outcomes for affected patients.

### Update on low-renin hypertension: Current understanding and future direction [^115Ewkok]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Low-renin hypertension is a common condition affecting 1 in 4 people with hypertension. Understanding the different causes and management of low-renin hypertension is becoming increasingly relevant as renin measurements are more widely ordered in clinical practice. Importantly, many people with low-renin hypertension do not fit traditional definitions of known causes, and the approach to management of these people is unclear. This review provides an overview of our evolving understanding of the causes of low-renin hypertension, the expanding spectrums of pathophysiology, key differentiating characteristics, distinct management strategies, and highlights our knowledge gaps. It is important to distinguish the underlying pathophysiology of an individual with low-renin hypertension to individualize treatment.

### Angiotensin inhibition in renovascular disease: a population-based cohort study [^116gFspx]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers effectively reduce blood pressure in patients with renovascular disease (RVD); yet, randomized cardiovascular prevention trials of these drugs typically exclude individuals with this condition.

- **Patients and methods**: We studied the association of renin-angiotensin system inhibition with prognosis in a population-based cohort comprising 3,570 patients with RVD in Ontario, Canada. Slightly more than half (n = 1,857, 53%) were prescribed angiotensin inhibitors. The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary outcomes included individual cardiovascular and renal events.

- **Results**: Patients receiving angiotensin inhibitors had a significantly lower risk for the primary outcome during follow-up (10.0 vs. 13.0 events per 100 patient-years at risk, multivariable adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.82). In addition, hospitalization for congestive heart failure (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53–0.90), chronic dialysis initiation (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42–0.92), and mortality (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47–0.68) was lower in treated patients. Conversely, patients receiving angiotensin inhibitors were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for acute renal failure during follow-up (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.05–3.33; 1.2 vs. 0.6 events per 100 patient-years at risk).

- **Conclusions**: These data emphasize the high vascular risk of RVD and suggest that angiotensin inhibitors may improve prognosis in this setting at the expense of acute renal toxicity.

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^116vyvd4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

Taking these largely indirect findings together and considering that, at least after the development of proteinuria, the progression of kidney injury tends to follow the same course in different situations. The 2023 ESH Guidelines suggest that the BP target for proteinuric nondiabetic CKD applies to patients with proteinuric diabetic kidney disease as well. For both patient categories, a target SBP of 30 mg/g may be associated with a reduction in mortality in most patients with CKD.

Particularly in patients with advanced CKD (G4 and G5), careful monitoring of eGFR is recommended because a further functional, but reversible, decline of GFR may occur on a lower BP. Finally, most of the patients with CKD have CV comorbidities that require respective target BP values to be considered. Thus, these CV comorbidities, rather than CKD protection, may primarily guide the target BP in an individual patient.

However, the 2023 ESH Guidelines acknowledge that these recommendations have a number of limitations:

- **Trials exclusion**: None of the trials comparing different BP targets included patients with both diabetes and CKD, thus evidence cannot be readily extrapolated to this subpopulation.
- **MDRD and AASK trials**: These trials randomized participants to different mean BP levels, which cannot be readily extrapolated to SBP and DBP values. They also recruited patient populations of a relatively young age (mean age 51.7 and 54.6 years).

### A European renal association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1112BQLb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). High credibility.

The 2023 ESH guidelines suggest that the results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) have little relevance to the question discussed herein. SPRINT randomized 9,361 hypertensive patients of increased cardiovascular (CV) burden to intensive (target systolic blood pressure [SBP] < 120 mmHg) versus standard (target SBP < 140 mmHg) treatment arms. Notably, individuals with proteinuria > 1 g/day or > 1 g/g were excluded. Importantly, diabetes mellitus (DM), the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and prior stroke were also exclusion criteria.

In the overall trial, although the primary composite outcome of CV events, as well as CV and total mortality, were significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group compared to the standard-treatment group, kidney outcomes did not differ between the two groups. A sub-analysis of the SPRINT chronic kidney disease (CKD) subpopulation showed no difference between groups in the primary outcome or in the pre-specified kidney outcome, but there was a lower total mortality rate in participants in the intensive blood pressure (BP) arm. These results must be interpreted with caution because the SPRINT trial was not designed or powered to study kidney outcomes. Consequently, this resulted in an extremely small number of kidney events (15 vs. 16 in the two groups).

Following the above, the 2023 ESH guidelines indicate that a recommendation to target office SBP < 120 mmHg in persons with CKD cannot be made. The reasoning is that the only relevant findings are derived from this hypothesis-generating sub-analysis of the SPRINT trial.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^111FbFMq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

In addition to the above, several reports of individual cases and cohorts showed that patients with high-risk presentations of AVRD (such as flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function) benefited the most from revascularization. These patients often have nearly occluded renal arteries, bilateral RAS, or single RAS with a solitary kidney, and revascularization had immediate beneficial effects with substantial decreases in BP and significant improvement in kidney function. Following the publications of relevant RCTs that almost entirely excluded patients with ARVD and high-risk clinical presentations, as discussed in detail below, several observational cohort studies examined whether PTRA with stenting might be beneficial for these individuals.

A previous prospective cohort study evaluated 467 individuals with RAS > 50% who received either medical treatment or medical treatment plus PTRA with stenting in the UK, and examined future CV events and mortality depending on the clinical presentation, as well as the relevant treatment. Among patients receiving only medical treatment, those who presented with flash pulmonary oedema had a markedly increased risk of death [HR 2.2 (95% CI 1.4–3.5)] and CV events [HR 3.1 (95% CI 1.7–5.5)] compared with patients with low-risk phenotypes (i.e. those without flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function). In the same study, PTRA with stenting compared with medical treatment was associated with large reductions in the risk of death [HR 0.15 (95% CI 0.02–0.9)].

### Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension: Pragmatism, pitfalls, and perspectives [^115q2btt]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For many years, a diagnostic work-up to look for a secondary form of hypertension, particularly of renovascular origin, has been a central tenet in medicine. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization bring into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes "renovascular hypertension".

From a clinical point of view, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not have a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty; to expose them to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up adds up to little more than a wild goose chase. However, with very few exceptions, medical therapy with antihypertensives and statins remains the cornerstone for managing patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

In the general non-black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add-on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within one month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug. If the goal BP cannot be reached with two drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

- **Basis of recommendations**: In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories. For the non-black population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first-line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP-lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of over 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of six different thiazide diuretics. Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect.

### Renovascular hypertension: A case with atypical neurological signs [^1165iHHU]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Secondary hypertension is the most frequent form of hypertension in children. Renovascular disease accounts for 5–10% of all childhood hypertension and should be suspected in the presence of severe hypertension that is difficult to manage with medical therapy. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to severe target organ damage.

We describe the case of a 13-month-old baby boy with failure to thrive, recent muscular weakness of the lower extremities, and irritability. Hypertension was detected, and he was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit with a refractory hypertensive emergency, despite multiple antihypertensive therapies. Bilateral renal artery stenosis was diagnosed through renal angiography, and balloon dilation was performed, leading to lower blood pressure. He is currently withdrawing from antihypertensive medication and is slowly gaining weight and recovering from target organ damage. However, weakness of the lower extremities persists, and he has been diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^112qMyRs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The figure shows the suspected mechanisms of BP elevation in renal artery stenosis and recommendations for the management of renovascular hypertension. Renal hypoperfusion due to renal artery stenosis induces excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing both sympathetic nervous system activation and fluid retention, which may lead to an elevated BP level at bedtime and/or an abnormal nocturnal BP dipping pattern.

- **Mechanisms and management of renovascular hypertension**: Renal artery stenosis leads to renal hypoperfusion, which induces excessive activation of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous systems, as well as fluid retention caused by the decrease in pressure natriuresis. These abnormalities cause elevation of BP levels and flash pulmonary edema. Based on the mechanisms of renovascular hypertension, we speculated that an increase in nighttime BP levels and abnormal nocturnal BP dipping may occur in patients with resistant hypertension due to renovascular disease. Nighttime BP is an important target to prevent CVD events, especially in resistant hypertension. In the management of renovascular hypertension, interventional renal angioplasty including PTRA should be considered in patients with poor BP control despite adequate use of multiple antihypertensive medications. *Contraindicated in bilateral stenosis and taking care of renal dysfunction. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin receptor antagonist; BMI, body mass index; BP, blood pressure; CHF, congestive heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD.*

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: Do the latest trials challenge existing evidence [^113ipxvw]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

The central role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) has been recognized for many years. The discovery of tissue-based angiotensin II production has resulted in the concept of a local RAS that is independent of the circulating RAS.

RAS activation following the release of renin by the kidney results in a cascade of physiological events. Renin catalyzes the formation of angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This results in the activation of the angiotensin II receptors and its deleterious effect on renal vasculature, causing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The progressive development of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) resulting from pathophysiological changes mediated by angiotensin II in the presence of risk factors is well established, and local activation of RAS in the vascular walls is thought to contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, intrarenal RAS is often inappropriately activated in diabetes and is thought to predispose these patients to nephropathy. RAS inhibition (both circulatory and intrarenal) is therefore a key therapeutic approach to slow progression of CKD and to reduce CV risk through both BP-dependent and independent mechanisms.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^114BZaic]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Combination therapy for hypertension, using either separate agents or a fixed-dose combination pill, offers the potential to lower blood pressure more quickly, achieve target blood pressure, and reduce adverse effects. Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset the adverse reactions of each other. For example, a diuretic may decrease edema secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions.

Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of "compelling indications" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate specific benefits in primary or secondary prevention.

- **Heart failure**: Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure.

- **Diabetes**: Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with diabetes includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers.

- **Increased risk of coronary disease**: For hypertensive patients with an increased risk of coronary disease, recommendations include a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or a calcium channel blocker.

The Joint National Committee guidelines also recommend beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists for appropriate patients.

### Cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease-induced resistant hypertension: Further considerations for 24-hour blood pressure profiles [^1167uQaF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In a recent issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Reinhard et al. reported that, in a prospective observational study with a 2-year follow-up regarding the effect of renal artery stenting in patients with resistant hypertension, 24-hour systolic blood pressure (BP) evaluated by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was decreased by 25.7 mm Hg from a baseline of 166.2 mm Hg, and an improvement in renal function was observed. Although participants were using 2 to 3 classes of antihypertensive medications and office BP measurements were used in the former studies, the novelty of Reinhard et al.'s observational study is the feature of "true resistant hypertension" among subjects who had used at least 4 different classes of antihypertensive medications and whose uncontrolled BP was evaluated by multiple ABPM measurements. All prospective observational studies, including that of Reinhard et al, reported that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTRA), such as renal artery stenting, had a favorable effect on elevated BP. From these findings, PTRA for renovascular hypertension should be considered a reasonable treatment for the management of hypertension. Of course, PTRA is an invasive procedure with a risk of adverse complications. Before it can be widely applied to patients with renovascular hypertension, it must be shown that PTRA is superior to antihypertensive drug therapy.

There are cases of uncontrolled blood pressure in patients who take appropriate medications and have adhered to recommended dietary and exercise interventions. In fact, their resistant hypertension presents significant challenges.

Two or more drugs are needed to control blood pressure in the majority of patients with hypertension.

### Treatment of atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension: Review of observational studies and a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^115jTENw]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis can cause ischemic nephropathy and arterial hypertension. We review both observational and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compare medical and endovascular treatment for controlling hypertension and preserving renal function. Using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) strategy, we identified relevant studies and conducted a novel meta-analysis of all RCTs to determine the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy.

- **Outcomes examined**: Baseline follow-up differences in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, number of drugs at follow-up, incident events (heart failure, stroke, and worsening renal function), mortality, cumulative relative risk of heart failure, stroke, and worsening renal function.

Seven studies, comprising a total of 2,155 patients (1,741 available at follow-up), including the recently reported CORAL Study, were considered. Diastolic BP fell more at follow-up in patients in the endovascular treatment arm than in the medical treatment arm (standard difference in means -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.342 to -0.078, P = 0.002) despite a greater reduction in the mean number of antihypertensive drugs (standard difference in means -0.201, 95% CI: -0.302 to -0.1, P < 0.001). In contrast, follow-up changes from baseline in systolic BP, serum creatinine, and incident cardiovascular event rates did not differ between treatment arms. Thus, patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis receiving endovascular therapy showed specific improvements in diastolic BP.

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents [^111usRUX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and even small reductions in blood pressure can substantially impact outcomes. Effective control of hypertension is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality; however, there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes.

The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), which inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events across a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of their antihypertensive effects.

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drugs to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve a more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI and have a substantially better side effect profile. Early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage, indicating that ARB should be considered as a first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), in conjunction with several other professional societies, released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data.

While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease.

This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis, published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA guidelines.

### Revisiting the role of nephrectomy for advanced renovascular disease [^111RUmN4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Despite advances in antihypertensive therapy and renal revascularization, there remains a group of patients in whom renovascular disease leads to renal atrophy and treatment-resistant hypertension. We performed an observational cohort study, reviewing blood pressures, renal function, and predictors of response in 74 patients who underwent nephrectomy of a small kidney for uncontrolled hypertension between 1990 and 2000.

- **Patient demographics and procedures**: The median age of the patients was 65 years, with 43 (58%) being women. Thirty-five patients (47%) underwent nephrectomy as part of combined revascularization of the contralateral kidney. Associated atherosclerotic diseases were common (28% to 49%), as were prior renal revascularization (21 [28%]) and hypertensive urgencies/emergencies (23 [31%]).

- **Renal measurements**: The mean (± SD) long axis of the affected kidney was 8 ± 2 cm, and the mean function of the kidney (based on radioisotope renography) was 12% ± 11% of total renal function.

- **Blood pressure outcomes**: The average systolic blood pressure fell from 168 ± 19 mm Hg to 136 ± 18 mm Hg (P < 0.0001), and diastolic blood pressure declined from 88 ± 10 mm Hg to 76 ± 9 mm Hg (P < 0.0001) at the most recent available clinic visit (mean follow-up, 4.1 ± 2.6 years). The number of antihypertensive medications decreased from 3.2 ± 1.1 to 2.2 ± 1.5 (P < 0.0001).

- **Renal function stability**: Renal function remained stable. Results were similar among the 39 patients who had a nephrectomy without contralateral revascularization, with preoperative blood pressure of 165/88 mm Hg taking three medications decreasing to 137/77 mm Hg taking two medications.

### Reliability of captopril renography in patients under chronic therapy with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists [^115fBDRo]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Captopril renography is a reliable, widely used test for the functional diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. However, well-recognized drawbacks of the procedure include reduced accuracy in patients with bilateral disease or renal impairment, as well as possible interference from antihypertensive medication, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. Currently, no data exist regarding the reliability of captopril renography in patients with renovascular hypertension evaluated while they are under chronic treatment with angiotensin II (AT1) receptor antagonists (Sartans). Moreover, the renographic response of the kidney with renal artery stenosis to prolonged therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists has not yet been evaluated.

- **Methods**: We investigated the diagnostic effectiveness of (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine captopril renography performed after acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to the daily dose of an AT1 receptor antagonist in 13 patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis. This was based on the short-term (3 months) blood pressure outcome after revascularization. The renographic evaluation was first performed after ingestion of the daily therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonist alone (Sartan renography) and was repeated within 7 days after the acute addition of 25 mg of captopril to chronic treatment with the angiotensin II receptor antagonist (captopril-Sartan renography). A cohort of 13 patients with a final diagnosis of essential hypertension was considered.

### Should beta blockers remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension? A meta-analysis [^117T5Dgx]. Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have been used widely in the treatment of hypertension and are recommended as first-line drugs in hypertension guidelines. However, a preliminary analysis has shown that atenolol is not very effective in hypertension. We aim to substantially enlarge the data on atenolol and analyze the effect of different beta blockers.

- **Methods**: The Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched for beta blocker treatment in patients with primary hypertension. Data were then entered into the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager package and were summarized in meta-analyses. Thirteen randomized controlled trials (n = 105,951) were included in a meta-analysis comparing treatment with beta blockers with other antihypertensive drugs. Seven studies (n = 27,433) were included in a comparison of beta blockers and placebo or no treatment.

- **Findings**: The relative risk of stroke was 16% higher for beta blockers (95% CI 4–30%) than for other drugs. There was no difference for myocardial infarction. When the effect of beta blockers was compared with that of placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19% for all beta blockers (7–29%), about half that expected from previous hypertension trials. There was no difference for myocardial infarction or mortality.

- **Interpretation**: In comparison with other antihypertensive drugs, the effect of beta blockers is less than optimum, with a raised risk of stroke. Hence, we believe that beta blockers should not remain first choice in the treatment of primary hypertension and should not be used as reference drugs in future randomized trials.

### Renovascular hypertension: Screening and modern management [^111GPSDo]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of patients with renovascular disease and hypertension continue to present challenges for healthcare providers. The advent of novel imaging and interventional techniques, along with an increased understanding of the pathways leading to irreversible renal injury and renovascular hypertension, have ushered in commendable attempts to optimize and refine strategies to preserve or restore renal function and control blood pressure. Large randomized clinical trials that compare different forms of therapy, along with smaller trials that test novel experimental treatments, will hopefully contribute to formulating innovative concepts and tools to manage the patient population with atherosclerotic renovascular disease.

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^111TbaB5]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

In the 2023 ESH Guidelines, hypertension is defined based on repeated office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg. This definition is acknowledged as arbitrary and serves mainly the pragmatic purpose of simplifying the diagnosis and decision-making process for hypertension management. There is a continuous relationship between blood pressure and the risk of death from stroke or ischemic heart disease starting from an office SBP > 115 mmHg and a DBP > 75 mmHg. At the above office threshold BP values, the benefits of intervention, such as lifestyle changes or drug treatment, exceed those of inaction, as demonstrated by outcome-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

The classification of office BP and the definition of hypertension grades remain unchanged from previous guidelines. In addition to grades of hypertension, the guidelines distinguish stages of hypertension, with the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) playing a crucial role in staging [Class of Recommendation (CoR) I, Level of Evidence (LoE) C].

- **Stage 1**: Uncomplicated hypertension (i.e. without hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), established cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), and CKD G3 or higher).

The evidence grading system used in the 2023 ESH Guidelines is depicted in the supplementary data, Fig. S1.

### Renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy [^1158GvHE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease remains among the most prevalent and important causes of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction. Many lesions reduce perfusion pressure, including fibromuscular diseases and renal infarction, but most are caused by atherosclerotic disease. Epidemiologic studies establish a strong association between atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (ARAS) and cardiovascular risk. Hypertension develops in patients with renovascular disease from a complex set of pressor signals, including activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), recruitment of oxidative stress pathways, and sympathoadrenergic activation. Although the kidney maintains function over a broad range of autoregulation, sustained reduction in renal perfusion leads to disturbed microvascular function, vascular rarefaction, and ultimately development of interstitial fibrosis.

Advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and intensive risk factor management, including smoking cessation and statin therapy, can provide excellent blood pressure control for many individuals. Despite extensive observational experience with renal revascularization in patients with renovascular hypertension, recent prospective randomized trials fail to establish compelling benefits either with endovascular stents or with surgery when added to effective medical therapy. These trials are limited and exclude many patients most likely to benefit from revascularization. Meaningful recovery of kidney function after revascularization is limited once fibrosis is established. Recent experimental studies indicate that mechanisms allow…

### Renal denervation: A review [^112nsARW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension persists as an important health issue despite the availability of many medications and nondrug therapies that lower blood pressure. Increasingly, nonadherence to medication is found in approximately 2 of every 5 patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In the search for interventions that lower blood pressure without relying on adherence to a regimen requiring daily ingestion of medication or repeated physical activity, device-based methods that denervate the renal arteries have emerged as a potential complement to standard antihypertensive treatments.

At least three different approaches to renal artery denervation are under active investigation, including the use of radiofrequency energy, ultrasound, or the injection of neurolytic agents into the renal perivascular tissue. In this review, we cover what is currently known about the mechanisms of antihypertensive effects of renal denervation. We summarize the efficacy and safety of renal denervation using recent controlled trial publications in a number of hypertensive populations, and we conclude with some thoughts about challenges in the field. These include the optimization of patient selection for the procedure and what the reader can expect in the near future in this rapidly developing field.

### Prevalence and clinical characteristics of renovascular hypertension associated with fibromuscular dysplasia in China [^1179e1gK]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

After percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA), antihypertensive drugs were adjusted according to the clinical needs of each patient. The patient's attending physician was in charge of these treatment adjustments. Patients were routinely followed up at 1 month, 6 months, and every year after the procedure. Antihypertensive medications, blood pressure, and postoperative complications were recorded during follow-up. All patients were asked to measure their blood pressure at home. They were also informed that they could return to our hospital if they experienced a recurrence of hypertension or unsatisfactory hypertension control. Determinants of hypertension cure and renal artery intervention at follow-up were analyzed. The cure rate of hypertension was calculated based on the results of the last follow-up, at least 1 year after the intervention.

In our study, the responses were defined as follows: 'cured' — patients became normotensive without medications; 'improved' — patients became normotensive after intervention with the same (or reduced) number of medications, or had a systolic blood pressure (SBP) 10 mmHg below baseline with the same or reduced number of medications; 'no effect' — patients had no change in hypertension after intervention or did not meet the criteria for cure or improvement, and were considered as having treatment failure.

- **Statistical analysis**: SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for database management and statistical analyses. We performed comparisons between multifocal and focal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Means and proportions were compared by the Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1115xpxa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) may present with multiple clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic disease to severe presentations, including malignant hypertension, flash pulmonary oedema, and rapidly progressive kidney function decline. In some cases, ARVD may be identified as an incidental finding during imaging studies. The most common clinical presentations are resistant hypertension — defined as uncontrolled hypertension under office and ambulatory conditions despite appropriate lifestyle measures and optimal treatment with adequate doses of three or more antihypertensive drugs of different classes, including a diuretic, or controlled blood pressure in the presence of adequate doses of more than four antihypertensive drugs — and ischaemic nephropathy.

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Other clinical presentations of ARVD include a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 30% within the first weeks of initiating an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), unexplained rapid decline in kidney function [acute kidney injury (AKI)], 'flash' pulmonary oedema (known as Pickering syndrome), or repeated hospitalizations for decompensated heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF), particularly in patients with hypertension and CKD.

In unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS), the non-stenotic kidney can sustain damage associated with glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration, which clinically can be associated with proteinuria.

### Catheter-based renal denervation ready for the management of hypertension: Evidence, challenges, and perspectives [^114su84Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Overall, currently available evidence supports the use of renal denervation (RDN) as an additional antihypertensive treatment option. However, the FDA approval of RDN as an adjunctive treatment for patients with hypertension, in whom lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications do not adequately control blood pressure (BP), reflects the invasive nature of the procedure.

Some of the greatest unmet needs in hypertension management include effective control of both nocturnal and morning hypertension. Our data suggest that, although the control status of office and daytime BP could be improved by increasing the number of antihypertensive medications, this approach did not improve control of nighttime BP and morning home BP. These measures remained uncontrolled in 45% to 55% of medicated patients with hypertension. These findings indicate that, even with longer medication half-life, the weakness of antihypertensive medication is the attenuation of its BP-lowering activity during nighttime to the early morning period before the morning antihypertensive dose. In contrast, the BP-lowering effect of RDN persists for 24 hours, including the nighttime and morning periods. This suggests that the differential BP-lowering effects of RDN should be greatest for nighttime BP, morning home BP, and morning trough office BP (before morning antihypertensive dosing), and smaller for daytime BP and intermittent office BP readings taken after antihypertensive medication in the morning.

### Effect of ramipril vs amlodipine on renal outcomes in hypertensive nephrosclerosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116gsgXk]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

The incidence of end-stage renal disease due to hypertension has increased in recent decades, but the optimal strategy for hypertension treatment to prevent renal failure remains unknown, particularly among African Americans.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on the progression of hypertensive renal disease.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This interim analysis involved a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 factorial trial conducted among 1094 African American participants, aged 18 to 70 years, with hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20–65 mL/min per 1.73 m²). Participants were enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following the discontinuation of the amlodipine intervention in September 2000.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive amlodipine, 5 to 10 mg/d (n = 217), ramipril, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 436), or metoprolol, 50 to 200 mg/d (n = 441). Additional agents were administered to achieve one of two blood pressure goals.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in GFR. The main secondary outcome was a composite index of clinical endpoints, including a reduction in GFR of more than 50% or 25 mL/min per 1.73 m², progression to end-stage renal disease, or death.

Results indicated that among participants with a urinary protein to creatinine ratio of > 0.22 (corresponding approximately to proteinuria of more than 300 mg/d), the ramipril group had a 36% (2.02 [SE, 0.74] mL/min…

### Clinical pharmacology of antihypertensive therapy for the treatment of hypertension in CKD [^115qWDuQ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and frequently complicated by hypertension, both predialysis and in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). As a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease in this high-risk population, the treatment of hypertension in CKD is important. We review the mechanisms and indications for the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β-adrenergic blocking agents, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, direct vasodilators, and centrally acting α-agonists. Recent evidence suggests that β-adrenergic blocking agents may have a greater role in patients on dialysis and that thiazide diuretics may have a greater role in patients with advanced CKD. We conclude by sharing our general prescribing algorithm for both patients with predialysis CKD and patients with ESKD on dialysis.

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117UxXSS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of hypertension in CKD**: The 2023 ESH guidelines recommend that in patients aged 18–79 years, the office threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 140 mmHg for SBP and/or 90 mmHg for DBP (CoR I, LoE A). The exception to this rule is adult patients with a history of CVD, predominantly coronary artery disease, in whom drug treatment should be initiated in the high-normal BP range (SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg) (CoR I, LoE A). Nephrologists should note that many patients with CKD fall into the latter category. In patients ≥ 80 years old, the recommended office SBP threshold for initiation of drug treatment is 160 mmHg (CoR I, LoE A), but a lower SBP threshold of 140–159 mmHg may be considered (CoR II, LoE B).

- **Treatment targets**: The 2023 ESH guidelines offer a detailed discussion on the best (most protective) BP targets in patients with CKD, including those with CKD and diabetes mellitus (DM), recognizing that for more than a decade, there has been considerable debate in the scientific literature in this field. Old observational data suggested an association between BP and the risk of kidney failure, starting from an SBP level of > 120 mmHg. More recent data from China obtained in CKD patients without antihypertensive therapy followed prospectively for 5 years indicated that a BP > 130/90 mmHg was associated with a significantly increased risk of CV and kidney outcomes. However, RCT evidence to fully delineate the target BP in CKD is missing; ideally, this would be an RCT comparing different BP targets (i.e. SBP < 140 vs < 130 mmHg).

### Use of prescription medications that potentially interfere with blood pressure control in new-onset hypertension and treatment-resistant hypertension [^112LryqS]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Withdrawing medications that interfere with blood pressure (BP) is recommended in patients with uncontrolled BP; yet, real-world use of such agents is not well characterized among individuals with hypertension. This study aimed to evaluate the use of BP-interfering prescription medications among US patients with hypertension.

This retrospective drug utilization study used medical and prescription claims from January 2008 to December 2014 in the MarketScan commercial claims database. Adults aged 18–65 years with a hypertension diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 401) and at least one antihypertensive medication fill were included. Two hypertension cohorts were examined: new antihypertensive drug users (incident hypertension) and patients requiring titration to a fourth antihypertensive (incident treatment-resistant hypertension [TRH]). Patient-level exposure to BP-interfering medications was assessed six months before and after the index date, defined as the first prescription fill of an antihypertensive drug or the first occurrence of overlapping use of at least four antihypertensive drugs.

We identified 521,028 patients with incident hypertension and 131,764 patients with incident TRH. The most prevalent BP-interfering prescription medications were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophens, and hormones. Overall, 18.3% of the incident hypertension cohort and 17.6% of the incident TRH cohort initiated a BP-interfering medication following antihypertensive titration.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: Clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events, as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal, as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment [^112fR7qf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration, and reduced healthcare costs.

Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs.

Finally, triple antihypertensive drug therapy may not control blood pressure in a number of chronic kidney disease patients. Hypertension is defined as resistant to treatment when appropriate lifestyle measures and treatment with optimal or best-tolerated doses of three or more drugs (a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic, a RAS blocker, and a CCB) fail to lower office blood pressure. Patients with baseline serum potassium levels above 4.5 mmol/L were excluded from this study; thus, the efficacy and safety of spironolactone in such individuals are not established. In the AMBER (Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease) trial, where spironolactone was administered with the addition of placebo or patiromer in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension and eGFR 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², blood pressure was effectively reduced in both groups. However, the rates of hyperkalemia (potassium ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) were about 60% and 35% respectively, at 12 weeks.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets, subsequently remaining at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly significant for nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials.

First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects.

- **Standardized evaluation**: We recommend each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension.

- **Secondary causes of hypertension**: Patients in whom there is a high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension.

Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed, with special considerations for the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD. This includes the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and the place of emerging therapies such as renal denervation and baroreceptor modulation.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1164MacD]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of blood pressure (BP) rise in renal artery stenosis (RAS) was first described 90 years ago. Currently, it is widely accepted that atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) with lumen stenosis greater than 70% will cause a reduction of renal blood flow and hypoperfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. This condition stimulates the release of renin, followed by increased production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Stenoses of lesser degrees are suggested to have minimal hemodynamic effects due to the compensatory mechanisms of renal autoregulation. However, renal autoregulation may be compromised in groups such as the elderly and those with diabetes mellitus or heart failure (HF). In these groups, renal blood flow could be compromised in stenoses of lesser degrees. Furthermore, ischemia of even a few nephrons can cause the full syndrome of renovascular hypertension. This is shown in numerous cases of segmental RAS with excess unilateral renin release, striking hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of affected glomeruli, and reversal of hypertension by partial nephrectomy or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. In unilateral RAS, the contralateral healthy kidney is expected to at least partly compensate for the adverse effects of renin-dependent hypertension through pressure natriuresis. However, in the increasingly common cases of bilateral RAS, this compensation cannot occur, leading to sodium and volume retention. This results in a volume-dependent hypertension phenotype and a higher risk of 'flash' pulmonary edema.

### Angiotensinogen suppression: A new tool to treat cardiovascular and renal disease [^112DfhJL]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Worldwide, 1 in 3 adults are hypertensive. Although the treatment of hypertension effectively prevents death and disability, the number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension continues to rise. This may be attributed, at least partly, to patient noncompliance, which refers to the tendency for patients to take their medication intermittently or stop taking them completely, rather than treatment-resistant hypertension.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the long-term regulation of blood pressure and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector peptide of the RAS, stimulates the AT1 receptor to elicit all the classical actions of the RAS, including vasoconstriction, water and sodium retention, aldosterone synthesis, proinflammatory effects, and growth and remodeling. Although several drug classes already exist to target the RAS — for example, direct renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) as well as the dual AT1 receptor neprilysin inhibitor — there remains an unmet need for a RAS inhibitor that can circumvent the so-called RAS escape phenomenon and issues pertaining to patient noncompliance.

This RAS escape concerns the fact that Ang II suppresses renin release via its AT1 receptor, a mechanism known as the negative feedback loop. This implies that any type of RAS blockade will prevent this suppression, causing renin levels to rise and potentially overcoming the effect of RAS blockade. As an example, a direct renin inhibitor can address some of these challenges.

### Atherosclerotic renovascular disease: A clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) board of the European Renal Association (ERA) and the Working Group Hypertension and the Kidney of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) [^1179p2ZG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The overall prognosis of atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is poor. In an analysis of a 5% random sample of the US Medicare population, adverse event rates after incident diagnosis of ARVD greatly exceeded those in the general population. This included atherosclerotic heart disease (303.9 versus 73.5 per 1000 patient-years), peripheral artery disease (PAD; 258.6 versus 52.2 per 1000 patient-years), and congestive heart failure (CHF; 194.5 versus 56.3 per 1000 patient-years). Additionally, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischaemic attack had a rate of 175.5 versus 52.9 per 1000 patient-years, death 166.3 versus 63.3 per 1000 patient-years, and renal replacement therapy 28.8 versus 1.3 per 1000 patient-years.

Patients with ARVD and pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) have 1.5 times, and those on dialysis have 3.3 times higher mortality risk than patients with other causes of CKD. The prognosis of renal artery stenosis (RAS) varies considerably depending on the underlying clinical presentation and comorbid conditions. A prospective cohort study in 467 patients with RAS > 50% showed that, among patients not treated with revascularization, those presenting with flash pulmonary oedema have a markedly increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–3.5] and cardiovascular (CV) events [HR 3.1; 95% CI 1.7–5.5] compared with patients with low-risk phenotypes (i.e. those without flash pulmonary oedema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function).

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension are unknown.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events, or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the included trials and evaluated the risks of bias.

### Blood pressure-elevating and antihypertensive medication prescription trends [^111vFGu9]. Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure (BP), is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke, which are among the leading causes of death in the United States. It is a chronic medical condition affecting a significant portion of the US population. According to estimates from 2017 to 2020, nearly 48.1% of US adults have hypertension, of which 77.5% have uncontrolled hypertension (BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg). Hypertension control is critically important as it is significantly associated with lower risks of premature heart disease mortality and major acute cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

One of the less investigated barriers to hypertension control is the use of medications that can raise BP levels. According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guideline, certain prescription medications, such as amphetamines, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and combined oral contraceptives, can raise BP. The use of these medications might lead to hypertension or worsening BP control among those with hypertension. Use of BP-elevating medication might attenuate BP-lowering effects of antihypertensive therapy or may also lead to a change in BP from drug interactions.

Prior studies have documented antihypertensive medication trends among the US population; however, there is scarce literature on prescription fills for BP-elevating medications. One study, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination…

### Beta blockers in the management of chronic kidney disease [^114omNoQ]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The sympathetic nervous system modulates renal function through its receptors, namely beta1 (cardiac output and renin release), alpha1 (systemic and renovascular constriction), and beta2 (renovascular dilation). Sympathetic overactivity is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is an important contributor to the increased risk of cardiovascular events as well as the progression of renal disease. Recent evaluations of drug use in people with CKD show a remarkably low percentage of patients receiving beta-blockers, especially in more advanced stages of CKD when cardiovascular risk is higher. This is largely due to the tolerability of these agents.

Moreover, water-soluble beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are dialyzable and require supplementation to avoid the exacerbation of arrhythmias following dialysis. Newer vasodilating beta-blockers have better tolerability and different effects on renal hemodynamics as well as metabolic variables. These effects are related to the relative alpha1-blocking effect of agents such as carvedilol and labetalol, with carvedilol having relatively greater alpha-blocking effects. Few studies evaluate beta-blockers on cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. Studies with carvedilol demonstrate attenuated increases in albuminuria as well as reductions in cardiovascular events in CKD patients with hypertension. This paper reviews the animal and clinical trial data that evaluate beta-blockers in CKD, highlighting the vasodilating beta-blockers. It is apparent that greater use of this drug class for blood pressure control would further enhance outcomes in this population.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus AT1 receptor antagonist in cardiovascular and renal protection: The case for AT1 receptor antagonist [^114MLp3f]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

The development of pharmacologic agents that directly inhibit the angiotensin II receptor (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has provided clinicians with an alternative to the previously available angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) to downregulate the renin-angiotensin system. This review focuses on the available data that can guide clinicians in using these two classes of agents concerning their ability to provide cardiovascular (CV) and renal protection.

Although the CV protective effect of ACEIs in high-risk populations is widely appreciated, whether such an effect is entirely blood pressure independent can be questioned. Most head-to-head comparisons between ACEIs and ARBs have yielded comparable CV protective effects, with ARBs being associated with fewer adverse effects. Likewise, several — but not all — studies have demonstrated a CV protective effect of ACEIs when compared with other active agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. One study demonstrated similar protection with an ARB when compared with a beta blocker.

In terms of renal protection, there are ample data to support the role of both ACEIs and ARBs in preventing the progression from microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, when progression of renal disease is used as an endpoint, protection has been demonstrated with ACEIs only for type 1 diabetes but not type 2 diabetes. In this latter group, only ARBs have been shown to slow progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### A European Renal Association (ERA) synopsis for nephrology practice of the 2023 European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^112jEytt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Renovascular disease

The 2023 ESH guidelines discuss the prevalence, prognosis, and management of the two main causes of renovascular hypertension: atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD) and fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Revascularization with balloon angioplasty without stenting is emphasized as the treatment of choice for patients with FMD and critical renal artery stenosis. For ARVD, the recommendation is to offer revascularization in addition to medical therapy for patients with documented secondary hypertension due to ARVD, or those with high-risk clinical presentations such as flash pulmonary edema, refractory hypertension, or rapid loss of kidney function with documented high-grade stenosis (≥ 70%).

Medical therapy alone is suggested for individuals with asymptomatic ARVD with stenosis < 70%, those with mild or moderate hypertension that is easily controlled with antihypertensive drugs and low-grade stenosis, or patients where the kidney parenchyma is non-viable and revascularization has little to offer. If treatment initiation with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB results in eGFR reduction of ≥ 30%, careful re-evaluation is warranted. Strategies in the management of ARVD are detailed in a recent clinical practice document by the European Renal Best Practice and the Working Group 'Hypertension and the Kidney' of ESH.

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 ESH guidelines recommend specific pharmacotherapy for the management of resistant hypertension (HTN). In cases where additional therapy is needed, the guidelines suggest considering the following drugs:

- **Spironolactone** or other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.
- **Β-blockers**: commonly used to manage hypertension.
- **Α-1 blockers**: as part of the treatment regimen.
- **Centrally acting agents**: such as clonidine.
- **Amiloride**: if available.
