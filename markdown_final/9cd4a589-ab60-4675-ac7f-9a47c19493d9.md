## Question

is nursing care required for 100 eschar on wound?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nursing care is required for a wound documented as having "100 eschar". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "100 eschar" actually means in clinical documentation. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of eschar and when debridement is or isn't indicated. Next, I will review high-credibility guidelines to align the management strategy. After that, I should define the nursing care components that apply regardless of debridement. Finally, I will synthesize scenario-based recommendations and confirm the answer directly with rationale and references, adjusting if any initial assumptions prove off base.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "100 eschar" is not standard phrasing; at first glance, I briefly assumed it meant a single eschar, but wait, that is less likely than shorthand for 100% eschar coverage of the wound surface, which is a common way clinicians communicate full necrotic coverage in pressure injury documentation and burn care notes, and for safety I should proceed assuming the higher-risk, comprehensive eschar burden unless the record clarifies otherwise.

> Next, I should review why eschar matters pathophysiologically; eschar is nonviable necrotic tissue that impedes epithelialization, sustains the inflammatory phase, and can be a nidus for infection, so I need to ensure vigilant assessment and determine promptly whether the eschar is stable and dry versus unstable, moist, or infected, because that distinction drives whether debridement is indicated or deferred in specific locations like the heel [^116Yd9r4] [^1112dnsB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guideline nuance is key here, as high-credibility WHS recommendations support debridement to reduce bioburden and devitalized tissue generally, but explicitly recommend no debridement for a stable, dry, intact heel eschar in the absence of clinical inflammation or infection, while burn care pathways emphasize early eschar removal for deep partial and full thickness burns, and the Cochrane review confirms that while debridement is standard when necrosis and infection are present, optimal method selection lacks definitive comparative superiority, requiring clinical judgment and ongoing reassessment [^116jbSSp] [^1112dnsB] [^113yHBTv].

> I will now examine nursing care requirements that are universal regardless of whether debridement is undertaken; I need to ensure structured assessment and documentation of wound dimensions and tissue characteristics, periwound condition, drainage, odor, pain, and systemic or local infection signs, maintain appropriate dressing strategies tailored to stability versus infection status, provide offloading for pressure-related ulcers, deliver patient and caregiver education on warning signs and dressing adherence, coordinate interprofessional input including timely surgical consultation when indicated, and manage analgesia proactively during dressing changes and procedures, as these elements are repeatedly emphasized across WHS guidance, primary care wound management resources, and pain guidelines for high-burden dermatologic wounds [^115kUNn3] [^112dJvcZ] [^114wxQhR].

> But wait, I should verify the low-probability edge cases before settling on the scenario map; there are niche conservative approaches to necrotic eschar in select traumatic wounds described in case reports using honey-based dressings that avoided surgery, yet these are low-credibility data and still required meticulous nursing application and close monitoring over months, reinforcing rather than replacing the need for skilled nursing surveillance and coordination even when debridement is deferred or alternative strategies are trialed [^116Yd9r4] [^111mCvHP].

> Now, let me consider Scenario A, the stable, dry, intact heel eschar without signs of infection or inflammation; in this specific case, I should confirm that debridement is not recommended, maintain complete offloading and pressure redistribution, protect the area with an appropriate protective dressing that does not macerate or moisten the eschar, keep the environment dry, and intensify surveillance for any transition to instability or infection that would change management, because converting a closed stable eschar into an open wound can worsen outcomes if done without indication [^1112dnsB].

> Next, I should review Scenario B, the unstable or infected eschar on any anatomic site, or a non-heel site with heavy bioburden; here, I need to ensure active management with provider-directed debridement strategy selection (sharp, mechanical, enzymatic, autolytic, or ultrasonic), consider antimicrobial dressings when indicated, increase monitoring frequency to detect evolving cellulitis or sepsis, and coordinate urgent surgical evaluation if systemic involvement or rapidly advancing infection is suspected, as debridement to remove necrotic tissue and reduce bacterial burden is indicated in this context and delays increase risk [^116jbSSp] [^113yHBTv].

> I will now examine Scenario C, burn wound eschar with suspected deep partial or full thickness injury; I should confirm that early eschar removal is standard, potentially including enzymatic options like anacaulase-bcdb (Nexobrid) per FDA labeling in appropriate burns, and anticipate intensive nursing around pain control, fluid shifts, thermoregulation, and specialized dressings as part of the multidisciplinary burn pathway, noting that real-world effectiveness varies by burn mechanism and that patient selection is governed by labeled limitations and burn center protocols [^116CM1h7] [^112XFwWY].

> Let me synthesize determinants of nursing care intensity to avoid oversimplification; wound etiology, infection status, eschar characteristics, perfusion and metabolic comorbidities, and mobility and offloading feasibility all modulate surveillance cadence and interventions, and I should double-check risk stratification to personalize follow-up, leveraging risk prediction principles where available while recognizing that clinician assessment remains central in the absence of robust predictive tools across heterogeneous chronic wounds [^114RTsAf] [^1118R4cL].

> Finally, I should confirm the direct answer and minimum standard; yes, nursing care is unequivocally required for a wound with 100% eschar coverage, with at least daily structured assessment, infection surveillance, appropriate dressing strategy, education, and care coordination, scaling up to active debridement support and escalation pathways if instability or infection emerges, and this holds across pressure injuries, surgical wounds, and burns, with the singular exception of observing a stable, dry heel eschar without infection where the nursing role remains vigilant protection and monitoring rather than removal [^115kUNn3] [^116jbSSp] [^1112dnsB].

Yes, **nursing care is required** for wounds with 100% eschar [^116jbSSp]. Eschar is nonviable tissue that impedes healing and increases infection risk [^116jbSSp] [^117VVTuD]; therefore, nurses must provide **regular assessment and monitoring** to detect infection or deterioration early [^112dJvcZ]. Nursing care includes **infection prevention and control**, pain management, and patient education [^112dJvcZ]; nurses also coordinate debridement and advanced therapies as indicated [^113yHBTv] [^116CM1h7] [^116Yd9r4]. Even when debridement is deferred (e.g. stable heel eschar), ongoing nursing care is essential to monitor for complications and maintain wound stability [^1112dnsB].

---

## Clinical significance of 100% eschar

Eschar is a firm, leathery, black or brown crust of necrotic tissue that forms after full-thickness injury; it is avascular and insensate, acts as a barrier to healing, and may harbor bacteria, increasing infection risk [^116jbSSp] [^114eJZY4]. Eschar can cause **delayed healing** and complications such as infection, sepsis, and tissue loss [^117VVTuD].

---

## Nursing care requirements for 100% eschar wounds

Nursing care is essential for **100% eschar wounds** to prevent complications, promote healing, and support patient comfort and education. Key nursing interventions are outlined below.

---

### Assessment and monitoring

Regular assessment includes monitoring wound size, depth, exudate, odor, and signs of infection such as **erythema, warmth, swelling, and purulent discharge** [^112dJvcZ]. Systemic monitoring involves tracking temperature, heart rate, and other vital signs to detect **systemic infection or sepsis** early [^116jbSSp]. Documentation should capture **wound characteristics, interventions, and patient responses** to guide care and detect changes [^115sLdSF].

---

### Infection prevention and control

Infection prevention and control emphasizes strict **aseptic technique** during dressing changes and wound care, along with rigorous **hand hygiene** [^116jbSSp]. Antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver-containing) are applied to reduce **bacterial load** and prevent **infection** [^115kUNn3] [^115zdMby].

---

### Pain management

Pain assessment should be performed regularly, with **appropriate analgesia** before dressing changes and procedures, and **non-pharmacologic measures** such as relaxation, distraction, and positioning should be used to reduce pain and anxiety [^114wxQhR].

---

### Debridement and wound bed preparation

Debridement coordination includes arranging **surgical, enzymatic, or autolytic debridement** [^113yHBTv] to remove necrotic tissue and prepare the wound bed [^116jbSSp] [^112dJvcZ], along with meticulous **post-debridement care** to prevent infection and promote healing.

---

### Moisture balance and dressing selection

Moisture management aims to maintain a **moist wound environment** to promote autolytic debridement and healing, while **appropriate dressings** are selected to manage exudate, protect periwound skin, and minimize friction and shear [^115kUNn3].

---

### Patient and family education

Education should cover **wound care and signs of infection**, with psychosocial support to address anxiety, depression, and body image concerns [^114jiZMM].

---

## Risks and complications of inadequate nursing care

Inadequate nursing care for 100% eschar wounds can lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Infection**: Increased risk of local and systemic infection, including sepsis [^117VVTuD].

- **Delayed healing**: Prolonged healing due to persistent necrotic tissue and bacterial colonization [^116jbSSp].

- **Tissue loss**: Increased risk of tissue necrosis and loss, potentially requiring surgical intervention or amputation [^117VVTuD].

- **Pain and discomfort**: Inadequate pain management leading to patient distress and reduced quality of life [^114wxQhR].

- **Psychosocial impact**: Increased anxiety, depression, and reduced patient satisfaction.

---

## Evidence-based guidelines and best practices

Several **evidence-based guidelines** emphasize the importance of nursing care in managing eschar wounds:

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend initial and maintenance debridement to remove necrotic tissue and reduce bacterial burden [^116jbSSp].

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend selecting dressings that maintain a moist environment, manage exudate, and protect periwound skin [^115kUNn3].

- **WHS 2024 guidelines**: Recommend not debriding stable heel ulcers with dry eschar unless signs of infection or inflammation are present [^1112dnsB].

---

## Multidisciplinary collaboration

Effective management of 100% eschar wounds **requires collaboration** among healthcare professionals, including [^115sLdSF]:

- **Physicians**: Provide medical oversight, prescribe antibiotics, and perform surgical interventions.

- **Wound care specialists**: Offer specialized expertise in wound assessment, debridement, and advanced therapies [^115ZPoUQ].

- **Physical therapists**: Assist with mobility, positioning, and rehabilitation.

- **Dietitians**: Provide nutritional support to promote wound healing.

---

## Conclusion

Nursing care is essential for wounds with **100% eschar**, providing assessment, infection prevention, pain management, debridement coordination, moisture management, and education. Inadequate nursing care increases the risk of infection, delayed healing, tissue loss, and psychosocial distress. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines and multidisciplinary collaboration are critical for optimal outcomes [^116jbSSp].

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^116Yd9r4]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Nonviable necrotic eschar is an impedance to wound healing and can ultimately lead to failure of soft tissue coverage of a lower extremity amputation stump. When present, this eschar can create a mechanical blockade to wound epithelialization, prolong the inflammatory component of the wound-healing mechanism, and serve as a nidus for soft tissue infection. For these reasons, surgeons classically opt for sharp debridement of eschar and revision of a wound closure to include skin grafts or vascularized flaps. Efforts to identify less invasive strategies for managing this complication have yielded a number of alternative debridement techniques. In this report, we present a case study wherein honey was utilized in combination with burdock leaves to promote successful healing of a traumatic transfemoral amputation surgical wound complicated by tissue necrosis without the need for further surgical revision in a patient opposed to additional surgery.

### The rash that leads to eschar formation [^114eJZY4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes. This contribution is intended to help dermatologists identify and manage these various dermatologic conditions, as well as provide an algorithm that can be utilized when approaching a patient presenting with an eschar.

### Pressure ulcers: prevention, evaluation, and management [^112dJvcZ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence, resulting from unrelieved pressure. Predisposing factors are classified as intrinsic (e.g. limited mobility, poor nutrition, comorbidities, aging skin) or extrinsic (e.g. pressure, friction, shear, moisture). Prevention includes identifying at-risk persons and implementing specific prevention measures, such as following a patient repositioning schedule, keeping the head of the bed at the lowest safe elevation to prevent shear, using pressure-reducing surfaces, and assessing nutrition and providing supplementation, if needed.

Documentation of each ulcer (i.e. size, location, eschar and granulation tissue, exudate, odor, sinus tracts, undermining, and infection) and appropriate staging (I through IV) are essential to wound assessment. When an ulcer occurs, treatment involves:

- **Management of local and distant infections**: Removal of necrotic tissue, maintenance of a moist environment for wound healing, and possibly surgery.
- **Debridement**: Indicated when necrotic tissue is present. Urgent sharp debridement should be performed if advancing cellulitis or sepsis occurs.
- **Nonurgent debridement methods**: Mechanical, enzymatic, and autolytic debridement methods are employed.
- **Wound cleansing**: Preferably with normal saline and appropriate dressings, this is a mainstay of treatment for clean ulcers and after debridement. Bacterial load can be managed with cleansing.

Topical antibiotics should be considered if there is no improvement in healing after 14 days. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with infections.

### Wound care in geriatrics [^112pLEtt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Wound care is a crucial aspect of caring for the geriatric population. It is important to recognize a wound when it begins and know the proper treatment once a wound develops. First, it is important to assess the wound and determine the type of wound that is being dealt with. One must establish whether the wound is acute or chronic. Then a proper treatment plan must be devised.

This article guides you through a step-by-step process for different types of wounds and provides the proper treatment strategies for wounds that commonly occur within the geriatric population.

### Nexobrid [^111mHvcq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Table 1 presents adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 1% of subjects in the Nexobrid arm and at a higher incidence than the SOC arm, up to 3 months following wound closure.

- **Pediatric subjects**: Study 3 (CIDS study) evaluated pediatric subjects undergoing eschar removal for deep partial thickness (DPT) and/or full thickness (FT) thermal burns [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A total of 139 subjects (69 Nexobrid, 70 SOC) were treated in the study. The SOC treatment included both surgical and non-surgical eschar removal methods. The mean age was comparable in the Nexobrid (5.89 years) and SOC (5.75 years) arms. The majority of subjects were male (59% Nexobrid, 69% SOC). For race, 70% Nexobrid and 69% SOC subjects were White, 25% Nexobrid and 23% SOC subjects were Asian, 4% Nexobrid and 3% SOC subjects were Black or African American, and 1% Nexobrid and 4% SOC subjects were other races. For ethnicity, 4% Nexobrid and 10% SOC subjects identified as Hispanic or Latino. The majority of burns in both treatment arms (Nexobrid and SOC) were due to scald (68% and 67%). The majority of patients in both treatment groups (Nexobrid and SOC) had 1 treated wound (71% and 80%, respectively).

Table 2 presents adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 1% of subjects in the Nexobrid arm and at a higher incidence than the SOC arm, up to 3 months following wound closure.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of anacaulase-bcdb outside of the United States. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unconstrained size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^114RTsAf]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). High credibility.

Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life, and considerable economic burden. Evidence-based risk prediction to guide improved wound prevention and treatment is limited by the complexity in their etiology, clinical underreporting, and a lack of studies using large high-quality datasets.

- **Recent advancements**: The objective of this review is to summarize key components and challenges in the development of personalized risk prediction tools for both prevention and management of chronic wounds, while highlighting several innovations in the development of better risk stratification.

- **Critical issues**: Regression-based risk prediction approaches remain important for assessing prognosis and risk stratification in chronic wound management. Advances in statistical computing have boosted the development of several promising machine learning (ML) and other semiautomated classification tools. These methods may be better placed to handle large numbers of wound healing risk factors from large datasets, potentially resulting in better risk prediction when combined with conventional methods, clinical experience, and expertise.

- **Future directions**: Where the number of predictors is large and heterogeneous, the correlations between various risk factors complex, and very large datasets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk stratifying patients predisposed to chronic wounds. Conventional regression-based approaches remain important, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small. Translating these advancements into practical applications will be key to improving patient outcomes.

### Persistent high risk HPV infection associated with development of cervical neoplasia in a prospective population study [^113VS1KS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to monitor the association between the progression of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and the development of cervical neoplasia over time, beginning with a baseline of normal cervical cytology.

This paper presents follow-up data from a previous cross-sectional analysis. Women from a screening population with normal cytology who were HR-HPV positive were recalled after two to three years for cytology and HPV genotyping. The development of cervical neoplasia at follow-up was analyzed in relation to the course of HPV infection (clearance, persistence, or sequential infection) and the presence of single or multiple HPV infections at baseline. A comparator control group of women, who were HPV and cytologically negative at baseline, was selected from the same population.

Twelve cases of dyskaryosis were found in women who were HPV positive at baseline, with four cases being high grade. Only three cases of low-grade dyskaryosis were found in the control group. Women with type-specific persistent infections were significantly more likely to develop cervical neoplasia than those who cleared the infection (p = 0.0001) or were sequentially infected with different types (p = 0.001). Women with multiple HPV infections at baseline were not more likely to develop cervical dyskaryosis than those with a single infection.

The study concludes that type-specific persistent HR-HPV infection, as monitored by genotyping, can identify women at increased risk of cervical neoplasia more accurately than a single or repeated presence/absence HPV test. Further evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of such an approach is warranted.

### Enzymatic debridement in scalds is not as effective as in flame burns regarding additional eschar excision: A retrospective matched-control study [^115msKCB]. Burns (2022). Low credibility.

Enzymatic debridement of burn eschar has become an accepted and widely used technique for burn wound treatment over the past years. However, this practice is not exempt from failure, and recent experimental studies indicate that it may not be as efficient in scalds as it is in flame burns.

- **Methods**: Patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit between June 2017 and February 2021 who received enzymatic debridement within the first 72 hours after scald and flame burns were included. Patients with scald burns were matched regarding age, sex, and percentage of total body surface area (%TBSA) burned in a 1:2 ratio with patients presenting with flame burns.

- **Results**: Eighteen patients with scald burns were matched with thirty-six patients with flame burns. After matching, both groups were similar in terms of age (flame burns 44.5 ± 21.1 years vs. scald 41.8 ± 22.6 years, p = 0.666) and %TBSA burned (11.0 ± 8.2% vs. 10.6 ± 9.6%, p = 0.851). Patients with scald burns significantly more often underwent further surgical eschar excision compared to controls (scald 16 (88.9%) vs. flame 19 (52.8%), p = 0.016). The length of stay per %TBSA was significantly longer in scald burns (scald 7.8 ± 9.2 days vs. flame 3.7 ± 3.8 days, p = 0.013).

This study indicates that enzymatic debridement may not be as effective in scalds as it is in flame burns. It was shown that patients with scalds and subsequent enzymatic debridement more frequently underwent additional surgical intervention and that the size of the transplanted area was larger compared to the control. Moreover, those patients had a longer length of stay.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^111wqU6L]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Textremity is a challenging clinical problem for the treating surgeon that predisposes trauma survivors to substantial morbidity and loss of function. In the acute setting, patients often present with active hemorrhage through the mangled extremity and orthopedic injuries too severe for successful limb salvage to occur. When hemorrhage through a mangled extremity cannot be controlled, amputation is sometimes performed with careful consideration for maintaining as much native limb as possible when appropriate. Amputation in these cases allows hemostasis to occur. Attention can then be focused on resuscitating the patient and treating any other associated but less severe injuries.

After amputation is performed, a series of challenges must be overcome. Open fractures and contamination of the initial injury predispose the patient to infection. In addition, the full extent of soft tissue injury is often difficult to ascertain in the immediate postoperative period after amputation. Barriers to successful healing of traumatic and surgical wounds in the setting of amputation are often encountered in the following days and weeks as the zone of injury declares itself, presenting as inadequate soft tissue flap perfusion, poor host nutrition, and soft tissue infection.

When wound healing complications are encountered, the options available to the surgeon to improve the clinical outcome may be limited based on patient preference or the wound characteristics themselves.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: Best care practice guidelines [^114wxQhR]. BMC Medicine (2014). High credibility.

To maintain appropriate moisture levels and facilitate the healing of wounds, dressings should be non-adherent and appropriate in size, as recommended for older patients. Infected wounds require more frequent dressing changes. Changing dressings one limb at a time is advocated in infants to reduce the likelihood of skin being rubbed off the opposite limb by feet kicking together, which can cause new, painful lesions. This approach also decreases the chance of bacterial spread from a colonized wound to an uncontaminated area. For baths, adding salt to the water is recommended, similar to the approach for older patients.

In addition to environmental adjustments, many infants will require analgesics with bath and dressing changes. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and opioids are all utilized as for older patients. Codeine is not recommended when alternatives are available, as neonates lack the capacity to metabolize the drug into active metabolites, and clinical responses are highly variable at all ages due to polymorphisms in codeine's metabolic pathway.

Severely affected newborns with deep tissue damage may require extensive pharmacologic support to achieve a level of comfort. These infants may need around-the-clock or continuous infusion of opioids and an adjuvant. A transition to methadone for better steady state levels should be considered.

### Approach to the atypical wound [^114bnXEt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of atypical wounds can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges; however, as the prevalence of atypical wounds grows worldwide, prompt and accurate management is increasingly an essential skill for dermatologists. Addressing the underlying cause of an atypical wound is critical for successful outcomes. An integrated approach with a focus on pain management and patient engagement is recommended to facilitate enduring wound closure. Advances in treatment, in addition to further research and clinical training, are necessary to address the expanding burden of atypical wounds.

### Management of acute changes in condition in skilled nursing facilities [^112QhB3e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

The study aims to describe the presentation and management of acute changes in condition in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) during the implementation of a program designed to reduce unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

- **Design**: Secondary analysis of data was conducted from a randomized controlled trial involving 264 SNFs.

- **Participants**: Out of the 264 participating SNFs, 133 provided data on acute changes in condition, with 55 in the intervention group and 78 in the control group.

- **Interventions**: Over a 12-month period, intervention SNFs received training and support for implementing the Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers program. Control SNFs were offered training and implementation support after the end of the 12-month trial.

- **Measures**: Project champions employed a structured online tool to describe acute changes in condition that did not result in a hospital transfer within 72 hours of the change.

- **Results**: The study reported 7,689 episodes of acute change in condition, most involving multiple, nonspecific changes. Only 10% resulted in hospital transfer between 72 hours and 7 days after the change. Five acute changes had odds ratios for transfer greater than 2, including mental status change, abnormal vital signs, bleeding, shortness of breath, and unresponsiveness. Most transfers occurred for reasons other than the initial change in condition.

In conclusion, a wide variety of acute changes in condition can be managed in SNFs without hospital transfer. Most of these changes are nonspecific and multiple.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^112nU8nM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methodological quality appraisal reveals that approximately 71% (42 out of 59) of the cost-effectiveness analyses had a score of 8 or higher out of a total possible score of 10 (Additional file 5, Figure 2). Using the Drummond 10-item tool, the key methodological shortcoming across the cost-effectiveness analyses was that only 51% (30 out of 59) had established the 'effectiveness' of the intervention using data from efficacy studies (i.e. systematic reviews, randomized clinical trials, or observational studies) with sufficiently large sample sizes according to the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for establishing efficacy. Consistent methodological strengths across the cost-effectiveness analyses included a clear research question, costs and consequences measured in appropriate physical units, credibly valued costs and consequences, and discounted costs when applicable.

- **Drummond methodological quality summary results (n = 59)**:
	1. Well-defined question.
	2. Competing alternatives well described.
	3. Effectiveness established.
	4. All important and relevant costs and consequences identified.
	5. Measurement accurately performed.
	6. Valuation credibility.
	7. Discounting.
	8. Incremental analysis performed.
	9. Allowance made for uncertainty.
	10. Discussion.

### Debridement for surgical wounds [^113yHBTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Surgical wounds that become infected are often debrided because clinicians believe that removing necrotic or infected tissue may expedite wound healing. There are numerous methods of debridement available, but no consensus on which method is most effective for surgical wounds.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different methods of debridement on the rate of debridement and healing of surgical wounds.

- **Search methods**: In October 2021, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. To identify additional studies, we searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions on language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with a surgical wound requiring debridement and reported time to complete wound debridement or time to wound healing, or both.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment using the RoB 1 tool, data extraction, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.

- **Main results**: In this fourth update, we identified one additional study for inclusion. The review now includes six studies, with 265 participants aged three to 91 years. Five studies were published between 1979 and 1990, and one was published in 2014. The studies were carried out in hospital settings in China, Denmark, and Belgium.

### Enhancement effect of terpenes on silver sulphadiazine permeation through third-degree burn eschar [^117AdhAf]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy remains one of the most important methods of wound management. Systemically administered antimicrobials may not achieve therapeutic levels in wounds, and most agents cannot penetrate burn eschar well enough when applied topically. Therefore, we tested the notion of increasing the permeability of eschar toward topical agents using terpenes, a well-known class of skin permeation enhancers.

We selected four terpenes: limonene (hydrocarbon), eucalyptol (ether), alpha-pinene oxide (epoxide), and geraniol (alcohol). Their effects on the permeation of silver sulphadiazine (SSD), a widely used topical antimicrobial agent, through human third-degree burn eschar, were evaluated using static diffusion cells. Results showed that terpenes increased the permeation flux of SSD through eschar significantly (P < 0.0001). Limonene provided the highest flux enhancement ratio (9.0 times), followed by geraniol, eucalyptol, and alpha-pinene oxide with enhancement ratios of 5.5, 4.7, and 4.3, respectively. The effects of terpenes on permeation lag-time were less than 20%.

Data analysis revealed that terpenes increase permeation of SSD mainly by increasing its partitioning into the eschar. The present results indicate that permeation of drugs through burn eschar can be increased considerably by terpenes, and that burn wound antimicrobial therapy may be improved by terpenes and possibly other penetration enhancers.

### Acute burn care [^117PC9Jw]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

After studying this article and viewing the videos, the participant should be able to:

1. Describe the epidemiology of burn injuries.
2. Understand burn pathophysiology and perform a wound assessment.
3. Summarize the initial emergency management of a burn patient.
4. Calculate the anticipated fluid resuscitation requirements for a burn injury and diagnose the complications of overresuscitation.
5. Describe the diagnosis and management of inhalation injury.
6. List the goals of wound care for superficial and deep burns, and describe the closed dressing technique.
7. Perform excision of a burn wound.
8. Compare various wound closure techniques using autografts and skin substitutes.

Plastic surgeons are essential members of the multidisciplinary burn team. Burn injuries remain common, and plastic surgeons have an opportunity to develop and innovate the field of acute burn care in light of workforce shortages. Burn pathophysiology is complex and dynamic, informing the challenges encountered during the perioperative phase. Accurate burn wound assessment remains difficult, with implications for diagnosis and management. A systematic approach is required when stabilizing a major burn and/or inhalation injury, with newly updated fluid resuscitation and triage guidelines. Wound care continues to evolve, with an emphasis on a closed dressing technique. For deeper burns, new surgical techniques are emerging for surgical débridement, along with improvements to traditional methods of tangential excision.

### Using computer vision and artificial intelligence to track the healing of severe burns [^116Tw3b8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Low credibility.

Burn care management includes assessing the severity of burns accurately, especially distinguishing superficial partial-thickness burns from deep partial-thickness burns in the context of providing definitive, downstream treatment. Moreover, the healing of the wound in the subacute care setting requires continuous tracking to avoid complications. Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) provide a unique opportunity to build low-cost and accessible tools to classify burn severity and track changes in wound parameters, both in the clinic by physicians and nurses and asynchronously in the remote setting by the patient themselves.

Wound assessments can be achieved by AI-CV using the principles of image-guided therapy with high-quality 2D color images. Wound parameters can include wound 2D spatial dimension and the characterization of wound color changes, demonstrating physiological changes such as the presentation of eschar/necrotic tissue, pustulence, granulation tissue, and scabbing. Here, we present the development of an AI-CV-based Skin Abnormality Tracking Algorithm pipeline. Additionally, we provide the results on a single localized burn tracked for a 6-week period in the clinic and an additional 2-week period of home monitoring.

### Management of diabetic wounds: Expert panel consensus statement [^115sLdSF]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). High credibility.

The Wound Healing Foundation recognized the need for consensus-based, unbiased recommendations for the treatment of wounds. Consensus statements on the treatment of chronic and acute wounds have been developed and published previously. The publication on diabetic wounds represents the next step in this process. Diabetic wounds constitute a major problem; population-based and meta-analytic studies indicate that the presence of foot wounds in patients with diabetes increases their mortality risk by more than twofold. The management of diabetic wounds requires consistent and evidence-driven intervention to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. This consensus statement provides clinicians with the necessary foundational approaches to the causes, diagnosis, and therapeutic management of diabetic wounds. Presented in a structured format, this is a useful guide for clinicians and learners in all patient care settings.

- **Recent advances**: Continuous glucose monitoring and other new tools have facilitated better diabetes management and the management of associated wounds. Diabetic limb salvage should focus on achieving and optimizing function for the patient with diabetes rather than preserving limb tissue at all costs.

- **Critical issues**: Successful management of diabetic wounds requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing comprehensive assessment, timely intervention, and collaborative care by the wound clinician with providers who can address critical aspects to achieve healing, including careful management of blood glucose levels and optimization of off-loading techniques.

### Pressure injury [^117VVTuD]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Pressure injury is seen across all healthcare settings and affects people of any age and health condition. It imposes a significant burden, with annual costs of up to $17.8 billion in the United States alone. Despite the considerable resources it exhausts, the disease remains very prevalent, and the incidence is on the rise. This is in part due to the aging population, a growing number of nursing home residents, poorly understood biology, and a dismal track record of clinical research in this field.

- **Methods**: In our review article, we discuss the disease pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, evidence-based recommendations for risk assessment, prevention and timely management, existing challenges, and directions to improve research in the field. This article encompasses dedicated sections on the full spectrum of the pressure-related pathologies including "conventional pressure ulcers", "medical device related pressure injuries", "pressure injuries in mucosal membranes", "pressure injuries in the pediatric population", "pressure injury at end of life", and the "role of pressure in the pathogenesis of diabetic foot ulcers".

### A consensus approach to wound care in epidermolysis bullosa [^1161Yqc6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Wound care is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB); however, there are currently no guidelines to help practitioners care for these patients.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to generate a list of recommendations that would enable practitioners to better care for patients with EB.

- **Methods**: An expert panel generated a list of recommendations based on the best evidence available. The recommendations were translated into a survey and sent to other EB experts to generate consensus using an online-based modified Delphi method. The list was refined and grouped into themes and specific recommendations.

- **Results**: There were 15 respondents (45% response rate), with significant experience in the EB field (> 10 years [67%]). Respondents included physicians (67%), nurses (17%), and allied health professionals (7%). There was more than 85% agreement for all the proposed items. These were further refined and grouped into five main themes (assessment and management of factors that impair healing, patient-centered concerns, local wound care, development of an individualized care plan, and organizational support) and 17 specific recommendations.

- **Limitations**: There is a paucity of scientific evidence with most recommendations based on expert opinion.

- **Conclusions**: These recommendations will provide practitioners with a framework for caring for these patients. Additional scientific research, including effectiveness studies for everyday practice and expert consensus, may further refine these recommendations.

### Guidelines for the management of partial-thickness burns in a general hospital or community setting — recommendations of a European working party [^1157tKA4]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Most partial-thickness burns in Europe and the United States are managed by non-burns specialists who do not treat burns regularly. To achieve better patient outcomes, partial-thickness burns should be properly managed in non-specialist centers and referred to burn units when appropriate. Although some guidelines have been published to assist non-specialists, few have attempted to provide comprehensive step-by-step guidance emphasizing wound-healing principles. A working party of European burn specialists devised a new treatment algorithm to provide clear and comprehensive guidance on the management of partial-thickness burns in the general hospital and community setting.

- **Diagnosis and referral**: Clear criteria are proposed for the diagnosis of burns and timely referral to specialists, ensuring that patients receive necessary advanced care when needed.

- **Wound preparation**: The importance of proper wound preparation is emphasized, as it is crucial for optimizing healing conditions and outcomes.

- **Wound covering**: Recommendations include appropriate selection and use of wound dressings that facilitate healing and minimize infection risks.

- **Post-wound care**: Guidance is provided on post-care strategies to enhance patient recovery and prevent complications.

These guidelines take into account the role of wound dressings, infection control, and general patient well-being while considering the varying working environments across Europe. They aim to improve the overall outcome for community-treated patients within the expanding European Union and reduce the number of preventable late referrals to specialists.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^111VrCtV]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Complex wounds represent a major challenge for clinicians and wound care specialists. Despite recent advances in wound care therapies and our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying chronic wounds, adhering to the basic tenets of wound care remains essential. These tenets include thorough assessment with medical and nutritional optimization, debridement (including surgery), offloading (or compression), management of ischemia, management of infection, and appropriate wound bed preparation. Following these principles and established wound care guidelines often leads to satisfactory outcomes.

In addition, the rational use of advanced wound care therapies is encouraged when wounds do not respond sufficiently to standard care after four weeks or sooner, as circumstances dictate. In most cases, the selection of advanced therapies should be based on the available evidence to facilitate their most appropriate use.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^112G19g1]. Advances in Wound Care (2019).

The objective of this study was to address the issue of nonviable necrotic eschar, which impedes wound healing and can ultimately lead to the failure of soft tissue coverage in traumatic or high-risk wounds. Topical therapeutic agents, like those used in this study, can provide a less invasive management alternative to surgical debridement of eschar.

The approach involved a case study of a 40-year-old male who suffered from a traumatic right lower extremity amputation complicated by surgical incision ischemic eschar formation. A honey-based salve combined with burdock leaf dressings was applied noninvasively to manage eschar extending over the incision site. Images documenting treatment progress were obtained over a follow-up period of five months.

Results from the five-month follow-up demonstrated a complete resolution of the eschar and successful re-epithelialization of the skin in the affected region.

- **Innovation**: Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings shows promise for enhancing healing outcomes in traumatic wounds that develop nonviable eschar. Surgical debridement of an amputation stump with a large ischemic eschar was avoided with the use of these dressings.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^117WTGVX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

	- **Protocol**: The systematic review question was posed by members of the Toronto Central Local Health Integrated Network. In collaboration with this network, our research team prepared a draft protocol that was revised to incorporate feedback from systematic review methodologists, policymakers, and clinicians with expertise in wound care. Our protocol also included conducting a related project comprising an overview of systematic reviews for treating complex wounds, and these results are available in a separate publication.

	- **Information sources and search strategy**: On October 26, 2012, an experienced librarian conducted comprehensive literature searches in the following electronic databases from inception onwards: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. The literature search was limited to adult patients and economic studies. The Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist was used by another expert librarian to peer review the literature search. The search was revised as necessary, and the final MEDLINE search is presented in an additional file. Full literature searches for the other databases are available upon request. The reference lists of the included studies were searched to identify additional relevant studies.

### Management of traumatic wounds in the emergency department: Position paper from the Academy of Emergency Medicine and Care (AcEMC) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) [^1164FkjC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To build this document, we composed a multidisciplinary panel consisting of emergency physicians and surgeons, as well as experts from various fields and countries. The study lasted about four months and was divided into two phases. A dedicated questionnaire was sent by email to each panel member in both phases. In the first phase, which included three rounds, consensus was reached on eight topics addressed. Therefore, it was considered appropriate, in the second step, to repeat the round to attempt to reach consensus on all the issues addressed. The external validation of the document was achieved by organizing a two-day workshop, inviting a group of European experts to discuss and validate the statements.

As such, the first step was based on a series of key questions. The details of these questions are reported in Table 1.

### Organisation of health services for preventing and treating pressure ulcers [^112g1Fh3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Pressure ulcers, which are localized injuries to the skin or underlying tissue, occur when individuals are unable to reposition themselves to relieve pressure on bony prominences. These ulcers are often difficult to heal, painful, expensive to manage, and negatively impact quality of life. While individual patient safety and quality care largely stem from direct healthcare practitioner-patient interactions, each practitioner-patient wound-care contact may be constrained or enhanced by the healthcare organization of services. Research is needed to clearly demonstrate the effect of different provider-oriented approaches to pressure ulcer prevention and treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different provider-oriented interventions targeted at the organization of health services on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.

- **Search methods**: In April 2018, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched three clinical trial registries for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series were included.

### Principles of wound care in patients with epidermolysis bullosa [^114Unwp5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Epidermolysis bullosa comprises a series of hereditary skin fragility disorders characterized by blister formation in response to minor friction or trauma. Acute and chronic wounds are part of the daily life of many epidermolysis bullosa patients. To offer proper care, health care providers need to understand the wound healing process, recognize the different types of wounds these patients may present, and be able to select among a wide variety of wound care products to optimize healing.

### Nexobrid [^112XFwWY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Nexobrid for the eschar removal of deep partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness (FT) thermal burns has been investigated in two trials.

- **Study 1**: Nexobrid was investigated in the DETECT randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, three-arm trial, comparing Nexobrid, standard of care (SOC), and gel vehicle treatment in subjects with DPT and/or FT thermal burns of 3–30% body surface area (BSA) (Study 1, NCT02148705). SOC included both surgical and non-surgical methods for eschar removal per the investigators' discretion. Subjects in the Nexobrid and gel vehicle arms who had eschar remaining following the topical treatment period were treated with SOC. Nexobrid was compared to gel vehicle for the incidence of ≥ 95% eschar removal at the end of the topical treatment period. Nexobrid was also compared with SOC for the incidence of surgical eschar removal (including tangential, minor, avulsion, Versajet, and/or dermabrasion excision) and time to eschar removal.

A total of 175 subjects were randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio (Nexobrid: SOC: gel vehicle), and 169 subjects were treated. The mean age was 41 years, with 70% of subjects being male and 30% being female. The racial distribution was 81% White, 14% Black or African American, 5% from other races, and 1% Asian, with 17% of subjects being Hispanic or Latino. Subjects had one or more target wounds (TWs) to be treated for eschar removal. The mean percentage BSA of all TWs per subject was 6.1%, and the majority of subjects (82%) had one to two TWs.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^116iX2Kg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Almost half of the included systematic reviews were rated as being of high methodological quality according to the AMSTAR tool. Consistent methodological shortcomings include not using a protocol to guide their conduct, not including a list of excluded studies at the full-text level of screening, and not addressing or referring to publication bias. Results reported in systematic reviews with higher scores on the AMSTAR tool are likely the most reliable. Furthermore, some studies only gave wound care patients two days of treatment or followed patients for two days; the utility of these short studies is questionable and studies of longer duration are recommended.

### What is important to patients in wound management [^114xbSVW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Traumatic wounds are a common reason for patients to attend emergency departments. There are many ways of managing these wounds, from glue to suturing. The authors conducted a patient survey to identify the outcome measures most important to patients after the closure of traumatic wounds. The results showed that having the least chance of infection was the most important outcome, followed by being looked after by caring staff and a quick recovery. These findings were consistent regardless of the anatomical location of the wound or the age of the patient. This information is being used to guide the authors in identifying the most appropriate outcome measures for further research.

### Comparison of patients discharged to skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for COVID-19: A retrospective study [^115wh5Wp]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

The aim of the study is to identify differences in demographics, severity of disease, and rates of hospital readmission among adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for coronavirus 2019.

- **Design**: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults hospitalized with coronavirus 2019 infection at academic medical centers participating in the Vizient Clinical Data Base between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, who were discharged to skilled nursing facilities or inpatient rehabilitation facilities (N = 39,882). Data from the Clinical Data Base are used with permission of Vizient, Inc. All rights reserved.

- **Results**: Among adults hospitalized with coronavirus 2019 infection, those discharged to skilled nursing facilities were 1.4 times more likely to require hospital readmission than those discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. They were, on average, older (73 vs. 61 years, P < 0.001) and had shorter hospital lengths of stay (15 vs. 26 days, P < 0.0001) than the patients discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Persons discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities were more likely to have received intensive care and mechanical ventilation while hospitalized (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Individuals discharged to inpatient rehabilitation facilities after hospitalization for coronavirus 2019 differ from those discharged to skilled nursing facilities on a number of key variables, including age, hospital length of stay, having received intensive care, and odds of hospital readmission.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^117JKZFB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The literature search resulted in 6,200 titles and abstracts, of which 5,778 were excluded for not fulfilling the eligibility criteria (Figure 1). Of the 422 full-texts retrieved and screened in duplicate, 309 articles were excluded. Ninety-nine systematic reviews of wound care interventions were included in this overview of systematic reviews; 54 were systematic reviews with meta-analysis results, and 45 were systematic reviews without a meta-analysis. In addition, 14 companion reports were included, the majority of which were Cochrane updates.

- **Study flow**: Details the flow of information through the different phases of the review. The flow maps out the number of records identified, included, and excluded, as well as the reasons for their exclusion.

- **Systematic review characteristics**: The reviews were conducted between 1997 and 2012, with 28% taking place after 2011. The first authors of the systematic reviews were predominantly based in Europe (66%), North America (19%), and Australia or New Zealand (7%). The number of studies included in each review ranged from 0 to 130, with 80% including between 2 and 30 studies. Ninety-three systematic reviews included randomized clinical trials. Five systematic reviews were unpublished.

*Numbers do not add up to 99, as the systematic reviews contributed data to more than one category.*

### Burns: Pathophysiology of systemic complications and current management [^115zdMby]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Treating burns requires that the toxic eschar be removed early, usually within the first 24 to 72 hours. Removal of necrotic tissue reduces mortality and complications in patients with serious burns. This is typically achieved through surgical eschar excision and split-thickness autografts from healthy skin. Thus, burn treatment strategies are often limited by the available amounts of healthy skin present.

Topical antimicrobial agents should be administered after initial decontamination to prevent bacterial colonization of the burn wound. Systemic agents are less successful in treating local infections because they do not reach the burn wounds in large concentrations due to the microthrombosis of vessels and wound edema. The area is then covered with a nonadherent dressing.

### Scabies outbreaks in ten care homes for elderly people: a prospective study of clinical features, epidemiology, and treatment outcomes [^114Fyhg2]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Scabies, a skin infestation with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is often intensely pruritic and distressing. Although clinicians frequently diagnose and treat scabies in children and young adults, very old people (i.e. older than 85 years) can be highly affected, and outbreaks are common in residential and nursing care for elderly people. The mean diagnosed incidence in the UK between 1997 and 2005 was 2.27 per 1000 men and 2.81 per 1000 women. The 2015 global burden was 5,268,900 years lived with disability. Transmission is by direct close contact and, to a lesser extent, via fomites, with a 4–6 week incubation period in people never previously infested. Signs include papules, burrows, and nodules. Excoriation due to scratching and parasite-induced inhibition of local immune response can lead to secondary bacterial infection, with resultant risks of impaired renal function and rheumatic heart disease. The normal parasitic burden is around 11 burrowing adult female mites per individual. However, some people develop crusted scabies, with hyperkeratotic skin lesions harboring more than 4700 mites per gram. Such patients have an increased mortality risk and are core transmitters during outbreaks.

- **Scabies signs**: Papules (A), burrows (B), burrows under dermatoscopy (C), hyperkeratotic skin crusts (D), and Sarcoptes scabiei mites and eggs under ×10 microscopy (E).

Scabies outbreaks in residential care homes for elderly people are challenging to diagnose, stigmatizing, and costly to manage. The close proximity of individuals and lengthy asymptomatic periods contribute to the difficulty in controlling these outbreaks.

### Wound care specialization: The current status and future plans to move wound care into the medical community [^116FSskX]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

There has been an explosion of basic science results in the field of wound care over the past 20 years. Initially, wound dressings were the only therapeutic option available to the wound practitioner. With advanced basic science knowledge, technical innovation, and the recent participation of pharmaceutical companies, the wound clinician now has an arsenal of dressings, biological tissue replacements, gene therapy, and cell-based treatment options. What has not, however, kept pace with these changes is the education and practical training for those treating non-healing wounds. The pace of innovation in wound diagnostic tools has also lagged, creating even more pressure on the clinician to use experience, skill, and training to properly diagnose the root cause for the non-healing wound. As wound healing is not considered a medical specialty, there is no formal training process for physicians. Subsequently, allied health practitioners are often the only ones available to provide care for these complex patients. Wound care training, however, is also not part of any formal curriculum for these healthcare providers, creating confusion for patients, payors, regulators, researchers, and product manufacturers.

- **The problem**: In all other fields of medicine, there is a formal process in place for physicians to train, certify, and credential. Medicine is constantly evolving, and several new fields of specialty care have been created over the past two decades that can serve as examples for the wound care field to follow. Without academic-based clinical residency programs, the systematic training necessary for a comprehensive understanding of wound care is lacking, leaving non-specialists to bridge the gap in addressing complex patient needs.

### Current state of science in negative pressure wound therapy [^117GVaNA]. Advances in Wound Care (2025). High credibility.

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was introduced in clinical practice in the early 1990s and has become widely used to manage wounds in both inpatient and outpatient care. Recent evolutions of the initial technology include the development of new dressing interfaces and tubing configurations, the addition of instillation to improve cleansing, and various design changes to enhance portability. Research has been conducted to understand mechanisms of action and to demonstrate clinical utility. NPWT has been suggested as a valuable approach for various complex and/or nonhealing wounds, and recommendations for its use have emerged in several guidelines.

The evidence, composed of a combination of randomized controlled trials, case series, cohort studies, real-world evidence, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and expert opinion, is heterogeneous and still building. This special mini forum issue presents the state of the science for NPWT and new studies providing insights on some innovative ways clinicians use this technology to help improve outcomes in a variety of wound types.

### Nexobrid [^116CM1h7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Nexobrid is indicated for eschar removal in adults and pediatric patients with deep partial thickness (DPT) and/or full thickness (FT) thermal burns.

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of Nexobrid have not been established for the treatment of chemical or electrical burns; burns on the face, perineum, or genitalia; burns on the feet of patients with diabetes mellitus or occlusive vascular disease; circumferential burns; or burns in patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease, including inhalation injury.

Nexobrid is not recommended for wounds contaminated with radioactive and other hazardous substances to avoid unforeseeable reactions with the product and an increased risk of spreading the noxious substance. It is also not recommended for the treatment of burn wounds where medical devices (e.g. implants, pacemakers, shunts) or vital structures (e.g. large vessels) could become exposed during eschar removal.

Nexobrid contains proteolytic enzymes and is indicated for eschar removal in adults and pediatric patients with deep partial thickness and/or full thickness thermal burns.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^1118R4cL]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). High credibility.

Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, a marked loss of quality of life, and a considerable economic burden. Evidence-based risk prediction to guide improved wound prevention and treatment is limited by the complexity of their etiology, clinical underreporting, and a lack of studies using large, high-quality datasets.

- **Recent advancements**: This review aims to summarize key components and challenges in developing personalized risk prediction tools for both prevention and management of chronic wounds, while highlighting several innovations in the development of better risk stratification.

- **Critical issues**: Regression-based risk prediction approaches remain important for the assessment of prognosis and risk stratification in chronic wound management. Advances in statistical computing have boosted the development of several promising machine learning (ML) and other semiautomated classification tools. These methods may be better suited to handle the large number of wound healing risk factors from extensive datasets, potentially resulting in better risk prediction when combined with conventional methods, clinical experience, and expertise.

- **Future directions**: Where the number of predictors is large and heterogeneous, the correlations between various risk factors are complex, and very large datasets are available, ML may prove a powerful adjuvant for risk stratifying patients predisposed to chronic wounds. Conventional regression-based approaches remain critical, particularly where the number of predictors is relatively small.

### Eschar with cellulitis as a clinical predictor in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin abscess [^117K4weq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This study was designed to determine the validity of a central eschar with surrounding cellulitis as a clinical predictor for CA-MRSA infection. In this 10-month prospective observational study, patients with a chief complaint or clinical findings of skin infection with abscess had study data sheets placed on their chart. All abscesses were treated with incision and drainage, and wound cultures were obtained. Exclusionary criteria included patient age under 18 years, recent incarceration within 14 days, and being hospitalized or in a nursing home within 10 days. Correlation of wound culture results with recorded physical examinations determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values.

A total of 224 patients with abscesses were enrolled; 18 patients met exclusion criteria. An additional 78 patients were excluded because no wound cultures had been obtained, study data forms were incomplete, or there was no evidence of wound cellulitis. Of the 128 remaining patients, 91 wound cultures grew MRSA (71% prevalence). Of these 91 cases, 50 tested positive for central black eschar, yielding a sensitivity of 55% (95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.65). Thirty-seven patients had abscesses that grew non-MRSA bacteria. Three of these were positive for central black eschar, yielding a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 0.83–1.01). The positive predictive value was 94% (95% CI, 0.88–1.01) and the negative predictive value was 45% (95% CI, 0.32–0.59). A central black eschar with cellulitis has good specificity and high positive predictive value in diagnosing CA-MRSA infection.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^111mCvHP]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

Nonviable necrotic eschar is an impediment to wound healing and can ultimately lead to failure of soft tissue coverage in traumatic or high-risk wounds. Topical therapeutic agents can provide a less invasive management alternative to surgical debridement of eschar. The case of a 40-year-old male with a traumatic right lower extremity amputation complicated by surgical incision ischemic eschar formation is reported. Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings was used to noninvasively manage eschar extending over the incision site. Images were obtained for five months of follow-up. A five-month follow-up demonstrated complete resolution of eschar and re-epithelialization of skin in the affected region. Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings shows promise for enhancing healing outcomes in traumatic wounds that develop nonviable eschar. Surgical debridement of an amputation stump with large ischemic eschar was avoided with the use of honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings.

### Collagenase Santyl [^113AcHuz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be applied once daily — or more frequently if the dressing becomes soiled, such as from incontinence. When clinically indicated, crosshatching thick eschar with a #10 blade allows Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment more surface contact with necrotic debris. Additionally, it is recommended to remove as much loosened detritus as possible using forceps and scissors.

Use Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment in the following manner:

1. Prior to application, cleanse the wound of debris and digested material by gently rubbing with a gauze pad saturated with normal saline solution or another cleansing agent compatible with Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment (see precautions). Follow this with a rinse using normal saline solution.

2.

- **Infection management**: Whenever infection is present, apply an appropriate topical antibiotic powder to the wound before applying Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment. If the infection does not respond, discontinue the use of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment until the infection is in remission.

3. Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment may be applied directly to the wound or to a sterile gauze pad, which is then applied to the wound and properly secured.

4. Use of Collagenase Santyl◊Ointment should be terminated when debridement of necrotic tissue is complete, and granulation tissue is well established.

### Better wound care begins with better evidence: Outcomes of the Wound Care Evidence Summit [^116DJUXT]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). High credibility.

In 2022, the Alliance of Wound Care Stakeholders convened the 2-day Wound Care Evidence Summit™. The Summit brought together a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders that included payers, government agency policymakers, prominent researchers, wound care medical specialty societies, patient and clinical associations, wound care clinics, and manufacturers to discuss wound care evidence and coverage issues. The Summit focused on a wide variety of wound care topics, with an emphasis on the processes payers use to create their coverage policies and the type, quantity, and characteristics of clinical evidence payers require.

The most valuable outcome of the Summit was the frank and open discourse among stakeholders, with unprecedented participation from payers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the subjects of trial design, product-approval pathways, and coverage policy determination. Stakeholders provided actionable ideas for ways to improve clinical trial research and design that will yield better evidence and ultimately better wound care.

This article examines the quality, adequacy, and relevance of the existing chronic wound care research base and discusses the gaps, associated problems, and implications for clinical trial design and execution as identified by Summit participants.

### A systematic review of cost-effectiveness analyses of complex wound interventions reveals optimal treatments for specific wound types [^115sARj2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Complex wounds are those that do not heal following a period of 3 months or more. These types of wounds are a significant burden on the healthcare system and result in patient and caregiver stress, economic loss, and decreased quality of life. At least 1% of individuals living in high-economy countries will experience a complex wound in their lifetime, and over 6.5 million individuals have a complex wound in the United States alone. Moreover, these types of wounds have a significant economic impact, with $10 billion USD per year spent in North America on managing complex wounds, and 4% of the annual National Health Service expenditure in the United Kingdom allocated to care for patients with pressure ulcers.

- **Types of complex wounds**: There are three main categories: i) wounds resulting from chronic disease (e.g. venous insufficiency, diabetes), ii) pressure ulcers, and iii) non-healing surgical wounds. Treatment is targeted to the type of wound. Managing complex wounds resulting from disease usually involves improving the underlying disease, such as optimizing diabetes control for patients with diabetes.

- **Management strategies**: A clinical assessment and history of mobility and neurological disability are often necessary to treat patients with pressure ulcers. Considerations for managing surgical wound infections include previous antibiotic treatment and immune response.

It is estimated that the global wound care market will reach over $22 billion USD annually by 2020 due to the burgeoning costs of managing patients requiring complex wound care.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^115oV1yN]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

The innovative approach of conservative management using a honey-based salve may be a reasonable alternative in the appropriate patient population with close follow-up, in lieu of repeat surgical debridement and placement of skin grafts. Biologic agents have the potential to enhance healing and reduce incident infection. Although the use of honey is commonly reported in diabetic wounds and burn wounds, this case report is, to our knowledge, the first description of honey-based salve and burdock leaves being utilized as a less-invasive alternative to sharp debridement and skin grafting of a traumatic wound eschar to achieve coverage. Necrotic eschar is an impedance to wound healing and can ultimately lead to failure of soft tissue coverage of a lower extremity amputation stump.

- **Key findings**: Less invasive approaches to eschar management can increase patient satisfaction and should be considered in similar scenarios. The use of effective biologic agents can reduce the need for surgical debridement and skin grafts. Honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings may provide a less-invasive and highly effective strategy for eschar management.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^115hHUk2]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Low credibility.

Complex wounds that fail to progress through expected healing phases in a timely manner are classified in the group of hard-to-heal wounds or chronic wounds. Chronic wounds are associated with significant morbidity, marked loss of quality of life and utility, and considerable economic and societal burden, both within the United States and globally. Recent US estimates across all wound types put Medicare spending alone at USD 28–97 billion annually. Data from other countries further support the considerable costs of chronic wounds. Canadian expenditure on diabetic foot ulcers alone is estimated at $509 million annually, while chronic wound expenditure in the United Kingdom is estimated to be €4.5–5.3 billion.

A 2017 systematic review of 36 international cost-of-illness studies covering payer, hospital, patient, and societal perspectives estimated mean 1-year costs to the public payer ranging from $11,000 (USD) per chronic venous leg ulcer up to $44,200 for every diabetic foot ulcer. Projections suggest that these costs will continue to increase into the future.

Despite chronic wounds representing a major public health challenge, cost estimates likely underestimate the true burden of disease due to underreporting and a lack of quality prevalence studies, particularly at the global level. Critically, the timely identification, intervention, and personalized management of complex chronic wounds are further limited by a lack of reliable, validated risk prediction and prognostic tools. This is, in part, secondary to the complexity and range of comorbidities involved.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^116gbxF6]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

In specific circumstances of burn injury, particularly concerning patients with electrical injury, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining an ECG in patients who have suffered low-voltage electrical burns (less than 1,000 volts). Other aspects of management should be similar to treatment for any thermal injury while adhering to admission criteria.

### ISBI practice guidelines for burn care, part 2 [^11771L2S]. Burns (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for burn injury, more specifically with respect to patients with electrical injury, the ISBI 2018 guidelines recommend transferring patients with high-voltage electrical burns (contact with electric current > 1,000 volts) to a burn care facility with the capability of caring for these complex patients.

### Wound healing — a practical algorithm [^115ZPoUQ]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The decision-making process involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds is complex but hinges on certain simple principles. The first is to agree on the actual aim of management with the patient or their representative, recognizing that healing of an open wound may be only a part of this goal. The agreed plan should be discussed and reviewed if the wound is unresponsive to intervention.

Management depends on regular debridement and cleansing, treatment of any infection, consideration of revascularization, and protection of the wound by dressings and off-loading. The evidence justifying the use of advanced wound care therapies is not strong; outcome depends more on the organization of the wound care process than on the choice of a particular wound care product.

The introduction of an expert multidisciplinary team has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of major amputation. It is likely that the availability of prompt expert advice is the principal explanation for the major variations in the incidence of amputation, even within single countries.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: An overview of systematic reviews [^111zEcZ7]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There are some limitations to our overview of systematic reviews. An inherent drawback of including systematic reviews is that the studies included in each of the reviews will have been published well before the search date. The inclusion of close to 100 systematic reviews, however, provides a breadth of information that is unlikely to significantly change with the inclusion of recently published studies.

Although we appraised the methodological quality of the included reviews, we did not assess the risk of bias in the included studies in the systematic reviews. This is because a risk of bias tool for systematic reviews currently does not exist, but we are aware of one being developed by the Cochrane Collaboration. Furthermore, we only included systematic reviews that were disseminated in English due to resource constraints. However, we attempted contacting authors to receive English translations.

In addition, although we included five unpublished systematic reviews, we attempted to obtain unpublished data from a further 10 systematic reviews that were available as conference abstracts, yet we didn't receive a response from the review authors. As such, our findings are likely representative of published literature written in English. Since we did not conduct a meta-analysis, we were unable to formally test for publication bias.

Our results suggest the need for a network meta-analysis, given the numerous interventions and comparators available and examined across the literature. Policy-makers focus their decisions at the systems level, so require information on all treatment.

### "Gearing to a time table"; the evolution of earlier surgical eschar excision in massive burns by British burns surgeons at the battles of Cassino, 1944: an example of real-time audit [^1126xZjt]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of burns care delivery is difficult to measure within a realistic workload and resource framework, and workers must develop new tools for this purpose. We describe a historical example from World War II, illustrating the evolution of burns excision in the context of thorough outcome assessment during the Allied advance from North Africa up the Italian peninsula, including the battles of Cassino from 1942 to 1945. Patrick Clarkson and Rex Lawrie, working as plastic surgeons in a small forward Maxillofacial Unit, were able to fully assess the management and outcomes of 800 burnt servicemen. Of these, 192 burns were full thickness and required grafting.

Prospective data revealed that burns which were surgically excised and grafted between 12 to 18 days after injury recovered more quickly than those managed by conservative dressings until the eschar sloughed off, followed by grafting. Specifically, burns managed by excision and grafting in less than 5 weeks after burning (n = 86) healed 8.6 days faster than those grafted later (n = 106). This difference was more pronounced for massive burns over 1000 cm², with those grafted in less than 5 weeks (n = 17) healing 13 days faster than the delayed group (n = 27). Their transparent and simple method of prospective audit is described.

### Individualized risk prediction for improved chronic wound management [^116AUFui]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). High credibility.

Improved risk prediction is essential for the early identification of patients at highest risk for progressing to chronic wounds. This may enable early intervention in clinical practice to both prevent disease progression and support targeted, personalized management of disease once progressed, accounting for an individual patient's unique set of risk factors.

### Burns [^115YCBhx]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Over the past 20 years, burn care has evolved as a specialized field of surgery, leading to significant improvements in both survival rates and outcome quality. Public expectations for survival and long-term recovery have reached previously unprecedented levels. These advancements are attributed to numerous improvements in various aspects of burn care, occurring concurrently and promoting the increasing regionalization of this resource-intensive activity into fewer specialized centers. Burn care involves complex hospitalizations, which can be divided into four distinct phases: initial evaluation and resuscitation; initial wound excision and biological closure; definitive wound closure; and rehabilitation and reconstruction.

### WHS guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers-2023 update [^116jbSSp]. Wound Repair and Regeneration (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pressure ulcers, more specifically concerning debridement, WHS 2024 guidelines recommend performing initial debridement — sharp, mechanical, enzymatic, ultrasonic, or autolytic — as more than one method may be appropriate. The aim is to remove the obvious necrotic or devitalized tissue, excessive bacterial burden, and the cellular burden of dead and senescent cells. Maintenance debridement should be carried out to preserve the appearance and readiness of the wound bed for healing.

### Wound care nursing: Professional issues and opportunities [^114jiZMM]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

As the field of wound care advances and seeks validity as a distinctive healthcare specialty, it becomes imperative to define practice competencies for all related professionals in the arena. The myriad of nurses practicing wound care in settings across the continuum should be understood for their unique contribution to the wound care team. Furthermore, the hierarchy of wound care nursing, with varying levels of licensure, certification, and scope of practice can be clarified to delineate leadership and reimbursement issues to meet healthcare challenges. A review of the role of nursing in wound care from a historical and evolutionary perspective helps to characterize the trend towards advanced practice nursing in the wound care specialty.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^113m6awA]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Low credibility.

- **Limitations**: If tissue is deemed completely nonviable in the initial evaluation of the injury, or infection threatens the soft tissue envelope, then sharp debridement and swift intervention are indicated. Allergies to honey or burdock leaves will contraindicate the use of these biologics.

The honey-based salve with burdock leaf dressings was used in combination in this case of patient-centered care in managing the severely mangled extremity. Further study is needed to determine whether honey-based salve or burdock leaf dressings used alone would have similar efficacy in eschar management for this type of injury.

### Emergency management of difficult wounds: Part II [^116yDdCu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Difficult wounds constitute a significant amount of the morbidity and mortality that emergency physicians encounter daily. There are specific traumatic and atraumatic wounds that are challenging to manage and carry a high risk of complications. Emergency physicians must be adept at identifying these high-risk wounds and patients and take necessary steps to mitigate further morbidity and mortality.

### Eschar-associated spotted fever rickettsiosis, Bahia, Brazil [^1147HFKb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In the scientific literature from Brazil, the earliest reference to an eschar in a suspected case of BSF was in 1932. Subsequent eschar-associated cases have been identified in regions where BSF is endemic, such as the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espirito Santo, as well as in regions where it is not endemic, including the states of Santa Catarina, situated along the Argentina border, and Bahia, where the case reported in this article occurred.

Clinical descriptions of eschar-associated rickettsioses in Brazil have been reported from BSF-endemic areas with large populations of A. dubitatum ticks but no known A. triste ticks, recognized vectors of R. parkeri in southern Brazil. Although A. dubitatum, a human-biting tick highly prevalent in many BSF-endemic areas, is a potential candidate for the transmission of R. parkeri to humans in Brazil, this tick species and its vertebrate hosts, capybaras, have not yet been described in the Paty Valley, Bahia, where the patient acquired the rickettsial infection. Unfortunately, the ticks causing both cases in São Paulo and Bahia were not available for identification.

The taxonomic status of the etiologic agent of this novel rickettsiosis in Brazil cannot be definitively determined until it is isolated. Based on the available genetic information presented here and elsewhere, the pathogen detected in the cutaneous lesion of the patients from Bahia and São Paulo is equally distant from R. africae, R. parkeri, and R. sibirica. Each of these three SFGR is among species long accepted by the International Committee.
