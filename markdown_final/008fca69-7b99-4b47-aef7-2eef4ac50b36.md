## Question

differential for high RBC, low MCV, low MCH, low MCHC, and high RDW, normal Hgb

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and generate a differential diagnosis for a blood count showing high RBC count with low MCV, low MCH, low MCHC, high RDW, and normal hemoglobin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pattern and what it implies morphologically. Then, I should verify the differential for microcytosis and how RDW helps separate iron deficiency from thalassemia. Next, I will examine how a high RBC count with normal hemoglobin fits thalassemia physiology. After that, I need to check for mixed or alternative causes and outline the confirmatory workup. Finally, I will consider special populations, pitfalls, and a concise bottom-line diagnosis with next steps, making sure I double-check each inference against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the morphologic pattern: low MCV and low MCH/MCHC indicate microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes, and a high RDW signals anisocytosis, which together are classic for thalassemia trait, whereas iron deficiency typically shows low MCV/MCH/MCHC with high RDW but not the compensatory erythrocytosis seen here; the normal hemoglobin despite microcytosis is a key clue toward thalassemia physiology rather than iron deficiency alone [^111wbP4h] [^117NHQFZ] [^114AKt1p].

> Wait, let me verify the role of RDW in separating iron deficiency from thalassemia trait because I should not jump to conclusions; RDW is commonly increased in iron deficiency anemia and often normal or only mildly increased in uncomplicated thalassemia trait, but this is not absolute, and mixed or evolving disease can blur this boundary, so I need to ensure iron studies and hemoglobin analysis are obtained rather than relying on RDW alone [^114AKt1p] [^111wbP4h] [^1135enbt].

> I will now examine the high RBC count with normal hemoglobin; in thalassemia trait, chronic underproduction of normal hemoglobin drives erythroid expansion with increased RBC production, which can normalize hemoglobin while keeping MCV and MCH low, a compensatory mechanism that is less prominent in isolated iron deficiency, so this constellation strengthens suspicion for thalassemia trait rather than pure iron deficiency anemia [^117NHQFZ] [^114iFd87].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for mixed etiologies because iron deficiency can coexist with thalassemia trait and will typically accentuate microcytosis and raise RDW further, and anemia of chronic disease can also contribute, so I need to ensure iron studies, inflammatory markers, and a reticulocyte count are interpreted in context before finalizing the diagnosis [^114AKt1p] [^112Vtput] [^111wbP4h].

> Next, I should review the confirmatory workup; let me first confirm iron status with ferritin, serum iron, transferrin or TIBC, and transferrin saturation, remembering ferritin is an acute phase reactant and may be misleading if inflammation is present, then I should order hemoglobin electrophoresis with quantification of HbA2 and HbF to identify thalassemia trait, consider molecular testing for alpha- or beta-thalassemia mutations when electrophoresis is inconclusive, and obtain a reticulocyte count to assess marrow response; if results are equivocal or there are atypical features, a peripheral smear can help detect codominant membrane defects or other morphologies, and in selected cases a bone marrow exam may be needed to exclude sideroblastic processes [^114AKt1p] [^117NHQFZ] [^113YLrwi] [^115QLxxB].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or from a high-prevalence region; I need to ensure I consider population-specific nuances, as pregnancy and certain ancestries increase the prevalence of thalassemia trait and may influence prenatal counseling and screening strategies, and I should remember that race-based reference ranges have been challenged, so interpretation should rely on biology and ancestry-informed diagnostics rather than race-assigned thresholds [^117NHQFZ] [^114ptyY5].

> I should confirm that the normal hemoglobin does not exclude thalassemia; in fact, many thalassemia carriers maintain normal or near-normal hemoglobin due to increased RBC production, so the combination of high RBC, low MCV/MCH/MCHC, and high RDW with preserved hemoglobin is physiologically consistent with thalassemia trait and should prompt hemoglobin analysis rather than reassurance [^117NHQFZ] [^114iFd87].

> Let me reconsider the RDW point one more time; while a markedly elevated RDW favors iron deficiency, overlap exists, and in a patient with high RBC and preserved hemoglobin, thalassemia trait remains the leading diagnosis until iron studies and hemoglobin electrophoresis prove otherwise, so I should explicitly state that iron deficiency has not been excluded and needs confirmation before concluding mixed disease [^114AKt1p] [^111wbP4h].

> Final synthesis: the most likely diagnosis is thalassemia trait, with the high RBC count compensating for microcytosis to keep hemoglobin normal, while the elevated RDW reflects anisocytosis from heterogeneous globin chain synthesis; iron deficiency anemia is a key differential and may coexist, anemia of chronic disease is less likely to explain isolated microcytosis without anemia, and sideroblastic anemia is rare but should be considered if iron studies are atypical or the smear shows ring sideroblasts, so the next steps are iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis with HbA2/HbF quantification, and reticulocyte count, with molecular testing or marrow evaluation reserved for unresolved cases [^117NHQFZ] [^114AKt1p] [^111wbP4h] [^115QLxxB].

---

The most likely cause of high RBC with low MCV, MCH, MCHC, high RDW, and normal Hgb is **thalassemia trait** (alpha or beta), in which microcytosis and hypochromia coexist with erythrocytosis and anisocytosis, keeping hemoglobin normal [^117NHQFZ]. Other considerations include **early iron deficiency** (before anemia develops), anemia of chronic disease with mixed microcytosis, and sideroblastic anemia; confirm with iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and a peripheral smear [^111wbP4h] [^115u8PZ8].

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Thalassemia trait (alpha or beta)

- **Pathophysiology**: Reduced globin synthesis causes microcytosis and hypochromia; marrow compensation increases RBC count, maintaining normal Hgb [^117NHQFZ].
- **CBC pattern**: High RBC, low MCV/MCH/MCHC, high RDW, normal Hgb [^117NHQFZ].
- **Confirmatory tests**: Hemoglobin electrophoresis (elevated HbA2 in beta-thalassemia trait), molecular testing [^117NHQFZ].

---

### Early iron deficiency anemia

Early iron deficiency anemia presents with **microcytosis and hypochromia** due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis, with an elevated RDW reflecting anisocytosis; the RBC count may be normal or slightly increased early on, and hemoglobin remains normal until late-stage deficiency [^111wbP4h] [^114AKt1p].

---

### Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) with mixed features

In anemia of chronic disease with mixed features, **chronic inflammation** impairs iron availability, causing microcytosis and hypochromia; when mixed with iron deficiency, RDW rises and RBC count may be normal or slightly increased, with hemoglobin typically normal or mildly decreased [^112Vtput] [^113YLrwi].

---

### Sideroblastic anemia

In sideroblastic anemia, **defective heme synthesis** produces microcytosis and hypochromia; RDW is elevated due to anisocytosis, RBC count may be normal or slightly increased, and hemoglobin is usually normal or mildly decreased [^111wbP4h] [^1147DvjX] [^111DJaRc].

---

## Diagnostic approach

| **Step** | **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Iron studies (ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation) | Differentiate iron deficiency from other causes [^111wbP4h] |
| 2 | Hemoglobin electrophoresis | Identify thalassemia trait [^117NHQFZ] |
| 3 | Peripheral blood smear | Assess morphology, anisocytosis, poikilocytosis [^114EUrzm] |
| 4 | Reticulocyte count | Assess marrow response [^113FzNgd] |
| 5 | Molecular testing (if indicated) | Confirm thalassemia or genetic disorders [^117NHQFZ] |

---

## Clinical implications

Thalassemia trait is usually benign but **carries reproductive implications**; genetic counseling is recommended [^notfound]. Early iron deficiency is **treatable and reversible** with iron therapy [^114J4SK1]. Anemia of chronic disease requires management of the underlying inflammatory condition [^117Fk92E], and sideroblastic anemia may need further evaluation for primary or secondary causes, including medications or myelodysplastic syndromes [^115QLxxB].

---

The most likely cause is **thalassemia trait**, with early iron deficiency, ACD with mixed features, and sideroblastic anemia as differentials; confirm with iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and smear [^111wbP4h].

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^112a7PzD]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Biology of anemia, differential diagnosis, and treatment options in human immunodeficiency virus infection [^1151tzEi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematologic manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes of HIV-related anemia are multifactorial and include direct and indirect effects of HIV infection. HIV-related anemia generally is due to reduced red blood cell (RBC) production, secondary to a variety of causes, but it may also involve nutritional deficiencies, increased RBC destruction, or a combination of these problems. Evaluation of hemoglobin level, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and mean corpuscular volume value and review of the peripheral blood smear are necessary for diagnosis. Treatment of HIV-related anemia should address the correctable underlying causes of this disorder, such as modifications of offending medications, nutritional deficiencies, and parvovirus infection. Patients with HIV infection have a blunted erythropoietin response to anemia. Therapeutic modalities for anemia that is not amenable to correction include blood transfusion and recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa).

### Red cell distribution width and dementia among rural-dwelling older adults: the MIND-China study [^111DJaRc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia affects over 50 million people worldwide, and nearly 60%of all dementia patients live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Notably, the number of people with dementia is projected to increase faster in LMICs than in high-income countries in the coming decades. Since the 1990s the prevalence of dementia in China has increased steadily in all age groups from 60 years of age. The total annual expenditure for dementia in China was estimated at US$168 billion. The prevalence of dementia was notably higher in the rural than urban communities. Given that there is currently no curative therapy available for dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for preventive and therapeutic interventions to delay the onset of dementia and slow cognitive decline.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocyte volume. It is routinely calculated by the overwhelming majority of hematologic analyzers according to red blood cell (RBC) volume and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). A normal RDW suggests homogeneous RBC size, whereas an elevated RDW indicates heterogeneous RBC size, known as anisocytosis. RDW in combination with MCV can used for differential diagnosis of anemia. An elevated RDW is often related to anemia due to nutrient deficiency (e.g. iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) and sideroblastic anemia, and a normal RDW is often related to anemia from chronic disease, thalassemia heterozygosity, and aplastic anemia. Studies have shown that an increased RDW is associated with mortality, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and other chronic health conditions. The association of RDW with adverse health outcomes may depend on anemia or hemoglobin levels. Of note, the cross-sectional data from the Chicago Health and Aging Project found that elevated RDW was associated with dementia, especially among non-anemic participants. In addition, evidence has been accumulating over the last decade that anemia or low hemoglobin is related to cognitive impairment and dementia among older adults. However, most population-based studies of anemia and dementia have been conducted among high-income countries. In particular, the relationship of abnormal RDW with dementia and cognitive function as well as the interplay of increased RDW and anemia in cognitive aging has yet to be explored among LMICs.

Therefore, in this population-based cross-sectional study of older adults living in the rural communities in China, we sought 1) to evaluate the associations of RDW and anemia with dementia and global cognitive function; and 2) to explore whether their association varied by anemia status.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^114rKA1g]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by persistent and progressive airway inflammation and/or emphysema. This causes airflow limitation, resulting in symptoms like coughing, mucus production, wheezing, and shortness of breath. According to statistics, COPD has become one of the top three causes of death in the world, and many patients have died from it or its complications. In 2019, more than 3.3 million people died from COPD which was the primary cause of deaths from COPD. The global burden of mortality in COPD patients remains substantial, affecting a significant number of individuals worldwide. This disease poses substantial challenges for both patients and healthcare systems, under-scoring the critical need for a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to improve outcomes and quality of life for affected individuals.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a simple and inexpensive hematological parameter that reflects the degree of heterogeneity in red blood cell volume, has been traditionally used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of anemia. As a dynamic parameter responsive to internal and external stimuli, RDW levels provide a sensitive gauge of the body's homeostatic mechanisms. Clinical studies have shown that RDW is associated with various diseases and disease outcomes, and RDW is now recognized as a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the general population. Over the past 20 years, multiple studies have confirmed that patients with stable COPD and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive disease (AECOPD) have higher RDW levels compared with healthy individual. Furthermore, some studies have confirmed that RDW is related to mortality in patients with COPD. Hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is a new combined biomarker proposed by Sun et al. in their study on the progression of non-small cell lung cancer. HRR is considered an inflammatory marker and is associated with the incidence and adverse events of a variety of diseases. However, the relationship between HRR and mortality in patients with COPD remains unclear. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HRR is a better predictor of mortality compared to RDW in these patients.

Consequently, our primary objective is to evaluate the association of RDW and HRR with mortality in COPD patients, and to compare their predictive roles for mortality in these patients.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with incident myocardial infarction in a general population: the troms ø study [^113ydnkf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of the variability in size of circulating erythrocytes, is calculated by automated blood cell counters as part of the routine blood cell count analysis. Traditionally, RDW and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, particularly anemias that are microcytic (caused by iron deficiency) or macrocytic (due to vitamin B 12 or folate deficiency). An increased RDW can also result from conditions that modify the shape of red blood cells due to the premature release of immature cells into the bloodstream, to hemoglobinopathies, or to other hematological diseases.

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. – Consequently, identification of novel risk factors is of great potential value to improve risk stratification and facilitate targeted prevention of MI. In a study from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a representative US population, participants with RDW values above the 75th percentile were aggregated in the highest 10‐year Framingham risk category for coronary heart disease. Other observational studies in selected cohorts of patients with heart disease have reported that RDW predicts all‐cause mortality, – cardiac morbidity and mortality, – and adverse outcome in patients with heart failure. – Furthermore, RDW predicted all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in 2 population‐based studies from NHANES. –

The association between RDW and MI has previously been reported mainly in patients with known CV disease or heart failure. – Although growing evidence supports the hypothesis that high RDW is associated with an unfavorable CV risk profile and higher total and CV mortality in various populations, the impact of RDW on the risk of incident MI in a general population is unclear. Consequently, we aimed to investigate whether RDW was associated with risk of first‐ever event of MI in a large prospective study with participants recruited from a general population.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^115Hh1of]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^115tiRmv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Childhood myelodysplastic syndromes — differential diagnosis and diagnostic thresholds are noted: Differential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular volume and clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory, and higher expression of p53, lower expression of survivin, or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA. Compared with AML, low WBC count, multi-lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis with numerical rather than structural cytogenetic abnormalities suggest MDS, and a bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, with biologic features more important than a strict blast cutoff value. Monosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, dysplasia does not necessarily indicate antecedent MDS and criteria for MDS diagnosis in a patient who presents with AML are stringent; dysplasia may reflect infection, deficiencies of B12 and copper, drug therapy, or chronic disease, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and Pearson syndrome should also be excluded.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Prognostic value of red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume on mortality in hemodialysis patients [^1119DKue]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are principally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Limited evidence is available for its prognostic value for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to definite the relationship between RDW and MCV and mortality in HD patients.

Method

This cohort study examined all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality with 181 maintenance HD patients from February 2015. Patients were divided into four groups according to the median of RDW and MCV. Pearson analysis was conducted to determine the related factors of RDW and MCV. The independent association of RDW and MCV with mortality was examined with Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis.

Results

This study included 181 HD patients for a median follow-up of 71months. We found RDW was positively related to neutrophil count, C-reaction protein, and ferritin, while negatively related to hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine. Only neutrophil count and ferritin were significantly related to MCV in this study. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the high RDW group was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 3.787; 95% confidence interval, 1.037 to 13.834; p = 0.044). The relationship between RDW and MCV and CV mortality was not significant.

Conclusions

RDW could emerge as an additive risk factor for all-cause mortality in maintenance HD patients, independent of other factors. An absolute value of MCV to predict mortality and the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms should be confirmed in the future.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112qcPhA]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of anemia, ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain anemia workup (including at least RBC indices such as red cell distribution width and MCV, reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP concentration) if the hemoglobin is below normal. Include the following in a more extensive workup: serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, LDH, soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^117SWdKS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^115toEda]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of severe morbidity and mortality. It is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States, and it is estimated that four million cases of CAP occur annually. There is a worldwide increase in the number of hospitalizations due to CAP in the general population.

Much research has been conducted in recent decades to determine prognostic factors for adverse outcome in patients hospitalized for CAP, including concomitant diseases and laboratory parameters on admission. Several prognostic scores were developed based upon these characteristics, such as the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team score. Ghanem-Zoubi et al reported recently in a study that included 43% of patients with pneumonia that simple clinical score and mortality in emergency department sepsis scores were the most appropriate clinical scores to predict the mortality of patients with sepsis in general internal medicine departments. Although there is a large body of evidence in this field in the general population, less focus was put in younger group of patients, even though several recent studies showed that there is an increasing number of hospital admissions due to CAP among patients less than 60 years old. Recently, it was reported that procalcitonin is associated with the severity of illness in patients with severe pneumonia and appears to be a prognostic marker of morbidity and mortality.

Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is a laboratory index used in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. Recently, several studies showed that a high RDW index predicts severe morbidity and mortality in various cardiac conditions, such as acute and chronic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and stroke.

Therefore, our primary aim was to determine prognostic factors that are associated with complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality. The major secondary endpoint was to assess whether RDW is associated with adverse outcome irrespective of hemoglobin and white blood cell (WBC) levels.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Anemia in children [^114pjQww]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^114TeR5A]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency among Indian preschool children contributing to increased burden of morbidity and mortality and the most significant negative consequence of iron deficiency is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Recent NFHS–III surveys (2005–06) have shown that 70–85% (approx. 79.2%) of Indian young children have anemia. IDA is attributed to inadequate iron intake, poor bioavailability of iron or high nutritional needs during childhood which is further exacerbated by chronic intestinal blood losses due to helminth infections and in many areas due to severe malarial infections. Studies have shown that iron deficiency causes delay in cognitive development and poor motor and sensory system functioning and that iron supplementation in early years may prevent these complications among children. Conversely, there is an evidence suggesting that routine iron treatment in non-iron deficient children may have adverse consequences for morbidity and infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect iron deficiency (ID) at its earliest stage in children especially in a low resource setting and replenish the iron stores by proper supplementation, thereby preventing many of the adverse developmental and behavioral effects caused by IDA. Currently, the detection of IDA is largely dependent upon quantification of biochemical markers like serum ferritin (SFr), serum transferrin (STr) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) which are not routinely available and affordable in developing countries due to high costs. Moreover, these tests are altered by inflammation, which limits their applicability for clinical interpretation, especially in areas with high infection rates. Another limitation of the commonly used hematological tests is their poor sensitivity or specificity as they can be modified by conditions other than iron deficiency. Studies have shown that RDW in addition to other hematological markers like mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin can be used as a differential diagnostic tool for identification of iron deficiency anemia. Various studies also show that the onset of iron deficiency anemia can be predicted using automated blood analyzers, as a low haemoglobin level along with a high level of anisocytosis detectable by red cell distribution width prove to be good indicators of changes in blood due to depleted iron stores. It seems that the earliest hematological manifestation of iron deficiency is marked by an elevated level of RDW and reports have shown that it is a cost-effective screening tool for early diagnosis of IDA in comparison to SFr and ZnPP. The red blood cell (RBC) distribution width, a measure of variations in the width of circulating RBCs, reported as a part of complete blood count has been known to be of value in the discrimination of iron deficiency anemia from other causes of microcytic anemia, but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the discriminative ability of RDW diagnostic test for detecting iron deficiency anemia among children aged 1–3 yrs in a low socio-economic setting using receiver's operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^1146BJgr]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific biological mechanisms about association between higher RAR and increased risk of low cognitive performance have not yet been fully elucidated, but may be related to chronic inflammation and poor nutritional status. RAR is a composite indicator integrating RDW and albumin, with increases in RDW and decreases in albumin both contributing to elevated RAR levels. Several studies have indicated that elevated RDW is associated with cognitive decline. A cross-sectional study indicated a "J-shaped" relationship between elevated RDW levels and the likelihood of dementia in older adults. Additionally, a prospective cohort study highlighted a causal impact of RDW on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated RDW is commonly associated with systemic inflammatory states, which can affect erythropoiesis, red blood cell lifespan, and red blood cell deformability, leading to increased cell anisotropy and subsequently raising RDW levels. Chronic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying low cognitive performance. Abnormal deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes in the central nervous system, triggering neuroinflammatory responses. Prolonged inflammatory conditions result in structural and functional damage to neurons, further contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, which is considered a contributing factor to CI and Alzheimer's disease. In the condition of anemia, pathological changes in red blood cells, including alterations in quantity, volume, distribution, and overall mass, can reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypoxic changes in cerebral blood vessels may be a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to low cognitive performance and dementia. Our study also found that participants with higher RAR often had lower hemoglobin levels and a higher risk of low cognitive performance.

### Eliminating race-based reference ranges in haematology: a call to action [^114ptyY5]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

In haematology, as in all of medicine, the use of reference intervals for laboratory variables is essential to define disease states and inform treatment decisions. There are many haematological variables, including haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, absolute neutrophil count, and iron indices, that are often reported to be different on the basis of a person's race or ethnicity. Although there are many haematological conditions with a genetic basis, such that it is appropriate to consider ancestry in the diagnostic algorithm, defining pathology on the basis of a social construct such as race is unacceptable. The inclusion of separate thresholds or simple statements that so-called normal values vary by race further validates the common misperception that there are physiological differences between Black and white patients. These statements might have downstream effects on diagnostic and treatment decisions that exacerbate existing racial health disparities. In this Viewpoint, we argued for the removal of race-based reference intervals across haematology.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Red blood cell distribution width: an emerging diagnostic factor of acute appendicitis? [^114WhFUG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Dear editor

We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. They aimed to evaluate whether red cell distribution width (RDW) has a role in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The authors concluded that if compared to healthy controls, RDW levels were lower in patients with acute appendicitis. Being inexpensive and easy attainability of this parameter may strengthen its utilization in daily practice in the near future. We would like to thank the authors for their contribution.

RDW which is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, is an automated measure of the variability of red blood cell size. Previously it was shown that, RDW is an independent variable of prognosis in patients with cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, strokes, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition, it was also found to be related to mortality and other severe adverse outcomes in renal and infectious diseases. Aging, malnutrition, Iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, bone marrow depression, or chronic inflammation may affect RDW levels. Thus, it would have been better, if the authors had mentioned these RDW affecting factors.

In a previous study, two novel biomarkers, calprotectin (CP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were found to be related to acute appendicitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and mean platelet volume (MPV) are also associated with inflammatory diseases. In this view, it would also be relevant, if the authors included these parameters in the study.

We are of the opinion that the findings of Narci et al. will lead to further research concerning the relationship between RDW and acute appendicitis. Nevertheless, RDW should be considered with other inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, calprotectin) to provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient.

### Diagnosing TMAs by automated red cell morphology analyses [^111K4ZDF]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Notably, Foy et al assessed their algorithms within the clinical disease context and confirmed the ability of their RBC-differentiating algorithm to make specific diagnoses. Using predominant cell types to arrive at a gestalt assessment of the smear pathology, the authors analyzed the RBC-differentiation ability of smears using the peripheral blood from patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome and could distinguish these from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). Importantly, they went on to demonstrate that schistocyte counts are associated with prognosis. The authors further found that they could correlate schistocyte counts from patients without TMA with all-cause mortality, similar to what had been shown previously for parameters such as red cell distribution width.

There are limitations. As expected, the sensitivity of the classification appears to vary for different cell types, and each will require validation. This system does not account for cells that might change shape within circulation, such as sickle cell anemia. This machine learning algorithm relies heavily on the use of black-white boundary detection to identify different RBC shapes but does not detect or differentiate between RBC inclusions.

Assessing peripheral blood smears requires expertise and is a time-consuming and costly exercise. Although the authors clarify that their RBC-differentiation algorithm is not intended to replace manual review, the idea that an automated, high-level, accurate RBC differential would be useful in a resource-limited setting is very appealing. Even in the United States, there is pressure on hematology laboratories to minimize the number of smears that require review. The intriguing possibility of diagnosing iron deficiency, thalassemia, sickle cell, or immune-hemolytic pathologies via smear further extends the potential utility of RBC-differentiation algorithm. This also paves the way to encourage more scientific research: why do schistocytes correlate with mortality? What causes schistocyte formation in those with nonhematological acute illnesses?

The future is very likely to include some type of accurate RBC differential that will not only be able to make the diagnosis but will also monitor disease progression and treatment efficacy. Classical hematology has frequently been regarded as too difficult and the problems as too emergent. One of the remaining reasons for a hematologist to visit the hospital in the middle of the night is the possibility of seeing schistocytes on a smear, which will help diagnose a TMA, particularly TTP. This could also be a boon to the idea of a better work-life balance for classical hematologists.

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^117Vr9jF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation. Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred. With contemporary formulations, allergic reactions are rare.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^116oUk1L]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of IDA in CLD

When evaluating a patient with CLD IDA everyone should have in mind that the tests commonly used in the general population show a wide variation in these patients, because they are affected directly or indirectly by the hepatic cell damage.

The laboratory methods used in the diagnosis of IDA can be divided into two categories. There are screening measurements (Hb, Tsat, mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular Hb [MCH], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and reticulocytes) that detect iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and measurements that indicate tissue iron status, either by measuring storage proteins or by direct examination of bone marrow aspiration for ID. The only definitive method still remains bone marrow aspiration, stained with Prussian blue for iron. However, the fact that the procedure is invasive, painful and expensive makes biopsy a tool that is not frequently used, and there is need for less- or even noninvasive tests with a good diagnostic accuracy.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

NASPGHAN pediatric IBD diagnosis — pediatricians "are ideally positioned to initiate the workup" when UC or CD is suspected, and initial laboratory studies "should assess for" inflammatory markers (elevated white blood cell and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]). Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### The role of automated measurement of RBC subpopulations in differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia and β-thalassemia screening [^115RnnzV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Cell counter-based formulas have been used in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. The measurement of RBC subpopulations is now available on the Sysmex XE 5000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). We describe the new formulas: % microcytic - % hypochromic; and % microcytic - % hypochromic - red cell distribution width (RDW), derived from the percentages of microcytic and hypochromic RBCs. The present study aimed to prospectively evaluate the reliability of these new formulas in the differential diagnosis of microcytosis and β-thalassemia screening compared with already published indices. The indices were calculated for a set of 250 iron-deficient patients and 270 β-thalassemia carriers. Independent samples t test and receiver-operating characteristics analysis were applied. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW, % microcytic - % hypochromic, and Green and King indices provided higher areas under the curve. The % microcytic - % hypochromic - RDW was the most reliable index evaluated, with 100% sensitivity and 92.6% specificity. This index can be used to efficiently screen patients with microcytosis for further hematologic studies to confirm β-thalassemia.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90·4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Red cell distribution width and red cell distribution width to total serum calcium ratio as major predictors of severity and mortality in acute pancreatitis [^113N8stZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the past, RDW was widely used for differential diagnosis of anemia. Over the last years, RDW has been associated with systemic inflammation due to the high oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines that contribute to RDW elevation by reducing RBC survival and maturation, increasing the release of newer and larger RBC into the peripheral circulation and changing of membrane glycoproteins and ion channels of RBC with consequent morphological alteration. Therefore, RDW reflects the degree of inflammation that occurs in AP and thus, can be used to predict its severity. Despite isolated TSC did not represent a good predictor for AP severity in our study, RDW 0h -to-TSC ratio proved to be an excellent predictor of AP severity and a very good predictor of AP mortality. In fact, hypocalcemia within the first 24 h was associated with AP severity, although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood. It has been postulated that hypocalcemia could be related to the calcium soaps formation and parathyroid hormone depletion.

There are some limitations, mainly related to the retrospective nature of this study. However, our study groups' size is within range when compared to other published studies for assessing both severity or mortality in AP. Second, RDW samples were collected from a single center and thus, RDW levels could have been slightly different in other populations studied.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### A novel discriminating tool for microcytic anemia in childhood [^1111iHR7]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate and timely interpretation of microcytic anemia can be diagnostically challenging in the primary care setting. We sought to develop a novel model for distinguishing iron-deficiency anemia from thalassemia trait in the modern pediatric population. Demographic history and red blood cell indices were retrospectively characterized for 76 children referred to our pediatric hematology clinic for evaluation of microcytic anemia. Statistically significant variables were sequentially added into a logistic regression model to develop the final model. The final discriminating model incorporates red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell values. Favorable predictive performance is seen in the initial (sensitivity 89.2%, specificity 92.3%) and external validation cohort (sensitivity 84.4%, specificity 88.9%). This novel tool may aid in determining the cause of hypochromic, microcytic anemia in the primary care setting. Finally, the study cohort reflects an underrepresented group in the development of screening tools, and thus offers generalizability.

### Red blood cell count and risk of adverse outcomes in patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^115Y6F14]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Three critical parameters related to RBCs

RBC count: This denotes the concentration of RBCs per microliter of blood, typically enumerated in millions. Integral to oxygen transportation, diminished counts may indicate conditions such as anemia, while elevated counts could signal disorders like polycythemia vera.

Hemoglobin: This intracellular protein is responsible for transporting oxygen to tissues and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs. Hemoglobin concentrations, quantified in grams per deciliter, can reflect various health conditions, with lower levels potentially indicative of anemia and higher levels suggestive of polycythemia vera or chronic hypoxia.

Red blood cell specific volume (RBCSV): This parameter represents the volume fraction of RBCs in the blood, also called hematocrit. Normal hematocrit ranges differ by sex. Deviations from normal ranges can indicate various conditions — low levels may suggest anemia, and high levels could indicate dehydration or other disorders.

2.2 RBC count

According to the definition of the standard RBC count in routine blood testing at our hospital, the reference range for men is 4.0 to 5.5 × 10 12 /L and that for women is 3.5 to 5.0 × 10 12 /L. After excluding patients with elevated RBC counts (> 5.5 × 10 12 /L in men and > 5.0 × 10 12 /L in women), the patients were divided into those with reduced RBC counts (< 4.0 × 10 12 /L in men and < 3.5 × 10 12 /L in women) and normal RBC counts (≥ 4.0 × 10 12 /L in men and ≥ 3.5 × 10 12 /L in women). We chose to evaluate RBC count as our primary parameter rather than hemoglobin or RBC specific volume (hematocrit), because RBC count is less affected by hypoxia, dehydration, and volume status, which can be confounding clinical factors within this patient population.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^111jjGLk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg/ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA therapy. (ungraded)

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^114MgqHM]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter that reflects the heterogeneity of the red blood cell volume. It is indicated that the variation coefficient of the red blood cell volume is more objective and accurate than that of the red blood cell on the blood smear. RDW is in about 11.0%–16.0% in normal population. RDW will rise under some physiological and pathological conditions.

RDW has at least five clinical significant meanings:
To diagnose and guide the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Traditionally, anaemia deficiency from iron can be differentiated from folate deficiency according to the size of RDW. RDW would increase because of the release of immature red blood cells into the blood stream in certain haematological diseases.RDW increases in iron deficiency anaemia, and such increase would appear earlier than the decline of mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which can be an early indication of iron deficiency. When MCV is low, RDW would increase more significantly. When iron therapy is given, RDW would elevate first and then gradually reduce at the normal level.
To diagnose small cell and low pigment anaemia.
To classify anaemia.
Previously, many research suggested that RDW was closely related to the mortality and cardiovascular events, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension.
RDW can be made as a predictor of mortality in patients with cancer, chronic lung disease or acute renal failure.

Stroke is the result of cerebral vascular occlusion or haemorrhage, and it is the leading cause of death in the world. At present, clinical diagnosis relies on history, neurological examinations and neuro-imaging. Several scoring systems are used to quantify the degree of severity of stroke: the Glasgow Coma Scale, Canadian Neurological Scale, Scandinavian Stroke Scale and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). However, there is no biological surrogate marker to diagnose stroke. RDW by flow cytometry could be an option for this purpose and predict the occurrence of stroke.

### The correlation between RDW, MPV and weight indices after metabolic surgery in patients with obesity and DM / IGR: follow-up observation at 12 months [^1178UgH1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a common indicator in blood routine analysis, which reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cell volume in the circulation. It is calculated as the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of red blood cell volume divided by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and then multiplied by 100. In previous studies, RDW has been used for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of erythrocyte disorders, especially anemia, and for the evaluation of nutritional status. Elevated RDW is commonly seen in iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, etc.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a common indicator of platelet activity in routine blood. Increased MPV is commonly seen in primary thrombocytopenic purpura and myelodysplastic syndrome, while decreased MPV is commonly seen in acute leukemia chemotherapy and aplastic anemia.

In the last decade, RDW and MPV have both been considered new biomarkers for the prognosis of cardiovascular disease. RDW levels were significantly higher in patients with end point events such as death, heart failure and arrhythmia than in those without end point events. Cardiovascular risk score and MPV in nonalcoholic fatty liver patients can accurately predict the risk of acute cardiovascular events within 1 year.

Previous studies have shown a significant correlation between the two indicators and obesity. Elisia et al. found that RDW was significantly higher in people with a BMI > 35 kg·m −2 than in those with a BMI ≤ 35 kg·m −2. In individuals with metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity, MPV levels were positively correlated with waist circumference and were significantly higher than in those without metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity.

RDW and MPV are also associated with diabetes. RDW levels in diabetic patients were significantly higher than in control subjects; also, RDW levels in diabetic patients with HbA1c > 7% were significantly higher than in those with HbA1c ≤ 7%. MPV was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than in those without T2DM and higher in T2DM patients with microvascular complications (retinopathy or microalbuminuria) than in those without.

Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of T2DM. Metabolic surgery by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become the most effective treatment for patients with T2DM complicated with obesity. A simple and economic indicator that can accurately predict the outcome of surgery in advance may be useful to make the optimum choice of metabolic surgery.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### Bone marrow synoptic reporting for hematologic neoplasms: guideline from the college of American pathologists pathology and laboratory quality center [^1146eZDx]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 5. Extended — hematologic parameters with prognostic or diagnostic value: In Ph+ pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), low-risk on d1 defined by peripheral blood WBC < 100 000 and bone marrow blast < 5% was associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with EFS: 55% low risk, 18% high risk; OS: 79% low risk, 27% high risk. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds are prognostic, as Hgb > 10 g/dL is associated with better OS in Int-1 and Int-2 MDS, and in MDS, significantly different survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with Hgb < 10 g, platelet count (Plt) < 100 000, and absolute neutrophil count < 0.8. Baseline thrombocytopenia < 100 000 was associated with 39% transfusion independence versus 73% without thrombocytopenia, and the odds ratio for decreased cytogenetic response with, versus without, thrombocytopenia was 4.78. For differentiating aplastic anemia (AA) from hypoplastic MDS in adults, peripheral blood Plt, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly different, and red cell distribution width (RDW) values differ with mean RDW, 16.8% severe AA; 17.4% nonsevere AA; versus 20.4% MDS.

### Sideroblastic anaemia in a patient with sickle cell disease [^115QLxxB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, this case highlights the rare occurrence of SCA and SA in a patient. This case also underscores the importance of generating a broad differential diagnosis and the ramifications of anchoring bias which can lead to delayed diagnosis. While this patient's presentation of anaemia with an increased need for red cell transfusion was thought to be due to SCD, workup revealed a much less common diagnosis of SA. SA is rare in the general population, and when coupled with anchoring bias related to a well-known cause of anaemia such as SCD can lead to delay in diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of avoiding premature closure when managing common diseases and calls on the clinician to ask, 'What else could it be?'

Learning points

Due to its low prevalence, the diagnosis of sideroblastic anaemias (SA) is often difficult. High suspicion on the part of the clinician and low threshold for workup of anaemia often aid in the diagnosis of SA.
Loss of response to a previously effective long-term treatment of anaemia should raise suspicion of an additional cause of anaemia.
A full workup, including peripheral smear, complete blood count with differential, iron studies, ferritin and reticulocyte count, is warranted when SA is suspected. A bone marrow biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis, and genetic testing should be done if congenital SA is suspected.
Workup to identify the cause of SA includes ruling out secondary and acquired causes, genetic testing in the appropriate population and identify myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasms-related underlying mutations.
Acquired causes of SA such as copper deficiency, pyridoxine deficiency and medication-related are often reversible. In contrast, SA secondary to MDS and congenital SA have a genetic basis and are potentially treatable but not curable. Early diagnosis and treatment initiation help improve the anaemia and prevent long-term complications.

### Impact of red cell distribution width and red cell distribution width / albumin ratio on all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and foot ulcers: a retrospective cohort study [^112Er9w9]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common and life-threatening complication of diabetes, leading to hospitalization, high health-care costs, and a high rate of amputation. DFUs exhibit a 5 — year mortality comparable to cancer. Individuals with DFUs have a 2.5-fold increase in the risk for death compared with patients who have diabetes but no DFUs. The excess mortality cannot be fully explained by other known comorbidities and complications of diabetes. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate additional risk factors that influence mortality in patients with DFUs.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a simple and easily-obtained parameter, representing the heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume, and is traditionally used for differential diagnosis of anemia. However, in more recent years, RDW was found to be associated with multiple disease processes and prognoses. RDW was associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes. RDW was also associated with diabetes-related complications. RDW can predict mortality and cardiovascular complications in patients with diabetes. However, this observation failed to be corroborated in another population, which may be due to the population heterogeneity. RDW/albumin (ALB) ratio is a new combined parameter that can predict mortality in patients undergoing burn surgery, and patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetes-related complications were associated with an increased inflammatory burden. RDW seems to be a new inflammatory marker. Elevated RDW was found in inflammation-related diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and autoimmune liver diseases. Although a definitive mechanism for the association of RDW, RDW/ALB ratio, and mortality has not yet been established, RDW and RDW/ALB seem to be nonspecific parameters that have the potential to provide effective risk stratification in patients with serious diseases.

To date, research related to the prognostic value of RDW with DFUs is scarce. Similarly, there are no previous studies on RDW/ALB ratio in patients with DFUs. In this study, we sought to explore the impact of RDW and RDW/ALB ratio on all-cause mortality in a relatively large cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes and foot ulcers.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^113BLgw2]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^112mTQNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### How useful are CBC and reticulocyte reports to clinicians? [^113gShbQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We surveyed 1,353 attending and 689 house staff physicians of the University Hospitals of Cleveland to ascertain the parameters of the CBC, leukocyte differential, and reticulocyte reports perceived as useful in clinical practice. The response rate was 33% for attending and 22% for house staff physicians. Only 4 of 11 parameters routinely reported in the CBC battery were selected as frequently or always useful by more than 90% of physicians: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and WBC count. Among primary care physicians, the mean cell volume also attained this level of usefulness for the evaluation of anemia. There were no differences between academic physicians and community physicians in the use of RBC indices; however, physicians who had been in practice for fewer than 10 years indicated higher use of the red cell distribution width than physicians practicing for more than 10 years. Most physicians prefer differentials reported as percentages rather than absolute counts. Among physicians who monitor reticulocyte counts, the immature reticulocyte fraction is not widely used. Our results indicate that many physicians do not use much of the data provided in routine CBC/differential and reticulocyte reports. Some modifications of report formats may facilitate physician perception of hematology laboratory results.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^113ykYfu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### Low hemoglobin A (1c) in nondiabetic adults: an elevated risk state? [^114SADBK]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Certain limitations should be considered in interpreting the results of this study. We were limited to information available from the death certificate for the classification of the underlying cause of death, which may have resulted in misclassification, particularly for the noncancer and noncardiovascular outcomes. We also did not have data available on iron indices, reticulocyte count, or red-cell distribution width. Nonetheless, the ARIC population is a large, diverse cohort with virtually complete follow-up for vital status and comprehensive information on important confounders and major risk factors for mortality. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first comprehensive examinations of the association of low HbA 1c with cause-specific mortality in a general population.

In conclusion, our results add to the evidence that low HbA 1c values may be a marker of elevated mortality risk in the general population. With new recommendations for the use of HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes, HbA 1c testing will undoubtedly increase. To the extent that HbA 1c is adopted for diabetes screening, clinicians will frequently observe HbA 1c values in the normal range, including low normal values. Additional work should focus on understanding the nonglycemic determinants of HbA 1c and the mechanisms that explain why low HbA 1c values in some individuals may reflect an elevated risk state.

### Red blood cell indexes in patients in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and β-thalassemia combination [^113djNS5]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The spontaneous occurrence of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and beta-thalassemia in the same patient is a rare event. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is elevated above the reference range in half to two-thirds of patients with HS, but there are no data for the HS/beta-thal combinations for the red blood cell indexes. This study reassessed these values in these particular patients. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution (RDW), and reticulocyte count were documented from 43 HS patients, 13 of which were from 10 families with the combination of beta-thal and HS; 28 controls were also included. Patients with HS/beta-thal have a significantly lower MCV, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and MCHC and a significantly higher RDW than normal control subjects; 95% of beta-thalassemia carriers are free of clinical symptoms. When red blood cell indexes reveal a possibility of a beta-thalassemia carrier state with the symptoms of hemolytic anemia, HS should be considered.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^115frxdq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

CRP is a sensitive acute phase protein that lacks specificity due to increased levels in all acute inflammatory processes. Its concentration increases with the duration and extent of the inflammation. In a meta-analysis examining the accuracy of CRP level in the diagnosis of AA, Hallan and Asberg found a wide range of sensitivity (40%-99%) and specificity (27%-90%). Similar to the literature, this study found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 41% for CRP in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Among the assessed parameters, CRP had the highest sensitivity and the lowest specificity.

RDW is commonly used to discriminate between microcytic anemia's due to iron deficiency and those due to thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies. Increased RDW levels are related to impaired erythropoiesis or erythrocyte degradation. The typical reference range spans between 11.6 and 15.5%. Recent studies have demonstrated that higher RDW levels, even within the normal reference range, were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and stroke independent of hemoglobin values. Furthermore RDW has been studied as a surrogate marker in many pathological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and celiac disease. Although the exact pathophysiological basis of this relationship is unclear, chronic inflammation, aging, malnutrition, and anemia are proposed underlying factors in this topic.

The CBC count and leukocyte differential count (LDC) are among the most frequently requested clinical laboratory tests. These analyses are highly automated, and the correct interpretation of results requires extensive knowledge of the analytic performance of the instruments and the clinical significance of the results they provide. In this review, we analyze the state of the art regarding traditional and new parameters with emphasis on clinical applications and analytic quality. The problems of some traditional parameters of the CBC count, such as platelet counts, some components of the LDC such as monocyte and basophil counts, and other commonly used indices such as red cell volume distribution width and platelet indices such as mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width are considered. The new parameters, evaluated from analytic and clinical viewpoints, are the available components of the extended differential count (hematopoietic progenitor cells, immature granulocytes, and erythroblasts), the immature reticulocyte fraction, the reticulocyte indices, the fragmented RBCs, and the immature platelet fraction.

### Changes in automated complete blood cell count and differential leukocyte count results induced by storage of blood at room temperature [^115MeKBz]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To delineate changes that occur in various parameters of automated complete blood cell count (CBC) and differential leukocyte count (differential) on prolonged storage of blood at room temperature.

Design

A CBC and an automated differential were performed on the Coulter Gen.S on 40 K(3) (tripotassium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate) EDTA-anticoagulated blood specimens once daily, specimen volume permitting, for 3 to 7 days. Specimens were kept at room temperature throughout the study. The results were tabulated using a personal computer with Excel software. Percent change or absolute difference from the initial value for each parameter for each subsequent day of the study period was calculated.

Results

Among the CBC parameters, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin were stable for the duration of the study (7 days), white blood cell count was stable for at least 3 days (up to 7 days, if the count was within or above the normal range), and platelet count was stable for at least 4 days (up to 7 days, if the count was within or above the normal range). The mean corpuscular volume, mean platelet volume, hematocrit, and red blood cell distribution width each increased, and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration decreased from day 2 onward. Among the differential parameters, the relative percentages and absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils tended to increase, whereas those of monocytes trended downward over time. Limited data on basophils did not reveal an appreciable change.

Conclusion

Blood specimens stored at room temperature for more than 1 day (up to 3 days or possibly longer) were found to be acceptable with some limitations for CBC but not for the differential.

### From microcytosis to macrodiagnosis [^111mviMJ]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^113YLrwi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2.7. Anemia

The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which can affect any patient with inadequate dietary intake of iron, or reduced iron absorption. CBC will typically reveal a hypochromic, microcytic anemia as evidenced by a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), respectively. Iron deficiency can be confirmed with a reduced serum ferritin. However, it should be noted that ferritin levels are often artificially elevated in the presence of systemic inflammation or kidney disease, so a normal or even elevated serum ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. In this setting, iron studies can provide further information, but are often susceptible to similar changes in the setting of inflammation.

Anemia of chronic disease can occur in any disorder where there is co-existent chronic inflammation. In a study of hematological abnormalities in 319 patients with IMDs in Turkey, anemia of chronic disease was the most common hematological finding encountered. This is usually characterized by a normocytic, normochromic anemia, and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease involves iron-restricted erythropoiesis due to upregulation of hepcidin. Increased red cell turnover and reduced production of erythropoietin also play a role in the pathogenesis. Iron deficiency anemia frequently co-exists with anemia of chronic disease, and it can be very challenging to diagnose in this setting, as the serum ferritin is unreliable. Novel red cell indices available on modern automated blood count analyzer such as the reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration (RET–He) and the percentage of hypochromic reticulocytes (%HYPO) can predict functional iron deficiency where the ferritin is unreliable, and predict response to iron replacement.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10 12 /l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Classical meets malignant hematology: a case of acquired ε γ δ β-thalassemia in clonal hematopoiesis [^114iFd87]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Here, we describe a patient presenting with thalassemic erythrocyte parameter changes, i.e. microcytic, hypochromic anemia and a rather high erythrocyte count. Further evaluation including hemoglobin capillary electrophoresis and molecular genetic analyses exhibited clonal hematopoiesis with large deletions in the short and long arm of one chromosome 11 restricted to the neoplastic clone. The loss in the chromosomal band 11p15.4 harboring the complete β-globin gene cluster resulted in an acquired εγδβ-thalassemia which we documented at the molecular level.

Our laboratory received a peripheral blood sample from a 34-year-old woman with microcytic, hypochromic anemia for further investigation after exclusion of iron deficiency. Blood count measurement at our laboratory confirmed a mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 11.0 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume [MCV] 72.3 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin 22.0 pg, mean corpuscluar hemoglobin concentration [MCH] 30.5 g/dL, red cell distribution width [RDW] 19.2%, red blood cell [RBC] count 4.99x10 12 /L). The white blood cell count was normal (7.97x10 9 /L), and the thrombocyte count was slightly increased (513x10 9 /L). A peripheral blood smear showed polychromatic erythrocytes with basophilic stippling and target cells (Figure 1), and a normal leukocyte morphology and differential blood count (57% segmented neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes, and 6% eosinophils).

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^11297Kyb]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Several explanations were suggested to this surprising finding. Abnormal RDW usually suggests one or more chronic condition that accompanies significant heart failure, such as anemia or nutritional deficit. Another mechanism that was suggested is the release of cytokines in response to inflammatory stress. These cytokines block the activity of erythropoietin and cause production of ineffective red blood cell and elevated RDW. Lippi et al found a correlation between high RDW and elevated indexes of inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). This correlation was independent of concomitant diseases, and was demonstrated even when anemic patients were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Our data demonstrated that RDW is a valuable and sensitive marker for a high level of inflammatory activity in young patients with CAP, and it is independent of hemoglobin levels. The mechanism underlying the association between high levels of RDW and adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. RDW is elevated in conditions in which there is ineffective red cell production or increased destruction of red blood cell. RDW may indicate a severe inflammatory process, with impact on bone marrow function and iron metabolism. Another option is that RDW is an earlier marker of prognosis, and it may appear earlier in the complex process of anemia than low levels of hemoglobin. As noted before, high RDW levels may represent a culmination of multiple pathophysiologic processes occurring in acute inflammatory and infectious state.

### The value of shear wave elastography combined with red blood cell distribution width in evaluating arterial erectile dysfunction [^112heRfR]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The erection process is an intricate neurovascular process that involves the coordination of the neurological, endocrine, psychological and circulatory systems. The inability of a man to achieve and/or sustain a penile erection that is sufficient for sexual engagement and for an acceptable sexual performance is known as erectile dysfunction(ED). ED can be classified as being psychogenic, organic (i.e. neurogenic, hormonal, arterial, cavernous, or drug-induced), or a mixture of psychogenic and organic. Vascular variables are crucial in organic ED because of the microcirculation of the penile corpus cavernosum (CCP). Arterial ED(AED), venous ED, and mixed ED are the three subtypes of vascular ED, with AED being the most prevalent.

The diagnosis of ED is therefore very complex, a process that requires differentiating among types of ED and identifying the causes, associated risk factors and potential life-threatening comorbidities. At present, it is mainly diagnosed through history taking, physical examination, laboratory assessment, and specific investigations.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is one of the quantitative parameters of routine complete blood cells and reflects the heterogeneity of red blood cells. It is a typical marker for differential diagnosis of different types of anemia. Recent studies have shown that RDW can be used as an independent diagnostic marker to predict cardiovascular diseases(CVD) (e.g. hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary syndrome), tumours, metabolic syndromes and inflammatory diseases. As a condition intimately associated with cardiovascular factors, some scholars believe that ED is an early symptom of subclinical CVD or even an independent marker. According to the association between ED and CVD, we hypothesized that clinically pertinent hematological parameters that can be used to predict or evaluate CVD would also be applicable to ED.

The features of shear wave elastography (SWE) include non-invasion quantification, convenience and high repeatability. SWE has been widely investigated to estimating thyroid, breast, and liver mass stiffness. A number of previous researches have investigated the feasibility of using SWE to quantitatively evaluate CCP stiffness for the diagnosis of ED. SWE provides noninvasive quantitative data on CCP stiffness and its change with age, as demonstrated by Inci et al. Hu et al found that compared with normal tissues, two-dimensional SWE can differentiate CCP lesions secondary to hyperlipidemia by quantifying elastic quantitative values.

### Importance of RDW value in differential diagnosis of hypochrome anemias [^1135enbt]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) was studied in adults carrying delta-beta thalassemia traits (deltabeta-TT) who were 20–40 years of age (n = 29), beta thalassemia traits (beta-TT) with an age range of 18–60 years (n = 49), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in individuals aged 1–18 years (n = 27), and in controls with an age range of 20–40 years (n = 20). Although red blood cell count, MCV, and MCH values showed no statistically significant differences between deltabeta-TT and beta-TT, the mean RDW value was significantly higher in deltabeta-TT (20.14 ± 1.21) compared to beta-TT (14.88 ± 1.77) (P < 0.001). No difference was observed between the means of RDW in deltabeta-TT and IDA (18.00 ± 1.94) (P > 0.05). A significant rise in RDW in IDA 5–7 days after initiation of iron therapy (P = 0.00) which was continued to rise up to the 4(th) week of therapy was suggested as an important tool in differentiation of IDA from deltabeta-TT. These observations could be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of deltabeta-TT from beta-TT and IDA by determining the red blood cell count, red cell indices, and RDW only.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^117Bhf4o]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width is a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count that actually reflects the degree of anisocytosis of the red blood cell population. It is a cost-effective tool used in everyday clinical practice along with other parameters to define and narrow the cause of anemia. In a series of pathologic entities, such as cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, malignancy, chronic renal diseases and chronic respiratory diseases, where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults, red cell distribution width behaves as a significant and competent marker able to predict and assess disease activity and severity. A number of clinical studies based on these observations have aimed to evaluate its potential utility as an index of activity in inflammatory bowel disease. In this narrative review we present data from the international literature regarding its ability to express disease activity and we look into its relation with clinical, laboratory and endoscopic indices used to identify active disease. According to the results of published clinical trials, red cell distribution width is considerably correlated with disease activity and might serve as an index to differentiate Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

### Accuracy of erythrogram and serum ferritin for the maternal anemia diagnosis (AMA): a phase 3 diagnostic study on prediction of the therapeutic responsiveness to oral iron in pregnancy [^114egkpH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Studied tests (predictive variables)

The initial values of the erythrocyte indices and serum ferritin will be tested as predictors of presence of the functional iron deficiency at the following cutoff points suggested by WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on pregnant or childbearing age women (when there is no specific report for pregnant women): red blood cells count < 3.8 10 12 cells/L; Hb < 10.5 g/dL (suggested for the 2nd trimester of pregnancy); haematocrit < 32.0% (suggested for the 2nd trimester of pregnancy); mean corpuscular volume (MCV) < 81.0 fL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) < 26.0 pg; mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) < 32.0 g/dL; red blood cells distribution width (RDW) > 14.0%; reticulocyte count < 1.0%; serum ferritin < 12.0 ng/mL.

Gold-standard test (outcome variable)

The final diagnosis of iron deficiency will be set individually on the basis of the presence (case) or absence (non-case) of the 'responsiveness to therapeutic test with oral iron', starting from assumptions that, in the case of iron deficiency in pregnancy, a functional definition would be more appropriate and the haematologic response to the treatment is considered as a reliable indicator of functional iron need. This is one of the alternative approaches in the definition of the gold-standard which is based on the follow up of the clinical course during a suitable predefined period under a therapeutic intervention.

To measure this outcome, the physiological variability of Hb throughout the pregnancy was taken into consideration, because it distorts the interpretation of longitudinal trends of Hb absolute values. Thus, on the rationale basis developed by Beaton and McCabe in 1999, the pre and post treatment Hb values of each pregnant woman will be adjusted to the gestational week through the Z-score methodology. This methodology quantifies the difference (in standard deviation units-SD) between an observed Hb value and the gestational week's reference mean from a reference distribution curve. Due to the lack of a Brazilian reference curve will be used the curve reported from iron-supplemented healthy women from Europe and North-America which was employed by Beaton and McCabe. The individual calculation of the Z-score is carried out according to the following mathematical formula:

The variables to investigate the clinical significance of iron deficiency were derived from routine laboratory assessments (ferritin, serum iron, hemoglobin, mean erythrocyte corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red cell distribution width (RDW) and percentage of hypochromic erythrocytes, which contained less than 28 g/dl hemoglobin). Patients presenting with anemia or low ferritin values were treated with 1000 mg intravenous ferric carboxy-maltose if needed. Clinical parameters for characterization included demographic data, comorbidities, hospitalization data, vital signs, echocardiography, hemodynamics measured by right heart catheterization, spirometry, blood gas analysis, lung function, WHO FC, 6MWD, as well as the laboratory parameters for the assessment of renal function (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate).

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Reference intervals of complete blood count constituents are highly correlated to waist circumference: should obese patients have their own "normal values? " [^1132Yiut]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Body mass index (BMI), the prevalent indicator of obesity, is not easily grasped by patients nor physicians. Waist circumference (WC) is correlated to obesity, is better understood and has a stronger relationship to the metabolic syndrome. We compiled WC, complete blood count (CBC) parameters as well as other pertinent data of 6766 25–55-year-old US volunteers sampled in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in the years 2005–2010. To determine reference intervals of typical US patients visiting their clinician, we used minimal exclusion criteria. We compiled hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count, mean platelet volume, and counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In addition, we also compiled serum C reactive protein and serum iron. The three major US races were studied and reference interval diagrams were constructed for each CBC parameter plotted against WC. WBC count, RDW, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and red blood cell count increase with WC. Conversely, serum iron and MCH and MCV decrease. These relationships may be related to insulin resistance and chronic activation of the immune system and the resulting low-grade inflammatory state. WC is a strong predictor for many CBC parameters, suggesting that WC should be taken into account when evaluating blood count results. Clinicians who take care of obese patients should be aware of altered hematology and investigate and treat accordingly.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: implications for anemia [^116adS7U]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

As a consequence, even amongst those in our small sample, we identified patients with identical and normal tHb-mass, in some of whom severe anemia would be diagnosed, likely triggering investigations focused upon failed erythrogenesis or increased red cell destruction. As specific exemplars of the phenomenon, 2 IBD patients had similar tHb-masses (9.2 and 9.3 g.kg −1), 1 having a high normal [Hb] (161 g.l −1) and the other being anemic ([Hb] 107 g.l −1), due to substantial differences in PV (37.2 ml.kg-1 vs. 65.7 ml.kg −1). Similarly, 2 CLD patients had the same tHb-mass (5.2 g.kg −1), 1 having mild anemia [Hb] (110 g.l −1), but the second being markedly anemic ([Hb] 69 g.l −1) due to a relatively raised PV in the latter (36.5 vs. 67.8 ml.kg −1, respectively).

Routine laboratory testing for infants with SCD — we recommend a standard laboratory panel be performed at 1 year (or prior to starting hydroxyurea) as detailed in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement; we recommend performing extended red cell phenotype (all) and genotype (preferred) consistent with ASH guidelines; we recommend a complete blood count with differential and absolute reticulocyte count be performed 2 to 4 times per year in the first 2 years of life to establish baseline values or prior to first transfusion.

### How laboratories use RBC indices… [^114bSFK3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In the February Archives Fischer and Fischer claim that the mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration provide little clinical information and should be abandoned. However, laboratories still use these indices as quality control indicators to detect instrument malfunction. The average value of mean corpuscular volume, MCH, and MCHC for a large number of patients remains relatively constant in each laboratory. Modern hematology instruments incorporate microcomputers that use a special "moving average" formula to monitor patient RBC indices. The moving average values for MCV, MCH, and MCHC can rapidly detect instrument malfunction and indicate which RBC parameters are at fault. 1In addition, laboratory technologists use the consistency of the MCHC to ensure accuracy of the measured RBC parameters on individual patient samples. An abnormal MCHC value must be regarded with suspicion.

Elevated MCHC values are seen with spherocytosis. Cornbleet J. How Laboratories Use RBC Indices. Arch Intern Med. 1983;

### The complete blood count-impact and distractions… [^113ZHrbf]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These minor variations are profoundly distracting because approximately 500 million CBCs are ordered per year, according to the authors.
2. Similarly, in a study conducted in Cleveland, Ohio, 4 variables were considered useful for screening by more than 90% of physicians; a fifth value, but not the red blood cell count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, or MCH concentration, was deemed useful in the evaluation of anemia.
4. Even what constitutes complete, as opposed to excessive, with respect to red cell values is open to interpretation. The hemoglobin and hematocrit are redundant; many physicians and institutions seem to work in one or the other. The red cells indexes, MCV, MCH, and MCHC were introduced circa 1930 by Wintrobe5 and are still frequently reported as part of the CBC despite evidence indicating the MCV is the only useful index. 6, 7. We have proposed that the CBC be stratified into 3 options.

8–10 The first is a screening CBC containing 5 variables for situations such as the annual health examination or evaluation of a minor medical issue: the hemoglobin, WBC, platelet counts, as well as MCV and red cell distribution width. A significant deviation in any of these would lead to a more comprehensive CBC, but that would be a very small fraction of those done. Second, a follow-up CBC for situations in which the patient has had a diagnosis and many previous CBCs but is under repeated observation, such as being monitored while receiving cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy; this would use 9 variables including the hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, platelet count, and the 5 absolute white cell counts. In this case, a WBC is unnecessary. Third, in situations in which the patient is undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for an illness, hematological or otherwise, a diagnostic CBC would be used.

It would contain 10 variables including the hemoglobin, MCV, RDW, the 5 absolute leukocyte counts, a platelet count, a reticulocyte count and, in addition, an evaluation of the blood film by the laboratory. For example, the MCHC is not a reliable screen for spherocytosis, the MCH does not have a utility different from the MCV and the relative neutrophil count is not more informative than the absolute count. 8–10.
