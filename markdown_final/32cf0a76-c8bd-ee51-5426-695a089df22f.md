## Question

Can you use adalimumab with for longer than 6 years in psoriasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adalimumab can be used for longer than 6 years in psoriasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA label says about duration of therapy. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend regarding long-term use. Next, I will review clinical trial and registry data that extend beyond 6 years. After that, I need to check safety signals with prolonged exposure. Finally, I will consider practical management issues like immunogenicity, dose optimization, and monitoring, and synthesize a clear conclusion with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because I should not jump to conclusions without anchoring to the label. The FDA labeling for adalimumab in plaque psoriasis indicates it is indicated for adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and it emphasizes ongoing monitoring and follow-up, but it does not specify a maximum treatment duration, which implies that continued therapy is acceptable if clinically justified and monitored appropriately [^11253ozC] [^116ox3c3] [^112mkX8h] [^116Dx6Dg].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations to ensure alignment with best practice. The AAD-NPF guidelines endorse adalimumab as a monotherapy option for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and provide dosing guidance, but they do not impose a time limit on therapy, reinforcing that duration should be individualized based on response, safety, and patient preference, with periodic reassessment of benefit-risk over time [^113oHR2H] [^1175hNAb] [^11322wY2].

> Now, I will examine the longest-term clinical data to see if safety and efficacy remain acceptable beyond 6 years. The ESPRIT postmarketing registry, which followed patients for up to 10 years, reported no new safety signals in the first 7 years and showed sustained effectiveness through 5 years, with approximately 65% achieving clear or minimal disease at 60 months; while the 9-year analysis was pending at the time of publication, the available data support multi-year continuous use without emergent toxicity signals [^115dsCJS] [^111iUb1r].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without checking pooled analyses. A comprehensive safety analysis of 18 psoriasis trials with 5,429.7 patient-years of exposure found stable adverse event rates and no new safety signals compared with earlier datasets, including malignancy rates comparable to background and manageable infection risks, which supports the feasibility of prolonged therapy when appropriately monitored [^111VJqvV].

> I should also consider real-world durability, because external validity matters. Large observational cohorts show meaningful drug survival with adalimumab, with median survival around 9.5 years in one long-term series and approximately 60% persistence at 2 years in registry data, acknowledging that loss of efficacy is the most common reason for discontinuation and that survival varies by patient factors and prior biologic exposure [^111GrjKA] [^1175VUth].

> But wait, what if immunogenicity undermines long-term benefit? I need to check that. Antidrug antibodies to adalimumab occur in a substantial minority and correlate with lower serum drug levels and reduced efficacy; however, therapeutic drug monitoring can identify this early, and strategies such as dose intensification to weekly dosing or adding methotrexate can mitigate immunogenicity and restore control in some patients, though the incremental benefit of routine methotrexate co-therapy in psoriasis is debated and not universally observed in randomized data [^11237sxD] [^113oHR2H] [^115BNAGT] [^115vUMtW] [^116Kykey].

> Next, I should review practical long-term management considerations. Guidelines recommend periodic reassessment of disease control, safety labs, and tuberculosis screening at baseline and intervals, with many clinicians reviewing response and labs about every 6 months; dose escalation to 40 mg weekly can be considered for suboptimal responders, and combination with topicals or other systemics may be used to augment efficacy when needed, all of which facilitate sustained control over many years [^111XfJa8] [^117D16ny] [^112L2AWD].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes, adalimumab can be used for longer than 6 years in psoriasis when clinically indicated, with no regulatory maximum duration and supportive long-term safety and effectiveness data through at least 7 to 10 years in registries and pooled analyses. The key is to individualize therapy, monitor for safety, and proactively manage loss of response, including consideration of drug level testing and dose optimization or agent switching if needed [^11253ozC] [^115dsCJS] [^111VJqvV] [^114Ek3s4].

---

Adalimumab can be used for **longer than 6 years** in psoriasis when clinically indicated, with no evidence of new safety signals or cumulative toxicity in long-term studies [^111VJqvV] [^115dsCJS]. Continued use is supported by sustained efficacy and a favorable benefit-risk profile, though ongoing monitoring for infections, malignancies, and immunogenicity is essential [^111VJqvV] [^115dsCJS]. If efficacy wanes, consider dose intensification or switching therapies [^115BNAGT] [^1134PMdH].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting long-term use

Several studies and registries provide evidence for the **safety and efficacy of adalimumab beyond 6 years**:

- **ESPRIT registry**: A 10-year observational study showed sustained effectiveness and no new safety signals through 7 years, with 64.7% achieving clear or minimal disease at 5 years [^115dsCJS] [^111iUb1r].

- **REVEAL extension**: Continuous adalimumab maintained efficacy for up to 3 years, with 76% achieving PASI 75 at 160 weeks [^1114Rf6c].

- **Meta-analysis**: Long-term biologic therapy, including adalimumab, maintains efficacy without increased malignancy or serious infection risk [^117KNNu5].

---

## Safety considerations

Long-term adalimumab therapy is **generally well tolerated**, but clinicians should remain vigilant:

- **Infections**: Increased risk of serious infections, including tuberculosis and opportunistic infections; ongoing vigilance is required [^116q6R3r] [^1161BsJo].

- **Malignancies**: No significant increase in overall malignancy risk, but a slight increase in non-melanoma skin cancer has been observed; regular skin examinations are recommended [^111VJqvV] [^113bJXV2].

- **Immunogenicity**: Antidrug antibodies can develop, potentially reducing efficacy; therapeutic drug monitoring may guide dose adjustments [^11237sxD] [^113oHR2H].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines support continued adalimumab use **without a predefined time limit**, provided patients benefit and are monitored:

- **AAD-NPF guidelines**: Recommend adalimumab as a monotherapy option for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with no specified maximum treatment duration [^114Ek3s4] [^1175hNAb].

- **BAD guidelines**: Emphasize regular monitoring and individualized treatment decisions, including long-term biologic use [^111XfJa8].

---

## Factors influencing long-term use

The decision to continue adalimumab beyond 6 years should be **individualized** based on:

- **Disease severity and control**: Continued use is justified if disease remains active and well-controlled [^1114Rf6c].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient satisfaction and quality of life [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Presence of psoriatic arthritis or other comorbidities may support continued biologic therapy [^1175hNAb].

- **Alternative therapies**: Availability and suitability of alternative biologics or systemic therapies may influence continuation decisions [^1151hLFo].

---

## Strategies for managing long-term therapy

To optimize long-term outcomes, clinicians may consider:

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring**: Measuring serum adalimumab levels and antidrug antibodies to guide dose adjustments [^113oHR2H] [^116FQfwR].

- **Dose intensification**: Increasing frequency to weekly dosing in cases of partial response or secondary failure [^115BNAGT].

- **Combination therapy**: Adding methotrexate or other systemic agents to enhance efficacy or reduce immunogenicity [^112L2AWD] [^116Kykey].

- **Periodic reassessment**: Regularly evaluate disease control, safety, and patient preferences to guide continued use [^111XfJa8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Adalimumab can be used for **longer than 6 years** in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with sustained efficacy and an acceptable safety profile. Continued therapy should be individualized, with regular monitoring for infections, malignancies, and immunogenicity. If efficacy wanes, consider dose intensification or switching to alternative therapies [^111VJqvV] [^115dsCJS] [^115BNAGT] [^1151hLFo].

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory condition that often requires life-long treatment. Conventional therapies have not fully met the needs of psoriatic patients, because of limited efficacy, adverse effects with cumulative use, and patient inconvenience. In the past decade, biologic immunotherapies have become accepted treatments for psoriasis as a result of perceived efficacy and safety on the part of patients and practitioners. However, most data on these medications come from relatively limited short-term trials. In this review, we will focus on the available long-term data on the efficacy of the biologic agents. We will emphasize the strengths and weakness of the available data of the biologic agents that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis (alefacept, efalizumab, * etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab), with the inclusion of a newer agent currently under FDA evaluation (ustekinumab).

Adalimumab — psoriasis dosing and efficacy: adalimumab dosing for psoriasis is 80 mg given subcutaneously the first week, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously given the next week and then every 2 weeks thereafter; in phase III studies, 1212 patients were randomized to receive adalimumab (given as 80 mg at week 1, 40 mg at week 2, and then 40 mg every other week) or placebo for the first 15 weeks; at week 16, 71% of patients treated with adalimumab and 7% treated with placebo achieved at least PASI-75; during weeks 33 to 52, the percentage who lost adequate response (defined as 50% improvement in the PASI score and at least a 6-point increase in PASI score from week 33) was 28% in those randomized to placebo compared with 5% of patients treated continuously with adalimumab; adalimumab is used continuously, at a dosage of 40 mg every other week, and rebound does not typically occur when adalimumab is discontinued, however, clearance is better maintained with continuous use and there is loss of efficacy after restart.

### The long-term safety of adalimumab treatment in moderate to severe psoriasis: a comprehensive analysis of all adalimumab exposure in all clinical trials [^112oCCzt]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A favorable benefit-risk profile has been established for adalimumab, with up to 5 years of treatment in 13 clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

Objective

The aim of this analysis was to assess the long-term safety of all adalimumab exposure in all psoriasis clinical trials.

Methods

A total of six sets of data were analyzed as follows: (i) all cumulative safety data from all exposure for all adalimumab-treated patients in the 13 clinical trials in moderate to severe psoriasis (All Adalimumab Treatment Population) through April 2007, November 2008, and November 2009, respectively; (ii) longitudinal data for 1403 patients treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) dosing (Every Other Week Population) through June 2007 and April 2010; and (iii) data from placebo-controlled periods of clinical trials. Adverse events that occurred up to 70 days after the final dose of adalimumab were analyzed.

Results

During placebo-controlled periods, a total of 572 patients had 173.0 patient-years (PYs) of exposure to placebo and 1188 patients had 370.5 PYs of exposure to adalimumab. Adverse event incidence rates, expressed as events per 100 PYs (events/100 PYs), for placebo- and adalimumab-treated patients for serious adverse events were 7.52 and 8.64, and for serious infectious adverse events were 2.89 and 2.43, respectively. In the 2007, 2008, and 2009 All Adalimumab Treatment Population there were, respectively, 1819 patients (2424.7 PYs), 2197 patients (4351.9 PYs), and 3010 patients (4844.7 PYs), with serious adverse event incidence rates of 6.51, 7.22, and 8.36 events/100 PYs, and serious infectious adverse event rates of 1.32, 1.38, and 1.65 events/100 PYs. In the 2007 and 2010 Every Other Week Population (n = 1403), there were 1883.5 and 2854.1 total PYs of exposure, respectively, with serious adverse event incidence rates of 6.32 and 6.87 events/100 PYs, and serious infectious adverse event rates of 1.33 and 1.37 events/100 PYs, respectively.

Conclusions

Multiple lines of evidence from a total of six sets of safety data, with treatment for up to 5 years, including results from all adalimumab-treated patients, and a subset of patients treated with 40 mg eow dosing, did not show evidence of cumulative toxicity, and showed adverse event rates that were generally stable or decreased with increased mean per-patient exposure.

Adalimumab long-term safety and immunogenicity — No new safety signals were observed during the first 7 years of the ESPRIT trial evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of adalimumab for adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, and there are no new safety data from the ongoing 9-year analysis (publication pending). Adalimumab has demonstrated that efficacy-limiting immunogenicity, characterized by antialimumab antibodies that lower serum levels and lead to loss of efficacy, occurs.

### Psoriasis and its treatment with adalimumab [^116BCPZD]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated skin condition affecting 2–3% of world's population. It affects patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and results in a significant financial burden. Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody approved in the US and European countries for the treatment of psoriasis along with other immunomediated diseases.

Areas Covered In This Review

We evaluate outcomes such as efficacy, safety, and quality of life associated with adalimumab in the treatment of psoriasis via a review of the published literature from the past 10 years.

What The Reader Will Gain

This review presents the effects, causes, types and treatment options for psoriasis with a focus on adalimumab with the goal of providing evidence-based guidance in choosing the appropriate therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.

Take Home Message

Adalimumab treatment in two forms 40 mg/every other week and 40 mg/week was reported to be effective and safe compared with placebo and methotrexate. Adalimumab significantly improved patients' HRQOL but some adverse events were reported, therefore vigilance is needed when using adalimumab. As the landscape of psoriasis treatments continues to evolve, adalimumab provides a highly effective and relatively safe treatment option for psoriasis patients.

### Adalimumab: in plaque psoriasis [^112gwipT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Adalimumab is a recombinant, human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for tumor necrosis factor. The clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab (40 mg administered subcutaneously every other week) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis have been demonstrated in several randomized, double-blind clinical trials, including the pivotal trials REVEAL (n = 1212) and CHAMPION (n = 271). Based on these trials, adalimumab was significantly more effective than placebo and methotrexate at relieving the signs and symptoms of psoriasis after 16 weeks of treatment, as assessed by the percentage of patients achieving a 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Based on open-label extension studies of up to 2 years' duration, the efficacy of adalimumab was sustained over the long term. Of patients who had responded to 33 weeks of treatment with adalimumab in REVEAL, patients randomized to remain on adalimumab for an additional 19 weeks of treatment were significantly less likely to experience loss of an adequate response than patients who were transferred to placebo. Compared with placebo or methotrexate, adalimumab was associated with significantly greater improvements in dermatology-specific and general measures of health-related quality of life in patients with plaque psoriasis. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated in trials in patients with plaque psoriasis, and the adverse-event profile was similar to that associated with its use in rheumatoid arthritis.

### Defining the therapeutic range for adalimumab and predicting response in psoriasis: a multicenter prospective observational cohort study [^113oHR2H]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Biologics have transformed management of inflammatory diseases. To optimize outcomes and reduce costs, dose adjustment informed by circulating drug levels has been proposed. We aimed to determine the real-world clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in psoriasis. Within a multicenter (n = 60) prospective observational cohort, 544 psoriasis patients were included who were receiving adalimumab monotherapy and had at least one serum sample and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score available within the first year. We present models giving individualized probabilities of response for any given drug level: a minimally effective drug level of 3.2 μg/ml discriminates responders (PASI75 indicates 75% improvement in baseline PASI) from nonresponders, and gives an estimated PASI75 probability of 65% (95% confidence interval = 60–71). At 7 μg/ml, PASI75 probability is 81% (95% CI = 76–86); beyond 7 μg/ml, the drug level/response curve plateaus. Crucially, drug levels are predictive of response 6 months later, whether sampled early or at steady state. We confirm serum drug level to be the most important factor determining treatment response, highlighting the need to take drug levels into account when searching for biomarkers of response. This real-world study with pragmatic drug level sampling provides evidence to support the proactive measurement of adalimumab levels in psoriasis to direct treatment strategy, and is relevant to other inflammatory diseases.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^1148Lf4F]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adalimumab (ADA) (Humira ®, AbbVie Inc, U.S. A.) is approved by the European Medicines Agency for children aged ≥ 4 years with severe plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ADA in children with severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Results are presented from the 52-week long-term extension (LTE) of the randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase III trial, in children with severe plaque psoriasis (results from prior periods have been published). Patients aged ≥ 4 and < 18 years were randomized 1: 1: 1 to ADA 0.8 mg kg -1 (40 mg maximum) or 0.4 mg kg -1 (20 mg maximum) every other week or to methotrexate (MTX) 0.1–0.4 mg kg -1 (25 mg maximum) weekly. The 16-week initial treatment (IT) period was followed by a 36-week withdrawal period and a 16-week retreatment period. Patients could enter the LTE at prespecified time points to receive ADA 0.8 mg kg -1 (blinded or open label) or ADA 0.4 mg kg -1 (blinded), or to remain off treatment. Efficacy is reported for patient groups according to doses received in the IT and LTE periods.

Results

Of the 114 patients randomized in the IT period, 108 entered the LTE (n = 36 in each group); 93 received ADA 0.8 mg kg -1. Efficacy (≥ 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) was maintained or improved from entry to the end of the LTE: MTX(IT)/ADA 0.8(LTE) 31–86% of patients; ADA 0.4(IT)/0.4 or 0.8(LTE) 28–47%; ADA 0.8(IT)/0.8(LTE) 50–72%. No serious infections occurred in the LTE.

Conclusions

After 52 weeks of long-term ADA treatment in children aged 4–18 years with severe plaque psoriasis, disease severity was reduced and maintained or further improved, as demonstrated by efficacy outcomes. No new safety risks were identified. What's already known about this topic? The results from the first three periods of this phase III trial in children aged 4–18 years with severe plaque psoriasis suggest that adalimumab is a safe and efficacious treatment option in this population. What does this study add? This is the first study to evaluate long-term treatment of adalimumab in children with severe psoriasis, and the first to evaluate switching from methotrexate to adalimumab in this population.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^111sGrrn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Biologics have significantly changed psoriasis treatment over the decades and have greatly improved patients' health‐related quality of life and patient‐relevant outcomes. 30, 31, 32, 33 ADA has been used to treat adults with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis for over a decade, and has shown superior efficacy to systemic treatments, such as MTX. Its accumulating safety data resulted in a first‐line label for adults and children. 34, 35 By blocking TNF‐α, ADA inhibits inflammation in psoriatic lesions by decreasing the level of proinflammatory cytokines. Other biologics approved for the treatment of children with plaque psoriasis are etanercept (age ≥ 6 years with severe disease) and ustekinumab (age ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severe disease).

In this active‐comparator‐controlled study, response at the end of the initial 16 weeks to ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 was maintained through the 52‐week LTE period of this trial. These results in children with severe psoriasis are consistent with results from ADA clinical trials in adults with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. In an analysis of 250 adults, PASI 75, 90 and 100 rates after 160 weeks of ADA treatment were 76%, 50% and 31%, respectively, 36 compared with 68.5%, 48.1% and 29.6% of children overall in the current study. In an interim analysis from a 10‐year observational registry of ADA treatment in adults (n = 6059), PGA 0/1 was achieved between 3 and 5 years of treatment by > 60% of adults, compared with 60.2% of children overall in the current study. 37

### Long lasting response to anti-tumor necrosis factor α agents in psoriasis: a real life experience [^111GrjKA]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease for which no definitive cure exists and patients difficult to treat with moderate to severe psoriasis often require life-long therapy. In general, the use of any biologic agent as monotherapy allows a long-term efficacy, however survival response may progressively decrease over time. We report real-world long lasting response data in psoriatic patients on treatment with anti-TNFα evaluating those on the same anti-TNFα agent (infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) from January 2011 and December 2013 to December 31, 2021 as monotherapy. On 210 treated patients, 69 were found to maintain the same anti-TNFα agent. The median survival rate for etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab was 10, 9.6, and 9.5years respectively and the efficacy rate was similar (mean PASI96). Our results demonstrate that anti-TNFα agents are a long-term effective and safe therapeutic option for a satisfying proportion (33%) of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Further long-term real life studies are needed to better understand which are the causes of drug failure or persistent response and why these may occur at different time intervals in patients on the same drug.

### Revealing patient characteristics and treatment outcomes among ultra-long users of biologics for psoriasis [^117AUgAT]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Biologics are effective for the treatment of psoriasis, but little is known regarding patients treated with one biologic for an 'ultra-long' duration.

Objectives

To explore the prevalence, patient and treatment characteristics, and treatment outcomes of ultra-long users of biologics for psoriasis.

Methods

Data for patients with psoriasis who had received continuous treatment with the same biologic for ≥ 10years were collected from the prospective, multicentre BioCAPTURE cohort. Baseline characteristics of these ultra-long users were determined and compared with the total BioCAPTURE population. The proportion of patients using concomitant systemic treatment and receiving dose adjustments, the trajectory of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores and drug survival rates beyond 10years were also analysed.

Results

Among the BioCAPTURE cohort, 30.5% of patients with the potential to achieve a treatment episode of ≥ 10years reached this treatment duration. These patients were treated with ustekinumab, etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab. The proportion of ultra-long users was highest for ustekinumab (37.1%). The ultra-long user cohort had a slightly longer disease duration at registry entry, and a higher proportion of men and patients diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) than the total BioCAPTURE population. Among the cohort, 69.5% of patients had at least one comorbidity and 66.1% used no additional systemic antipsoriatic treatment. Dose adjustments were often applied, varying from dose escalation (29.7%), dose reduction (40.7%) or both (13.6%); only 16.1% of patients consistently used the standard dose throughout their treatment. The median PASI score for ultra-long users from month 6 onwards was consistently < 3, with only a small proportion achieving complete clearance of their psoriasis (3.9–13.7% at the various timepoints). Drug survival analysis beyond 10years showed that 62.3% of patients were still being treated with the same biologic after 15years.

Conclusions

Ultra-long use of the same biologic in patients with psoriasis was common in real-world practice but varied between biologics. The median PASI score was around 2.5 throughout the 10-year treatment course; complete clearance was often not achieved. Remarkably, ultra-long use was also recorded in patients with multiple comorbidities (including PsA). Dose adjustments of the biologic were applied in the majority of patients. These results provide clinicians with important evidence on ultra-long treatment with biologics, thereby improving psoriasis care and the management of treatment expectations.

### Adalimumab monotherapy vs adalimumab with methotrexate for psoriasis [^115vUMtW]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether concomitant methotrexate enhances the effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab for psoriasis. The recent OPTIMAP randomized clinical trial that tested adalimumab against adalimumab with methotrexate could not adequately answer this question due to underrecruitment.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of using methotrexate with adalimumab in people with plaque psoriasis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This target trial emulation cohort study replicated key aspects of the OPTIMAP trial design using the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register between 2007 and 2021.

Exposures

Adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week monotherapy (comparator) vs adalimumab, 40 mg, every other week and methotrexate weekly, with the dosage as determined by the clinician (intervention).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference in the adalimumab survival function at 1 year. The secondary outcomes included differences in adalimumab survival function at 3 years; 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) at 1 year and 3 years; serious adverse events at 1 and 3 years; and adalimumab concentrations and antidrug antibodies at 1 year. Inverse probability treatment and censoring weighting were used for covariate and missing outcome adjustment. Flexible parametric survival models were fitted for survival outcomes and generalized linear models for other outcomes.

Results

There were 231 and 1553 participants (754 female individuals [42.3%]) in the intervention (median [IQR] age, 43.7 [35.1–53.1] years) and comparator (median [IQR] age, 43.6 [34.2–52.0] years) arms, respectively. Drug survival for the comparator arm at 1 year was 78.1% (95% CI, 76.1%-80.2%) and the intervention arm was 79.1% (95% CI, 71.8%-87.2%), with no evidence of difference (1.0%; 95% CI, -7.0% to 8.9%). PASI75 at 1 year and 3 years in the comparator arm was 52.0% (95% CI, 47.7%-56.3%) and 32.4% (95% CI, 28.0%-36.8%), respectively; in the intervention arm, PASI75 was 49.4% (95% CI, 31.5%-67.3%) and 37.2% (95% CI, 16.8%-57.6%), respectively. There was no evidence of differences at 1 year and 3 years (-2.5%; 95% CI, -21.0% to 15.9% and 4.9%; 95% CI, -16.1% to 25.7%, respectively). There was no evidence for a difference between the 2 arms for serious adverse events and adalimumab concentrations, while the intervention arm had a lower antidrug antibody level (risk difference, -123.7 AU/mL; 95% CI, -200.5 to -46.9).

Conclusion and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that there was no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness and persistence of adalimumab in people with psoriasis between monotherapy and adalimumab with concomitant methotrexate.

### Efficacy, safety and medication cost implications of adalimumab 40 mg weekly dosing in patients with psoriasis with suboptimal response to 40 mg every other week dosing: results from an open-label study [^115BNAGT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical utility of increasing to weekly adalimumab therapy in patients with psoriasis with inadequate response to every other week (eow) dosing is unknown.

Objectives

(i) To determine the effectiveness of escalating adalimumab dosage from 40 mgeow to 40 mg weekly in patients with < PASI 50 response following ≥ 24 weeks treatment. (ii) To identify retrospectively characteristics of patients likely to benefit from dose escalation using classification and regression tree analysis. (iii) To assess cost implications for allowing dose escalation from the private payers' perspective.

Methods

Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who had received blinded adalimumab 40 mgeow or placebo in antecedent phase II/III studies could enrol in an open-label extension (OLE) and initially receive open-label adalimumab 40 mgeow (EOW population). On/after week 24 (OLE), patients with < PASI 50 response relative to baseline of antecedent study could increase to 40 mg weekly. The dosage escalation population continued on weekly dosing until achieving PASI 75 response, then resumed eow dosing. Study visits were 6/12 weeks after dosage escalation, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The percentage of patients who achieved PASI 75 response following dosage escalation was determined (missing PASI scores imputed as nonresponse). Safety was assessed for the dosage escalation population and for all adalimumab exposure that did not follow dosage escalation in the EOW set.

Results

In total, 349/1256 (27.8%) patients underwent dosage escalation (OLE). At 12/24 weeks after dosage escalation, 93/349 (26.6%)/133/349 (38.1%) were PASI 75 responders or resumed eow dosing. Secondary nonresponders, patients weighing ≤ 102 kg, and those with disease duration < 8.3 years were most likely to benefit from dose escalation. Rates of serious/serious infectious/malignant (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers or lymphoma) adverse events were 6.8/0.9/1.4 events per 100 patient-years (dosage escalation population); comparable rates in the EOW set were 6.5/1.2/0.5 events per 100 patient-years.

Conclusions

Most patients did not require dose escalation. By 12 weeks after dose escalation, one-quarter achieved substantial clinical improvement. Safety results were similar between patients who dosage-escalated and those who did not.

### Risk of serious infections in patients with psoriasis on biologic therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161BsJo]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, no increased short-term risk of serious infection was identified in adults with psoriasis who were eligible for enrolment in the RCTs. No differential serious infection risk between the biologic therapies was detected where head-to-head RCT data were available. Data from a real-world population, however, suggest that adalimumab is associated with a higher risk of serious infections compared with acitretin and/or phototherapy in adults.

The results from the RCTs should be interpreted with caution given limitations, which include the lack of long-term data, the differences among the characteristics of the study population compared with the target population of patients in real-world settings, and the unclear reporting of outcome measures of serious infections in RCTs.

Other limitations include a low event rate, the lack of data informing the serious infection risk of infliximab, and the lack of comparative data either between biologic therapies or against traditional systemic therapies. Future research priority should focus on standardization of the nomenclature, definition, and reporting of the outcome for serious infection in RCTs. Strict adherence of the extension of the CONSORT statement to report harms in clinical trials will help make the definition, ascertainment, and statistical evaluation of adverse events more transparent. Future RCTs should conduct head-to-head comparisons between biologic therapies above and beyond 6 months. More RCTs should be conducted in children from different populations. Individual patient data and trial protocols from the RCT should be shared after publication for replication of results and to facilitate time-to-event meta-analysis.

Analysis of further adequately powered registry data with adequate adjustment for potential confounding should be performed to clarify the risk of serious infection of biologic therapies against a suitable comparator cohort. This may inform the current uncertainty about the risk of serious infection when biologic therapies are used in patients with psoriasis. Clinicians should encourage their patients to enroll in prospective pharmacovigilance registries and should remain vigilant for serious infections in patients receiving biologic therapies for psoriasis.

### What's new in psoriasis? Analysis of the clinical significance of systematic reviews on psoriasis published in 2007 and 2008 [^116QNM3y]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the clinical importance of six systematic reviews on psoriasis published between January 2007 and October 2008. A meta-analysis demonstrated that several traditional nonbiological systemic therapies have equal or superior efficacy to some biological therapies used in the treatment of psoriasis. Two further meta-analyses comparing biological therapies for psoriasis (excluding adalimumab) have established a hierarchy of efficacy for short-term treatment (10–16 weeks): infliximab > etanercept 50 mg twice weekly > etanercept 25 mg twice weekly > efalizumab > alefacept. Excluding adalimumab, rates of adverse events are significantly higher for biological therapies than for placebo, except for etanercept at both 25 and 50 mg twice weekly. Further, head to head trials of biological therapies for psoriasis and longer-term safety data on their use are required. Psoriasis can be induced by and/or exacerbated during antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. It is recommended to initially switch anti-TNF agent in this situation and only discontinue therapy if psoriasis is extensive and/or intolerable, allowing the primary disease to remain under control. Most screening and monitoring tests carried out during treatment of psoriasis with biological therapies are neither supported nor refuted by current evidence and the clinician must assess each case individually. Studies designed specifically to assess appropriate use of these tests are required. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing psychological interventions in psoriasis. The effectiveness of support groups has not been adequately proven, although there are limited data supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated continuously over 3 years: results from an open-label extension study for patients from REVEAL [^1114Rf6c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

REVEAL was a 52-week phase III trial of adalimumab therapy for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients from REVEAL could enter an open-label extension trial to receive adalimumab for approximately 3 years of total therapy.

Objective

We sought to determine long-term efficacy and safety of continuous adalimumab therapy for patients from REVEAL.

Methods

Efficacy and safety over greater than 3 years of treatment were analyzed for 4 groups of patients from REVEAL. Patients who received adalimumab continuously from baseline were grouped by their responses in REVEAL: (1) greater than or equal to 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (PASI 75) at weeks 16 and 33 (sustained responders); (2) less than PASI 75 at week 16; and (3) greater than or equal to PASI 75 at week 16 with 50% to less than 75% improvement in PASI score at week 33. Results were also analyzed for patients who began adalimumab after 16 weeks of placebo therapy.

Results

For patients with sustained PASI 75 responses during REVEAL, efficacy was generally well maintained over 3 years, with 75%/90%/100% improvement in PASI score response rates (last observation carried forward) of 83%/59%/33% after 100 weeks and 76%/50%/31% after 160 weeks of continuous therapy. Some patients with less than PASI 75 responses in REVEAL also achieved long-term PASI 75 responses. Efficacy in the placebo/adalimumab group was consistent with the ensemble of results from the other 3 groups. Adverse event rates were consistent with those during REVEAL.

Limitations

The REVEAL study design prevented analyzing all patients from the adalimumab arm as one long-term cohort.

Conclusion

Adalimumab efficacy was well maintained over more than 3 years of continuous therapy for patients with sustained initial PASI 75 responses. Maintenance was best at the PASI 100 level.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^113Rq1gu]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Its overall prevalence for children 0–18 years of age is 0.2–1.4% in Europe and approximately 1% in the U.S. A. 1, 2 The disease in children and adults is associated with impaired quality of life 3, 4, 5 and an increased risk of comorbidities, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk, autoimmune diseases 6, 7, 8 and psychosocial issues, especially depression. 9, 10, 11

The limited number of approved systemic therapies and randomized controlled trials evaluating treatment in children has challenged the effective management of the disease. Conventional treatment options include topical therapy for mild‐to‐moderate disease, 12 and for severe or refractory disease, ultraviolet (UV)B phototherapy, narrowband UVB therapy if accessible and systemic treatments, including methotrexate (MTX), ciclosporin, acitretin (retinoids) and biologics. 13, 14, 15

Approved biologic therapies for plaque psoriasis in children include the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α inhibitors etanercept 16, 17, 18, 19 and adalimumab (ADA), 20 and the p40 inhibitor ustekinumab. 18, 19 Etanercept is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for children aged ≥ 6 years with severe disease, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children aged ≥ 4 years; ADA is approved by the EMA for children aged ≥ 4 years with severe chronic disease; and ustekinumab is approved by the EMA and FDA for children aged ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severe disease.

Results of long‐term treatment of children with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis have been published for open‐label etanercept, 21, 22 and for ustekinumab vs. placebo. 23 Biologic treatment of psoriasis in children is reported as less likely to result in adverse events or in treatment discontinuation compared with MTX. 24

The current analysis reports results from the first randomized 52‐week controlled trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of a biologic treatment, ADA (Humira ®, AbbVie Inc. North Chicago, IL, U.S. A.), a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF‐α, with the active comparator MTX, in children with severe plaque psoriasis. Results from the first three periods of this trial have been reported. 25

### Efficacy and safety of systemic long-term treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KNNu5]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Psoriasis as a chronic inflammatory disease often requires effective long-term treatment; a comprehensive systematic evaluation of efficacy and safety of systemic long-term treatments in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis is lacking. Twenty-five randomized clinical trials were included. Results were pooled and quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). With respect to PASI 75 (psoriasis area and severity index), pooled risk ratios for infliximab (13.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.60–19.87), secukinumab (11.97, 95% CI: 8.83–16.23), ustekinumab (11.39, 95% CI: 8.94–14.51), adalimumab (8.92, 95% CI: 6.33–12.57), etanercept (8.39, 95% CI: 6.74–10.45), and apremilast (5.83, 95% CI: 2.58–13.17) show superiority of biologics and apremilast in long-term therapy compared with placebo. With respect to the addressed safety parameters, no differences were seen between adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab versus placebo. No placebo-controlled data on conventional treatments was identified. Head-to-head studies showed superior efficacy of secukinumab and infliximab versus etanercept and of infliximab versus methotrexate. A clear ranking is limited by the lack of long-term head-to-head trials. From the available evidence, infliximab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab are the most efficacious long-term treatments. Data on conventionals are insufficient. Further head-to-head comparisons and studies on safety and patient-related outcomes are needed to draw more reliable conclusions.

Study design

This randomized, parallel‐group, double‐blind, phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01251614) had four periods: primary double‐blind initial treatment (IT, 16 weeks), withdrawal (up to 36 weeks), retreatment (16 weeks) and long‐term extension (LTE, 52 weeks) (Fig. 1). Results from the LTE are presented here.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^1164wDgb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Etanercept (2017)

Recommendations Etanercept is recommended as induction therapy and long‐term therapy in moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S17; see Supporting Information). A starting dose of 50 mg twice weekly is suggested, over a dose of 50 mg once weekly. Undesired effects of long‐term treatment are similar to induction therapy. A maintenance dose of 50 mg twice weekly is suggested over a dose of 50 mg once weekly.

Infliximab (2017)

Recommendations Infliximab is recommended as induction therapy for chronic plaque‐type psoriasis in week 0, 2 and 6 (Table S18; see Supporting Information). Infliximab is recommended as maintenance therapy every 8 weeks (with at least 4 weeks between two administrations).

Secukinumab (2017)

Recommendations Secukinumab is recommended as induction therapy in chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S19; see Supporting Information). A dose of 300 mg is recommended over a dose of 150 mg in induction therapy. Secukinumab is suggested for maintenance therapy. Long‐term safety data are limited.

Ustekinumab (2017)

Recommendations Ustekinumab is recommended as induction therapy in chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S20; see Supporting Information). Ustekinumab 45 mg is suggested in patients ≤ 100 kg. Ustekinumab 90 mg is suggested in patients > 100 kg. Ustekinumab is recommended as a maintenance therapy for at least 5 years. The long‐term safety profile of ustekinumab over a period of 5 years appears not to be evidently different from that for 1 year in additional literature.

Combination therapy (2017)

Prescription of systemic combination therapy is currently off‐label. Patients should be informed about this off‐label use and possible side‐effects. Therapy should be started only after careful weighing of benefits and risks tailored to the individual patient. 16

Recommendations

Etanercept in combination with methotrexate is suggested as induction and maintenance therapy of chronic plaque‐type psoriasis. Etanercept in combination with acitretin is suggested as induction and maintenance treatment of chronic plaque‐type psoriasis (based on one maintenance study). 16

Biologics or methotrexate in combination with ultraviolet B is not recommended as a maintenance treatment in patients with chronic plaque‐type psoriasis because of a lack of data on safety. 16

Treatment with adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab or secukinumab in combination with methotrexate is suggested in treatment‐resistant psoriasis.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alfa inhibitors — infectious risk profile and risk–benefit show that the incidence of infections including the reactivation of tuberculosis and rare opportunistic infections appears to be lower for etanercept than for the monoclonal antibodies infliximab and adalimumab, and that during the first year of treatment the likelihood of success with TNF-alfa inhibitors for psoriasis was approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the likelihood of toxicity.

### Adalimumab therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis: a randomized, controlled phase III trial [^1156vNF3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds tumor necrosis factor, a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Objective

We sought to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab for moderate to severe psoriasis and investigate continuous versus interrupted therapy.

Methods

We conducted a 52-week, multicenter study of 1212 patients randomized to receive adalimumab (40 mg) or placebo every other week for the first 15 weeks. At least 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was the criterion for advancement through this multiphase study.

Results

At week 16, 71% (578 of 814) of adalimumab- and 7% (26 of 398) of placebo-treated patients achieved greater than or equal to 75% improvement in the PASI score. During weeks 33 to 52, the percentage of patients rerandomized to placebo who lost adequate response (defined as < 50% improvement in the PASI response relative to baseline and at least a 6-point increase in PASI score from week 33) was 28% compared with 5% of patients treated continuously with adalimumab.

Limitations

Lack of an active comparator and evaluation of maintenance of response beyond week 52 are limitations.

Conclusion

Adalimumab is efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.

Trial Registration

### Comprehensive long-term safety of adalimumab from 18 clinical trials in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis [^111VJqvV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Adalimumab (Humira ®, AbbVie Inc, North Chicago, IL, U.S. A.) is a fully human monoclonal antibody specific for tumour necrosis factor-α that is approved to treat adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

To assess long-term safety for patients with psoriasis receiving adalimumab in clinical studies.

Methods

Adalimumab safety data from adults with psoriasis who received at least one adalimumab dose in 18 clinical trials were evaluated. Adalimumab was delivered subcutaneously in all treatment regimens. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were collected from the first dose to 70 days after the last dose or cut-off date (31 December 2015). AE incidence rates were expressed as events per 100 patient-years (E/100 PYs) of adalimumab exposure. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for malignancies and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.

Results

Cumulative exposure was 5429.7 PYs in 3727 patients. Overall, there were 16 536 AEs (304.6 E/100 PYs). The most common AEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection and headache (23.7, 12.9 and 7.9 E/100 PYs, respectively). Incidence rates for serious infections, tuberculosis and opportunistic infections were 1.8, 0.3 and 0.02 E/100 PYs, respectively. Incidence of malignancy excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was 0.8 E/100 PYs [SIR 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58–1.23]. Incidences of NMSC and melanoma were 0.6 and 0.2 E/100 PYs, respectively. The SIR was 1.55 (95% CI 1.10–2.13) for NMSC and 3.04 (95% CI 1.11–6.62) for melanoma. The SMR was 0.34 (95% CI 0.16–0.65).

Conclusions

AE rates remained stable in this analysis of patients with psoriasis receiving adalimumab; no new safety signals were identified compared with earlier analyses.

### The interpretation of long-term trials of biologic treatments for psoriasis: trial designs and the choices of statistical analyses affect ability to compare outcomes across trials [^115jRPYB]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy, which makes finding treatments with favourable long-term safety and efficacy profiles crucial. The goal of this review is to provide the background needed to evaluate properly long-term studies of biologic treatments for psoriasis. Firstly, important elements of design and analysis strategies are described. Secondly, data from published trials of biologic therapies for psoriasis are reviewed in light of the design and analysis choices implemented in the studies. Published reports of clinical trials of biologic treatments (adalimumab, alefacept, etanercept, infliximab or ustekinumab) that lasted 33 weeks or longer and included efficacy results and statistical analysis were reviewed. Study designs and statistical analyses were evaluated and summarized, emphasizing patient follow-up methods and handling of missing data. Various trial designs and data handling methods are used in long-term studies of biologic psoriasis treatments. Responder analyses in long-term trials can be conducted in responder enrichment, re-treated nonresponder or intent-to-treat trials. Missing data can be handled in four ways, including, from most to least conservative, nonresponder imputation, last-observation-carried-forward, as-observed analysis and anytime analysis. Long-term clinical trials have shown that adalimumab, alefacept, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab are efficacious for psoriasis treatment; however, without common standards for these trials, direct comparisons of these agents are difficult. Understanding differences in trial design and data handling is essential to make informed treatment decisions.

### Adalimumab for the treatment of severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^112vfqjy]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically determined, immunomediated, inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 2–3% of the Caucasian population. Systemic treatment is required in moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis forms or psoriatic arthritis. However, cumulative organ toxicity, lack of efficacy over time and other underlying diseases may limit long-term use of conventional treatments.

Objectives

TNF-alpha, serves a key role in potentiating inflammatory responses associated with both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Adalimumab is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody; approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and, more recently, for plaque-type psoriasis.

Methods

This review reports the latest progresses made in the clinical use of 'biologic' drugs for psoriasis focusing on the clinical management of adalimumab in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

Results

Adalimumab was shown to be effective in treating both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis with a rapid onset of action and a good safety profile.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^114sw6jS]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

For the subgroup who did not respond to MTX treatment in the IT period and continued directly to open‐label treatment with ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 in the LTE, the majority achieved PASI 75, PASI 90 and PGA 0/1 (80%) response throughout the LTE, starting as early as week 4. This improvement after switching is consistent with results of other trials in adults with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis. In an open‐label trial, 61% of patients (n = 41) who had failed prior treatment with MTX achieved PGA 0/1 after 16 weeks of ADA. 41 In an open‐label randomized controlled trial, patients who switched from initial treatment with MTX (n = 215) to infliximab (n = 63) had a higher response rate at week 26 than patients who did not switch (73% vs. 30.7% achieved PASI 75, and 75% vs. 28% achieved PGA 0/1). 42 In a real‐world practice study, patients (n = 267) improved their skin response following a switch to biologics after treatment with conventional systemic agents. In that study the mean time to first follow‐up after switching was 6 weeks, and the mean ± SD PASI scores before and after switching were 13.6 ± 8.8 and 5.7 ± 5.8, respectively. 43

In the current study, following ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 treatment in the LTE, the MTX responders in the IT period had a generally greater treatment response rate across efficacy outcomes than MTX nonresponders in the IT period. Possible reasons include lack of a washout period for nonresponders, or more patients who escaped early in the IT period entering the LTE. In general, the response rates for both groups were greater than the rates in the LTE for patients who received ADA in the IT period and in the LTE.

The ADA safety profile across all efficacy groups during the 52‐week LTE was similar to the 16‐week IT period profile, 25 including low numbers of serious adverse events, severe adverse events, injection‐site reactions and allergic reactions, and was therefore consistent with the known safety profile of ADA in adults with psoriasis. No serious infections were observed during the LTE. Rates for adverse events leading to discontinuation, allergic reactions or injection‐site reactions were low. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections.

### Real-world, long-term treatment patterns of commonly used biologics in Canadian patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis [^111E1KGj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

This chart review was limited due to the review period focusing mostly on the last few years. No effectiveness data were collected. The introduction of new biologics may have impacted drug survival patterns as patients may have switched earlier if/when new options became available. Also, treatment goals and patterns evolved over time. The longer a biologic has been on the market the higher the likelihood that is has been used as a first treatment. Limited long‐term data were available for newer biologics; therefore, the estimation of treatment changes could not be performed. Restricting inclusion of patients with treatment initiated per label dose may not fully reflect clinical practice. Some sites could not provide the requested number of charts to meet the inclusion criteria within the study time frame; therefore, these sites went sequentially backwards in 2018 until they reached 100 charts. Despite this approach, some sites were unable to provide 100 charts, mainly due to current therapy lasting < 1 year. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, missing or incomplete information was also a limitation. Future investigations should explore temporal treatment changes at a deeper level.

Novel from this study was the assessment of time to first treatment change – including switching, discontinuation, dose escalation, and interval change (both increasing and decreasing) – which was longer for adalimumab than ustekinumab or etanercept. The time to first treatment change could be half as long for the second line of treatment than for the first line of treatment. Specifically, in the Canadian context where dosing is usually neither decreased nor intervals increased as much as in Europe, this study provides long‐term data on four classes of biologics, helping to close a knowledge gap on treatment pattern practices in a real‐world setting in patients with moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque PsO.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis — TNF-alfa antagonists usage and comparative efficacy indicates there is no specific sequence in which the currently available TNF-alfa antagonists should be used; pivotal phase III studies suggest the initial response rate of cutaneous disease to infliximab is superior to that of adalimumab, which is superior to that of etanercept; over the course of a year, a loss of response may be noted with these agents, necessitating the addition of phototherapy or methotrexate (MTX) or switching to another biologic; a retrospective study demonstrated that patients who develop positive antinuclear and antidsDNA antibodies to the monoclonal antibody TNF-alpha inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab, compared with the fusion protein TNF-alfa inhibitor etanercept, were more likely to lose response to treatment.

### Five-year analysis from the ESPRIT 10-year postmarketing surveillance registry of adalimumab treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis [^111iUb1r]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

ESPRIT is an ongoing, 10-year, observational registry, evaluating long-term safety and effectiveness of adalimumab treatment in routine clinical practice for patients with moderate to severe, chronic plaque psoriasis.

Objectives

Initial 5-year results are reported.

Methods

Two populations were analyzed: the "all-treated" population received 1 or more adalimumab doses in registry, continuing adalimumab treatment from a current prescription or previous study participation, and included the "new-prescription" population initiating adalimumab 4 weeks or earlier preregistry entry.

Results

Data were collected from September 26, 2008, through November 30, 2013, for all-treated (n = 6059), which included new-prescription (n = 2580, 42.6%); median registry exposure was 765 and 677 days, respectively. In all-treated, rate (events per 100 patient-years of total adalimumab exposure [E/100PY]) of serious treatment-emergent adverse events (inside or outside of the registry) was 4.3 E/100PY, serious infection 1.0 E/100PY, malignancies 0.9 E/100PY (nonmelanoma skin cancers 0.6 E/100PY; melanomas < 0.1 E/100PY). Standardized mortality ratio was 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.19–0.44). Physician Global Assessment clear or minimal (effectiveness parameter) was achieved by 57.0% at 12 months and 64.7% at 60 months of treatment.

Limitations

Observational data are subject to outcome-reporting bias.

Conclusion

No new safety signals were observed with adalimumab treatment during this initial 5-year registry review. Observed number of deaths was below expected. As-observed effectiveness remained stable through 60 months.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^115WqM8Q]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 114 initially randomized patients (MTX, n = 37; ADA 0.4 mg kg −1, n = 39; ADA 0.8 mg kg −1, n = 38), 108 entered the LTE (n = 36 in each efficacy group) (Fig. 2). Patients who entered the LTE according to prespecified entry criteria included eight who escaped the IT period early (n = 6 at week 4 and n = 2 at week 8), 51 who were nonresponders at the end of the IT period, 15 who completed the IT period and did not lose disease control at the end of the treatment withdrawal period, and 34 who completed the IT period, lost disease control in the withdrawal period and completed the retreatment period.

### Adalimumab with methotrexate vs. adalimumab monotherapy in psoriasis: first-year results of a single-blind randomized Controlled trial [^116Kykey]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adalimumab is normally prescribed with methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis given the enhanced treatment effect and reduced antidrug antibody formation compared with adalimumab monotherapy (ADL). In psoriasis, the long-term treatment effects and pharmacokinetic profile have not been investigated extensively.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of adalimumab combined with MTX 10 mg per week (ADL-MTX group) compared with that of ADL (ADL group) in chronic plaque psoriasis.

Results

A total of 31 patients in the ADL-MTX group and 30 in the ADL group were analyzed. After 1 year, a (nonsignificant) better drug survival was found in the ADL-MTX group (74.2 vs. 58.6%, P = 0.15). The PASI 75 response in week 49 was 58.1 versus 36.7% (P = 0.13), and the median (interquartile range) serum-trough concentrations were 6.8 (5.5‒9.2) versus 5.9 (3.5‒8.8) mg/l (P = 0.26) in the ADL-MTX group and ADL group, respectively. Fewer patients showed antidrug antibodies in the ADL-MTX group (22.6 vs. 60.0%, P < 0.01). No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Combination therapy of adalimumab and MTX results in fewer patients showing antidrug antibodies, with a trend toward a better PASI 75 response, drug survival, and higher serum-trough concentrations than ADL. Patient-reported outcomes and adverse events were comparable between the groups.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis biologic therapy — tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alfa) antagonists have favorable interaction and hemodynamic profiles but carry specific safety observations: "there are no relevant drug interactions with the biologics", and for TNF-alfa agents there are "no known drug interactions" and "no known deleterious effect on renal function or blood pressure". However, "significant elevations of liver enzymes occurred in 4.9% of patients during the phase III clinical trials of infliximab" and occurred "in a smaller percentage" with adalimumab, with elevations "in the majority of cases, self-correcting". Case reports describe "the sudden development of SCC" in psoriasis with prior "significant UVB or PUVA exposure", and "an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers" has been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF-alfa inhibitors. While "there are no data evaluating the potential long-term (> 5 years) effects" in psoriasis, a rheumatoid arthritis cohort of "1430" patients treated with TNF-alfa antagonists had "a decrease in mortality from all causes (adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.46–0.93])".

### Adalimumab in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^112LDY97]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are chronic immune-mediated diseases, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Adalimumab is an anti-TNF-α drug widely used for the treatment of both psoriasis and PsA. Controlled clinical trials demonstrated that adalimumab is characterized by a high degree of clinical response. The aim of this review is to report the safety, efficacy, and recent findings in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA with adalimumab.

Areas Covered

This article reviews the results of Phase II, III, controlled, and observational clinical studies on adalimumab in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA. A systematic search was conducted using the Pubmed Medline database for primary articles.

Expert Opinion

Treatment of psoriasis and PsA represents a therapeutic challenge for dermatologists and rheumatologists. The efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles suggest adalimumab as a suitable anti-psoriatic drug in the long-term treatment of psoriasis and PsA. Management of long-term treatment, loss of efficacy, and comorbidities has been described.

### Psoriasis is a chronic disease: long term efficacy and safety of new biologics is important [^111VfpDU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Increased understanding of psoriasis has led to a shift in treatments from non-specific immunosuppressants to targeted biologics. Studies in psoriasis have demonstrated minimal risk and substantial benefit. As a result, dermatologists and patients are more frequently choosing biologics as first-line treatments for moderate-to-severe disease as our biologics options have recently increased.

### Impact of methotrexate and adalimumab on immune function of patients with psoriasis [^114MNTS5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with psoriasis are commonly treated with methotrexate or biologics. We examined the immune response in a whole blood assay (TruCulture®) to assess the effect of methotrexate and adalimumab. Twenty patients with psoriasis were included and cytokine levels following stimulation with LPS, R848, HKCA, PolyIC, or a blank were investigated before and after 3–6 months of treatment with methotrexate or adalimumab and in patients who had received adalimumab > 5years. Methotrexate only induced minor changes in the cytokine responses, whereas adalimumab affected a wide range of cytokines important for the immune defense towards microorganisms. In the long-term adalimumab treated group, the cytokine levels were almost equivalent to the short-term adalimumab-treated group. Overall, methotrexate was not associated with cytokine suppression. Short and long-term treatment with adalimumab lowered multiple cytokines involved in the immune defense equally emphasizing the need to continuously be aware of the risk of infections in these patients.

### Comparison of long-term drug survival and safety of biologic agents in patients with psoriasis vulgaris [^1175VUth]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Drug survival (time to drug discontinuation) has recently emerged as an important parameter reflecting the long-term therapeutic performance in a real-life setting. Biologic drug survival in psoriasis is mainly limited by a gradual loss of efficacy over time. Previous studies have been limited by small patient population size and short observation times and yielded discrepant survival times for different biologics.

Objectives

To calculate the long-term drug survival for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab in a large cohort of real-life patients with psoriasis vulgaris and to analyse the factors that influence drug survival.

Patients and Methods

Data were extracted from the prospective registry DERMBIO covering all patients with psoriasis vulgaris treated with biologic agents in the academic centres in Denmark. Drug survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The influence of different covariates on drug survival was analysed by Cox regression.

Results

Included in the analysis were 1867 treatment series (adalimumab n = 774, etanercept n = 449, infliximab n = 253, ustekinumab n = 391) administered in 1277 patients for up to 10 years. Drug survival was significantly longer for ustekinumab than for anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents (P < 0.001). Etanercept had the shortest survival time [median survival 30 months, 95% confidence interval (CI) 25.1–34.9] whereas adalimumab and infliximab had comparable survival rates (59 months, 95% CI 45.6–72.4; 44 months, 95% CI 33–54.9, respectively). Survival was longer in men [odds ratio (OR) 1.51, 95% CI 1.31–1.74 vs. women] and in patients who had not previously received any biologic agent (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05–1.46). Loss of efficacy accounted for 67% of all drug discontinuations.

Conclusions

Ustekinumab has a significantly longer drug survival than the anti-TNF-α agents. Switching from one biologic to another is associated with an impairment of drug survival. Preventing loss of efficacy is a major area of medical need in the biologic therapy of psoriasis and the strategies that improve drug survival should be further investigated.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^113aRhWZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of the 108 patients who entered the LTE received ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 in the LTE (Fig. 2): 100 received any ADA (0.4 or 0.8 mg kg −1) and 93 received any ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 dose. Of these, 83 of 93 received open‐label or blinded ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 from the start of the LTE, and 88 of 93 received ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 from their first dose in the LTE. Four of 93 patients started the LTE off drug, lost disease control and were switched to blinded ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 in the LTE, and an additional six of 93 switched from double‐blind ADA 0.4 mg kg −1 to open‐label ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 in the LTE (Fig. 2).

Eight of the 15 patients who did not lose disease control in the withdrawal period and who continued off treatment in the LTE remained off drug in the LTE, and seven of 15 lost disease control in the LTE and were re‐treated with the same blinded dose they received in the IT period (or with ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 for those initially randomized to MTX in the IT period); this included three who were re‐treated in the LTE with ADA 0.4 mg kg −1 and four who were re‐treated with ADA 0.8 mg kg −1.

In total 18 of 108 patients (16.7%) discontinued the LTE; the primary reason was lack of efficacy (n = 10). The median exposure to any ADA dose was 364 days (range 42–380) during the LTE (n = 100), and 392 days (range 21–611) during the entire study (n = 111). The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced among the IT‐period dose groups. 25 The most commonly reported concomitant topical medications were salicylic acid (6%) and emollients and protectives (5.3%).

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^116ZWQXs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment of children with severe chronic psoriasis remains a challenge. Standardized treatment guidelines are lacking and the evidence for the efficacy and safety of systemic treatments in paediatric psoriasis is limited. The treatment approach is based on systemic treatments for adults, even though most of these drugs are not approved for paediatric use. 26 While MTX was first investigated in this clinical trial, only retrospective case series are available for drugs such as ciclosporin and acitretin. 26, 27, 28 The chronicity of psoriasis and its negative effect on patient quality of life can necessitate long‐term treatment, thus the efficacy and safety of long‐term systemic therapy are important in this population. However, they have been evaluated in only a few clinical trials, which show the strongest evidence for biologics. 21, 22, 23, 29 Methotrexate is approved for adult plaque psoriasis only, but up to now has been the first‐line systemic agent recommended for paediatric psoriasis. 14

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, more specifically with respect to biologic agents (adalimumab), AAD 2019 guidelines recommend to initiate adalimumab as a monotherapy treatment option in adult patients with:

- moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, including when affecting the nails or plaque-type palmoplantar psoriasis

- plaque psoriasis of any severity associated with psoriatic arthritis.

### Effectiveness and survival of methotrexate versus adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a cohort study from the British Association of Dermatologists biologics and immunomodulators register (BADBIR) [^114Zce9Y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Most information on the comparative effectiveness and survival of methotrexate (MTX) and adalimumab (ADA) in the treatment of psoriasis is from randomized control trials and may not translate to the everyday clinical setting.

Objectives

To determine the real-world effectiveness and survival of MTX and ADA in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis registered in the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR).

Methods

Eligible patients were registered in BADBIR, ≥ 16years of age and receiving a first course of MTX or ADA between September 2007 and December 2021, with ≥ 6months of follow-up. Effectiveness was defined as achieving an absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≤ 2 reported ≥ 13 weeks after the treatment start date until the stop date. The average treatment effect (ATE) was estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting with propensity score, including baseline covariates. ATE results were presented as risk ratios (RR). A flexible parametric model was used to estimate adjusted standardized average survival, defined as treatment discontinuation associated with ineffectiveness or the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) at 6, 12 and 24months. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 2years of treatment exposure was calculated.

Results

In total, 6575 patients (median age 44years; 44% female) were analysed; 2659 (40.4%) were prescribed MTX and 3916 (59.5%) ADA. The proportion of patients achieving PASI ≤ 2 was higher in the ADA cohort (77.4%) than in the MTX cohort (37.4%). ADA was more effective than MTX [RR 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98–2.45]. Overall survival associated with ineffectiveness or AEs was lower in the MTX cohort than in the ADA cohort at 6months [survival estimate 69.7 (95% CI 67.9–71.5) vs. 90.6 (95% CI 89.8–91.4)], 1year [survival estimate 52.5 (95% CI 50.4–54.8) vs. 80.6 (95% CI 79.5–81.8)] and 2years [survival estimate 34.8 (95% CI 32.5–37.2) vs. 68.6 (95% CI 67.2–70.0)]. The difference in RMST (years) overall, or when stratified by ineffectiveness and AEs, was 0.53 (95% CI 0.49–0.58), 0.37 (95% CI 0.33–0.42) and 0.29 (95% CI 0.25–0.33), respectively.

Conclusions

Patients on ADA were twice as likely to be clear or nearly clear of psoriasis and were less likely to discontinue their medication than patients on MTX. Findings from this real-world cohort provide important information to aid clinicians managing patients with psoriasis.

### Adalimumab for the treatment of psoriasis in real life: a retrospective cohort of 119 patients at a single Spanish centre [^114vt4dX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with adalimumab in daily clinical practice are different from those in clinical trials, and outcomes may differ in different geographical settings.

Objectives

To analyse the efficacy, retention of treatment and adverse events in a cohort of such patients at a referral centre in Barcelona, Spain.

Methods

Data from a cohort of 119 consecutive patients treated between January 2008 and March 2013 were retrospectively collected. Drug survival was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and Cox regression.

Results

The mean duration of treatment was 25 months (median 22, range 2–60). The 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) response rates at 16 weeks, 6 months and 1 year of treatment were 64%, 58% and 53%, respectively (intention-to-treat analysis). The corresponding PASI 90 values were 49%, 52% and 50%. Biologic-naive patients (41%) had significantly higher PASI 75 and PASI 90 response rates at 6 months and 1 year. On multivariate analysis, only PASI 90 response at 6 months was significantly associated with treatment retention (P = 0.0009), with a hazard ratio of 7.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3–23.6). Forty-eight adverse events (AEs) occurred in 29 patients, and were serious in eight (0.032 events per patient-year). Paradoxical flares of psoriasis or arthritis were seen in five patients. Infections accounted for seven serious AEs, and were the reason for discontinuation in two patients.

Conclusions

PASI 90 response at 6 months was the only independent variable predicting drug survival on multivariate analysis. Infections, including de novo infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, accounted for seven serious AEs.

### Determination of adalimumab and etanercept trough levels and drug antibodies in long-term psoriasis treatment: a single-centre cohort study [^117VKziY]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

An algorithm based on measurement of a serum tumour necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF) and antidrug antibodies (ADA) has been proposed previously to guide dose escalation or therapy switching in the early (i.e. the first months of) treatment of psoriasis by anti-TNF. In long-term treatment of responding patients with psoriasis, it is usual to empirically reduce standard doses of anti-TNF to reduce exposure while maintaining clinical response. The relationship between serum anti-TNF, ADA levels and clinical efficacy in long-term treated patients with psoriasis has not yet been determined, so the potential role of these parameters in guiding dose escalation in this scenario is unknown.

Aims

To evaluate the relationship between drug/ADA levels and clinical efficacy in a group of patients with psoriasis undergoing long-term treatment with adalimumab or etanercept.

Methods

This was a single-centre, prospective, cohort study of patients with psoriasis receiving adalimumab or etanercept for a minimum of 48 weeks. All patients were started on the standard dose, but some adalimumab users had a reduced frequency of administration. Clinical efficacy was measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Serum concentrations were measured by ELISA. Clinical assessment and blood sample collection were carried out simultaneously within 24 h before the next drug administration.

Results

In total, 21 patients were enrolled (67 simultaneous clinical and serum determinations: 38 receiving adalimumab, 29 receiving etanercept). We did not find any association between serum anti-TNF levels and clinical response. None of the patients developed ADA.

Conclusions

ADA and anti-TNF levels are not related to clinical effectiveness in patients with psoriasis undergoing long-term treatment with adalimumab or etanercept.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis biologic dosing — TNF-alfa antagonists use fixed and weight-based regimens, and "extensive clinical experience demonstrates the importance of accounting for patient weight" even though "there are no comparative studies" on weight effects. "Etanercept is given as a fixed dose (the FDA-approved dose is 50 mg twice weekly for the first 3 months of therapy followed by 50 mg once weekly thereafter)", and "adalimumab is also given as a fixed dose (the FDA-approved dose is 80 mg the first week, 40 mg the next week, and then 40 mg every other week)"; conversely, "infliximab is given intravenously on a weight basis (the FDA-approved dosage is 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks)".

Biologics

Recommendations Biologics should be administered with caution in children with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis given the uncertainty about long‐term safety. The working group suggests considering the conventional systemics first.

In order to evaluate long‐term safety, it is recommended including children treated with a biologic in a (national) registry. Treatment of paediatric patients with psoriasis with biologics should be the preserve of dermatologists with experience in biological therapy, especially in children.

For instructions for use/screening/frequency of laboratory checks of biological therapy in children please refer to the instructions described for adults in the various sections. It is recommended to check the vaccination status of children (according to the national vaccination programme) before starting biological therapy.

Etanercept is recommended as an induction and maintenance therapy in children and adolescents with plaque‐type psoriasis from the age of 6 years who are inadequately controlled with use of, or are intolerant to, other systemic agents or phototherapy. Dosage is 0.8 mg kg −1 (up to 50 mg per dose) once a week.

Adalimumab is recommended as an induction therapy in children and adolescents aged 4 years and older with plaque‐type psoriasis who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapy. Long‐term safety data in children are not available. Dosage is 0.8 mg kg −1 (up to 40 mg per dose) week 0, 1 and thereafter every other week.

Ustekinumab is recommended in adolescent patients with chronic plaque‐type psoriasis from the age of 12 years whose condition is inadequately controlled with use of, or who are intolerant to, other systemic agents or phototherapy. Long‐term safety data in children are not available. The recommended dose for adolescents < 60 kg is 0.75 mg kg −1, for those with a weight ≥ 60 to ≤ 100 kg the dose is 45 mg and for patients > 100 kg the dose is 90 mg. Administration is at week 0 and 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter.

### Efficacy of adalimumab in plaque psoriasis: experience on 28 patients [^117Q26eL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease with arthritis that may occur in a percentage of patients that varies between 5% and 42%. Many systemic agents as cyclosporine, methotrexate, acitretin, and photochemotherapy have been used for the treatment of patients affected by moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis although they present side effects (ie, cumulative organ toxicity and lack of efficacy over time) that limit long-term use. Significant therapeutical improvement has been obtained introducing biological therapies, designed to modify and regulate immunological processes by targeting specific molecules involved in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis. Adalimumab is a fully human recombinant antibody against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). To date, there is not much data available on the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients affected by moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The authors report our first experience on the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in monotherapy at a dose of 40 mg every-other-week for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients with or without arthritis. Twenty-eight patients were treated for a period of 48 months. It was observed an improvement of the psoriasis condition as well as of patients' quality of life and mood state.

### Treatment satisfaction, safety and effectiveness of adding methotrexate to adalimumab in patients with psoriasis responding suboptimally to adalimumab in a real-world setting [^117SK2G3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

From 12 sites, 46 patients were enrolled: 93.5% (43 of 46) completed the study, and no patients discontinued due to an AE, consent withdrawal, or were lost to follow‐up. Their mean age (SD) was 46.5 (12.2) years, and their median duration of psoriasis (Q1, Q3) was 20.2 (13.8, 30.0) years. The majority was male (76.1%) and white (76.1%), with a mean body mass index of 32.1 (6.5) kg m –2.

At baseline as assessed by investigators and patients, respectively, no patients (0/46) and 15.2% [7 of 46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8–25.6%] reached a satisfactory response with treatment, i.e. score ≥ 4 on a 1–5 scale. At week 16, these proportions increased, respectively, to 50.0% (23 of 46; 95% CI 35.6–64.4%) and 47.8% (22 of 46; 95% CI 33.4–62.3%), reaching 56.5% (26 of 46; 95% CI 42.2–70.8%) and 54.3% (25 of 46; 95% CI 40.0–68.7%) by week 24 (Figure 1a).

Treatment effectiveness was significantly different from baseline to weeks 8, 16 and 24 (P < 0.001) (baseline PASI score = 10.4; n = 46). From weeks 8 to 24, 43.5–65.2% of patients reached a PASI 50 response, 28.3–39.1% a PASI 75 response, 13.0–28.3% a PASI 90 response, and 13.0–26.1% a PASI 100 response (Figure 1b). Patients achieving a PGA clear or minimal increased from 26.1% to 43.5% between weeks 8 and 24, which was significantly different from baseline (P < 0.001) (Figure 1c). DLQI of 0 or 1 was achieved numerically by 20% of patients at week 8, plateauing at 37% by week 16.

### Comparison of the 1-and 5-year effectiveness of adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis in daily clinical practice: results from the prospective bioCAPTURE registry [^111f9dnZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of etanercept and ustekinumab in psoriasis has been compared in one randomized controlled trial. Comparison of the long-term effectiveness of biologics in daily-practice psoriasis treatment is currently lacking.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness between the three widely used outpatient biologics adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab in daily-practice psoriasis treatment and to correct for confounders.

Methods

Data were extracted from the prospective, multicentre BioCAPTURE registry. Multilevel linear regression analyses (MLRAs) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed on the course of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and PASI 75 (≥ 75% reduction vs. baseline). Both models were corrected for confounders. Subgroup analyses for biological dose were performed.

Results

We included 356 patients with 513 treatment episodes: 178 adalimumab, 245 etanercept and 90 ustekinumab. MLRA showed a similar effectiveness between adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab after 1 year, but the highest effectiveness for ustekinumab during 5 years of treatment (P = 0.047; ustekinumab vs. etanercept, P = 0.019). GEE analysis revealed a higher chance of attaining PASI 75 with adalimumab and ustekinumab than with etanercept at 1 year of treatment. A higher than label dose was more often used in patients treated with etanercept (adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab: respectively 31.5%, 55.1% and 17% after 1 year, P < 0.001; 39.3%, 71.4% and 24% after 5 years, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Compared with etanercept, ustekinumab had the highest effectiveness during 5 years of treatment. Patients receiving adalimumab and ustekinumab more often reached PASI 75 than those on etanercept at 1 year of treatment. Dose escalation was more frequent in etanercept and adalimumab than in ustekinumab.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^116pWKDo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the mean ± SD patient body weight (51.3 ± 20.3 kg) and body mass index (BMI) (21.1 ± 4.9 kg m −2) were balanced across baseline treatment groups (MTX, ADA 0.4 mg, ADA 0.8 mg). The numbers of patients in each BMI category (based on age‐ and sex‐specific World Health Organization BMI charts) were 68 of 114 (59.6%) normal weight, 17 (14.9%) overweight and 24 (21.1%) obese; the percentages of patients within each category were also balanced across baseline treatment groups. 25

There were no trends regarding the percentages of patients achieving PASI 75 across the BMI categories of normal weight, overweight and obese: MTX(IT)/ADA 0.8(LTE), 90%, 100%, 63% (n = 21, 6, 8, respectively); ADA 0.4(IT)/ADA 0.4 or 0.8(LTE), 48%, 50%, 50% (n = 23, 4, 8, respectively); ADA 0.8(IT)/ADA 0.8(LTE), 75%, 57%, 83% (n = 20, 7, 6, respectively). The small numbers of patients in each of the overweight and obese categories limit any interpretation of these results.

Efficacy

Treatment response, measured by achievement of PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100, improved for all efficacy groups from the start of the LTE across 52 weeks of treatment (Fig. 3). At LTE week 52, PASI 75, 90 and 100 response rates for each efficacy group were higher than the corresponding rates at week 16 of the IT period. Response measured by achievement of PGA 0/1 also improved for all efficacy groups from the start of the LTE across 52 weeks of treatment, and rates at LTE week 52 for the MTX(IT)/ADA 0.8(LTE) and ADA 0.4(IT)/0.4 or 0.8(LTE) groups were higher than the corresponding rates at week 16 of the IT period (Fig. 4). Patients in the MTX(IT)/ADA 0.8(LTE) group had a higher response rate at LTE week 52 than those in the other two efficacy groups for all efficacy measures (Figs. 3 and 4).

### Long-term efficacy and safety of brodalumab in psoriasis through 120 weeks and after withdrawal and retreatment: subgroup analysis of a randomized phase III trial (AMAGINE-1) [^112tpQ1Z]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sustained skin clearance is an unmet need in patients with psoriasis, given that biological therapies have been shown to lose their effectiveness in a proportion of patients over time. 1 An analysis of long‐term persistence of adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and ustekinumab found that 67% of treatment discontinuations were caused by loss of efficacy. 2 Furthermore, analysis of an international psoriasis registry showed that lack of effectiveness was the most common reason why patients discontinued treatment with these same biologics and that second‐ and third‐line therapies had higher rates of discontinuation than first‐line therapy. 3 Many patients with psoriasis stop and restart treatment because of factors including psychological distress, dissatisfaction with treatment, inconvenience, cost, insurance problems and use of therapy only when needed. 4, 5 A recent cohort study of patients with long‐term plaque psoriasis found that, over a 12‐month period, 17.5% of patients switched biological therapies and 2.6% stopped and restarted treatment after a break of ≥ 90 days. 6 To approximate scenarios of real‐world discontinuation associated with events such as pregnancy, adherence issues or changes to insurance coverage, multiple studies have used withdrawal and retreatment periods to evaluate the potential for recapture of response following treatment and subsequent retreatment. 7, 8, 9 Therefore, inability to achieve sustained skin clearance extends to patients who withdraw from treatment and are subsequently re‐treated with the same or a different agent. In contemplating long‐term psoriasis therapy (i.e. ≥ 1 year), patients require both sustained symptom control and safety with prolonged use, highlighting the importance of long‐term studies.

Studies have reported efficacy of the interleukin (IL)‐12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab and the IL‐17A inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab for skin clearance in psoriasis over 2–4 years of follow‐up. 10, 11, 12 Among 517 patients who received ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg, some of whom were withdrawn from therapy at week 40 and were later re‐treated, 63.4% and 72.0%, respectively, achieved 75% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 244, 21.6% and 26.4%, respectively, achieved PASI 100, and 42.5% and 51.0%, respectively, achieved a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 244. 12

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116FQfwR]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Serum trough level and detection of antidrug antibodies (2017)

The serum trough level of a biologic depends on many factors, among which are dose and dose frequency, treatment adherence, disease activity, antibody formation and comedication with immunosuppressants. The extent to which the presence or absence of antibodies and the drug serum concentrations correlate to the clinical response depends on the type of biologic and needs further exploration.

At the moment a correlation between trough level concentration and clinical effect has only been demonstrated for adalimumab. 17 A therapeutic algorithm based on serum trough levels has potential to improve adalimumab therapy, but no prospective studies have been performed yet.

Recommendations

It may be useful to determine adalimumab serum trough levels before altering the frequency of administration or stop/switch therapy. A low serum trough level concentration can be caused by antidrug antibodies. The optimal serum trough concentration has been established for adalimumab (3.51–7.00 mg L −1). 18 Measurement of only antidrug antibodies provides limited information.

Biosimilars (2017)

Currently approved biosimilars are available for infliximab (Remsima™, Celltrion Healthcare, Budapest, Hungary; Inflectra™, Hospira, Maidenhead, U.K.; and Flixabi ®, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, U.S. A.) and for etanercept (Benepali, ® Biogen, Cambridge, MA, U.S. A.; and Erelzi, Novartis Pharma AG, Stein, Switzerland).

Recommendations There are no major objections to starting a registered biosimilar for patients eligible for biological therapy. It is recommended that patients be included in a registry to monitor efficacy and safety. Substitution of a biologic with a biosimilar in patients who are responding well is not recommended, but the decision to switch to a biosimilar in these patients is reserved for the physician and patient. Physicians should take into consideration that long‐term safety data for biosimilars are limited.

It is possible for patients who discontinue a biological therapy (for example for more than 6 months) to restart with a biosimilar. In the case of switching to a biosimilar, it is recommended to administer the first dose of the biosimilar when the old reference product was supposed to be re‐administered and not before, as the old drug may still be partially present in the body, which makes it impossible to attribute side‐effects to either of the two drugs. These recommendations are in line with the Dutch national guideline on biosimilars. 19

### Extent and consequences of antibody formation against adalimumab in patients with psoriasis: one-year follow-up [^11237sxD]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

In a previously reported cohort of 29 patients with plaque-type psoriasis followed up for 24 weeks, clinically relevant antidrug antibody (ADA) to adalimumab was frequently found. Long-term data were lacking. We now present the extension of this study: 80 patients followed up for 1 year.

Objectives

To assess the extent of ADA and its clinical consequences after 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment for psoriasis in a cohort of 80 patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter cohort study, performed in the outpatient dermatology clinic of 2 academic hospitals, included 80 sequential patients receiving adalimumab therapy for plaque-type psoriasis and had a follow-up of 1 year. Outcome assessors were not aware of the presence of antibodies to adalimumab or the adalimumab serum concentration when assessing patients' Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and personnel analyzing serum samples were blinded to patients' PASI.

Interventions

For 80 patients treated with adalimumab for psoriasis, disease severity (PASI) was assessed, blood samples were collected, and adalimumab and ADA concentrations was determined at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, and 52.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient PASI and adalimumab and ADA concentrations.

Results

Antidrug antibody formed in 49% of patients, before week 24 in 90% of them. Adalimumab and ADA concentrations, clinical response and ADA concentration, and adalimumab concentration and clinical response had correlations of -0.872, -0.606, and 0.519, respectively. The adalimumab dose interval was shortened because of lack of efficacy in 15 patients, 7 with and 8 without ADA; improvement in responder status occurred in 1 of 7 and 4 of 8, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with no ADA formation in the first 24 weeks of treatment have little chance of it in the following 24 weeks. The presence of ADA is strongly correlated with adalimumab concentration and greatly influences clinical response. If ADA is present, dose interval shortening is less useful.

### Defining the therapeutic range for adalimumab and predicting response in psoriasis: a multicenter prospective observational cohort study [^114wApUV]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biologic therapies have transformed the treatment paradigm in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). Complete disease remission is now achievable in people with psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) remains the first-line biologic strategy. However, there are wide variations in response, with a significant number of patients not responding (primary treatment failure) or losing response over time (secondary treatment failure). Some of this heterogeneity may be explained by differences in the amount of drug available at the target tissue, which in turn is influenced by adherence and pharmacokinetic covariates such as weight and drug immunogenicity (formation of antidrug antibodies [ADAs]). Therapeutic drug monitoring using measurement of serum drug levels (a proxy for tissue levels) and/or ADAs thus holds potential to optimize management, and a strong correlation between TNF inhibitor serum trough levels, ADAs, and treatment response has been described in IBD, RA, and psoriasis. Indeed, a recent study using adalimumab clinical trial data in 1,212 psoriasis patients reported that responders at 16 weeks had higher adalimumab concentrations than nonresponders (6.3 vs. 2.2 μg/ml). Bodyweight was a significant covariate in the pharmacokinetic model, and the presence of ADAs resulted in lower adalimumab exposure and efficacy.

### Biosimilars for the treatment of psoriasis [^116gWeTH]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Biosimilars are biological products that are very similar to their originators, with no meaningful differences in terms of efficacy, safety, and purity. Since the patents of some of the biologics used to treat patients with psoriasis have expired, uptake of biosimilars provides a good opportunity to reduce the cost of treatment. Areas covered: In this review we summarize the stages in development of a biosimilar product, the main differences with the originator biologic, and their potential implications. We have also reviewed clinical trials of biosimilars approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Expert opinion: Because of efficacy and convenience of administration, adalimumab biosimilars will be used to greater extent than etanercept or infliximab to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of approved biosimilars are equivalent to those of their reference products in clinical trials, and multiple-switch studies are intended to provide evidence in support of FDA-required interchangeability. Non-medical switching is expected to become frequent, and the nocebo effect will be relevant. Traceability of biologics is an essential requirement to gather relevant information on their long-term efficacy and safety, especially when multiple switches occur.

Patients unresponsive to MTX in the IT period who at the end of that period were transitioned directly to the LTE to receive open‐label ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 experienced improved treatment response as measured by PASI 75 and PASI 90 as early as 4 weeks after switching to ADA, and generally maintained the respective level of response through the rest of the LTE (Fig. 6 a). The PASI 100 response rate for these patients also improved starting at LTE week 4, and continued to improve to the end of the period (Fig. 6 a). The PGA 0/1 response rate improved from weeks 1 to 11 and then slightly decreased by the end of the period (Fig. 6 b).

### Clinical response to adalimumab treatment in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis: double-blind, randomized controlled trial and open-label extension study [^1159QxFN]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tumor necrosis factor is pivotal in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that neutralizes tumor necrosis factor.

Objectives

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 147 patients received adalimumab (40 mg every other week or 40 mg/wk) or placebo. After 12 weeks of blinded therapy, patients taking adalimumab could continue their assigned dosages in a 48-week extension trial; patients taking placebo were switched to adalimumab (40 mg every other week).

Results

At week 12, 53% of patients taking adalimumab every other week, 80% of patients taking adalimumab weekly, and 4% of patients taking placebo achieved 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (P < .001). Responses were sustained for 60 weeks. No new safety signals were noted compared with the existing adalimumab clinical safety database.

Limitations

The study was insufficiently powered to detect rare adverse events associated with adalimumab.

Conclusions

Adalimumab significantly improved psoriasis and was well tolerated for 60 weeks.

### Sustained long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab in paediatric patients with severe chronic plaque psoriasis from a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^112yS1ty]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Evaluations

In the LTE, efficacy was summarized for three patient groups, defined according to their initial randomized dose in the IT period and the dose received in the LTE: MTX (IT)/ADA 0.8 (LTE); ADA 0.4 (IT)/0.4 or 0.8 (LTE); and ADA 0.8 (IT)/0.8 (LTE). Given the study design, LTE dosing was complex; the majority of patients received ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 (open label or blinded) at the start of or during the LTE, and as continued treatment from the retreatment period or after switching from treatment withdrawal or from ADA 0.4 mg kg −1 during the LTE. For this reason, we report results for all patients who entered the LTE, despite how, when or whether they received ADA 0.8 mg kg −1.

Other LTE evaluations included the CDLQI and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Absolute PASI values at score categories ≤ 5 and ≤ 3 were analysed post hoc across the IT period and the LTE. Safety was evaluated by treatment‐emergent adverse events. Efficacy and safety were also evaluated for the subgroup of patients who failed MTX treatment in the IT period and were switched to ADA 0.8 mg kg −1 in the LTE.

Statistical analysis

Efficacy was evaluated for all randomized patients (intention‐to‐treat population) in the IT period (n = 114); the statistical analysis and results have been reported previously. 25 In the LTE, the intention‐to‐treat population included all patients who entered the LTE (n = 108). Missing data were imputed using nonresponder imputation for dichotomous efficacy end points and last observation carried forward for continuous end points. The safety population consisted of all who received at least one dose of study medication in the trial. As the majority (92.6%, 100 of 108) of patients received ADA during the LTE, no statistical comparisons among efficacy groups were performed in the LTE.

Tuberculosis (TB) risk and screening with TNF inhibitors — reactivation of TB has been associated with TNF inhibitors, with numerous cases across "all 3 TNF inhibitors" and an increased incidence of extrapulmonary or disseminated TB; while etanercept carries an increased reactivation risk compared to the general population, it is "likely to be less frequent than with infliximab or adalimumab". The FDA recommends TB screening "with a purified protein derivation" for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends such screening for all patients on TNF inhibitors, with high-risk individuals carefully screened at appropriate intervals.

### What's new in psoriasis treatment? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2015 [^1177zvLc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

This review provides a summary of key findings from 27 systematic reviews of 51 articles first published or indexed during 2015, focusing on the treatment of psoriasis and on precision medicine in psoriasis. The evidence supports weight-loss interventions by dieting and exercise for improvement in disease severity in overweight and obese patients with psoriasis. No significant increased risk of serious infections was reported for the biologic therapies adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab compared with appropriate comparators. Evidence could not provide reliable estimates of rare adverse events, emphasizing the need for large prospective registries. Polymorphisms in the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α gene may confer improved responses to TNF inhibitor (TNFI) therapy, but the studies to date lack power to detect a true association. From the limited available evidence, multidisciplinary management is both more effective and more satisfactory for patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis than conventional consultations. This summary of reviews provides a succinct guide for clinicians and patients wishing to remain up to date with high-quality evidence for the treatment of psoriasis.

### An evolution in switching therapy for psoriasis patients who fail to meet treatment goals [^116qoJ47]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Need for a washout period

Recommendations differ on the need for a washout period when switching from one biologic to another. The 2009 British Association of Dermatologists guidelines recommend not to overlap biologic therapies and to have a washout period of 4 times the drug's half‐life between therapies 6. However, there are no data available to support this recommendation 50, and a more recent consensus from the Progressive Psoriasis Initiative (PPI) 12 questions the value of a long washout period between treatments. The PPI consensus 12 stated that the risk for psoriasis flares is generally greater than the risk for any adverse effects associated with overlapping biologic therapies. While a theoretical risk for increased susceptibility to infection has been proposed if washout time is not adequate between biologic therapies, data supporting such a risk are minimal 50.

Further, consensus from the Transitioning Therapies program 18 recommends against a washout period unless a safety concern arose with the previous therapy that needs to resolve before initiating a new treatment. Instead, the new biologic should be initiated when the next dose of the previous biologic is due 18. Special consideration may be required when transitioning from ustekinumab to another biologic because ustekinumab maintenance doses are only given every 8–12 weeks. If psoriasis signs and symptoms are poorly controlled, administration of a different biologic 2–4 weeks after the last dose of ustekinumab can be considered 18.

Demographic characteristics

Certain patient demographic and clinical characteristics should be considered when selecting therapies that will minimize treatment failure. For example, overweight and obese patients may have better outcomes with infliximab or ustekinumab than with other biologics because dosing for these agents is based on body weight 20, 23, 51. Gender may also affect the pharmacokinetic properties of different biologics. It has been observed that adalimumab has a shorter half‐life in female versus male patients 47 and that male gender was associated with a reduced likelihood for infliximab treatment failure 51.

Patients with high levels of C‐reactive protein and low levels of albumin (markers for inflammation) may have accelerated drug clearance due to increased reticuloendothelial system‐mediated drug catabolism 47. Genetic heterogeneity and polymorphisms are also assumed to cause differences in drug metabolism that likely determine why some patients fail to respond to one biologic but may respond to others 20. However, until these characteristics are better understood, routine genetic testing is not recommended when determining psoriasis treatment strategies and goals 20.

6.2 Immunogenicity

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other adalimumab products may be misleading.

There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were < 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2.

Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Patients in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12- month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown.

### Persistence of treatment with biologics for patients with psoriasis: a real-world analysis of 16 545 biologic-naïve patients from the French national health insurance database (SNIIRAM) [^111o4EFs]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-term clinical effectiveness of biologics in psoriasis is needed.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the long-term persistence of biologics used to treat psoriasis in a real-life setting.

Methods

All adults with psoriasis having been registered in the French National Health Insurance database (SNIIRAM) between 2008 and 2016 were eligible for inclusion. Psoriasis was defined as the fulfilment of at least two prescriptions for topical formulations of a vitamin D derivative within a 2-year period. The study population comprised biologic-naïve patients, i.e. those with a first prescription of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab or ustekinumab. Persistence of treatment with a biologic was defined as the time interval between initiation and discontinuation.

Results

In this nationwide population-based cohort, 16 545 out of 874 549 patients with psoriasis were biologic-naïve (mean age 48.6 years; males 57.3%, mean follow-up 3.6 years). The mean ± SD length of follow-up for biologic-naïve patients was 3.6 ± 2.4 years. There were 9988 treatment discontinuations. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed a persistence rate of 61.9% for the first, 33.3% for the third and 22.6% for the fifth year. Ustekinumab had a higher persistence rate than the other biologics. This finding should be interpreted with caution, in view of differences in administration between the biologics. About 85% of patients, having discontinued their first biologic, resumed systemic treatment of some type in the following year (biologics in 85% of cases).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that biologics are less effective than physicians have been led to believe in a real-life, nonselected population. Further, long-term disease control requires several courses of different biologics.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^113bJXV2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Malignancy risk in psoriasis — severity was associated with higher standardized incidence ratios (SIRs): for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) SIR 3.72 vs 7.08; melanoma in severe disease significantly increased (11.01, 95% CI 1.55–78.16); and lymphoma 2.3 (95% CI 1.15–4.60). A review of 198,336 psoriasis patients and 937,716 matched controls found associations with lymphoma (aHR 1.34), NMSC (aHR 1.12), and lung cancer (aHR 1.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 37 observational studies reported increased rates of several cancers. In a systematic review of 23,458 patients in 71 clinical trials of adalimumab, no significant increase was found in cancers collectively (SIR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65–1.36), but NMSC increased (1.76, 1.26–2.39). A meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials of 6810 psoriatic patients treated with short-term TNFi found no increase in the OR of malignancy, and a review of 13 randomized clinical trials including 3010 psoriatic patients treated with adalimumab lasted up to 5 years.

### Patient-reported reasons for the discontinuation of commonly used treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis [^115TLMMJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Despite widespread dissatisfaction and low treatment persistence in moderate to severe psoriasis, patients' reasons behind treatment discontinuation remain poorly understood.

Objectives

We sought to characterize patient-reported reasons for discontinuing commonly used treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis in real-world clinical practice.

Methods

A total of 1095 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis from 10 dermatology practices who received systemic treatments completed a structured interview. Eleven reasons for treatment discontinuation were assessed for all past treatments.

Results

A total of 2231 past treatments were reported. Median treatment duration varied by treatment, ranging from 6.0 to 20.5 months (P < .001). The frequency of each cited discontinuation reasons differed by treatment (all P < .01). Patients who received etanercept (odds ratio [OR] 5.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.23–8.33) and adalimumab (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.20–3.67) were more likely to cite a loss of efficacy than those who received methotrexate. Patients who received etanercept (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.23–0.49), adalimumab (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.30–0.75), and ultraviolet B phototherapy (OR 0.21; 95% CI 0.14–0.31) were less likely to cite side effects than those who received methotrexate, whereas those who received acitretin (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.08–2.25) were more likely to do so. Patients who underwent ultraviolet B phototherapy were more likely to cite an inability to afford treatment (OR 7.03; 95% CI 3.14–15.72).

Limitations

The study is limited by its reliance on patient recall.

Conclusions

Different patterns of treatment discontinuation reasons are important to consider when developing public policy and evidence-based treatment approaches to improve successful long-term psoriasis control.

### Drug survival associated with effectiveness and safety of treatment with guselkumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab in patients with psoriasis [^1151hLFo]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Drug survival of biologic therapies for psoriasis is a proxy for longer-term treatment effectiveness and safety. Patient factors that are associated with the survival of each biologic differently (effect modifiers) may inform the decision to choose between biologics.

Objective

To assess the drug survival associated with the effectiveness and safety of commonly used biologics for psoriasis in the UK and Ireland and identify effect modifiers for these biologics and their survival.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with psoriasis using data from the British Association of Dermatologists Biologics and Immunomodulators Register (BADBIR) between November 2007 and August 2021.

Exposures

Adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, ixekizumab.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We conducted a survival analysis and fitted separate flexible parametric models for drug survival as a proxy for effectiveness and safety.

Results

A total of 16 122 treatment courses were included: 6607 (41.0%) in which treatment with adalimumab was initiated, 5405 (33.5%) with ustekinumab, 2677 (16.6%) with secukinumab, 730 (4.5%) with guselkumab, and 703 (4.4%) with ixekizumab. The crude survival functions at year 1 for measures of effectiveness for treatment with adalimumab was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.80–0.82), 0.89 for ustekinumab (95% CI, 0.88–0.89), 0.86 for secukinumab (95% CI, 0.85–0.87), 0.94 for guselkumab (95% CI, 0.92–0.96), and 0.86 for ixekizumab (95% CI, 0.83–0.89). The adjusted survival curves from the multivariable model for effectiveness showed that treatment with guselkumab had the higher survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.56) and adalimumab had the lower survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.03–2.76) compared with ustekinumab. Secukinumab and ixekizumab had similar survival curves over time. Psoriatic arthritis, previous biologic exposure, nail involvement, and ethnicity were effect modifiers for survival in association with treatment effectiveness. The crude survival functions at year 1 for safety were 0.91 for treatment with adalimumab (95% CI, 0.90–0.91), 0.94 for ustekinumab (95% CI, 0.94–0.95), 0.94 for secukinumab (95% CI, 0.92–0.94), 0.96 for guselkumab (95% CI, 0.94–0.98), and 0.92 for ixekizumab (95% CI, 0.89–0.94). Guselkumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab had similar adjusted survival curves for safety, while adalimumab (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.46–1.89) and ixekizumab (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13–2.03) had lower survival compared with ustekinumab.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that guselkumab had the highest drug survival in BADBIR of the included biologics for treatment persistence that was associated with effectiveness, and guselkumab had highest drug survival for safety compared with other biologics except ustekinumab. Psoriatic arthritis, nail involvement, previous biologic exposure, and ethnicity were effect modifiers for biologics and their survival in association with treatment effectiveness. This information on longer-term treatment persistence, safety, and tolerability may help patients and their clinicians make an informed decision to initiate treatment with a biologic therapy.

### An open-label, prospective cohort pilot study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in patients who have not had an adequate response to adalimumab [^1166QaUA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The past several years have seen the approval of five different biologic agents for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in the United States and Canada. Psoriasis has proven to be a difficult disease to treat and treatment failures, even with newer biologic therapies, are not uncommon. The vast majority of clinical data for these medications is derived from treatment of biologic-naive patients, or patients who have not responded to, or lost response to, or not tolerated systemic therapy for psoriasis. There is currently little data available on therapeutic response of a second biologic therapy after loss of response, or no response, to the first biologic therapy initiated. It has become common clinical practice to switch medications that are structurally distinct but therapeutically similar in order to achieve an improved clinical outcome. Therapeutic interchange now is being applied to the biologic agents used to treat psoriasis.

Objectives

Using a proof of concept study, describe the response of etanercept after adalimumab has failed to produce a satisfactory response in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

A total of 10 biologically naive patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who were initiated on adalimumab for at least 12 weeks but had a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of mild or worse were transitioned to commercial etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 weeks followed by a dose reduction to 50 mg once weekly (OW) for an additional 12 weeks. Ethics approval was obtained and the study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00833729). The primary outcome measured was the mean change in Physician?s Global Assessment (PGA) score (range 0–5) from baseline (when the first etanercept injection is given) to 12 weeks of etanercept therapy. The secondary outcomes measures included the mean change in Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI), mean change in body surface area (BSA) covered in psoriasis, Subject's Global Assessment of disease (SGA), proportion of patients achieving an improvement in PGA score from baseline to 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks and safety.

Results

Overall, there were significant favorable changes in all outcomes measured (PGA, SGA, BSA and DLQI) with respect to etanercept's efficacy after an inadequate response to at least 12 weeks of adalimumab therapy. There were no significant safety issues noted especially during the transition period from adalimumab to etanercept. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00833729.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^112hCuxi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis — biologic therapy recommendations and dosing detail the following: Etanercept is recommended as an effective therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis in children 6 years of age and older, with dosing typically once weekly administered subcutaneously at 0.8 mg/kg with a maximum of 50 mg weekly. Adalimumab is recommended for off-label use as an effective therapy in children and adolescents with moderate to severe psoriasis; the dose of adalimumab is 0.8 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) at weeks 0 and 1 and then is given every other week, and adalimumab administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg is more efficacious than at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. Infliximab can be recommended as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for pediatric patients with severe plaque or pustular psoriasis that is unresponsive to other systemic medications, rapidly progressive, unstable, and/or life threatening, with a starting dose of an infusion of 5 mg/kg administered on weeks 0, 2, and 6 and then every 8 weeks. Ustekinumab is recommended as an effective therapy for adolescents 12 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and can be used for pediatric patients younger than 12 years old with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis; ustekinumab is given at weeks 0, 4, and 16 and then every 12 weeks with weight-based dosing as follows: 0.75 mg/kg if < 60 kg, 45 mg if 60 to ≤ 100 kg, 90 mg if > 100 kg. Biologics may be safely combined with topical corticosteroids, with or without a vitamin D analogue, to augment effectiveness for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and the major risk for biologics in children is injection site reaction, but patients should be monitored for their increased risk of infection.

Infections: bacterial, viral, and mycobacterial — tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors carry an increased infection risk, with upper respiratory tract infections most common, and rare opportunistic infections reported more often with infliximab or adalimumab than with etanercept; careful monitoring and early evaluation is critical. In the event of an infection requiring antibiotics, "the TNF inhibitor should be withheld" and for more serious or opportunistic infections "the TNF inhibitor should be discontinued", and "treatment with TNF inhibitors should be avoided if possible in patients with chronic, serious, or recurring infections".

### An evolution in switching therapy for psoriasis patients who fail to meet treatment goals [^116EQcET]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

TNFα ADAs do not cross‐react; thus, antibodies to one drug do not predict ADA formation to a different TNFα inhibitor 37. In rheumatoid arthritis, switching to etanercept from infliximab or adalimumab has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ADAs 37.

A lack of ADAs in nonresponders with adequate serum drug concentration may indicate that a patient did not respond to the drug's mechanism of action 49. Thus, a nonresponsive patient without ADAs to one TNFα inhibitor may be unlikely to respond to a different TNFα inhibitor 49.

Serum drug levels may provide more insight than ADA levels when trying to determine possible reasons for treatment failure and whether switching is warranted 49. If a nonresponder has a low trough serum drug concentration, treatment intensification can be considered before switching therapies, whereas if a nonresponder has a high serum drug concentration, switching to another agent (with the same or different mechanism of action) should be considered. In addition, measuring serum levels of certain biologics early in the course of treatment can provide insight into long‐term outcomes. In a cohort of 56 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis initially treated with adalimumab or etanercept, Mahil et al. 47 found that serum adalimumab concentration at 4 weeks was predictive of treatment response at 6 months; however, serum etanercept levels at 4 weeks were not associated with response at 6 months.

### Efficacy of secukinumab and adalimumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis and concomitant moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: results from EXCEED, a randomized, double-blind head-to-head monotherapy study [^116RNpmU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 853 patients were randomized to receive secukinumab (N = 426) or adalimumab (N = 427) in the study; at baseline, there were 211 patients in the psoriasis subset [secukinumab (N = 110) and adalimumab (N = 101)]. Up to week 50, a total of six of 110 (5.5%) patients had discontinued treatment in the secukinumab group vs. 18 of 101 (17.8%) patients in the adalimumab group in the psoriasis subset. The major reasons for discontinuation of secukinumab vs. adalimumab treatment were lack of efficacy [one of 110 (0.9%) vs. seven of 101 (6.9%)] and patient/guardian decision [four of 110 (3.6%) vs. six of 101 (5.9%)] (Figure 1). The analysis of patients in the psoriasis subset for time to study treatment discontinuation (Kaplan–Meier curve) indicated that a higher proportion of patients were being retained for a longer period for secukinumab than adalimumab treatment until last dosing visit at week 50 (P = 0.0005) (Figure 2).
