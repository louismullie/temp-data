## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a "REFLEX SLIDE REVIEW" on a peripheral blood smear means and how to interpret the reported findings of anisocytosis and target cells with otherwise normal platelet morphology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "reflex" means in laboratory medicine and how it applies to smear review. Then, I should verify what a slide review entails and who performs it. Next, I will interpret the specific morphologic findings and their clinical implications. After that, I should consider the role of the automated CBC in triggering the reflex and how laboratories optimize review criteria. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful interpretation and note any limitations or next steps that might be needed.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "reflex" in this context. In laboratory medicine, reflex testing refers to an automatic downstream action triggered by predefined criteria in the initial test, so that additional testing is performed on the same specimen without a separate order, which improves efficiency and reduces loss to follow-up. Here, the reflex is a manual peripheral blood smear review triggered by abnormal automated CBC parameters or instrument flags, rather than a clinician's explicit order for a smear [^11358bsK] [^112DwmKk] [^1146p3dU] [^112JaYDv].

> Wait, let me verify what "slide review" actually entails. A peripheral blood smear review is a manual microscopic examination of a Wright-Giemsa–stained blood film to assess red cell, white cell, and platelet morphology, typically performed by a medical laboratory scientist or pathologist; it is a core hematology competency and is often used to validate or clarify automated flags, with digital whole-slide imaging increasingly used for training and remote review, though high-magnification detail can be limited in some digital systems [^114oVbFu] [^1159iutE] [^113BURL8].

> I will now examine the reported findings. Anisocytosis 2+ indicates moderate variation in red cell size, and target cells 2+ indicates moderate numbers of codocytes. Both are abnormal morphologies that the instrument cannot reliably quantify and thus commonly trigger a reflex smear review, whereas the note that platelet morphology appears normal suggests no qualitative platelet abnormalities were identified on the smear [^112mPFoX] [^112JaYDv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what these RBC findings mean clinically. Anisocytosis reflects size heterogeneity and is nonspecific, while target cells classically suggest disorders of hemoglobin synthesis, liver disease, or altered membrane cholesterol, but I should confirm that the smear did not show other features like microcytosis, macrocytosis, basophilic stippling, or polychromasia that would refine the differential. In the absence of such additional cues, these findings alone are suggestive but not diagnostic and should be correlated with indices, reticulocyte count, iron studies, liver tests, and clinical context [^112mPFoX].

> Next, I should review why the reflex was triggered. Automated hematology analyzers flag samples for manual review based on instrument algorithms that detect distributional or morphologic abnormalities; laboratories can optimize these flagging thresholds to balance sensitivity and workload, and many have moved from blanket reflex differentials to targeted validation strategies that reduce unnecessary manual reviews without missing significant disease, which explains why a smear may be triggered for RBC morphology while the differential remains automated if WBC flags are absent [^112BEEvY] [^113BURL8] [^113M4R2U].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and limitations. The presence of anisocytosis and target cells should prompt me to check MCV/MCHC, RDW, reticulocyte index, iron studies, hemoglobin electrophoresis if indicated, and liver function tests, while remembering that the smear did not identify dysplasia, blasts, schistocytes, malaria or babesia, or qualitative platelet disorders; if the clinical picture suggests hemolysis, I should double-check for hemolytic features and consider a direct antiglobulin test, and if liver disease is suspected, I should correlate with ALT, AST, and bilirubin before attributing the morphology to hepatic causes [^112mPFoX].

> But wait, what if the automated platelet count was low or the histogram was abnormal? The report notes platelet morphology appears normal, but I should confirm whether a fluorescent platelet count or other confirmatory method was used when the primary count is discordant or the size histogram is skewed, since many modern analyzers automatically perform alternate platelet counting in such scenarios; if the smear truly shows normal morphology and adequate numbers, that supports confidence in the platelet result [^112mppvN].

> In summary, I need to ensure the interpretation is precise. "REFLEX SLIDE REVIEW" means the laboratory automatically performed a manual peripheral smear because the automated CBC met predefined reflex criteria, typically related to RBC morphology flags; the reported anisocytosis and target cells indicate moderate red cell size variation and codocyte formation, which are abnormal but nonspecific and require correlation with indices, reticulocyte response, iron studies, hemoglobin analysis, and liver tests to determine etiology, while the normal platelet morphology on smear supports no qualitative platelet disorder identified in this review [^11358bsK] [^112JaYDv] [^112mPFoX].

---

The "REFLEX SLIDE REVIEW" means the lab **automatically performed a manual smear** [^113M4R2U] because the automated CBC flagged abnormal RBC morphology — specifically anisocytosis (2+) and target cells (2+) — prompting expert review to confirm and characterize these findings [^112JaYDv]. The smear also confirmed normal platelet morphology. This reflex ensures **accurate morphology assessment** and timely clinical decision-making when automated flags detect potential disease [^116ggwmh].

---

## Definition and purpose of reflex slide review

- **Definition**: Reflex slide review is an automatic manual smear triggered by predefined abnormal automated CBC flags, requiring no separate order [^112BEEvY].

- **Purpose**: It provides expert confirmation and characterization of flagged abnormalities, supporting accurate diagnosis and management [^116MKNmv].

---

## Clinical significance of reported findings

| **Finding** | **Clinical significance** | **Potential underlying conditions** |
|-|-|-|
| Anisocytosis (2+) | Indicates moderate RBC size variation, often due to mixed populations or dyserythropoiesis | - Iron deficiency <br/> - Vitamin B12/folate deficiency <br/> - Hemolytic anemia <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndromes [^notfound] |
| Target cells (2+) | RBCs with central pallor suggest membrane/cytoskeletal defects or altered cholesterol | - Liver disease <br/> - Thalassemia <br/> - Hemoglobinopathies <br/> - Post-splenectomy states [^112mPFoX] |
| Normal platelet morphology | Platelets appear normal in size, shape, and granulation | - No platelet disorder suggested |

---

## Clinical implications and recommended actions

- **Confirmatory testing**: Consider iron studies, vitamin B12/folate, hemolysis labs, liver function tests, and hemoglobin electrophoresis to define etiology [^notfound].

- **Clinical correlation**: Integrate history, exam, and labs to guide further evaluation and management [^114oVbFu].

- **Follow-up**: Repeat CBC and smear to monitor progression or response to therapy [^111UQPvD].

---

## Laboratory protocols and quality assurance

- **Automated flags**: Instruments flag abnormal morphology based on RBC indices and histograms, triggering reflex smear review [^112BEEvY].

- **Manual review**: Trained personnel confirm and quantify abnormalities, ensuring accuracy and clinical relevance [^117LKKRy].

- **Quality assurance**: Labs validate criteria and monitor performance to balance sensitivity and workload [^113M4R2U].

---

## Conclusion

The reflex slide review confirms moderate anisocytosis and target cells, indicating RBC membrane/cytoskeletal or hemoglobin defects, and normal platelet morphology. This reflex ensures **accurate morphology assessment** and timely clinical decision-making when automated flags detect potential disease [^112BEEvY].

### Measuring the clinical impact of pathologist reviews of blood and body fluid smears [^116MKNmv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Despite the widespread practice of pathologist review of blood and body fluid smears, little is known about its impact on improving patient care.

Objective

To assess the clinical usefulness of pathologist review of blood and body fluid smears.

Design

Survey study. Pathology residents contacted the ordering physician after pathologist reviews were reported to assess their clinical impact.

Results

Ninety-six pathologist reviews met criteria for study inclusion, and 64 ordering physicians were successfully contacted during the 2-month study period. Of the 64 cases, 19 reviews (30%) had been seen by the physician within 24 to 48 hours after the report was issued and 33 (51%) had not been seen; in 4 (6%) instances, physicians did not remember whether they had seen the review. Eight reviews (13%) were considered urgent enough to warrant immediate communication by the pathologist. Of the 27 reviews that were seen or directly communicated, 23 (85%) contributed to clinical diagnosis and/or patient management.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the contribution of pathologist reviews of blood and body fluids to clinical diagnosis and patient management. The results also highlight the problem of a lack of physician awareness of clinical pathology results.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^111HyVKR]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the remarkable progress in therapeutics for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that cure over 95% of those treated, few countries globally are on track to meet the ambitious targets of the World Health Organization to eliminate HCV as a public health threat by the year 2030. DAAs have ensured that almost all who initiate treatment are cured, but the challenges to achieving elimination lie further upstream in the cascade of care with initial diagnosis and subsequent linkage to care and treatment.

Diagnosis of HCV infection remains relatively complex due to the multistep process involved. Current paradigms require an initial test for HCV antibodies that confirms exposure to the virus but does not indicate whether infection is current, followed by a second test to confirm active infection. Most often, the follow-up assay tests for HCV RNA in the blood as an indicator of current, ongoing infection. For individuals 'accessing care, this process can be challenging.

Each test requires a visit to a provider, and unless reflex testing for HCV RNA is performed on the original blood sample, a follow-up at a laboratory to have more blood taken, a subsequent visit to receive results, which may take many days or even weeks to arrive, and only then can a discussion about HCV treatment begin. Many people get lost to follow-up along the way; particularly when HCV is not a major priority due to its relative lack of symptoms and slow progression. Additionally, barriers such as poor venous access due to past injection drug use as well as competing priorities that are more time-sensitive in the marginalized populations that are disproportionately affected by HCV, may compound loss to follow-up. This multistep process is also particularly problematic in rural or remote regions and in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where access to providers and laboratories may be limited, further lengthening timelines.

In this review, considerations of what would be required to simplify this process to allow for a reliable diagnosis of HCV infection with a single step are explored. While there is not a current solution to this problem, there are some promising developments that may make a single-step diagnosis feasible, a key step toward advancing HCV elimination efforts.

### A regional centralized microbiology service in calgary for the rapid diagnosis of malaria [^111SD74Q]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

A regional centralized laboratory service for the rapid diagnosis of malaria was implemented 3 years ago in May 1999 within the Division of Microbiology, Calgary Laboratory Services.

Objective

To describe the design and performance of this unique microbiology laboratory service.

Design

Blood specimens must arrive at the central laboratory within 2 hours of collection. Thin blood smears are read and reported from suspected acute cases within 1 hour of receipt, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, by trained and experienced microbiology technologists. All positive malaria smears are reviewed by a medical microbiologist and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction at a reference laboratory.

Setting

Calgary Laboratory Services provides integrated laboratory services to the Calgary Health Region, an urban area of more than 1 million people.

Main Outcome Measures

Performance of the service has been continuously monitored by measuring preanalytic and analytic test turnaround times, test accuracy, clinical relevance, and the results of proficiency testing.

Results

More than 90% of blood specimens for malaria from community locations have consistently arrived within 2 hours of collection, and hospitals have reached this target within the past year. Although polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive at detecting the presence of malaria, the expert microscopists were as accurate at determining the type of Plasmodium infection. More than 95% of all positive smear results are consistently reported within 2 hours of receipt of a blood specimen.

Conclusions

Implementation of a regional centralized microbiology service has improved our ability to make a rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria in this region.

### Rapid presumptive diagnosis of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome by peripheral blood smear review [^115Vzmnc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a rare but frequently lethal acute zoonotic viral infection in rural North America. The rapidity of progression from febrile prodrome to cardiogenic shock and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema requiring intensive care creates high diagnostic urgency and a need for a rapid screening tool. In this retrospective cohort study, 2 pathologists scored blinded peripheral blood smears from 52 patients with HCPS and 128 seronegative patients referred for diagnosis of suspected hantavirus infection. During the prodromal phase, thrombocytopenia was the only consistent abnormality and could be used to indicate hantavirus serologic testing. After the onset of pulmonary edema detected radiographically, the presence of 4 of 5 findings (thrombocytopenia, myelocytosis, hemoconcentration, lack of significant toxic granulation in neutrophils, and more than 10% of lymphocytes with immunoblastic morphologic features) has a sensitivity for HCPS of 96% and a specificity of 99% and missed no patients with HCPS who required intensive care. While each abnormality is commonly seen, the combination of at least 4 of these CBC count data and peripheral blood smear findings can guide early treatment and patient transport decisions until rapid, specific, serologic testing becomes widely available.

### Prediction of good neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^117HGohx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Interventions (Index tests)

This review includes prognostic accuracy studies. In these studies, sensitivity and specificity measure how well the results of an index test correctly identifies patients who will subsequently develop or not develop the target condition, respectively. Four types of index tests were assessed: clinical examination, biomarkers, electrophysiology, and neuroimaging. These predictor categories are defined in the Appendix 1 of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).

For assessment of prognostic accuracy, in the previous review we considered an abnormal result of the index test indicating a likely poor outcome as a positive result. In the present review, we considered the test results indicating a likely good outcome as a positive result. For predictors whose results are expressed as a continuous variable in a spectrum of values, e.g. the blood values of a biomarker, this usually corresponds to test values within the normal range; for predictors whose results are expressed as a categorical variable, e.g. the presence of specific EEG patterns, this corresponds to the result categories that are closer to normality. We did not include in this review the predictors whose results are dichotomised in only two categories, e.g. present vs. absent pupillary light reflex, because their accuracy for prediction of good outcome corresponds to the inverse of their accuracy for prediction of poor outcome (i.e. the specificity for prediction of good neurological outcome corresponds to the sensitivity for prediction of poor neurological outcome, and vice versa). Therefore, the accuracy of these indices to predict good outcome was already indirectly reported in our previous review on prediction of poor neurological outcome.

### The impact of pathologist review on peripheral blood smears: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 22 laboratories [^113F2gtb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of peripheral blood (PB) smear review by a pathologist when requested by a technologist or provider to measure the rate of pathologist-detected clinically relevant findings.

Objective —

To report and analyze the results of clinically relevant morphologic findings on PB smears that were pathologist reviewed because of either a request from a technologist or an order from a provider.

Design —

During a 4-week study period, participants enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes program submitted data on PB smear reviews including review request source, reason for review request, and if the pathologist's review resulted in a clinically relevant morphologic finding.

Results —

Twenty-two institutions submitted data on 835 eligible PB smears. Pathologists identified clinically relevant findings on a median 53.4% of technologist-requested PB smear reviews and a median 14.3% of provider-ordered PB smear reviews. The most frequently identified pathologist finding on technologist-requested PB smear reviews was "blasts" in 91 of 532 (17.1%) followed by "atypical (possibly neoplastic) lymphocytes" in 74 of 532 (13.9%); the most frequent finding on provider-ordered reviews was "other" in 55 of 315 (17.5%) followed by "immature cells/left shift in myeloid cells or monocytes" in 12 of 315 (3.8%). Pathologists agreed with technologists' indications for review in 458 of 513 requested reviews (89.3%). Institutions that conducted postanalytic follow-up on previously reviewed PB smears had a higher rate of clinically relevant findings detected on technologist-requested smears.

Conclusions —

Pathologist review of PB smears flagged by technologists for review frequently yielded clinically relevant findings. This was higher in institutions that conducted postanalytic reviews. Provider-ordered reviews resulted in clinically relevant findings in a median of 14.3% of smears.

### Comparative analysis reveals potential utility of digital microscopy in the evaluation of peripheral blood smears with some barriers to implementation [^1159iutE]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear (PBS) is an essential diagnostic test in current medical practice. We aimed to evaluate the use of digital microscopy for the examination of PBS as an option to provide expert interpretation to remote sites and in "on-call" situations.

Methods

We collected 100 Wright-Giemsa-stained PBS slides representing normal and abnormal findings seen at a community-based hospital. Four hematopathologists independently evaluated the cases using conventional light and digital microscopy.

Results

When comparing digital vs light microscopy, most of the cellular features evaluated showed at least a moderate degree of agreement in at least three of the reviewers. Discrepancies in final diagnosis were identified in a minority of the cases, most of which were attributed to the poorer resolution of digital microscopy at high magnification (×400).

Conclusions

These results support the limited use of digital microscopy for evaluation and triage of peripheral blood smears as a practical option to obtain expert opinion in locations where experienced staff is not available on site. Our results indicate that while digital microscopy is well suited for basic triage of these blood smears, limitations in quality of imaging at higher magnification as well as large file size may limit its utility in certain settings and situations.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114vZgsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Microscopic thick and thin blood films for babesiosis and malaria — best practices emphasize that the gold standard method for diagnosis of both malaria and babesiosis is microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films; samples should be obtained from fresh capillary or EDTA venous blood and slides prepared and read as soon as possible; thick blood films are the most sensitive method for microscopic screening and allow detection of very low parasitemia < 0.001% of RBCs infected; both thick and thin films should be screened manually and slides should be examined under oil immersion; the laboratorian should examine a minimum of 100 microscopic fields using the 100x objective before reporting a specimen as negative, and at least 300 additional fields should be examined for patients without previous Plasmodium exposure; if a highly pathogenic agent is suspected, the ordering clinician should notify the laboratory; because Babesia and Plasmodium may at times be indistinguishable on blood films and both can be transmitted by transfusion, clinical and epidemiologic information must be considered and additional testing may be required; repeat blood samples (3 or more specimens drawn 12–24 hours apart, ideally during febrile episodes) are indicated if the initial film is negative, and malaria or babesiosis is strongly suspected.

### Alternative strategies to provide actionable results when a supply of urinalysis strips is unavailable [^113WvZ3V]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Urinalysis instrument-specific dip strips offer physicians qualitative results for actionable analytes (protein, glucose, leukocyte esterase, nitrates, hemoglobin, and ketones).

Objective —

To explain a strategy implemented to support clinical decision-making by providing urine quantification of protein, glucose, white blood cells (WBCs), and red blood cells because of urine strip shortages.

Design —

During shortages, we implemented an automated algorithm that triggered sending urine samples to the automation line for quantification of protein and glucose and ensured that urine microscopy was performed to obtain WBC and red blood cell counts. The algorithm printed 2 labels so nursing staff would collect 2 specimens. We monitored the turnaround time from the specimen being received in the laboratory to result verification, ensured that the culture reflex order was triggered, and tracked complaints by physicians regarding not having usual urinalysis results. Prior to implementation, correlation between sample types for protein and glucose measurement was found acceptable.

Results —

The algorithm was put in place twice during 2022. The turnaround time of urine microscopic study was identical to that obtained when the urinalysis was done with the strips; however, the quantification of glucose and protein took approximately 30 minutes more. Urine reflex cultures were triggered correctly with the algorithm, as they were derived entirely from a WBC count higher than 10 per high-power field. During the shortage period we had only 1 complaint, by a physician wanting to have results of nitrates.

Conclusions —

During urine strip shortages, we successfully implemented a diversion algorithm that provided actionable urinalysis analytes in a timely manner with minimal provider complaints.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^116ggwmh]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Focus group results

Transcribed statements from focus group 1 were coded thematically in an iterative fashion. Individual statements could be coded in several thematic categories if multiple dimensions were identified. Major emerging thematic categories included benefit provided by PBS review, cell lineage, medium used for PBS review, procedure of PBS review, source of slide, specific diagnosis, and specific morphology (Figure 2). Subtopics were developed within each theme.

Figure 2.
Participant statement coding. Statements were categorized and subcategorized following inductive coding. Seven emerging domains of theory are shown. Subdomains are noted where applicable. ∗Further subcategorization can be found in the supplemental Data. The number of further subcategories are noted in parentheses.

Most discussion centered on specific cell lineage (32.8% of the statements), specific diagnosis (39.7% of the statements), and specific morphology (26.0% of the statements). The procedure of PBS review was discussed the least (9.2% of the statements).

Participants reported the majority of their slides for PBS teaching as having originated from clinic or consult service patients currently being seen by the educator or trainee. Some voiced the importance of reviewing PBSs from collated slide libraries to ensure that trainees get a full breadth of exposure. Thorough systematic review was most commonly discussed as the appropriate method for trainee review, whereas some noted abbreviated methods were used in clinical practice by attending hematologists.

White blood cells and red blood cells accounted for the vast majority of cell lineage–based discussion (48.8% and 41.9%, respectively). The most commonly discussed morphologies were schistocytes, spherocytes, blasts, and macro-ovalocytes (supplemental Appendix). Acute leukemia (including acute promyelocytic leukemia), TMA, and hemolytic anemias were the most discussed diagnostic subcategories.

Several benefits of PBS review were stated. First, PBS review is often available at the time of consultation which can improve time to initial diagnosis. The rapid availability to review PBS is specifically important because it pertains to confirming or refuting "can't miss diagnoses" that convey a high likelihood of morbidity or mortality if misdiagnosed. Furthermore, the identification of morphologic characteristics informs Bayesian reasoning and aid in clinical decision making, and in turn, allows for early initiation of therapeutic interventions.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^113SHyNy]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Emergent categories were developed using participant statements through inductive coding in an iterative fashion. Statements were analyzed using mixed-methods analysis to give further insight into the relative time spent on discussion of each category and subcategory. These data were used to develop a semistructured facilitator guide for session 2. Categories and emerging tenets of the potential theory were reviewed with participants at the beginning of this session. Discussion of potential CR was directed by participants. Recording and transcription were completed as in session 1.

An updated list of prospective morphologies and diagnoses was distributed via email to participants after session 2. For each domain, each participant was assigned the level of training at which they felt a practitioner should have attained competency. These levels are as follows: (1) medical student, (2) internal medicine resident, (3) hematology fellow, (4) practicing hematologist (generalized), and (5) practicing hematologist (subspecialized). Rating levels 1 through 3 (medical student through fellow) were categorized as "required for fellow competency" whereas rating levels 4 and 5 were considered "aspirational". Interrater reliability was assessed using percent agreement and a free-marginal multirater kappa statistics. The rating levels 4 and 5 were selected given the lack of a priori bias on the relative prevalence in each category of competency.

Potential CR were developed after the analysis of the focus group 2 transcript and the returned morphology and diagnosis list. Initial CR were disseminated to participants for revision and validation. Participants were asked to either agree with the proposed recommendation as written or disagree and offer textual edits. Participants were offered the ability to propose new recommendations or remove recommendations altogether. At least 2 rounds of iterative feedback were prespecified. Feedback was obtained via email. M.L.C. reviewed emails, anonymized feedback, and revised statements before each subsequent round of review.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of treatment response, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining reflex HBV DNA testing where available, through either laboratory-based reflex HBV DNA testing using a sample already held in the laboratory or clinic-based reflex testing in a healthcare facility through immediate sample collection following a positive HBsAg rapid diagnostic test, as an additional strategy to promote linkage to care and treatment in patients testing positive on HBsAg.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^111gL3Y2]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Interpretation of the PBS is an essential skill of a practicing hematologist. To the best of our knowledge, through this study we have developed and proposed CR that are the first to appear in a peer-reviewed publication. The methodology described herein offers a potential framework for others to discuss and propose consensus on analogous visuospatial and object recognition tasks within the medical specialties.

Several themes emerge from our CR. First, all fellows in ACGME accredited hematology and hematology-oncology training programs should meet minimum levels of competency upon graduation. A trainee's desire to specialize in a nonhematology focused field should not obviate the need for training in PBS review. Learners are likely to benefit most from interactions with a core group of educators. The exact qualifications and scope of practice of these educators is best determined locally because it is possible that there will be significant variability in expertise among clinical hematologists and hematopathologists across training programs. Curricula should be designed to ensure a broad level of education, and when possible, incorporate patient cases under trainee care. The use of "slide libraries" is of specific importance in the case of rare diagnoses, or common diagnoses that may not be seen owing to referral bias. Specifically, a trainee may not encounter patients with sickle cell disease, or endemic parasitic infections unless they are trained at a center with sufficient sample volume.

### Laboratory productivity and the rate of manual peripheral blood smear review: a college of American pathologists Q-probes study of 95, 141 complete blood count determinations performed in 263 institutions [^112JaYDv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Automated laboratory hematology analyzers are capable of performing differential counts on peripheral blood smears with greater precision and more accurate detection of distributional and morphologic abnormalities than those performed by manual examinations of blood smears. Manual determinations of blood morphology and leukocyte differential counts are time-consuming, expensive, and may not always be necessary. The frequency with which hematology laboratory workers perform manual screens despite the availability of labor-saving features of automated analyzers is unknown.

Objective

To determine the normative rates with which manual peripheral blood smears were performed in clinical laboratories, to examine laboratory practices associated with higher or lower manual review rates, and to measure the effects of manual smear review on the efficiency of generating complete blood count (CBC) determinations.

Design

From each of 3 traditional shifts per day, participants were asked to select serially, 10 automated CBC specimens, and to indicate whether manual scans and/or reviews with complete differential counts were performed on blood smears prepared from those specimens. Sampling continued until a total of 60 peripheral smears were reviewed manually. For each specimen on which a manual review was performed, participants indicated the patient's age, hemoglobin value, white blood cell count, platelet count, and the primary reason why the manual review was performed. Participants also submitted data concerning their institutions' demographic profiles and their laboratories' staffing, work volume, and practices regarding CBC determinations. The rates of manual reviews and estimations of efficiency in performing CBC determinations were obtained from the data.

Setting

A total of 263 hospitals and independent laboratories, predominantly located in the United States, participating in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes Program.

Results

There were 95,141 CBC determinations examined in this study; participants reviewed 15,423 (16.2%) peripheral blood smears manually. In the median institution (50th percentile), manual reviews of peripheral smears were performed on 26.7% of specimens. Manual differential count review rates were inversely associated with the magnitude of platelet counts that were required by laboratory policy to trigger smear reviews and with the efficiency of generating CBC reports. Lower manual differential count review rates were associated with laboratory policies that allowed manual reviews solely on the basis of abnormal automated red cell parameters and that precluded performing repeat manual reviews within designated time intervals. The manual scan rate elevated with increased number of hospital beds. In more than one third (35.7%) of the peripheral smears reviewed manually, participants claimed to have learned additional information beyond what was available on automated hematology analyzer printouts alone.

Conclusion

By adopting certain laboratory practices, it may be possible to reduce the rates of manual reviews of peripheral blood smears and increase the efficiency of generating CBC results.

B-cell lymphoma cytogenomic testing — Interphase FISH analysis using relevant probes should be performed on lymphoid tissue sections, fine needle or bone marrow aspirate smears, and/or touch imprints, and metaphase FISH can also be performed as needed. The most common studies performed in B cell lymphomas are FISH evaluation for double and triple hit lymphomas, specifically for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 gene rearrangements, which can be performed as a panel or through reflex testing beginning with MYC; because some MYC rearrangements may be missed using only break-apart probes, additional testing using IGH::MYC dual-fusion probes may be indicated. For high-grade B cell lymphoma with 11q aberrations/large B cell lymphoma with 11q aberration, the 11q aberrations are typically identified only by CMA, and NGS methods for either copy-number assessment or translocation identification are not within the scope of this document, although they can identify additional copy-number and structural alterations beyond those listed here.

### Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of HIV infection: updated recommendations [^117Gxppt]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Specimen collection and storage requirements for HIV testing — volume and handling: Freshly collected serum or plasma specimens yield the most accurate HIV test results, and specimen volume also influences the ability to perform the recommended algorithm. A venipuncture specimen of at least 5 mL of whole blood is necessary to yield at least 2 mL of serum or plasma needed to conduct all assays in the recommended algorithm, and some laboratories require a separate specimen for NAT. Ensuring accurate results requires that laboratories carefully review manufacturer's instructions in each assay's package insert to determine requirements for acceptable specimen types, communicate these specific requirements to the persons who submit specimens for testing, request collection of another specimen from a second venipuncture if all tests cannot be performed on the same specimen, and confirm handling, storage, and shipping requirements before sending specimens to reference laboratories for additional testing.

### Performance evaluation of the sysmex haematology XN modular system [^112mppvN]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The Sysmex XN haematology instrument performs automatic reflex testing, depending on sample results. A nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) count is provided on all samples. The instrument has a smaller footprint (34%) than previous Sysmex XE analysers.

Methods

An evaluation comparing all results to the Sysmex XE-2100 and manual microscopic differential and morphology (n = 390) was performed followed by a workflow study of 1000 samples to compare speed of operation and number of blood films reviews required from both systems.

Results

The new features on the instrument are: (1) white cell and NRBC channel, all samples include the NRBC count; (2) white cell precursor channel: false positive flags for blasts, abnormal lymphocytes and atypical lymphocytes are reduced significantly without a statistical increase of false negatives; (3) low white cell count mode: suggested setting of < 0.5×10(9)/l. An extended count is more precise and provides an accurate differential. Fluorescent platelet count is performed in a dedicated channel. If the red cell or platelet size histograms are abnormal or if the platelet count is low, then a fluorescent platelet count is automatically performed. Good correlation with the XE-2100 and manual differential was found and the improved results compared to the reference flow cytometric analysis for platelet counts, especially below 30×10(9)/l (XE-2100, R(2) = 0.500; XN, R(2) = 0.875).

Conclusion

The XN showed reduced sample turnaround time of 10% and reduced number of blood films for examination, 49% less than the XE-2100 without loss of sensitivity with more precise and accurate results on low cell counts.

### Educational cost-effective intervention to reduce pathologist's peripheral blood smears reviews with non-contributory findings: an academic institution experience [^1164jDWY]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripheral blood smear (PBS) review by a pathologist is a necessary and invaluable diagnostic tool. However, innovative highly sophisticated haematology analysers that flag peripheral blood abnormalities have decreased the need for a PBS review. Ordering practices including PBS reviews lumped as part of an 'order set' or with complete blood count (CBC) constituted most PBS requests at our institution. A retrospective review of all PBS review orders from 1 April 2016 to 31 January 2017 was performed to investigate the ordering practices at our institution. A total of 2864 PBS were ordered during the above study period. In many cases, the PBS report did not add any significant clinical information beyond that acquired by the CBC and differential count. These findings inspired policy changes within our institution for pathologist PBS reviews. Within the electronic order system, all PBS orders for inpatients were linked to a pop-up window with criteria for peripheral smear review and instructions on the approval policy. Outpatient orders required clinicians to request pathology approval. This implementation reduced total number of PBS orders by 42.5% with no adverse effect on patient management. Empowering pathologists and clinicians with guidelines on PBS review orders is a beneficial educational exercise of resource utilisation. Discussion with physicians regarding clinical indications reduces non-contributory PBS reviews, provides guidance to appropriate testing, and aptly allocates pathologist and laboratory staff time and resources.

### Elimination of instrument-driven reflex manual differential leukocyte counts. optimization of manual blood smear review criteria in a high-volume automated hematology laboratory [^113BURL8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Automated peripheral blood leukocyte differential counts (LDCs) are widely accepted in routine practice. However, many laboratories still reflexively perform manual LDCs based solely on abnormal automated results or instrument "flags", before any manual triage step. We describe our transition to a procedure that uses manual methods to validate, rather than to replace, automated LDCs (an approach recommended early in the development of automated methods, but still not used in many clinical laboratories). Manual microscopic scans were performed in lieu of manual LDCs. Each scan that revealed cell types not quantifiable by the instrument triggered a manual LDC. However, if the manual scan simply confirmed the cell types seen on automated LDC, then the automated result was released, even if clinically significant quantitative abnormalities were present. This policy reduced manual LDCs by more than 70% and was validated by a manual retrospective audit. Patient care and laboratory operations can be optimized by using manual microscopic examination as a validation procedure rather than as a reflexive substitute for automated methods. There is no clinical rationale for reflex performance of manual LDCs based solely on instrument warnings.

### Validation and optimization of criteria for manual smear review following automated blood cell analysis in a large university hospital [^113M4R2U]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Each laboratory should have criteria for manual smear review that limit workload without affecting patient care. The International Consensus Group for Hematology Review established guidelines for action after automated blood cell analysis in 2005.

Objective

To compare the consensus group criteria with our laboratory criteria and optimize them for better efficiency.

Design

A total of 2114 first-time samples were collected consecutively from daily workload and were used to compare 2 criteria as well as establish the optimized criteria. Another set of 891 samples was used to validate the optimized criteria. All samples were run on either Sysmex XE-5000 or Coulter LH750 hematology analyzers and were investigated by manual smear review. The efficiency of each set of criteria was compared and optimized to obtain better efficiency, an acceptable review rate, and a low false-negative rate.

Results

From 2114 samples, 368 (17.40%) had positive smear results. Compared with that of our laboratory criteria, the efficiency of the consensus group criteria was higher (83.63% versus 78.86%, P < .001), the review rate was higher (29.33% versus 22.37%, P < .001), and the false-negative rate was lower (2.22% versus 8.09%, P < .001). After optimizing the rules, we obtained an efficiency of 87.13%, a review rate of 24.22%, and a false-negative rate of 2.98%. We validated the optimized criteria with another set of samples, and the efficiency, review rate, and false-negative rate were 87.32%, 25.25%, and 1.12%, respectively.

Conclusions

Each laboratory should verify the criteria for smear review, based on the International Consensus Group for Hematology Review, and optimize them to maximize efficiency.

### A suspected case of mixed infection ofwith: a diagnostic conundrum due to pre-analytical error [^1176GTqz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Blood sample transport and slide preparation should not be delayed in suspected cases of malaria. The temperature of the laboratory also plays a significant role in the development of exflagellation and ookinetes. In our laboratory, the temperature was maintained at 24–25°C. Hence, this case highlights the importance of pre-analytical variables such as the time of collection and peripheral blood smear preparation in totality for the correct interpretation of peripheral blood smear findings. And last, this case reiterates the various morphological changes which may happen inside the vacutainer itself and how understanding the scenarios can help avoid a probable morphological confusion to the gametocyte of P. falciparum which can transpire.

Recommendations
5. All persons at risk for ML — on the basis of the etiologic agent of the Leishmania infection, if known, and the region in the New World in which infection was acquired — should be questioned about and examined for mucosal symptoms and signs, respectively, even during the initial evaluation [Strong, low].
6. During all evaluations (i.e. initial and subsequent), persons at risk for ML should be questioned explicitly about the development, evolution, and other characteristics of mucosal symptoms; and they should have a thorough examination of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa even if they do not have any mucosal symptoms [Strong, low].
7. Persons at risk for ML should be educated and provided personalized documentation about the importance of seeking medical attention for possible ML if they ever develop persistent, atypical (unusual for the person) naso-oropharyngeal/laryngeal manifestations that do not have a clear etiology [Strong, low].
8. Persons at risk for ML who have persistent mucosal symptom(s) or compatible abnormalities of the naso-oropharyngeal mucosa should be referred to a specialist for an otorhinolaryngologic examination, which typically should include fiberoptic endoscopy [Strong, low].
9. Clinicians might refer some at-risk persons without documented mucosal symptoms or signs to an otolaryngologist, especially if it was not possible to conduct a thorough review of systems and mucosal examination or if the assessments may not have been adequate or reliable [Weak, very low].

IV. In a person with a compatible clinical course and epidemiologic context, what types of samples should be collected to evaluate for the diagnosis of VL?

Recommendations
10. We recommend the collection of tissue aspirates or biopsy specimens for smears, histopathology, parasite culture, and molecular testing [Strong, low].
11. Bone marrow aspiration is the preferred first source of a diagnostic sample. Liver, enlarged lymph nodes, and whole blood (buffy coat) are other potential sources of tissue specimens [Strong, low].
12. Serum should be collected for detection of antileishmanial antibodies (see VIII) [Strong, moderate].
13. In immunocompromised persons, blood should be collected for buffy coat examination, in vitro culture, and molecular analyses [Strong, very low].

### A systematic literature review of microscopy methods reported in malaria clinical trials [^114uiakx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Asexual peripheral parasitemia.

Of the 206 studies, 61% (125/206) estimated parasite density by the WBC method, 2% (4/206) by the HPF method, a single study used the RBC method, and 5% (10/206) used both WBC and RBC methods (Figure 2A). About one-third of the articles (32%, 66/206) did not report the method for parasitemia estimation. Among studies in which peripheral parasitemia was measured using the WBC method, 37% counted parasite densities per 200 WBC, 4% per 500 WBC, and 12% per 200 or 500 WBC. To calculate parasite density per µL, the majority of studies (84%, [105/125]) used an assumed WBC value per µL, whereas only 9% (11/125) used an actual count of WBC measured by using the hematology analyzer. In studies calculating parasitemia using assumed WBC values, the range was 6,000–10,000 WBCs/µL, with 68% (85/125) assuming 8,000 WBCs/µL and 16/125 (13%) using 6,000 WBCs/µL (Table 1). The reported methods for parasite density estimation stratified by study region and parasite species are shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Reported methodology used for estimating parasite density (N = 206)

Method to consider slide negative.

More than half of the studies (55%, 113/206) did not mention how a patient was considered aparasitemic by microscopy examination (Figure 2B). One-third (33%, 68/206) of studies used the HPF method in which microscopic fields ranging from 30 to 500 were examined before declaring a slide negative. Examining 100 HPFs (56%, 38/68) was the most common method reported, followed by 200 HPFs (34%, 23/68). And, 12% of studies (25/206) followed the WBC method, whereby 1,000 WBCs were examined before considering a slide negative most often (80%, 20/25). The methods for declaring a slide negative stratified by study region and parasite species are shown in Table 3.

### Recommendations for cell-free DNA assay validations: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and college of American pathologists [^114NH2vQ]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) specimen collection volumes — Approximately half of the reviewed publications (51%, 621/1228) reported the volume of blood from which plasma was extracted; among those, 65% (404/621) used 4 to 10 mL of blood, 24% (149/621) used > 10 mL of blood, and 11% (68/621) used < 4 mL of blood. Forty-four percent (538/1228) reported the volume of plasma extracted from whole blood, with the most common reported plasma volume extracted being 1 to 2 mL (54%, 290/538) and the next largest subset extracting 2 to 4 mL (33%, 176/538).

### A systematic literature review of microscopy methods reported in malaria clinical trials [^114AzHpj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

The observed differences in microscopy methods need to be minimized by implementing standardized procedures. This would allow for methodological consistency and comparability of clinical trial outcomes across studies. Based on the findings of this review, we have proposed a minimum checklist for reporting microscopy procedures and results in malaria study publications (Box 1). This evidence-based checklist supplements existing guidelines and recommendations for microscopy methods. We propose pursuing the following standard practices: a minimum of 200 HPFs should be examined on the thick film before declaring a slide negative. Parasites should be estimated against 500 WBCs in the thick film, given actual WBC counts by a hematology analyzer is used for counting parasitemia. If the laboratory facility to perform actual WBC counts is not available, parasites must be counted in 40 HPFs on the thick smear. Another provision for the adoption of a harmonized standard microscopy procedure would be making it a prerequisite by the sponsor or funder of a trial.

### Establishment of review criteria coordinating with the automated digital cell morphology identification system in a specialized women's and children's hospital [^114bzgns]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to establish appropriate review criteria for blood cell analysis in a specialized women's and children's hospital. Also, the CellaVision DI-60, was developed as one of the automated digital cell morphology analyzer, we evaluated if it was shown to be most effective under the certain review criteria.

Methods

A total of 2890 blood samples were detected to optimize the previously established review criteria for women and children with the Sysmex XE-2100. A total of 623 samples were used to validate the criteria.

Results

The microscopic-review rate based on the initial review criteria was 51.0%. After optimization, it was reduced to 17.3% and the false-negative rate was 3.85%. There was > 80% consistency between manual review results and CellaVision DI-60 preclassification when samples triggered the platelet- or red cell-related rules. The sensitivity for abnormalities (immature granulocytes, nucleated red blood cells) of reclassification was 90% to 100% and the false-negative rate was < 5%. However, direct microscopic review was required when the "Blasts/AbnLympho?" and "Atypical Lympho?" flags were triggered.

Conclusion

Specialized review criteria are needed for women and children. An automated morphology identification system might help to improve the review criteria.

### What is a significant difference between sequential laboratory results? [^111Dsi8A]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The uncertainty of a numerical laboratory result can be masked by the fact that the laboratory reports an absolute number, whereas users have limited knowledge of the confidence interval of the result. Interpretation of laboratory tests is in reality therefore an inexact science, a balance between clinical context and the likely relevance of a laboratory result. This review considers the factors which contribute to result variability and examines the implications for interpreting differences between sequential laboratory results. It offers suggestions to deal with a problem which has not yet been much addressed in routine practice. The examples used are restricted to the discipline of clinical biochemistry, although the issues and principles apply to numerical (and indeed qualitative) results in other disciplines. Laboratories could provide more guidance on the likelihood of a result being significant to assist users. There is a need for discussion about how this is best done, and compatible with electronic result delivery. Options for providing this information are considered.

### Harmonisation of full blood count reports, recommendations of the French-speaking cellular haematology group (GFHC) [^111cpy7C]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To propose recommendations related to the presentation, content and formulation of full blood count analysis reports.

Methods

Strong professional agreement among a group of experts from the French-Speaking Cellular Haematology Group (GFHC) was obtained.

Results

The following two proposals emerged from the consensus: (1) stratification of comments into three parts upon the discovery of an anomaly in blood cell analysis and (2) selection and/or redefinition of the terms recommended for designating the cell types found in normal and pathological peripheral blood.

Conclusions

The recommendations can help biologists who are currently undergoing the process of accreditation.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^114oVbFu]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Manual review of the PBS via light microscopy or digital whole slide imaging is strongly preferred over single high-power field images. Independent use of the compound light microscope is a mandatory skill that should be attained by graduation. Expertise in the identification of normal morphology aids in the recognition of more subtle pathology on PBS. Trainees should be wellversed in the identification of both normal and pathologic cytoplasmic and nuclear characteristics. The identification of staining and preparation artifact is necessary to allow for proper clinical reasoning. Curricula should emphasize the utility of PBS in the context of contemporary testing as it can augment or eliminate the need for other diagnostic testing, minimize medical waste, and reduce time to diagnosis. Adept fellows will contextualize PBS morphology within the greater clinical context of the patient's clinical history, laboratory, and pathologic data; and harbor an understanding of how positive and negative PBS findings affect Bayesian reasoning. Trainees should have a thorough and reproducible methodologic approach to PBS evaluation, although all educators need not be expected to teach a uniform approach across all ACGME training institutions. Specific emphasis should be placed on distinction of malignant and benign etiologies of leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. Finally, trainees should identify morphology suggestive of hemolytic anemias and suspect specific diagnoses based on PBS review with otherwise limited clinical information. In the institutions, participants practice with high resource availability and low exposure to tropical diseases. It was felt that the outsized global impact of malaria (247 million cases, and 619 000 deaths in 2021) warranted specific attention.

Broad consensus existed on the specific morphologies and diagnoses within the fellow's purview. This is an important development that can guide PBS curricular design (Tables 3 and 4). The high interrater agreement on included morphology and diagnoses indicates that hematologists likely have a shared mental model of what constitutes fellow competency, despite the lack of current formally accepted theory.

Qualitative data from the focus group sessions offer potential insights into the importance that participants place in various aspects of fellow competency. The high proportion of time spent on the specific diagnoses of acute leukemia and TMA possibly indicates a bias among attending hematologists to place heightened emphasis on the recognition of these conditions. The domains of PBS review do not appear to be weighted equally in the minds of hematologists, with an excess of attention focused on conditions that predispose patients to a high risk of short-term morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the relatively minimal discussion on the identification of abnormal platelet morphology and primary disorders of platelets potentially indicates a relative perceived lack of importance.

### Normocytic anemia… [^112mPFoX]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Most published algorithms for the diagnosis of normocytic anemia begin with an examination of the peripheral blood smear 20 or a corrected reticulocyte index. 2, 9, 21 The red blood cell distribution width is a measure of the variability of the size of the cells and is usually reported as a component of automated CBCs. Therefore, a practical and useful first step is to use the red blood cell distribution width to help categorize the normocytic anemia as heterogeneous or homogeneous. PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR The examination of the peripheral blood smear often yields diagnostic clues or confirmatory evidence.

Easily recognized red blood cell findings related to normocytic anemias include the following: large polychromatic "shift cells, " which represent reticulocytosis; target cells, which may be found in liver disease; basophilic stippling, which may be present in hemolytic anemias; and mixtures of large and small red blood cells, which may suggest the presence of mixed microcytic and macrocytic disease processes. 3, 9, 10 The corrected reticulocyte index, along with the white blood cell and platelet counts, indicates whether the bone marrow is functioning appropriately. The corrected reticulocyte index should be elevated in patients with an acute anemia but a competent bone marrow. The CBC revealed a normocytic anemia, with a red blood cell distribution width of 41 fL.

A reticulocyte count and "draw and hold" specimens were ordered. The corrected reticulocyte index was 1. 0 percent. A CBC revealed normocytic anemia, with an elevated red blood cell distribution width of 53 fL. A reticulocyte count and "draw and hold" specimens were ordered. The corrected reticulocyte index was elevated.

### A method for optimizing and validating institution-specific flagging criteria for automated cell counters [^112BEEvY]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Automated cell counters use alerts (flags) to indicate which differential white blood cell counts can be released directly from the instrument and which samples require labor-intensive slide reviews. The thresholds at which many of these flags are triggered can be adjusted by individual laboratories. Many users, however, use factory-default settings or adjust the thresholds through a process of trial and error.

Objective

To develop a systematic method, combining statistical analysis and clinical judgment, to optimize the flagging thresholds on automated cell counters.

Design

Data from 502 samples flagged by Sysmex XE-2100/5000 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) instruments, with at least 1 of 5 user-adjustable, white blood cell count flags, were used to change the flagging thresholds for maximal diagnostic effectiveness by optimizing the Youden index for each flag (the optimization set). The optimized thresholds were then validated with a second set of 378 samples (the validation set).

Results

Use of the new thresholds reduced the review rate caused by the 5 flags from 6.5% to 2.9% and improved the positive predictive value of the flagging system for any abnormality from 27% to 37%.

Conclusions

This method can be used to optimize thresholds for flag alerts on automated cell counters of any type and to improve the overall positive predictive value of the flagging system at the expense of a reduction in the negative predictive value. A reduced manual review rate helps to focus resources on differential white blood cell counts that are of clinical significance and may improve turnaround time.

### Cessation of dipstick urinalysis reflex testing and physician ordering behavior [^1111FEBY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of our study was to determine the effect of the elimination of laboratory-initiated reflex testing on physician ordering behavior. In 1999, we stopped laboratory-initiated reflex testing and did microscopic analysis only on physician request. The number of urinalysis dipstick tests, microscopic analysis tests, and urine cultures done during 6-month periods for the next 10 years was extracted from our laboratory information system that includes data from the middle of 1999. The number of physician complaints was also recorded. Before the intervention, we did 106,000 urine analysis tests per 6-month period, with 19,006 microscopic examinations (17.9%) that decreased to less than 0.2% after the change in policy. During the 10-year period, physician requests for microscopic urinalysis decreased gradually to around 50 in any 6-month period.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FGtHT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Applicability and Generalizability

From the pie charts in the "Applicability and Feasibility Data" subsection of the "Results" section, the following patterns emerge: (1) academic/university/teaching as well as primary care/outpatient clinic facility settings are strongly represented, while community hospitals, children's hospitals, and public hospitals (including Veterans Affairs [VA] hospitals) are less represented, and (2) education, feedback, reflex testing, and test review interventions are less represented as single-practice interventions compared to CPOE and CDSS. From the cross-attribute tables, observable in Table 9 is that within university/academic/teaching hospitals CPOE and combined practice interventions are more strongly represented relative to other intervention types. Because CPOE interventions most commonly appeared as modifications to an existing CPOE system (see "Results" section), this finding is perhaps reflective of increased resource availability in such settings in support of improvement efforts, a point perhaps also true of combined practice interventions (which may require more resources to plan and implement relative to single-practice interventions). A pattern observable in Table 10 is that most interventions occurred in hospital inpatient settings, perhaps reflecting that (1) most testing occurs in hospital labs (a point supported by basic Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data), and (2) inpatients may experience increased testing in terms of scope or frequency. Finally, a pattern emerging from Table 11 is that there is greater focus on primary care/outpatient clinic patient settings among studies outside the US relative to other patient setting types, possibly a reflection of intervention planning occurring in different reimbursement environments (eg, national health care systems) than in the US.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^111vJ6cz]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The interpretation of peripheral blood smear (PBS) morphology is a core skill of the practicing hematologist and plays a key role in their ability to provide a timely diagnosis. The morphologic evaluation can reveal pathologic findings, which allow for timely diagnosis and rapid treatment for intracellular parasitic infections, hemolytic anemias, suspected thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and acute leukemias. However, the absence of pathologic findings required when diagnoses of exclusion, such as immune thrombocytopenia purpura, are under consideration.

Identification of pathologic morphology on PBS is an acquired skill that requires iterative visuospatial training to allow for high fidelity object recognition. Object recognition theories suggest that iterative training and the repetitive exposure to unique combinations of visual stimuli, including shapes, contours, colors, and textures, are needed to develop rapid object recognition with retained fidelity. Hematologists in the United States hone these skills during fellowship training.

In North America, graduate medical education (GME) training programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). During the training, fellows routinely order and interpret PBSs under the supervision of an attending hematologist. The ACGME outlines fellowship specific milestones across several domains in an effort to ensure a minimum level of clinical exposure and competency across programs. The ACGME milestones for hematology mandate competency in the "interpretation of peripheral blood smears". Despite this mandate, there neither is an established "gold standard", nor are there published, peer-reviewed recommendations on the methodology of teaching PBS review.

Other medical specialties require trainees to be competent in the interpretation of analogous visuospatial tasks. Examples include the interpretation of radiographic images (radiology, pulmonology, and internal medicine), echocardiography (cardiology), anatomic pathology (pathology), and urine sediment (nephrology). Clinical competency in the use of echocardiographic imaging is among the most granular and developed among these, but is still largely based on expert consensus. There are no agreed upon interdisciplinary best practices in skill acquisition in object recognition despite the seemingly ubiquitous nature of visuospatial skill mastery at the GME level.

We convened a focus group of academic hematologists, well-versed in the clinical application and teaching of PBS review with the goal to develop a theoretical framework for PBS education at the GME level. Here, we describe proposed theory and the consensus recommendations (CR) of a multiinstitutional focus group, developed using constructivist grounded theory and modified nominal group technique (NGT).

### Update on blood cultures: how to obtain, process, report, and interpret [^117X1aHy]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The detection and identification of microorganisms circulating in the bloodstream of patients is arguably one of the most important functions of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Effective implementation of this function requires careful consideration of specimen collection and processing, culture techniques, result reporting, and, perhaps most importantly, result interpretation by the physician. The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of the current state of the art for each of these areas, with the intention of providing adequate information to enable clinical laboratory personnel and physicians to critically evaluate and, if required, improve their current blood culture practices.

### The generation of narrative interpretations in laboratory medicine: a description of service-specific sign-out rounds [^1133DJCx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The logistical details for organizing effective interpretive rounds in a laboratory medicine subspecialty must be carefully established so that expert opinions are provided in a timely fashion in a patient-specific report, rather than as a collection of fixed comments associated with a particular laboratory result generated by a computer This report describes the test batteries for interpretations, the billing for interpretations, clinical examples of interpretations, and interpretations for which billing is not typically performed in several clinical or laboratory areas in our institution. These include coagulation disorders, hemoglobin and anemia evaluations, autoimmune disorders, serum protein analysis, toxicology, molecular diagnostics, and transfusion medicine. The information in this report should provide sufficient detail to allow development of interpretive services with successful billing for the areas in laboratory medicine described.

### Beyond blood smears: qualification of18S rRNA as a biomarker for controlled human malaria infections [^113dgGyR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

18S rRNA is a biomarker that provides an alternative to thick blood smears in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials. We reviewed data from CHMI trials at non-endemic sites that used blood smears and Plasmodium 18S rRNA/rDNA biomarker nucleic acid tests (NATs) for time to positivity. We validated a multiplex quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for Plasmodium 18S rRNA, prospectively compared blood smears and qRT-PCR for three trials, and modeled treatment effects at different biomarker-defined parasite densities to assess the impact on infection detection, symptom reduction, and measured intervention efficacy. Literature review demonstrated accelerated NAT-based infection detection compared with blood smears (mean acceleration: 3.2–3.6 days). For prospectively tested trials, the validated Plasmodium 18S rRNA qRT-PCR positivity was earlier (7.6 days; 95% CI: 7.1–8.1 days) than blood smears (11.0 days; 95% CI: 10.3–11.8 days) and significantly preceded the onset of grade 2 malaria-related symptoms (12.2 days; 95% CI: 10.6–13.3 days). Discrepant analysis showed that the risk of a blood smear-positive, biomarker-negative result was negligible. Data modeling predicted that treatment triggered by specific biomarker-defined thresholds can differentiate complete, partial, and non-protective outcomes and eliminate many grade 2 and most grade 3 malaria-related symptoms post-CHMI. Plasmodium 18S rRNA is a sensitive and specific biomarker that can justifiably replace blood smears for infection detection in CHMI trials in non-endemic settings. This study led to biomarker qualification through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in CHMI studies at non-endemic sites, which will facilitate biomarker use for the qualified context of use in drug and vaccine trials.

### Technical competency assessment of peripheral blood smears: tools and trends learned from 2 college of American pathologists Q-probes studies [^117LKKRy]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Morphologic evaluation of peripheral blood smears provides valuable information to diagnose and manage a variety of hematologic disorders.

Objective —

To measure the competency of the technical staff in the morphologic evaluation of peripheral blood smears and provide performance trends.

Design —

Participating technologists accessed 10 whole slide-imaged peripheral blood smears through a web-based imaging tool in 2 separate studies. Participants performed a 100-cell differential and morphologic evaluation for each slide image. Grading criteria, determined by 3 hematopathologists, were weighted according to their clinical significance (score range, 0–100 for each case). Each institution and participant answered a questionnaire to assess the impact of current practices and educational programs on competency scores.

Results —

A total of 776 technologists from 92 institutions participated in study 1 and 1495 technologists from 179 institutions participated in study 2. Median performance scores for institutions were 78.9 and 87.6 for studies 1 and 2, respectively, encompassing a range of hematologic disorders. Based on results of the questionnaire for study 1, higher performance scores were seen when institutions required a specific number of continuing education credits per year through an agency (P = 0.005). In study 2, institutions with remediation procedures following a failed competency demonstrated higher performance scores (P = 0.03).

Conclusions —

Medical technologist competency of peripheral blood smears improves with level of experience and is positively impacted through attending educational programs. Whole slide images offer a convenient means of assessing technical competence and provide data to allow institutions to appropriately focus their procedures and educational efforts.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oscTw]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Quality Improvement Practices

Eight practices impacting test utilization were determined relevant to this systematic review, and have been characterized in the literature. These practices, defined in the glossary (Supplemental Table 1; all supplemental material can be found at American Journal of Clinical Pathology online), are: computerized provider order entry (CPOE), clinical decision support systems/tools (CDSS/CDST), education, feedback, reflex testing, test review, laboratory test utilization (LTU) teams, and combined practices.

These practice categories represent approaches to systematically manage the utilization of testing, and are generally preanalytical within the total testing process. As such, each practice serves to impact the appropriateness of specific testing ordered or performed, a gap generally expressed as overutilization or underutilization of testing within this review's a priori analytical framework and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The source of criteria informing the "appropriateness" of testing is variable, ranging from national recommendations and guidelines to local consensus and administrative protocols. This aspect of variation was not an a priori consideration for analysis and derivation of practice recommendations (ie, not an element of inclusion/exclusion nor an element of data abstraction). However, it is further discussed in the "Conclusions".

### Best practice in primary care pathology: review 2 [^111kubVD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

This second best practice review examines five series of common primary care questions in laboratory medicine: (1) laboratory testing for allergy, (2) diagnosis and monitoring of menopause, (3) the use of urine cytology, (4) the usefulness of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and (5) the investigation of possible urinary tract infection. The review is presented in a question-answer format. The recommendations represent a précis of guidance found using a standardised literature search of national and international guidance notes, consensus statements, health policy documents, and evidence based medicine reviews, supplemented by MEDLINE EMBASE searches to identify relevant primary research documents. They are standards but form a guide to be set in the clinical context. Most are consensus rather than evidence based. They will be updated periodically to take account of new information.

### Evaluation of the impact of mandating health care providers to offer hepatitis C virus screening to all persons born during 1945–1965-new york, 2014 [^114juFmm]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

To assess linkage to care after implementation of the law, NYSDOH and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene HCV surveillance data were reviewed. The proportions of nonincarcerated persons born during 1945–1965 with newly diagnosed cases of confirmed HCV infection who were linked to care during the preenactment period (January 2011–December 2013) and the postenactment period (January 2014–December 2014) were compared. Linkage to care was defined as documentation of either 1) two or more positive HCV RNA tests (excluding reflex RNA testing) or 2) one positive HCV RNA test (excluding reflex RNA testing) and an HCV genotype test within 6 months of the initial positive HCV antibody result. In reflex RNA testing, a positive antibody test result triggers an automatic RNA test by the laboratory on the same specimen. For this analysis, reflex testing was defined as an HCV RNA test with the same collection date as the HCV antibody test. The rationale for excluding reflex testing is that a reflex RNA test is automatic and does not necessarily indicate an engagement in care. These laboratory data were made available through the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System. Linkage to care was assessed among active Medicaid clients receiving Medicaid services statewide. Among Medicaid recipients receiving HCV antibody testing, those who also received RNA testing during the same year they were initially tested were considered linked to care; because Medicaid claims data do not distinguish reflex testing, these results might include reflex testing.

Among the 151 laboratories eligible for the survey, 116 (76.8%) responded, 106 (91.4%) of which provided 24 months of usable data for analysis. Among laboratories that provided 24 months of data, the monthly rates of increase for 2013 (preenactment) and 2014 (postenactment) were assessed by fitting two linear trend lines to the 2013 and 2014 monthly data, respectively.

Data from the 106 responding laboratories that provided 24 months of data indicated a 51.1% increase in the number of specimens collected for HCV testing from persons born during 1945–1965, from 538,229 in 2013 to 813,492 in 2014 (Figure 1). During 2013, the average rate of increase was approximately 404 specimens per month. In 2014, the average rate of increase was 1,091 specimens per month.

### Initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia: guideline from the college of American pathologists and the American Society of Hematology [^116xaQyf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

CAP/ASH initial diagnostic workup of acute leukemia — key questions and evidence review: The expert panel met 23 times through teleconference webinars from June 8, 2011 through August 16, 2016, conducted additional work via electronic mail, and met in person July 19, 2013 and again September 15, 2015. Prior to the first in-person meeting, key questions guiding the literature search addressed what clinical and laboratory information should be available during the initial diagnostic evaluation, what specimens and sample types should be evaluated, at diagnosis what tests are required for all patients, which tests should be performed only on a subset of patients including in response to results of initial tests and morphology, where laboratory testing should be performed, and how test results and the diagnosis should be correlated and reported. All expert panelists participated in the systematic evidence review (SER) including title-abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction of high-level studies (i.e., randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines), with a dual review for each study and phase and co-chair adjudication of all conflicts. Because the high-level studies alone and initial extraction points were not sufficient to draft guideline statements, the panel developed additional extraction points, included lower-level study designs, and CAP staff and two contracted methodologists performed a second round of data extraction for the high-level studies and 150 cohort studies; the expert panel co-chairs audited for accuracy and completeness, and a total of 119 studies comprised the final body of studies included in the SER.

### Consensus recommendations on peripheral blood smear review: defining curricular standards and fellow competency [^113bksJN]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Consensus recommendation generation

Previously coded data were used to develop 4 domains of recommendations, ie, curricular considerations, method of PBS review, morphologic considerations, and specific disorders. Disorders were further subcategorized into disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Response rates per round of revision were 87.5%, 87.5%, and 100%.

Strong and unanimous consensus was reached on multiple aspects of PBS education, including curricular considerations, method of review, and morphology (Table 2). All agreed that trainees should learn PBS review through a structured approach that includes the identification of monolayer, use of various magnifications, switching between magnifications, and systematic review of each cell line. Procurement of PBS slides should encompass both patients under the care of the trainee and slide "libraries" to ensure all trainees see similar morphology regardless of personal experience on ward and consult rotations.

Ideal curricula should include education on how PBS review can augment or eliminate the need for more advanced testing and should include discussions on the practical use of PBS within the context of resource limited vs resource rich settings. Trainees should be aware of the growing use of digital microscopy and understand the benefits and limitations of digital microscopy.

Trainees should be able to name and identify common cytoplasmic and nuclear features that aid in diagnosis. CR on individual disorders of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets can be seen in Table 2. Participants agreed that specific emphasis should be placed on disorders in which correct and timely diagnosis is paramount to avoiding significant patient morbidity, acute decompensation, or death. Acute leukemias and hemolytic anemias, specifically TMA, were felt to warrant explicit curricular emphasis. Conversely, fellows should also be competent in the recognition of commonly encountered diagnoses that are more indolent in nature, eg, iron deficiency anemia. However, consensus was not reached on how to balance education in these competing interests.

### Clinical implementation of circulating tumour DNA testing forT790M for detection of treatment resistance in non-small cell lung cancer [^117GvMXx]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

For the patient population where reflex tissue testing is not possible, the optimal timing of retesting these patients by plasma testing for ctDNA remains unclear. We evaluated those patients who received serial blood tests to investigate what clinical indicators might be present to trigger a repeat liquid biopsy. Although no clear clinical trigger was identified, our findings demonstrate that a positive test result was identified in 13% of patients retested within 60 days following an initially negative or inconclusive test, and two patients developed a positive test 6 months after a negative blood test. Of note, the majority of those who become positive for EGFR T790M on sequential blood tests initially received an inconclusive blood test. This suggests that it is particularly important to retest those patients who received an inconclusive result on initial testing. Our data demonstrate that repeat ctDNA testing may be clinically indicated when tissue testing is not feasible and that a substantial percentage of patients with an initially negative test will become positive for EGFR T790M ctDNA at a later date, if offered sequential testing. This finding highlights the importance of further studies to investigate appropriate timing of repeat blood specimen testing for monitoring for EGFR T790M status and repeat ctDNA testing should be offered if tissue reflex testing is not possible, particularly when clinically indicated due to signs of progression.

Take home messages

The droplet digital PCR test for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutations effectively triaged 24% of patients for treatment with third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, avoiding the need for invasive tissue biopsy in these patients.
A positive test result was identified in 13% of patients retested within 60 days following an initially negative or inconclusive test, and positive test results correlated with increased tumour shedding.
Repeat ctDNA testing may be clinically indicated when tissue testing is not feasible and a substantial percentage of patients with an initially negative test will become positive for EGFR T790M ctDNA at a later date, if offered sequential testing.

### Sensitivity of peripheral blood smear review for the diagnosis of Candida fungemia [^113zx4r9]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Case reports have described detection of candidemia by examination of peripheral blood smears. It is unclear whether this method has wider applicability for early detection of fungemia.

Objective

To determine the sensitivity of smear review for detecting candidemia.

Design

Normal and cytopenic blood was spiked with increasing concentrations of yeast. Smears were prepared and reviewed by a pathologist and by technical staff. Staff members blinded to the purpose of the study first performed a routine slide review and then a targeted review for yeast.

Results

The pathologist detected isolated yeast forms at a concentration of 1 to 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. When blinded to the purpose of the study, technical staff could detect Candida in most samples when the yeast concentration was 1 to 5 x 10(7) CFU/mL, but found it in only a small fraction of samples with lower concentrations. When asked to examine the smears specifically for yeast, they could detect it in most samples containing 1 to 5 x 10(6) CFU/mL.

Conclusions

Detection of candidemia by peripheral blood smear examination requires a yeast concentration of 1 to 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL or greater. This degree of fungemia is unusual; therefore, detection of candidemia by blood smear review will not be possible in most cases. Sensitivity of smear review for yeast detection is greatly increased if the microscopist is specifically directed to look for the presence of yeast.

### Significant improvement in diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection by a one-step strategy in a central laboratory: an optimal tool for hepatitis C elimination? [^114umL4E]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design and diagnostic protocols.

This study was an analysis of all HCV diagnostic tests recorded in the laboratory information system (LIS) of Vall d'Hebron Barcelona Hospital (Spain) between January 2015 and December 2018. The laboratory centralizes the analytical tests from a 1,200-bed hospital, as well as all samples coming from primary care centers and other public facilities of Barcelona (1.5 million inhabitants). The study period encompasses two different diagnostic protocols: before March 2018, we actively recommended to perform HCV RNA determination in anti-HCV-positive outpatients upon prior request by the health care provider (six-step protocol) (Fig. 1A); whereas from March 2018, the laboratory used the whole-blood EDTA sample collected for blood count analysis (hematimetry [hemocytometry]) to determine the HCV RNA in all anti-HCV-positive patients (reflex testing or one-step protocol) (Fig. 1B). Results of the HCV RNA test were provided within 24 h after anti-HCV testing, on Monday to Thursday, and within 3 days in case the anti-HCV test was performed on a Friday. Serological testing (anti-HCV determination) was performed on the Cobas 8000 platform (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) with single-use (i.e. disposable) tips. In both protocols, the determination of HCV RNA was performed with a Cobas 6800 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Germany); the blood count analysis prior to determination of HCV RNA was performed by flow cytometry with a Sysmex XN-20 analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Therefore, the sample used for HCV RNA had been previously used for hematimetry studies. However, the Sysmex XN-20 analyzer can perform hematimetric measures without decapping blood tubes (the rubber cap is punched by a needle). The potential use of serum samples previously collected for serology was initially ruled out due to the higher risk of carryover. First, since the analyzer centralizes serological determinations, the system tends to concentrate samples with suspected hepatitis C (i.e. is potentially anti-HCV positive). Second, although the Cobas 8000 analyzer uses disposable tips, samples reach the analytical system uncapped and they are, therefore, exposed to environmental aerosols and other occasional hand manipulations, which may increase the risk of contamination. In contrast, all hematimetry determinations are randomly processed (more than 5,000 a day), meaning that potential anti-HCV-positive cases (about 5 to 10 a day) would be randomly distributed among these 5,000 samples, statistically reducing the probability of cross-contamination associated with that of two anti-HCV-positive cases: one positive HCV RNA located near, and prior to, one negative HCV RNA. In spite of this, a cross-contamination study was performed to ensure the quality and adequacy of this type of sample. Said HCV RNA analysis is only carried out in those cases lacking any data prior to the determination of the viral load (see the algorithm in Fig. 2).

### Incidental identification of neonatal babesiosis: a case report [^115zvhfK]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count was also obtained, with manual differential via peripheral smear review incidentally identifying intraerythrocytic ring forms (Fig. 1). Reflex testing for malarial antigens was negative, and parasite load was formally quantified at 5% parasitemia. A presumptive diagnosis of babesiosis was rendered, and Babesia PCR confirmed that the neonate was positive for B. microti.

Fig. 1
Peripheral blood smear for neonate on initial presentation, with intraerythrocytic forms highlighted (arrows)

Post-hoc evaluation of a peripartum peripheral blood smear from the patient's mother revealed that she had previously undetected, very low (< 1% estimated) parasitemia (Fig. 2) at the time of her concurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia. Subsequent PCR testing, completed at the time of patient's admission, showed that the patient's mother was also PCR-positive for Babesia microti.

Fig. 2
Peripheral blood smear for mother near time of delivery, with intraerythrocytic forms highlighted (arrow)

The infant was diagnosed with neonatal babesiosis. We suspect that the patient was infected with B. microti through vertical transmission given that his mother had antenatal anemia and thrombocytopenia, coupled with perinatal maternal B. microti parasitemia, and because the neonate had low risk epidemiologic profile for post-natal acquisition.

The patient was started on intravenous azithromycin and oral atovaquone. He responded well to antimicrobial therapy, rapidly defervescing and clearing parasitemia by day 6 of therapy. He was treated for a total of 10 days, until 2 consecutive blood smears over 48 h were parasite-free. He had symptomatic anemia during hospitalization, requiring one red blood cell transfusion, with both anemia and thrombocytopenia promptly and stably normalizing over time (Fig. 3).

Discussion

Additional Benefits and Economic Evaluation

Several subsections of this section serve to further inform implementation decisions, while indicating limitations of the current evidence base. Frameworks guiding decision-making exist, such as GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group) Evidence to Decision frameworks, and may be applied by health care decision-makers when choosing to adopt (or adapt) recommendations in new contexts.

To this end, this first subsection refers readers to the data provided in the "Additional Outcomes Data" of the "Results" section, suggesting benefit beyond this review's primary outcome ("number of tests"). These data suggests statistically significant favorable impact (via P values) for studies that could not be meta-analyzed. While the patient-related outcomes provided by some of the studies are distal outcomes, impacted by many factors during the course of care, the following pattern arises: the rates of the patient-important outcomes assessed (eg, morbidity, mortality, and length of stay) were not significantly different pre- or postintervention, therefore interventions apparently were not associated with adverse impact on these outcomes. Additional discussion on limitations associated of the patient-related outcome measures encountered in the current evidence base appears in the "Limitations" section.

Additionally, while concerns associated with the economic evaluation supported by the current evidence base are also noted in the "Limitations" section, what the meta-analyzed "costs of tests" outcome does provide is complementary indication of the proximal effects of these interventions, expressed as cost-savings.

### Perfect vs practical: utilizing hematology thin smears for the diagnosis ofand [^111RXbSV]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the manuscript entitled "Hematology Thin Smears Perform Equally to Parasitology Thick and Thin Blood Smears for the Diagnosis of Plasmodium and Babesia in a Low-Prevalence Setting", the investigators demonstrate that traditional hematology smears (HS) review can have comparable performance to formal blood parasite smears (PS) review. The authors quote a 93.3% sensitivity in comparison to thick smears. This increases to 100% considering only new diagnoses. The implications are that HS can be utilized as a practical and rapid alternative to PS. For clinical laboratories that are limited to only HS capabilities, these findings suggest that they may be able to be less reliant on reference laboratory PS testing, allowing for more rapid diagnosis and management. Even in clinical laboratories that offer both tests, the findings suggest a reassessment of how both HS and PS fit into the diagnostic process for blood parasites. Familiarity with the pros and cons of both approaches allows them to be employed in a way that maximizes patient care impact.

### Regulations regarding reflexive testing and narrative interpretations in laboratory medicine [^112DwmKk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The use of reflexive test selection and patient-specific narrative interpretations in laboratory medicine is associated with a host of compliance issues and government regulations. Reflexive testing is associated with many advantages for patients and their physicians, but if not adequately organized it has the potential for inefficient test ordering and abuse by physicians and laboratories. Patient-specific narrative interpretations in laboratory medicine, much more than fixed comments generated by a computer with a specific test result, also provide clinical and financial benefit when done effectively. Regulations exist to ensure that the physician-provided information has clinical value. This report describes the compliance and billing regulations regarding reflex testing and narrative interpretations. The codes used for narrative interpretations in laboratory medicine are also presented, as well as the use of those codes to obtain payment for the interpretation provided.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^1145sWrh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We developed a list of key findings in 'Summary of findings' tables and determined the certainty in the summary estimates for each test and findings, using the GRADE approach (Schünemann 2020a; Schünemann 2020b. Starting at high certainty, we downgraded meta‐analyses by one level when at least half of the studies had high risk of bias on one or more domains; we downgraded for indirectness when at least half of the studies in the meta‐analyses had high concerns regarding applicability on at least one domain; we downgraded for imprecision when fewer people with the target condition were included than would have been needed to achieve the sensitivity estimates listed, with a width of the confidence interval of at most 10 percentage points; and we downgraded for inconsistency when study estimates differed more than 20 percentage points from each other. We did not consider publication bias to be a problem.

Updating

We will undertake the searches of published literature, preprints, and new test approvals weekly, and, dependent on the number of new and important studies found, we will consider updating each review with each search if resources allow.

### Impact of a prospective review program for reference laboratory testing requests [^112b9nGQ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To control the cost of reference laboratory testing, to ensure that its usage is medically appropriate, and to review the contribution of reference testing to patient care at our institution.

Methods

A multidisciplinary institutional committee was convened to manage the utilization of reference testing. A subset of tests was designated to be reviewed in real time by a team of clinical pathologists in consultation with clinical subject matter experts.

Results

Twelve percent of testing requests, accounting for approximately 18% of send-out costs, were determined to be clinically unnecessary or would not produce actionable results at that point during that patient's care and were therefore not performed. This intervention, combined with insourcing of frequently requested tests, resulted in a reduction in the costs of reference testing to less than half of that predicted by the rate of growth from 2005 to 2009. Molecular diagnostic tests displayed a higher cost per test than other forms of testing but had a similar degree of clinical impact.

Conclusions

Formal prospective review of reference laboratory testing requests resulted in substantial cost containment and improved the efficiency of patient care.

### An electronic health record-based solution to reduce the volume of CBC differentials performed on inpatients [^112wpQSv]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We sought to investigate the use of same-day, repeat complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential orders in a large pediatric institution and design an intervention to limit CBC with differential testing and, thereby, manual differential performance to once per calendar day, without placing a burden on ordering clinicians.

Methods

We created a seamless electronic health record (EHR)-based back-end workflow that reaccessions CBC with differential orders to a CBC without differential if a CBC with differential has been resulted within that calendar day. Clinicians have an opportunity to override at the time of test order entry in the EHR.

Results

Repeat CBC with differential orders originated predominantly in intensive care units (ICUs) and oncology inpatient units and accounted for 18% of all CBC with differential orders. Implementation of our EHR workflow led to an average annual reduction of 9% in CBC with differential tests and a 16% reduction in manual differentials performed. This change amounts to a combined annual cost savings (direct cost of testing plus laboratory technologist time) of approximately $45000 and improved CBC with differential test turnaround times.

Conclusions

Our EHR-based solution resulted in a substantial and sustained decrease in CBC with differential tests and manual differential slide reviews performed in a critically ill pediatric population. This approach is a potential alternative to traditional educational and other clinician-dependent stewardship interventions that aim to improve test utilization.

Malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. knowlesi) — urgent microscopy, repeat intervals, and confirmatory testing: STAT microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films is required, with repeat testing every 12–24 h for a total of 3 examinations before ruling out malaria; rapid antigen detection tests should be followed by confirmatory blood films within 12–24 h, and antigen tests lack sensitivity at low parasitemia and do not differentiate all species, whereas PCR from some reference laboratories will detect and differentiate all species; calculating percent parasitemia and species identification on films is required for management and response monitoring.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^116wh7ZK]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Reflex Testing

Five studies assessing the effectiveness of reflex testing-alone practices (ie, not in combination with another practice type) were included in this systematic review.

Body-of-Evidence Qualitative Analysis

Five studies in the reflex testing practice category were qualitatively analyzed using the LMBP rating criteria, with results summarized in Table 6. They have a "moderate" rating for the overall strength of evidence of effectiveness in relation to the primary outcome measure assessed and the number of tests.

Table 6
Body-of-Evidence Qualitative Analysis for Reflex Testing Practice a

For the five studies assessing the impact of reflex testing, standard effect measures (OR or Cohen d with its standard error) could not be determined for three of them (Bonaguri et al, Tampoia et al, and Wu et al). Thus, two reflex testing studies were meta-analyzed in relation to the primary outcome measure.

Meta-Analysis

Two of the five eligible studies had sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis, with the primary outcome measure of number of tests. The forest plot in Figure 7 presents the meta-analysis results.

Figure 7
Forest plot for reflex testing studies. CI, confidence interval.

The summary OR (95% CI) is 0.008 (0.003–0.022). This indicates a substantial effect that is statistically significant. The results are homogeneous (I 2 < 0.001%, P = 0.513).

### AGA institute rapid review and recommendations on the role of pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing and endoscopy [^115hRStE]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 testing performance — specimen source and collection technique: Specimen sources for SARS-CoV-2 testing include nasopharyngeal (NP), mid-turbinate (MT), nasal, throat, or saliva, and no recommendation was made for asymptomatic patients, which comprise the outpatient endoscopy population, as available data are limited. Collection technique also impacts diagnostic test accuracy, and particularly for NP sample collection, training is beneficial to ensure adequate specimen collection; a New England Journal of Medicine resource and the FDA's website provide technique instructions. Collection of specimens is most commonly performed by health care workers, but some tests allow patient self-collection; however, published guidance from the IDSA indicates there is no role for self-collection of samples in asymptomatic individuals and therefore this practice is not recommended in the context of endoscopy operations.

Clarifying wording, 'the word "negative" in this context should be construed as inclusive of diagnostic terms such as "reactive", "negative for malignancy", "inconclusive", and "nondiagnostic"'. Stakeholder feedback showed 'overwhelming agreement with this recommendation as written (91.6%) or with modification (6.2%)'.

### Fetal blood sampling [^114yCw4k]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fetal blood sampling — aneuploidy testing and mosaicism indications have largely been replaced by less invasive diagnostics: Rapid karyotyping to diagnose aneuploidy is no longer an indication for FBS; chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis with fluorescence in-situ hybridization followed by karyotyping or chromosomal microarray can detect the majority of fetuses with common aneuploidies within 24–48 hours and yield a complete karyotype or microarray result in 7–10 days; noninvasive prenatal testing can also provide karyotype results for chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, and Y in 7–10 days; mosaicism — the presence of > 1 cell line — historically prompted FBS, but limited prognostic utility has decreased procedures for this indication.

### Historical data decrease complete blood count reflex blood smear review rates without missing patients with acute leukaemia [^112613Ev]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The availability of historical data decreases the rate of blood smear review rates in outpatients, but we are unaware of studies done at referral centres. In the following study, we determined the effect of historical data on the rates of peripheral blood smears over a 3-month period and then the detection rate of patients with acute leukaemia.

Methods

All results of complete blood counts (CBCs) tested on three ADVIA 120 analyzers at the regional Rabin Medical Centre, Beilinson Campus over a 3-month period were accessed on a computerised laboratory information system. Over a 3-month period, we determined the proportion of total CBC and patients with criteria for a manual differential count and the actual number of peripheral blood smears done. Finally, we determined the proportion of 100 consecutive patients with acute leukaemia detected using our criteria that included limiting reflex testing according to historical data.

Results

Over the 3-month period, there were 34,827 tests done in 12,785 patients. Without historical data, our smear rate would have been 24.5%, but with the availability of historical data, the blood smear review rate was 5.6%. The detection rate for cases of acute leukaemia was 100%.

Conclusions

We conclude that the availability of previous test results significantly reduces the need for blood smear review without missing any patients with acute leukaemia.

### Evaluating pathologist practices in peripheral blood smear review: a comprehensive practice survey [^112tuZbc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Widely accepted standardized criteria for peripheral blood (PB) smear review do not exist. The aim of this study was to collect data regarding PB smear review practices across multiple institutions, with a focus on pathologist review.

Methods

A 23-question survey was developed by members of the Society for Hematopathology (SH) Education Committee and distributed to SH members. The survey included questions on practice environment and PB smear review practices, including trainee involvement.

Results

Of 725 members contacted, 137 (19%) completed the entire survey. Over half of practices examined 5 to 20 smears a day. All respondents reported using complete blood count/differential leukocyte count data and clinical history as part of smear review. The reported proportion of laboratory-initiated vs clinician-requested reviews varied across respondents. Clinician-requested smear reviews were more likely to be billed and issued as a separate pathology report. Glass slide review (as opposed to digital microscopy) was used by most respondents. All respondents affirmed that PB smear review is an essential component of pathology training programs. Numerous free-text comments were submitted by respondents regarding their own experiences with PB smear review and suggested improvements.

Conclusions

This survey elucidated the spectrum of practice patterns for pathologist review of blood smears and identified potential areas for process improvement.

IDSA 2020 babesiosis guideline — diagnostic confirmation of acute babesiosis states "we recommend peripheral blood smear examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than antibody testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)" and comments that diagnosis should be based on epidemiological risk factors and clinical evidence and confirmed by smear or PCR. PCR is described as "more sensitive than a blood smear examination" and "If blood smears are negative and babesiosis is still suspected, PCR testing should be performed". Smear technique notes that "A review of at least 200–300 fields under oil immersion will increase sensitivity", that "Both thick and thin smears should be prepared and examined by experienced personnel", and that "merozoites organized in tetrads (Maltese cross forms) are pathognomonic of babesiosis". Antibody testing guidance states "Babesia-specific antibody testing should not be used for routine diagnosis of acute babesiosis", in part because many patients "remain seropositive for a year or more after resolution of disease".

### Perfect vs practical: utilizing hematology thin smears for the diagnosis ofand [^113Jmjnj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study is important because it highlights that the Wright Giemsa smear can play an important role in the diagnosis of blood parasites. Clinical laboratories should consider this as they evaluate the training of technologists and diagnostic workflows. The identification and subsequent reporting of potential blood parasites should be part of the training of all technologists who perform the Wright Giemsa smear examination. While definitive identification may be challenging with the Wright Giemsa or beyond the training of all technologists performing HS, having mechanisms to report the possible presence of blood parasites may allow for more timely patient management.

Furthermore, if a formal blood parasite examination is ordered and a delay is anticipated, efforts can be made to have parallel Wright Giemsa staining ordered as well. While providers often do order these tests in parallel, it is also important for them to understand that the HS examination can be utilized as a rapid screen while awaiting PS examination (if the laboratory is formally evaluating HS for blood parasites and reporting the findings). Complicating this is the fact that reporting of complete blood cell results is often performed utilizing automated technology. The performance of these instruments for the detection of blood parasites is variable and of limited study. For one commonly utilized flow cytometry-based instrument, the Sysmex hematology analyzer, the sensitivity has been reported to range from 46% to 100%, depending on the study. Yet another automated analyzer, relying on digital image analysis from prepared smears, yielded an overall sensitivity of 23.5%. In many laboratories, peripheral smears are only performed when abnormalities are detected by these automated instruments or when a peripheral smear review is manually ordered. As such, for providers to use HS as a rapid screen, there needs to be reporting clarity regarding whether a manual review of the stain was performed. Making a manual review option accessible on all shifts will better allow Wright Giemsa staining to serve as a rapid blood parasite screen.

### Effectiveness of practices to support appropriate laboratory test utilization: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review and meta-analysis [^116cT25h]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of practices used to support appropriate clinical laboratory test utilization.

Methods

This review followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Medicine Best Practices A6 cycle method. Eligible studies assessed one of the following practices for effect on outcomes relating to over- or underutilization: computerized provider order entry (CPOE), clinical decision support systems/tools (CDSS/CDST), education, feedback, test review, reflex testing, laboratory test utilization (LTU) teams, and any combination of these practices. Eligible outcomes included intermediate, systems outcomes (eg, number of tests ordered/performed and cost of tests), as well as patient-related outcomes (eg, length of hospital stay, readmission rates, morbidity, and mortality).

Results

Eighty-three studies met inclusion criteria. Fifty-one of these studies could be meta-analyzed. Strength of evidence ratings for each practice ranged from high to insufficient.

Conclusion

Practice recommendations are made for CPOE (specifically, modifications to existing CPOE), reflex testing, and combined practices. No recommendation for or against could be made for CDSS/CDST, education, feedback, test review, and LTU. Findings from this review serve to inform guidance for future studies.

Cytogenetic sample preparation for neoplastic tissues — touch imprint, cytospin, and FFPE sections — is outlined as follows: a pathologist "should be involved in selecting the tissue for touch imprint preparations", and these "should be made by lightly touching the piece of tumor tissue to a glass slide without smearing, followed by air drying". Cytospin preparations "are useful for a concentration of samples with very low cellularity (eg, cerebrospinal fluid)". For FFPE, "Tumor sections cut to a validated thickness and mounted on positively charged organosilane-coated (silanized) slides work well" and the laboratory "should request several unstained sections and one hematoxylin and eosin–stained sequentially cut section", with review before scoring because "it can be difficult to differentiate normal cells from malignant cells using only 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstain", and "the technologist should be clear where the malignant cells of interest are located on the slide".

Item 6: Included studies

Indicate the number and type of included studies and the participants and relevant characteristics of the studies (including the reference standard).

Examples

6a: "We included 27 unique studies involving 9557 participants. Sixteen studies (59%) were performed in low‐ or middle‐income countries".

6b: "For the diagnostic accuracy of HBsAg from dried blood spot compared to venous blood, 19 studies were included in a quantitative meta-analysis, and 23 in a narrative review".

6c: "Of the 40 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 33 compared rapid diagnostic test and/or enzyme immunoassays against enzyme immunoassays and 7 against nucleic-acid test as reference standards. Thirty studies assessed diagnostic accuracy of 33 brands of rapid diagnostic tests in 23,716 individuals from 23 countries using enzyme immunoassays as the reference standard".

6d: "All studies were at high risk of bias for the index test domain because no reported thresholds were prespecified".

Explanation

Authors should report the number of included studies and participants (and, if possible, the number of participants with the target condition) and any other key characteristics (example 6a). Some studies may be included in the qualitative part of the review but not in the quantitative synthesis (example 6b). If the included studies use multiple reference standards, this should be reported (example 6c). This information enables readers to gauge the amount of summarised evidence and its applicability to the review question. Reviews with few included studies and a limited number of participants may produce imprecise accuracy estimates and may not add substantive value compared with the individual studies. Review authors are also invited to summarise their assessment of the quality of evidence (that is, risk of bias and concerns about applicability) and highlight their main source of concern (example 6d).

Item 7: Synthesis of results

Include the results for the analysis of diagnostic accuracy, preferably indicating the number of studies and participants. Describe test accuracy including variability; if meta-analysis was done, include summary results and confidence intervals.

### Methodology for constructing guidance [^112sHi4d]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Although guidance exists for the use of many laboratory tests in a wide range of clinical situations, this guidance is spread among a range of literature sources, and is often directed at laboratory specialists rather than test users. Individual general practices display large variations in standardised test requesting, yet much of their testing activity involves a relatively small range of tests. This paper describes a methodological approach to review the available evidence and guidance and to extract relevant primary research work to examine a range of testing scenarios in general practice, with the aim of formulating guidance based on the best available evidence or consensus opinions.

Ask: Review Questions and Analytic Framework

The question addressed through this systematic review is: "What is the effectiveness of practices used to support appropriate clinical LTU?" This review question was developed in the context of the analytic framework depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Analytic framework. CPOE, computerized provider order entry.

Eligibility criteria, relevant population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and setting elements are:

- **Population**: o Personnel legally authorized to order clinical laboratory tests (ie, targeted population for test utilization management interventions) o General patient population (no restrictions, including inpatient and outpatient settings, in terms of study eligibility for the systematic review)
- Interventions (quality improvement practice interventions to manage/support appropriate clinical LTU, with quality gaps expressed as inappropriate over- or underutilization of testing): CPOE (CPOE replacement of written test orders and modifications to an existing CPOE), CDSS/CDST, education, feedback, test review, LTU teams, reflex testing, and combined practices.
- **Comparison**: experimental (eg, randomized controlled trials) and other comparative studies designs (eg, before and after studies) in which the effect of a utilization management intervention was compared to a group lacking it.
- **Outcomes**: o Number of tests (eg, number of test orders, number of tests performed) o Costs/charges (eg, cost of test orders, cost of tests performed, cost per diagnosis, overall health care costs) o Turnaround time (eg, where reduction in the number of inappropriate tests may not be relevant) o Diagnostic yield and diagnostic detection rate o Length of hospital stay o Other patient-related outcomes (eg, patient satisfaction, patient safety events related to delayed or incorrect diagnosis, adverse drug reactions, readmission rates, morbidity, and mortality)
- Setting: o Facility: any health care facility in which laboratory testing is ordered/performed, including reference laboratory testing o Targeted testing: any testing identified within eligible studies as being inappropriately utilized (ie, over- or underutilized)

### The tahoe study: bias in the interpretation of Papanicolaou test results when human papillomavirus status is known [^1144f41d]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) status is expected to bias the morphologic evaluation of Papanicolaou (Pap) test results.

Objective

To characterize Pap test result interpretive bias when the HPV status is known at the microscopic evaluation.

Design

Forty HPV-positive liquid-based Pap test results initially interpreted as negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy were selected from a quality assurance program, separated into 2 groups of 20 slides each, and circulated in 2 groups to 22 members of the College of American Pathologists Cytopathology Committee. Each member reviewed each case and indicated whether the result was negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy or was an epithelial cell abnormality (ECA). The participants assessed the severity of ECAs using the Bethesda System. The participants were not informed of the HPV status in the initial review round. Each group of 20 slides was then distributed to the opposite group (to avoid slide recall), and the participants were informed that all slides were from patients who were high-risk HPV positive. Differences in the responses between groups were analyzed by χ(2) test and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test at the .05 significance level.

Results

Without knowledge of the HPV status, slides were more often categorized as negative for squamous intraepithelial lesion or malignancy and less likely identified as an ECA (P < .001). There was an increase across all categories of ECAs in the biased responses compared with the unbiased responses (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Knowledge of positive HPV status biases morphologic Pap test result interpretation. If the HPV status is positive, observers are more likely to report a Pap test result as abnormal across all categories of ECAs.
