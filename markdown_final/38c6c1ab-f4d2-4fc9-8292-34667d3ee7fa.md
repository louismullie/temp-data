## Question

Can doxycycline reverse type 1 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether doxycycline can reverse type 1 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "reversal" of T1D would clinically and biologically require. Then, I should review exactly what the provided evidence shows about doxycycline and β-cell biology, making sure to distinguish in vitro gene-switch results from any in vivo therapeutic data. Next, I will verify whether any clinical trials or regulatory labels support a T1D indication for doxycycline. After that, I need to consider the broader context of disease-modifying therapies in T1D and whether doxycycline's pharmacology could plausibly meet those requirements. Finally, I will synthesize the data, consider safety, and state a conclusion with appropriate caveats [^113fwHw4] [^112KrFgn].

> Let me first confirm what "reversal" of T1D would entail. Clinically meaningful reversal would require restoration of endogenous insulin secretion sufficient to maintain normoglycemia without exogenous insulin, which in turn demands both regeneration or replacement of functional β-cell mass and durable suppression of the autoimmune process that destroyed those cells in the first place, and by the time of clinical diagnosis, substantial β-cell mass has already been lost, so the bar is high for any intervention to achieve both regeneration and immune tolerance [^113fwHw4] [^117E47wQ] [^111E1Pj4].

> Now, I will examine the key paper linking doxycycline to β-cell replication. At first glance, I might think doxycycline directly induces β-cell proliferation; wait, let me verify the experimental context — this study used a tetracycline-inducible (Tet-On) adenoviral system in human cadaveric islets to drive cdk6/cyclin D1 expression, with doxycycline acting as the molecular switch in vitro, showing dose-responsive increases in proliferation up to about 20-fold, and proliferation ceased upon doxycycline withdrawal and resumed with re-exposure, but crucially this is a gene-therapy construct in cultured islets, not systemic antibiotic therapy in living humans [^111g6SgT] [^1174F5rY] [^115KiwK1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whether there is any in vivo or autoimmune-context evidence in that line of work. There is no in vivo demonstration that oral doxycycline regenerates β-cells in animals or humans, no evaluation within an ongoing autoimmune milieu, and no clinical translation reported; moreover, tetracyclines are known to impair mitochondrial translation in mammalian cells, which can confound Tet-based experimental systems and limits extrapolation of these results to therapeutic antibiotic use in patients [^111g6SgT] [^1174F5rY] [^117Tpybq].

> Next, I should review regulatory and clinical evidence. I need to check the FDA labels and recognized indications for doxycycline; I should double-check across SPL entries to be sure — doxycycline is indicated for a range of infections and certain dermatologic conditions, but there is no indication for diabetes of any type, and I do not see any T1D clinical efficacy data on label or in the provided documents; conversely, other antidiabetic agents like exenatide are explicitly not indicated for T1D, underscoring how carefully these distinctions are maintained in labeling and guidelines [^1142qeoU] [^1177NLvP] [^111pWixk] [^114jUT6C] [^115fAYu2].

> I will now examine the broader disease-modifying context in T1D to calibrate plausibility. The only FDA-approved therapy that modifies T1D natural history is teplizumab, which delays progression from Stage 2 (autoantibody-positive, dysglycemia) to Stage 3 T1D by a median of 25 months; it does not reverse established T1D, and durable reversal remains elusive despite extensive trials, with growing consensus that combination strategies targeting immune tolerance and β-cell preservation or replacement may be required [^114WynCy] [^112QaV8Y] [^111QNjuQ] [^11284WR5].

> But wait, what if doxycycline's nonantibiotic, anti-inflammatory properties could mitigate autoimmunity sufficiently to protect β-cells; I should review this mechanistically. Tetracyclines do inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate inflammatory pathways, yet these effects are broad and nonspecific, and there is no evidence that doxycycline eliminates islet-specific autoreactive T cells or induces durable regulatory tolerance — the two pillars required for lasting disease modification in T1D; while ribosome-targeting antibiotics can suppress T cell effector function via mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition, that observation is not islet-specific nor validated as a safe, durable approach to halt T1D autoimmunity in humans [^115r57uW] [^111A7C4s] [^1169nqPd] [^111asdX2] [^112KLQSf].

> I should confirm safety and feasibility if someone were to consider long-term doxycycline off-label; let me check. Although long-term doxycycline use is feasible in selected contexts, class effects include photosensitivity, gastrointestinal upset, rare autoimmune syndromes with some tetracyclines, drug–drug interactions, and occasional idiosyncratic events such as hypoglycemia reported in an insulin-treated patient; without proven benefit on T1D outcomes, the risk–benefit calculus does not support chronic use for this purpose [^111AMsrh] [^116NakEx] [^115SmSma].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my conclusion aligns with the totality of data. The only link between doxycycline and β-cell proliferation is as a Tet-On gene switch in vitro, not as a systemic therapy; there is no evidence that oral doxycycline regenerates β-cell mass in vivo, no demonstration that it abrogates islet autoimmunity, and no clinical trials or regulatory support for T1D reversal; by contrast, even targeted immunotherapies currently only delay disease, not reverse it, so doxycycline cannot be considered a therapy that reverses T1D at this time [^111g6SgT] [^1174F5rY] [^113fwHw4] [^114WynCy].

> As a clinical bottom line, I should emphasize evidence-based care while remaining open to future validated advances. Current standards focus on insulin therapy and individualized comprehensive management per ADA guidance, with disease-modifying therapy limited to delay of onset in presymptomatic stages; no credible evidence supports using doxycycline to reverse established T1D, and patients should be counseled accordingly and steered toward participation in legitimate clinical trials if interested in disease-modifying strategies [^114u4Z98] [^112KrFgn] [^114iTwS1] [^114WynCy].

No, doxycycline **does not reverse type 1 diabetes** in humans. There is **no clinical evidence** that doxycycline preserves or restores beta-cell function in T1D, and it is not recommended for this purpose by any guidelines. While doxycycline has anti-inflammatory effects and can inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in immune cells [^112KLQSf] [^117Tpybq], these properties have not translated into clinical benefit for T1D [^112QaV8Y]. The only approved therapy that delays progression in stage 2 T1D is teplizumab [^114WynCy], and insulin remains the standard of care [^114u4Z98].

---

## Mechanisms of doxycycline relevant to type 1 diabetes

Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. These include **inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis**, which can impair mitochondrial function in immune cells and potentially reduce their activity [^112KLQSf] [^117Tpybq], and **anti-inflammatory effects**, including inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which may theoretically reduce inflammation [^1169nqPd]. These mechanisms suggest a potential role in modulating immune responses, but their **clinical relevance to T1D remains unproven** [^114hrzEr].

---

## Preclinical evidence

Preclinical studies have explored doxycycline's effects on immune cells and inflammation. They report **immune cell modulation**, with doxycycline impairing T-cell effector function via inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, and **reduced inflammation**, with anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in various models, including rheumatoid arthritis and dermatological conditions [^1169nqPd] [^116nLUqN] [^115r57uW]. However, there is **no direct preclinical evidence** that doxycycline reverses established T1D or regenerates pancreatic beta cells.

---

## Clinical evidence

Currently, there is **no clinical evidence** supporting doxycycline to reverse T1D in humans. No trials have demonstrated that it preserves or restores beta-cell function in patients with T1D [^11284WR5].

---

## Safety considerations

Doxycycline is generally well tolerated, but long-term use may pose risks [^1142qeoU]. These include **mitochondrial dysfunction**, as prolonged doxycycline use can impair mitochondrial function and potentially affect metabolic health [^117Tpybq], and **antibiotic resistance**, since prolonged antibiotic exposure can contribute to resistance, a significant public health concern [^1144gAv6].

---

## Current standard of care

The current standard of care for T1D involves **insulin therapy**, glucose monitoring, and lifestyle management [^112KrFgn]. Recent advances include immunomodulatory therapies such as **teplizumab**, which has been shown to delay the progression of T1D in at-risk individuals [^114WynCy].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting doxycycline to reverse T1D in humans [^112KrFgn]. Although doxycycline has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, these have not been shown to preserve or restore beta-cell function in T1D. The standard of care remains insulin therapy and glucose monitoring, while emerging immunomodulatory therapies show promise in delaying disease progression [^114WynCy].

### Regulated and reversible induction of adult human β-cell replication [^111g6SgT]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Induction of proliferation in adult human β-cells is challenging. It can be accomplished by introduction of cell cycle molecules such as cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (cdk6) and cyclin D1, but their continuous overexpression raises oncogenic concerns. We attempted to mimic normal, transient, perinatal human β-cell proliferation by delivering these molecules in a regulated and reversible manner. Adult cadaveric islets were transduced with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible adenoviruses expressing cdk6 or cyclin D1. End points were cdk6/cyclin D1 expression and human β-cell proliferation, survival, and function.

Increasing doses of Dox led to marked dose- and time-related increases in cdk6 and cyclin D1, accompanied by a 20-fold increase in β-cell proliferation. Notably, Dox withdrawal resulted in a reversal of both cdk6 and cyclin D1 expression as well as β-cell proliferation. Re-exposure to Dox reinduced both cdk/cyclin expression and proliferation. β-Cell function and survival were not adversely affected. The adenoviral tetracycline (tet)-on system has not been used previously to drive human β-cell proliferation. Human β-cells can be induced to proliferate or arrest in a regulated, reversible manner, temporally and quantitatively mimicking the transient perinatal physiological proliferation that occurs in human β-cells.

### Tresiba [^116UsMoz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], a total of 77 (7%) of the 1,102 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 1 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 9 (1%) were 75 years or older. A total of 670 (25%) of the 2,713 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 80 (3%) were 75 years or older. Differences in safety or effectiveness were not suggested in subgroup analyses comparing subjects older than 65 years to younger subjects.

In the safety outcomes trial (DEVOTE), a total of 1,983 (52%) of the 3,818 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes were 65 years or older, and 381 (10%) were 75 years or older. Differences in safety or effectiveness were not observed in these subgroup analyses.

Nevertheless, greater caution should be exercised when TRESIBA is administered to geriatric patients since greater sensitivity of some older individuals to the effects of TRESIBA cannot be ruled out. The initial dosing, dose increments, and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may be more difficult to recognize in geriatric patients.

### Type 1 diabetes: Translating mechanistic observations into effective clinical outcomes [^113fwHw4]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains an important health problem, particularly in Western countries, where the incidence has been increasing in younger children. In 1986, Eisenbarth described T1D as a chronic autoimmune disease. Work over the past three-and-a-half decades has identified many of the genetic, immunological, and environmental factors that are involved in the disease and have led to hypotheses concerning its pathogenesis. Clinical trials have been conducted to test these hypotheses but have had mixed results.

The findings that have led to our concepts of the disease mechanisms involved in T1D and the clinical studies promoted by these studies are discussed here. Findings from preclinical and clinical studies support the original proposed model for how T1D develops but have also suggested that this disease is more complex than was originally thought and will require broader treatment approaches.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: An updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^115r57uW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

As for systemic treatments of papules and pustules, there is low-certainty evidence that tetracycline is effective and moderate-certainty evidence for doxycycline (40 mg MR). There is low-certainty evidence that 40 mg MR doxycycline is at least as effective as 100 mg, with fewer adverse events with 40 mg MR. The evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose minocycline 45 mg is of low certainty and of very low certainty for azithromycin. There is probably little to no difference between minocycline 100 mg and doxycycline 40 mg MR (moderate-certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events have been reported in rare cases with minocycline, such as autoimmune hepatitis, lupus erythematosus, and hyperpigmentation of the skin and tissues. Low-dose isotretinoin 0.25 mg/kg results in far more participants with a minimum 90% lesion count reduction when compared with placebo (high-certainty evidence). Isotretinoin is known to be teratogenic and should therefore not be prescribed to pregnant women or women who are trying to become pregnant. Compared with doxycycline (100 mg tapered to 50 mg after 2 weeks), low-dose isotretinoin 0.3 mg/kg probably results in a small effect, but that difference in reducing lesion counts may not be important. Both oral isotretinoin and oral doxycycline showed important reductions in lesion counts (moderate-certainty evidence).

For most treatments, or combinations thereof, there is no clear evidence favoring any with regard to higher remission rates or fewer adverse events. However, more participants experienced an adverse event with topical azelaic acid.

### Prevention of type 1 diabetes [^1172sQcV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of the loss of beta cells in type 1 diabetes is a major goal of research. Knowledge of genetic susceptibility, increasing ability to predict who may be at risk, recognition of the potential clinical impact of residual insulin secretion after diagnosis, and the development of new immunomodulatory agents have supported an increasing number of clinical trials to prevent beta-cell loss. Interventions can be targeted at three stages: before the development of autoimmunity (primary prevention), after autoimmunity is recognized (secondary prevention), or after diagnosis when significant numbers of beta cells remain (tertiary prevention).

Thus far, several agents show promise when given shortly after diagnosis, but no interventions before diagnosis have shown benefit. Knowledge in this area has grown quickly in recent years and will continue to grow rapidly with several international collaborative efforts underway.

### Tresiba [^114JwrxB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 2713 adults with type 2 diabetes to Tresiba with a mean exposure duration of 36 weeks in six open-label trials: Study D, E, F, G, H, and I [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The mean age was 58 years, with 3% being older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent were male, 71% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 13% were Hispanic. The mean BMI was 30 kg/m². The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years, and the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.3%. A history of neuropathy, ophthalmopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular disease at baseline was reported for 14%, 10%, 6%, and 0.6% of participants, respectively. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 83 mL/min/1.73 m², and 9% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Common adverse reactions (excluding hypoglycemia) occurring in Tresiba-treated subjects during clinical trials in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Common adverse reactions were defined as reactions occurring in ≥ 5% of the population studied. Hypoglycemia is not shown in these tables but is discussed in a dedicated subsection below.

### Have we pushed the needle for treatment of type 1 diabetes [^111QNjuQ]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Studies with immunologics have shown that the natural history of type 1 diabetes can be modified. These studies have targeted key mediators of the disease, and recent analyses together with studies in preclinical models have identified mechanisms that may be involved in the clinical effects. Several issues remain, including the specificity of the interventions, adverse effects of the treatments, and the duration of their effects. Future studies are likely to include more specific approaches with agents such as cell therapies with selected immune regulatory subsets, antigen-specific therapies, and combinations of agents with complementary mechanisms of activity.

### C-peptide: Much more than a byproduct of insulin biosynthesis [^115cbCN7]. Pancreas (2004). Low credibility.

During the past decade, numerous studies in both humans and animals have demonstrated that C-peptide, although not influencing blood sugar control, might play a role in preventing and potentially reversing some of the chronic complications of type 1 diabetes. The aim of this paper is to present an up-to-date review of C-peptide, focusing on its role in insulin biosynthesis and in the classification of diabetes mellitus, as well as its potential clinical applications.

- **Methods and results**: The relevant literature cited in the MEDLINE database shows that the measurement of C-peptide production combined with screening for the presence of islet-cell and other autoantibodies seems to exert an important role in the accurate differentiation between patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both experimental and clinical data provide evidence suggesting that combined replacement of insulin and C-peptide has potential therapeutic value in patients with type 1 diabetes.

- **Conclusions**: Further study in this area is warranted, but the findings that pancreas transplants promote the reversal of diabetic neuropathy and stabilization of diabetic retinopathy and that both pancreas and islet transplants lead to the reversal of diabetic nephropathy lend credence to the concept that combined replacement of insulin and C-peptide may more effectively mitigate the inexorable progression of diabetes-related complications.

### Novel approach for assessing outcomes of type 1 diabetes prevention trials over a fixed time interval [^114mUeH6]. Diabetes (2025). High credibility.

Challenges in time-to-event type 1 diabetes (T1D) prevention trial design can yield negative results even for treatments that may actually improve disease pathology. We evaluated whether a binary metabolic endpoint for a 12-month change from baseline to 1 year post-randomization could be useful in T1D prevention trials. This approach detected treatment effects at least as well as standard primary endpoints with shorter follow-up. Fixed interval metabolic endpoints should be used in combination with traditional T1D endpoints to better understand treatment effects of preventive agents.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: Report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^111AMsrh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Although long-term safety and tolerability studies have not been performed with doxycycline as a malaria chemoprophylaxis, similar drugs in the same class, tetracycline and minocycline, have been used in equivalent doses (less than 1 g/day for tetracycline, 50 mg/day to 100 mg twice a day for minocycline) for a few months to several years in the treatment of various dermatological conditions. This suggests that doxycycline can be used for long-term malaria chemoprophylaxis. When used at this dosage, tetracyclines were found in some studies to cause no abnormalities in renal and hepatic function when taken for as long as 5 years and, in one study, for as long as 13 years.

- **Adverse effects**: There have been several case reports of minocycline-associated autoimmune hepatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome in individuals who used minocycline at 100 mg or more daily for more than 1 year. Of note, doxycycline users were not found to have an increased risk of hepatotoxicity in one matched case-control study. Scleral, dental, and dermal hyperpigmentation has also been reported in patients taking long-term minocycline as early as 1 month after initiation of treatment. However, this hyperpigmentation has been shown to fade after discontinuation of the medication.

- **Comparative studies**: In a 2-year, double-blind comparison of minocycline (100 mg twice a day) and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, only 10% of patients withdrew because of rash or gastrointestinal symptoms. Overall, these case reports and studies observed rare to occasional adverse events associated with long-term use of other tetracyclines.

### Population response to information on reversibility of type 2 diabetes [^114zzPKJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Following the publication of the Counterpoint Study, which investigated the reversibility of type 2 diabetes using a very low energy diet, public interest surged. This prompted the authors to provide general information about reversing diabetes on a website. Soon after, individuals began sharing their personal experiences of attempting to reverse their diabetes. We have compiled this information regarding the effects of energy restriction in motivated individuals with type 2 diabetes, as achieved outside a research setting.

- **Methods**: We evaluated emails, letters, and telephone communications received between July 2011 and September 2012 (n = 77; 66 men, 11 women). The median duration of diabetes was 5.5 years (ranging from 3 months to 28 years). Reversal of diabetes was defined as achieving fasting capillary blood glucose levels of less than 7.0 mmol/l, sustained HbA1c of less than 6.5% without the use of diabetes medications, and reporting living life free of diabetes. Results reflect personal experiences shared by individuals outside a formal research context.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2009 [^114WDCTH]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Screening for type 1 diabetes generally occurs when individuals present with acute symptoms of diabetes and markedly elevated blood glucose levels. Most cases are diagnosed soon after the onset of hyperglycemia. However, evidence from type 1 diabetes prevention studies suggests that the measurement of islet autoantibodies can identify individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Such testing may be appropriate in high-risk individuals, such as those with prior transient hyperglycemia or relatives with type 1 diabetes, particularly in the context of clinical research studies. Widespread clinical testing of asymptomatic, low-risk individuals is not currently recommended, as it is likely to identify very few at-risk individuals in the general population.

Individuals who screen positive should be counseled about their risk of developing diabetes. Clinical studies are being conducted to test various methods of preventing or reversing early type 1 diabetes in those with evidence of autoimmunity.

### Stopping type 1 diabetes: Attempts to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes in man [^117E47wQ]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

A successful approach to the prevention or cure of type 1 diabetes requires that β-cell function and mass be preserved. This is true both for native β-cells, regenerated β-cells, and for any cells used to replace β-cells. From the discussion above, there are at least three components to preserving β-cell function and mass. These include:

1. **Abrogating or controlling the immune response**: Both in terms of autoimmunity and allorejection (if a nonidentical source of β-cells is used).

2. **Protecting cells used for β-cell replacement by immunoisolation**.

3. **Using pharmacologic agents**: These are used to enhance β-cell function and potentially stimulate repair, regeneration, or neogenesis of β-cells.

The appropriate manner of use of such strategies remains to be determined. For example, it may be necessary to arrest autoimmunity and induce immune regulation or immune tolerance prior to replacing or regenerating β-cells. Alternatively, it may be possible to apply such strategies simultaneously, such as combined islet cell and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to induce chimerism and graft tolerance.

### Autologous umbilical cord blood transfusion in very young children with type 1 diabetes [^113MPDyb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder characterized by T-cell–mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells and lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin administration. At the time of writing, the majority of efforts seeking to ameliorate the autoimmune process and reverse hyperglycemia have focused on the use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs. Although several agents have shown and continue to show promise, no single agent has succeeded in demonstrating long-term success in preventing or reversing type 1 diabetes as a means of standard medical practice.

More recently, efforts have focused on the use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as potential immunoregulatory agents to reverse this disease. Hematopoietic stem cells have been successfully directed in vitro to differentiate into insulin- and C-peptide–producing cells. Infusion of human hematopoietic stem cells into diabetic animals has demonstrated reversal of the disease. The potential of such cells to provide a source of safe and effective immunomodulation may be of the greatest importance in treating type 1 diabetes, but this has yet to be realized.

### Tresiba [^116skxLz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the open-label adult clinical trials involving patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as the open-label pediatric clinical trial for patients with type 1 diabetes, the percentages of adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes randomized to Tresiba who experienced at least one episode of hypoglycemia are detailed in the clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)] and are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for adults with type 2 diabetes.

Severe hypoglycemia in the open-label trials with adult patients was defined as an episode requiring assistance from another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or perform other resuscitative actions. In the pediatric trial, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an altered mental status where the child could not assist in their own care, was semiconscious, unconscious, or in a coma with or without convulsions, possibly requiring parenteral therapy (glucagon or intravenous glucose). A hypoglycemia episode was defined as either a severe hypoglycemia episode or an episode where laboratory or self-measured glucose calibrated to plasma was less than 56 mg/dL, or where whole blood glucose was less than 50 mg/dL, regardless of the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes: The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^111asdX2]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize what we have learned so far regarding the mechanism by which viral infections can inhibit a diabetogenic response, please refer to Fig. 2. TGF-β augmentation of Tregs is not solely responsible for virally mediated prevention of type 1 diabetes. It turns out that important general mechanisms occur simultaneously while the virus infection is ongoing. Based on our findings, these mechanisms are associated with the viral induction of PD-1L and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Both molecules have been shown to downmodulate immune responses and are crucial for the attrition of the antiviral immune response when the viral infection is being cleared, with the purpose of limiting excess immunopathology.

Indeed, what happens following a viral infection, and this mechanism holds true for Coxsackie B viruses and other systemic infections, is that not only are the antiviral T-cells being eliminated, but PD-1L and TNF-α mediate the bystander death of autoaggressive T-cells. This aspect of the mechanism results in a delay in the progression to type 1 diabetes but not a reduction in the overall incidence. The invigoration and activation of Treg cells are ultimately responsible for the observed reduction in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in our model systems. Combined, these cytokine effects result in a reduced incidence and delay of type 1 diabetes.

These findings also illustrate rather elegantly that two components are needed to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes therapeutically: 1) elimination of autoaggressive T-cells and 2) augmentation of Tregs to achieve long-term tolerance.

### Ptpn22 silencing in the NOD model indicates the type 1 diabetes-associated allele is not a loss-of-function variant [^111QEcwB]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

- **Time of treatment**: Determines the effect of Ptpn22 silencing on Teff-cell differentiation. The percentage of CD44ʰⁱ CD62Lˡᵒ (Teff) cells within the CD4⁺ T-cell compartment were quantified in WT, P2, and P4 mice that had either been untreated, treated for 2 months from birth, or treated for 3 months from the age of 6 weeks. Data for CD8⁺ T cells were similar (not shown). Data are averaged (mean ± SEM) for two to six mice per group and are representative of two experiments (doxycycline [dox] from birth) and six experiments (dox from 6 weeks).

- **Cellularity of spleens**: From WT, P2, and P4 mice untreated or treated with dox for 4–5 months from the age of 10 weeks averaged (mean ± SEM) for 14 WT, 5 P2, and 8 P4 mice (untreated groups) and 19 WT, 10 P2, and 9 P4 mice (treated groups).

- **Relative distribution**: Of B cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, dendritic cells (DC), and macrophages (Mp) in the spleen of WT and P2 mice either untreated or treated from the age of 4 weeks for a duration of 4 months. Data are averaged (mean ± SEM) from five mice per group and representative of four similar experiments.

### Repurposing anti-inflammasome NRTIs for improving insulin sensitivity and reducing type 2 diabetes development [^111zoYkb]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Alu mobile elements propagate themselves by hijacking the endogenous reverse-transcriptase LINE-1. Notably, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), drugs that are used to treat HIV-1 and hepatitis B infections, inhibit not only viral reverse-transcriptases but also LINE-1 reverse-transcriptase activity. NRTIs also block inflammasome activation by Alu RNAs and other stimuli, independent of their ability to block reverse-transcriptase. Therefore, we seek to determine whether, among patients with HIV-1 or hepatitis B, there is a relation between exposure to NRTIs and the development of type 2 diabetes.

Here, we employ a health insurance claims database analysis approach to examine the link between NRTI use and incident type 2 diabetes. We also investigate the effect of the NRTI lamivudine on insulin resistance in diabetic human adipocytes and myocytes, and in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, to obtain experimental evidence in support of the clinical observations. We find that NRTI exposure is associated with reduced development of type 2 diabetes in people and that lamivudine inhibits inflammasome activation and improves insulin sensitivity in experimental systems. These data suggest the possibility of either repurposing this approved class of drugs or exploring less toxic modified NRTIs for treating prediabetes or diabetes.

### Doxycycline [^116NakEx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory tests: In venereal disease, when coexistent syphilis is suspected, a dark-field examination should be performed before treatment is initiated. Blood serology tests should be repeated monthly for at least four months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies, should be conducted.

- **Drug interactions**: Tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, meaning patients on anticoagulant therapy may require a reduction in their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid administering tetracyclines alongside penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, iron-containing preparations, and bismuth subsalicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline. The use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**: False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with fluorescence tests.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there is evidence of oncogenic activity in rats from studies with related antibacterials, such as oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors).

### Minocycline for acne vulgaris: Efficacy and safety [^112TormG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris. It is more convenient for patients as it needs to be taken only once or twice a day and can be taken with food; however, it is more expensive. Concerns have been raised about its safety following the deaths of two patients taking the drug. There is a lack of consensus among dermatologists regarding the relative risks and benefits of minocycline. Since most acne prescribing is done by general practitioners, guidelines issued to them should be based on the best available evidence rather than personal judgments.

- **Objectives**: To collate and evaluate the evidence on the clinical efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of inflammatory acne vulgaris. Specific objectives were to compare the efficacy of minocycline with other drug treatments for acne and to collate information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions.

- **Search strategy**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of minocycline for acne vulgaris were identified by searching the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, Biological Abstracts, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Cochrane Skin Group's Trial Register, Theses Online, BIDS ISI Science Citation Index, National Research Register, Controlled Trials, and BIDS Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings. Other strategies used included scanning the references of articles retrieved, hand-searching major dermatology journals, and personal communication.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114iTwS1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of diabetes mellitus type 1, specifically concerning glycemic targets, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend the deintensification of hypoglycemia-causing medications, such as insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides. Alternatively, they suggest switching to a medication class with a lower risk of hypoglycemia for patients at high risk. These recommendations are to be implemented within individualized glycemic goals. Furthermore, diabetes medications should be deintensified if the harms or burdens of treatment are deemed greater than the benefits, again within individualized glycemic goals.

### The tetracycline resistome is shaped by selection for specific resistance mechanisms by each antibiotic generation [^1144gAv6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Since their discovery in the 1940s, the tetracycline family of antibiotics has been intensively used in agriculture and clinical settings. These drugs inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 16S rRNA of the 30S ribosome subunit, preventing the accommodation of incoming aminoacyl-tRNAs. Tetracyclines are type II polyketides composed of a four (tetra-) ring (-cycl-) scaffold.

First-generation tetracyclines include the naturally occurring chlortetracycline (1948), oxytetracycline (1950), and tetracycline (1953). Over the decades, to overcome resistance to existing tetracyclines, the core tetracycline scaffold has been modified with a variety of functional groups in an effort to improve ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), efficacy, and spectrum of activity. These semi-synthetic and fully synthetic derivatives are referred to as second- and third-generation tetracyclines, respectively.

- **Second-generation tetracyclines**: These include minocycline (1961), metacycline (1962), and doxycycline (1967).

- **Third-generation tetracyclines**: The most recently developed, these include glycylcyclines such as tigecycline (reported 1993, FDA-approved 2005), omadacycline (reported 2013, FDA-approved 2018), and eravacycline (reported 2013, FDA-approved 2018). These later-generation drugs were intentionally optimized for activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens, and tigecycline is currently reserved as an antibiotic of last resort.

The history of tetracycline resistance in human pathogens has been characterized by cycles where new generations of tetracyclines are developed to combat emerging resistance.

### Strategies to prevent type 1 diabetes [^113Vvvhj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting from T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing cells in the islets of Langerhans. Its primary cause remains unknown, but it has been established that the clinical presentation is preceded by a long prodrome. This enables individuals at high risk of disease to be identified and offers the possibility of intervention to prevent clinical disease. Many groups are working in this field, concentrating on manipulation of environmental exposures that are potential triggers of autoimmunity and on immunomodulation strategies that aim to prevent destruction of beta-cells. Some interventions have shown promising results in early trials, but effective disease prevention remains elusive. This article reviews progress in the field.

### Congenic mesenchymal stem cell therapy reverses hyperglycemia in experimental type 1 diabetes [^117Us4Eo]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

A number of clinical trials are underway to test whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are effective in treating various diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Although this cell therapy holds great promise, the optimal source of MSCs has yet to be determined with respect to major histocompatibility complex matching. Here, we examine this question by testing the ability of congenic MSCs, obtained from the NOR mouse strain, to reverse recent-onset type 1 diabetes in NOD mice, as well as to determine the immunomodulatory effects of NOR MSCs in vivo.

- **Research design and methods**: NOR MSCs were evaluated regarding their in vitro immunomodulatory function in the context of autoreactive T-cell proliferation and dendritic cell (DC) generation. The in vivo effect of NOR MSC therapy on the reversal of recent-onset hyperglycemia and on immunogenic cell subsets in NOD mice was also examined.

- **Results**: NOR MSCs were shown to suppress diabetogenic T-cell proliferation via PD-L1 and to suppress the generation of myeloid/inflammatory DCs predominantly through an IL-6-dependent mechanism. NOR MSC treatment of experimental type 1 diabetes resulted in long-term reversal of hyperglycemia, and therapy was shown to alter the diabetogenic cytokine profile, diminish T-cell effector frequency in the pancreatic lymph nodes, alter antigen-presenting cell frequencies, and augment the frequency of the plasmacytoid subset of DCs.

- **Conclusions**: These studies demonstrate the unique benefits of congenic MSC therapy in reversing experimental type 1 diabetes. These data should benefit future clinical research directions.

### Tresiba [^113n1vc1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: In clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14)], a total of 75 (7%) of the 1102 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 1 diabetes had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 1 (0.1%) had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². Among the 2713 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes, 250 (9%) had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and no subjects had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

	- In the safety outcomes trial (DEVOTE), 1429 (37.4%) of the 3818 TRESIBA-treated patients with type 2 diabetes had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 108 (2.8%) subjects had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m². No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in the subgroup analyses.

	- No clinically relevant difference in the pharmacokinetics of TRESIBA was identified in a study comparing healthy subjects and those with kidney impairment, including subjects with end-stage kidney disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, as with all insulin products, glucose monitoring should be intensified, and the TRESIBA dosage adjusted individually in patients with kidney impairment.

- **Hepatic impairment**: No difference in the pharmacokinetics of TRESIBA was identified in a study comparing healthy subjects and those with hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, and severe) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, as with all insulin products, glucose monitoring should be intensified, and the TRESIBA dosage adjusted on an individual basis in patients with hepatic impairment.

### Developing combination immunotherapies for type 1 diabetes: Recommendations from the ITN-JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Combination Therapy Assessment Group [^114VEWJC]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Like many other complex human disorders of unknown aetiology, autoimmune-mediated type 1 diabetes may ultimately be controlled via a therapeutic approach that combines multiple agents, each with differing modes of action. The numerous advantages of such a strategy include the ability to minimize toxicities and realize synergies to enhance and prolong efficacy. The recognition that combinations might offer far-reaching benefits, at a time when few single agents have yet proved themselves in well-powered trials, represents a significant challenge to our ability to conceive and implement rational treatment designs. As a first step in this process, the Immune Tolerance Network, in collaboration with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, convened a Type 1 Diabetes Combination Therapy Assessment Group, the recommendations of which are discussed in this perspective paper.

### Current and future efforts toward the prevention of type 1 diabetes [^112QaV8Y]. Pediatric Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the natural history of 'pre-type 1' diabetes as well as in the post-diagnosis period. Currently, the inability to successfully prevent the disease limits screening outside of the research setting. While studies involving both humans at various levels of risk for type 1 diabetes and animal models of the disease have enhanced our understanding of the disorder, the development of a safe and effective therapeutic intervention capable of reversing or preventing type 1 diabetes remains elusive.

Worldwide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention studies have been undertaken. Intervention studies in new-onset and established type 1 diabetes patients have, at the time of writing, shown fairly limited success, with most effects seen within the first 6–12 months post-therapy. Long-term outcomes remain to be determined. Improved and innovative trial designs, more rapid testing of both antigen-specific and combination therapies in different populations (at-risk, new-onset, and established type 1 diabetes), continued efforts to fill the mechanistic voids in the etiopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and the development of validated biomarkers will hasten efforts toward reversing and preventing the disease.

For successful prevention, therapy must be safe and target not only effective control of the autoimmune process culminating in type 1 diabetes but also the protection or replacement of lost β-cell function.

### Minocycline-mediated inhibition of microglia activation impairs oligodendrocyte progenitor cell responses and remyelination in a non-immune model of demyelination [^113utBm5]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2005). Low credibility.

Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, disrupts inflammatory processes within the CNS and reduces demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Several recent studies indicate that components of the inflammatory response to demyelination may be beneficial for the regenerative process of remyelination. In this study, we examined the effects of minocycline on remyelination independent of its effects in limiting immune-mediated white matter damage using a toxin model of demyelination.

Demyelinating lesions were induced by injection of ethidium bromide into caudal cerebellar peduncles of adult rats. Minocycline or PBS was administered by twice daily injections from day 1 prior to lesion-induction to post lesion day 3. Remyelination was assessed, blinded to grouping, using standard morphological criteria. Microglia activation within the lesion was assessed by examining the expression of OX-42 and major histocompatibility class II immunoreactivity. The oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) response was quantified by in situ hybridization using probes for OPC-expressed mRNAs, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and Olig-1. Minocycline treatment strongly inhibited microglia/macrophage activation at day 1 and day 3 post-lesion induction and suppressed the OPC response to demyelination.

We also found a significant decrease in the extent of oligodendrocyte but not Schwann cell remyelination in the minocycline-treated animals as compared with controls at 3 weeks post-lesion induction. These results indicate that microglia/macrophage activation is an important factor in remyelination.

### Stopping type 1 diabetes: Attempts to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes in man [^114XZ1ej]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to predict type 1 diabetes based on immunologic, genetic, and metabolic markers has led to several large studies aimed at determining whether the disease can be prevented through intervention in individuals with identified autoimmunity (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, at the time of writing, these studies have not achieved clear success. Part of this outcome can be attributed to the selection of interventions that pose minimal risk to participants in the trials.

However, it is also possible that once autoimmunity is established, the immune process expands progressively, involving more components of the immune system and targeting an increasing number of islet autoantigens. Consequently, therapies aimed at one specific component of the immune system or a particular autoantigen may be insufficient to halt the progression of type 1 diabetes. Nonetheless, any therapeutic strategy proven safe in new-onset type 1 diabetes, even with only minor or transient efficacy, might be worth considering for prevention.

Safety must be paramount in any study involving individuals who do not yet have the disease. However, caution is necessary to avoid equating unpleasant but temporary side effects, such as those associated with an infusion, with obstacles to considering agents that lack serious sustained adverse effects.

### Aspirin-responsive gene switch regulating therapeutic protein expression [^112B9LBb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We quantified systemic biomarkers of chronic inflammation in both wild-type (WT) and late-stage type 1 diabetes (T1D) mice, including C-reactive protein (CRP) (Fig. 7e), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Fig. 7f), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Fig. 7g), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (Fig. 7h), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Fig. 7i). These inflammatory biomarkers were all significantly upregulated in untreated T1D mice or T1D mice receiving HEK-ASPIRIN but no ASA, whereas T1D mice implanted with HEK-ASPIRIN and treated with ASA exhibited a remarkable reduction to levels akin to those observed in healthy controls (WT, ASA(-)). These results demonstrate that aspirin alone has minimal effects on biomarkers associated with diabetic complications. However, with the assistance of the ASPIRIN system, aspirin significantly downregulates these biomarkers to wild-type levels (Fig. 7a–i). Collectively, these findings support the idea that ASPIRIN could become an attractive strategy for therapeutic transgene regulation by elegantly exploiting the treatment benefits of ASA itself.

### Successful treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor-induced alopecia with doxycycline [^112MY1L8]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Doxycycline, as a member of the tetracycline family, inhibits key proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These anti-inflammatory effects of doxycycline may contribute to its success in treating EGFR inhibitor–associated alopecia. In addition, doxycycline is a potent broad-spectrum antibiotic with good coverage of skin flora. Patients undergoing EGFR-inhibitor treatment frequently have superinfections at sites of toxicity. In one study, 84 of 221 (38%) patients had culture-positive Staphylococcus aureus superinfections after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. S. aureus infection has also been linked to exacerbations of EGFR inhibitor–induced skin eruptions, including that of a papulopustular eruption on the scalp with associated alopecia. Minocycline, another tetracycline, was reported to help in one case of folliculitis decalvans–type alopecia associated with erlotinib; however, within the tetracycline family, doxycycline has been linked to fewer severe toxicities and is safer in patients with renal impairment than minocycline.

The success of doxycycline in treating our patient's EGFR inhibitor–associated alopecia may be a combination of its potent anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Although further studies are required, doxycycline should be considered a potential therapeutic option for corticosteroid-resistant EGFR inhibitor–induced alopecia.

### Rapamycin monotherapy in patients with type 1 diabetes modifies CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells [^1177n6Sp]. Diabetes (2008). Low credibility.

Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive drug currently used to prevent graft rejection in humans, considered permissive for tolerance induction. It allows the expansion of both murine and human naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells (nTregs), pivotal for the induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Preclinical murine models have shown that rapamycin enhances nTreg proliferation and regulatory function in vivo. The objective of this study was to assess whether rapamycin has in vivo effects on human nTregs.

- **Research design and methods**: nTreg numbers and function were examined in a unique set of patients with type 1 diabetes who underwent rapamycin monotherapy before islet transplantation.

- **Results**: We found that rapamycin monotherapy did not alter the frequency and functional features, namely proliferation and cytokine production, of circulating nTregs. However, nTregs isolated from type 1 diabetic patients under rapamycin treatment had an increased capability to suppress the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-) effector T-cells compared with that before treatment.

- **Conclusions**: These findings demonstrate that rapamycin directly affects human nTreg function in vivo, refitting their suppressive activity, whereas it does not directly change effector T-cell function.

### Umbilical cord blood and type 1 diabetes: A road ahead or dead end [^113rzh2K]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although at present we have no roadmap for the use of stem cells to reverse type 1 diabetes in children, two promising research discoveries might provide us with clues for future clinical trials. Recently, Zhao et al. used human umbilical cord blood stem cells to reverse type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. These investigators developed coculture techniques by mixing nondiabetic human umbilical cord blood stem cells with NOD mouse spleen cells to generate an unconventional subset of Tregs bearing CD4 + CD62L + but not CD25 + on the cell surface. These unconventional Tregs, when injected into diabetic NOD mice, reversed type 1 diabetes 75% of the time and stimulated pancreatic β-cell regeneration. Conventional Tregs bearing CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + (note FoxP3 is a transcription factor that demarcates functional Tregs) did not possess these regenerative properties. These unconventional CD4 + CD62L + cells could only be derived using purified human cord blood stem cells from healthy donors but not from type 1 diabetes donors (Y. Zhao, personal communication). Apparently, healthy umbilical cord blood possesses a critical stem cell population capable of reeducating and transforming diabetic regulatory cells into regenerative CD4 + CD62L + cells capable of reversing type 1 diabetes. Conversely, umbilical cord blood obtained from individuals who later developed type 1 diabetes does not contain this critical stem cell population and therefore might not be a useful source of regenerative cells.

### Antigen-based therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes [^117AdsEK]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Intervention trials of antigen-based therapies (ABTs) in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients emphasize the importance of preserving residual β-cell function. Disease prevention is preferable to intervention post-onset, but this approach requires screening individuals for type 1 diabetes risk markers and carries the risk of exacerbating the disease process.

Furthermore, intervention trials are more feasible since potential subjects can be readily identified, and efficacy evaluated in a shorter time frame. Preserving β-cell function post-onset may help prevent or delay long-term complications.

### Endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta cells and autoimmune diabetes [^113u2JxP]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β cells, leading to insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia. Although multiple attempts have been made to slow the autoimmune process using immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents, there are still no effective treatments that can delay or reverse the progression of type 1 diabetes in humans. Recent studies support the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a novel target for preventing the initiation of the autoimmune reaction, propagation of inflammation, and β cell death in type 1 diabetes. This review highlights recent findings on ER stress in β cells and the development of type 1 diabetes, and it introduces potential new treatments targeting the ER to combat this disorder.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? The role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^111E1Pj4]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

We will take a journey from basic pathogenetic mechanisms elicited by viral infections that play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes to clinical interventions, where we will discuss novel combination therapies. The role of viral infections in the development of type 1 diabetes is a rather interesting topic because in experimental models, viruses appear capable of both accelerating and decelerating the immunological processes leading to type 1 diabetes. Consequently, I will discuss some of the underlying mechanisms for each situation and consider methods to investigate the proposed dichotomy for the involvement of viruses in human type 1 diabetes.

Prevention of type 1 diabetes by infection supports the so-called "hygiene hypothesis". Interestingly, viruses invoke mechanisms that need to be exploited by novel combinatorial immune-based interventions.

- **Elimination of autoaggressive T-cells**: The first immune element involves autoaggressive T-cells attacking the beta-cells, ultimately leading to their immediate but temporally limited amelioration.

- **Invigoration of regulatory T-cells (Tregs)**: The second involves the invigoration of regulatory T-cells, which can mediate long-term tolerance to beta-cell proteins in the pancreatic islets and draining lymph nodes.

In combination, these two immune elements have the potential to permanently stop type 1 diabetes. It is my belief that only combination therapies will enable the permanent prevention and curing of type 1 diabetes.

### Should tetracycline treatment be used more extensively for rheumatoid arthritis? Metaanalysis demonstrates clinical benefit with reduction in disease activity [^116nLUqN]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of tetracycline antibiotics versus control (placebo or conventional treatment) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for the reduction of disease activity, as defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria, a comprehensive search was conducted.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline (1966-February 2002), Embase (1980-February 2002), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 1, 2002 Cochrane Library). Reference lists of published trials were searched by hand to identify further published reports and presentations at scientific meetings. Randomized controlled trials comparing tetracyclines to control (placebo or conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic therapy) were included if at least one of the following outcomes was reported: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count, patient pain score by visual analog scale, patient global assessment of disease activity, physician global assessment of disease activity, eosinophil sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), joint space narrowing and erosions, adverse events, and quality of life measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Subjects were required to have RA as defined by the 1987 ARA criteria.

- **Results**: Ten randomized controlled trials, including 535 individuals, were reviewed. Only three trials were considered high quality, as elements of bias could not be excluded in the remainder. Tetracyclines, when administered for three months or more, were associated with a significant reduction in disease activity in RA, as follows: for TJC, standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.39, 95% CI -0.74.

### A multicentre, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, vehicle-controlled phase IIb study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1% and 3% topical minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea [^115uRKHP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Minocycline is a broad-spectrum, semisynthetic, second-generation tetracycline similar to doxycycline and has been reported to have both antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. The tetracycline nucleus consists of four linear-fused tetracycline rings, with a variety of functional groups attached at different positions; minocycline has a dimethylamino group at position 7 and no substituents at position 6. Like other tetracyclines, minocycline is bacteriostatic and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis in a reversible manner by preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into the peptide chain.

Minocycline's anti-inflammatory properties are due to its effects on a wide variety of immune responses. Particularly important in the pathobiology of papulopustular rosacea are:

- **Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases**: In the cathelicidin pathway.
- **Inhibition of immune cell function and infiltration**.
- **Reduction of oxidative stress**.
- **Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase**.

These effects could potentially account for the clinical efficacy of tetracycline derivatives in papulopustular rosacea. The study details the results of a multicentre, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled study of minocycline gel in patients with papulopustular rosacea over a 12-week treatment period.

### All-trans retinoic acid inhibits type 1 diabetes by T regulatory (Treg)-dependent suppression of interferon-gamma-producing T-cells without affecting Th17 cells [^113RguZT]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

ATRA treatment inhibits type 1 diabetes. We used an adoptive transfer animal model of the disease to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the potential immunoregulatory effect of ATRA on type 1 diabetes. Splenocytes isolated from newly diabetic NOD mice were adoptively transferred to NOD/scid recipient mice. Donor T-cell phenotype, including CD4+ versus CD8+ T-cells, percentage of CD4+ Foxp3-expressing Treg cells, CD8+ cells expressing different markers, and their cytokine secretion profile are shown in Fig. 1A. The data showed that control recipient mice developed diabetes within 3 weeks, and all mice became diabetic within 4 weeks of cell transfer. In comparison, ATRA treatment (every other day, as of day 1 of cell transfer) not only significantly delayed the onset of diabetes for 5 weeks in recipient mice but also significantly reduced diabetes incidence compared with controls (25% vs. 100%, respectively). Histological studies of pancreases from recipient mice showed that control mice had already developed severe destructive insulitis 2 weeks after cell transfer, whereas either intact islets or stationary peri-insulitis was observed in ATRA-treated mice as late as week 17 after cell transfer.

The effects of ATRA treatment on spontaneous diabetes development in NOD mice were also analyzed in studies where treatment was only initiated at 10 weeks of age. At this age, 2 weeks before the onset of overt diabetes, it is known that destructive insulitis has developed for several weeks.

### Congenic mesenchymal stem cell therapy reverses hyperglycemia in experimental type 1 diabetes [^1112oHv2]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence of type 1 diabetes is steadily rising globally, and the most common intervention to reverse disease in recently diagnosed patients has been immunosuppression using agents such as anti-CD3. However, because immunosuppressive regimens are commonly associated with acute morbidity, there is a dire need for novel treatments to reduce this burden. MSC therapy is one promising modality due to the considerable immunomodulatory effects of these cells; it has shown promising results in treating autoimmune diseases and may serve as part of a combination therapy to reduce the morbidity of immunosuppressive regimens.

Whereas MSCs can differentiate into various mesenchymal cell lineages, hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent stem cells that give rise to all blood cells and also have immunomodulatory roles. Indeed, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients has resulted in improved β-cell function. Clinical trials examining the effects of MSC therapy have been initiated for numerous disorders, including type 1 diabetes. However, these type 1 diabetes trials have been initiated with a scarcity of preclinical data, necessary for determining the type and course of MSC therapy and understanding the mechanisms by which MSCs exert their immunomodulatory effects. We and others have previously demonstrated the benefit of MSC therapy in this specific setting.

### Antibiotics used in nonbacterial dermatologic conditions [^111A7C4s]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of nonbacterial dermatological conditions treated with antibiotics benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of these medications, usually dapsone or tetracycline. Many other antimicrobials are used to treat noninfectious conditions. This chapter provides an overview of selected noninfectious dermatological conditions for which antibiotics are used, focusing on the most common antibiotics employed for their nonantimicrobial properties.

### Tetracycline antibiotics impair mitochondrial function and its experimental use confounds research [^117Tpybq]. Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines, a class of antibiotics that target bacterial translation, are commonly used in research for inducible gene expression using Tet-ON/Tet-OFF systems. However, such tetracycline-inducible systems carry a risk. Given that mitochondria have a "bacterial" ancestry, these antibiotics also target mitochondrial translation and impair mitochondrial function. Indeed, treatment with doxycycline — a tetracycline derivative — disturbs mitochondrial proteostasis and metabolic activity and induces widespread gene-expression changes. Together, this affects physiology in well-established model systems ranging from cultured cells to simple organisms and to mice and plants. These changes are observed with doxycycline doses that are widely used to regulate gene expression.

In light of these findings, and bearing in mind the conserved role of mitochondria in metabolism and whole organism homeostasis, we caution against the use of tetracyclines in experimental approaches. The use of newly developed tetracycline-based systems that are more sensitive could be an alternative; however, even if no overt mitochondrial toxicity is detected, widespread changes in gene expression may sensitize cells to the intended tetracycline-controlled loss or gain of function, thereby introducing a "two-hit model". This is highly relevant for cancer research, as mitochondrial metabolism holds a central position in the reallocation of nutrients for biomass production known as the Warburg effect.

### Regulated and reversible induction of adult human β-cell replication [^115KiwK1]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Cdk6 and cyclin D1 can be overexpressed in a dose-dependent manner in human β-cells transduced with tet-inducible adenoviruses. Human islets were transduced with an adenovirus delivering the tet transactivator (Ad.TTA) and either a control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP) or adenoviruses expressing cdk6 or cyclin D1 under the control of the tet response element (Ad.TRE-cdk6 or Ad.TRE-cyclin D1). Increasing amounts of doxycycline (Dox) (0–1 μg/mL) were added to the medium to define the dose responsiveness of the cdk6 and cyclin D1 expression.

Figure 1 shows that cyclin D1 or cdk6, or both, markedly increased with rising concentrations of Dox, plateauing at 0.1 μg/mL Dox. Close examination indicates that both cdk6 and cyclin D1 were expressed at low levels in the absence of Dox. For example, control (Ad.GFP-transduced) islets expressed 12.2% of the maximal amount of cdk6 expressed by Ad.TRE-cdk6 (with 0.1 μg/mL Dox), whereas Ad.TRE-cdk6 without Dox exposure expressed 23% of the maximum; similarly, Ad.GFP-transduced islets and Ad.TRE-cyclin D1 without Dox expressed 2.7% and 13.9% of maximal cyclin D1 levels, respectively. This suggests some "leakiness" of the TRE promoter, but below levels associated with activation of proliferation.

### It's time to consider changing the rules: The rationale for rethinking control groups in clinical trials aimed at reversing type 1 diabetes [^11284WR5]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

In some ways, it is difficult to imagine that more than a quarter century has passed since the earliest attempts to reverse type 1 diabetes through immune modulation saw their genesis. Sadly, despite the performance of a multitude of clinical trials during this time period ranging from single case studies to large multicenter collaborative efforts, no agent or methodology has been identified as a proven means for reversing this disorder in a setting meaningful to public health care delivery. These efforts, like those seeking to prevent the disorder before its symptomatic onset, have not been devoid of providing scientific benefit as many intellectual gains have been realized through their performance. This includes improvements in assays for immunologic and metabolic biomarkers of disease (e.g. autoantibodies, C-peptide), standardization of tests for metabolic function, the organization of large collaborative networks (e.g. National Institutes of Health [NIH] TrialNet and Immune Tolerance Network), as well as an improved understanding of the natural history for type 1 diabetes; many facets of which have been reported over the years within the pages of Diabetes.

To be clear, clinical trials seeking the reversal of type 1 diabetes are tough to perform for reasons large in number and diverse in nature. Often, a therapeutic agent can be difficult to obtain from a pharmaceutical entity (especially if it is in the early stages of development), and even when available, it can be cost prohibitive. Beyond this, costs for laboratory testing, patient care, travel, and mechanistic research remain challenging barriers.

### Drug insight: New immunomodulatory therapies in type 1 diabetes [^114hrzEr]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Animal models and human studies have provided strong evidence that the immune response causing type 1A diabetes is initiated against a limited array of antigens. This response acquires breadth and depth until the beta-cell mass is critically compromised. Two recent trials confirmed the ability to identify relatives at risk for developing diabetes, though they were unsuccessful in preventing the disease. Treatment of at-risk individuals with oral insulin, believed to be an antigen in the disease, showed efficacy in a subgroup of these subjects. This suggests that antigen-specific prevention approaches might be successful in the right group of subjects at the right time.

Earlier trials indicated that the natural progression of disease can be altered with conventional immune suppression. However, these approaches have been supplanted by tolerance-induction strategies. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies have shown efficacy in preventing the loss of insulin production over the first two years of the disease without chronic immune suppression. The mechanisms are novel and appear to involve the induction of immune regulation by the monoclonal antibody. Ultimately, the goal of therapy is the preservation and even improvement of beta-cell mass. Achieving this will depend on the timing and mechanisms of the immune intervention, which might require combinations of agents.

### Inhibition of caspase-1 with tetracycline ameliorates acute lung injury [^113nH2rB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous syndrome with a mortality rate of up to 40%. Precision medicine approaches that target patients based on their molecular phenotypes of ARDS may help identify effective pharmacotherapies. The inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway contributes to ARDS development via IL-1β and IL-18 production. Recent studies indicate that tetracycline can be used to treat inflammatory diseases mediated by IL-1β and IL-18, although the molecular mechanism by which tetracycline inhibits inflammasome-caspase-1 signaling remains unknown.

- **Objectives**: To identify patients with ARDS characterized by IL-1β and IL-18 expression and investigate the ability of tetracycline to inhibit inflammasome-caspase-1 signaling in ARDS.

- **Methods**: IL-1β and IL-18 concentrations were quantified in BAL fluid from patients with ARDS. The effects of tetracycline on lung injury and inflammation were assessed in two mouse models of direct (pulmonary) acute lung injury, and its effects on IL-1β and IL-18 production were assessed by alveolar leukocytes from patients with direct ARDS ex vivo. Murine macrophages were used to further characterize the effect of tetracycline on the inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway.

- **Measurements and main results**: BAL fluid concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 are significantly higher in patients with direct ARDS than those with indirect (nonpulmonary) ARDS. In experimental acute lung injury, tetracycline significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary inflammation by selectively inhibiting caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 production.

### Ribosome-targeting antibiotics impair T cell effector function and ameliorate autoimmunity by blocking mitochondrial protein synthesis [^112KLQSf]. Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

It is well established that some ribosome-targeting antibiotics (RAbos) can inhibit mitoribosomes, and some have been described as immunosuppressive. For example, chloramphenicol diminishes neutrophil extracellular trap release, and doxycycline inhibits B cell class switching and IgM secretion. However, how the reduction of immune cell function occurred is not well understood. We have shown here that inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by antibiotics can reduce Th cell cytokine secretion.

Certain clinical observations suggest that linezolid is immunosuppressive: as previously mentioned, linezolid treatment confers an increased risk of fungal and Gram-negative infections. Th17 cell function is necessary for mounting antifungal and antibacterial responses. As linezolid is active exclusively against Gram-positive bacteria, we postulated that linezolid facilitates opportunistic fungal or Gram-negative infections by dampening Th17 cell function. Importantly, we found linezolid to inhibit both mitochondrial translation and Th17 cell function in vitro at concentrations routinely achieved during clinical administration.

We also showed that linezolid prevented the development of self-reactive T cells in the T cell-mediated autoimmunity EAE model. Thus, repurposing linezolid as an immunosuppressive drug resulted in significant protection from pathogenic T cell infiltration and led to absent (or mild) EAE symptoms. However, future studies will be necessary to determine if T cell suppression by linezolid contributes to the progression of infections.

### Induction of chimerism permits low-dose islet grafts in the liver or pancreas to reverse refractory autoimmune diabetes [^116GpsCA]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. A cure for type 1 diabetes will require a reversal of autoimmunity as well as the regeneration or replacement of islet β-cells. Currently, islet transplantation is the only therapy with the potential to reverse refractory late-stage type 1 diabetes in animal models and patients, although hundreds of regimens have been reported to prevent type 1 diabetes, and anti-CD3 therapies have been shown to reverse or ameliorate new-onset type 1 diabetes in mouse models or patients.

However, islet transplantation under the Edmonton protocol, which involves the administration of immunosuppressants including rapamycin, tacrolimus, and anti-IL-2 mAb, only provides insulin independence for 1 to 2 years in most recipients.

The obstacles preventing islet transplantation as a curative therapy for refractory late-stage type 1 diabetes include:

- **Chronic rejection of islet grafts**: Mediated by allo- and autoimmunity.
- **Chronic toxicity of immunosuppressants**: These impair islet graft function and β-cell regeneration.
- **Limited availability of donor islets**: Under the Edmonton protocol, more than two cadaveric donors are usually required for each recipient, limiting the widespread application of islet transplantation.
- **Lack of an ideal graft site**: In clinical islet transplantation, donor islets are usually injected via the portal vein into the liver. Unfortunately, this procedure has shortcomings. Portal vein injection of islets can cause bleeding.

### Tetracyclines: Nonantibiotic properties and their clinical implications [^1169nqPd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Tetracyclines are broad-spectrum antibiotics that act at the ribosomal level by interfering with protein synthesis. Dermatologists first widely prescribed them in the early 1950s after discovering their effectiveness as a treatment for acne. More recently, the biologic actions of tetracyclines affecting inflammation, proteolysis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, metal chelation, ionophoresis, and bone metabolism have been researched. The therapeutic effects of tetracycline and its analogues in various diseases have been investigated, including rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitis, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. This review explores the nonantibiotic properties of tetracycline and its analogues and their potential for clinical application.
