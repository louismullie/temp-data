## Question

Domperidone in third trimester of pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether domperidone is safe and appropriate to use in the third trimester of pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the specific indication and whether the question is about antiemetic use or lactation enhancement. Then, I should verify regulatory guidance and labeling for domperidone in pregnancy. Next, I will review what high-quality guidelines recommend for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum in the third trimester. After that, I need to assess domperidone's pharmacology and known risks, including placental transfer and cardiac effects. Then, I will compare domperidone with evidence-based alternatives like doxylamine–pyridoxine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with risk–benefit counseling and monitoring considerations, if any off-label use is contemplated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Most guidance defines nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as starting before 16 weeks. When severe symptoms persist into the second or third trimester, the preferred terminology is persistent NVP or hyperemesis gravidarum, and we should also re-evaluate for other causes rather than assume pregnancy-related emesis, which matters for medication selection and sequencing [^113zxaGF] [^1164cbRP].

> Wait, let me verify regulatory status and pregnancy-specific guidance. FDA materials consistently advise that domperidone is not usually recommended in pregnancy due to limited human data, and any use should be reserved for situations where benefits outweigh potential risks; the Australian categorization places it in category B2, reflecting limited human experience and inadequate animal data, which does not provide reassuring evidence for routine use in pregnancy, especially late gestation [^112tgcip] [^115nW4kn].

> I should confirm whether major guidelines even mention domperidone for NVP or HG. RCOG 2024 recommends doxylamine–pyridoxine first-line, with escalation to agents such as metoclopramide, ondansetron, promethazine, and corticosteroids in refractory cases; domperidone is not included in the treatment algorithms, and the AGA clinical practice update likewise does not list domperidone among recommended antiemetics for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting, underscoring the lack of endorsement for this indication [^115Au6Tg] [^11667biW] [^111LDZ6X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to check pharmacologic rationale and risk. Domperidone is a peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist that increases prolactin and gastric motility; although it does not readily cross the blood–brain barrier, it does cross the placenta, and third-trimester exposure raises theoretical concerns about neonatal effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms after birth, which are well described with other dopamine antagonists in late pregnancy and warrant caution even if domperidone-specific neonatal data are sparse [^1172Awex] [^1164cbRP] [^1164cbRP] [^111iUxte].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular safety, because this could be decisive. Domperidone has documented QT-prolongation risk and has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Expert guidance for lactation recommends ECG screening in higher-risk scenarios, and regulatory bodies have constrained use due to arrhythmic potential, which is particularly concerning in late pregnancy where volume status, electrolytes, and polypharmacy can compound risk [^117KXMDy] [^111TZicr] [^115c9NZ7].

> I will now examine evidence-based alternatives so I can propose a safer sequence. First-line remains doxylamine–pyridoxine, and for refractory cases metoclopramide is supported by large safety data showing no increase in major congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth; ondansetron is considered second- or third-line depending on the guideline, with RCOG noting a very small absolute increase in orofacial clefts in the first trimester but supporting use when first-line therapies fail, which still leaves it as a reasonable option after 28 weeks in selected cases; promethazine and corticosteroids are additional steps in severe or refractory HG [^115Au6Tg] [^1115cvFq] [^1114UojN] [^11667biW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said metoclopramide should be avoided in the third trimester because of extrapyramidal effects. I should double-check that. Some sources note potential fetal extrapyramidal effects in the third trimester, but high-quality cohort data have not shown increased major malformations or perinatal death with first-trimester exposure, and RCOG still includes metoclopramide in recommended regimens, so my earlier inclination was too strong — metoclopramide remains an acceptable option in pregnancy when clinically indicated, with counseling on neurologic side effects and careful monitoring [^1164cbRP] [^1115cvFq].

> But wait, what if the user is actually asking about domperidone as a galactagogue after delivery rather than as an antiemetic in pregnancy? Let me clarify. Postpartum domperidone has evidence for modest increases in milk volume, especially in mothers of preterm infants, yet it remains off-label for lactation in many jurisdictions and carries the same QT risk, so any postpartum use requires informed consent, ECG screening in higher-risk patients, attention to drug interactions, and shared decision-making; that is a different question from third-trimester antiemetic use, and should not be conflated with in utero exposure considerations [^115mDqzw] [^111TZicr] [^115QtGsZ].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. For third-trimester nausea and vomiting or hyperemesis gravidarum, domperidone lacks supportive guideline endorsement, has limited pregnancy safety data, crosses the placenta with uncertain neonatal implications, and carries meaningful cardiac risk; therefore, it should not be used as a first-, second-, or third-line antiemetic in pregnancy. Preferred strategies include optimizing nonpharmacologic measures, doxylamine–pyridoxine, metoclopramide, ondansetron, promethazine, and corticosteroids in severe refractory cases, chosen within a stepwise framework and individualized to prior response, comorbidities, and monitoring capacity [^11667biW] [^111LDZ6X].

> If, after exhaustion of recommended therapies and careful multidisciplinary review, domperidone is still considered off-label, I need to ensure explicit documentation of rationale, discussion of limited evidence and known risks, baseline ECG if cardiac risk factors exist, avoidance of interacting drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, and neonatal observation after birth for any neurologic or feeding issues, while acknowledging that this remains outside evidence-based pathways and should be exceptional rather than routine [^115mDqzw] [^117KXMDy].

---

Domperidone is **not first-line** for nausea/vomiting in the third trimester [^115nW4kn] because of limited pregnancy data and potential fetal risks. It may be considered only if **first-line therapies fail** and the benefits clearly outweigh risks, with close monitoring for neonatal extrapyramidal symptoms and feeding difficulties [^1116r9vu]. Preferred options are doxylamine-pyridoxine [^115Au6Tg], metoclopramide [^1162C1Xj], or ondansetron [^1114UojN]; domperidone should be avoided in patients with QT risk or CYP3A4 inhibitors [^115mDqzw].

---

## Pharmacological profile and mechanism of action

Domperidone is a **peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist** that increases gastrointestinal motility and has antiemetic effects [^114fc5KN]. Unlike metoclopramide, it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, theoretically reducing CNS side effects. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and can prolong the QT interval, posing arrhythmia risk [^111TZicr].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding domperidone use in pregnancy

Evidence for domperidone in pregnancy — especially the third trimester — is **limited**. Animal studies show no major teratogenicity, but human data are sparse; small studies and case series report no clear increase in congenital anomalies, though the evidence quality is low [^115nW4kn]. Regulatory agencies caution that benefits must outweigh risks given the limited human data [^112bZoKX].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects in the third trimester

### Maternal risks

- **QT prolongation**: Domperidone can prolong QT and cause torsades de pointes, especially with CYP3A4 inhibitors or electrolyte disturbances [^111TZicr].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. macrolides, fluconazole) increase domperidone levels and arrhythmia risk [^115mDqzw].
- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Rare, but possible due to dopamine blockade.

---

### Fetal and neonatal risks

Fetal risks remain largely unknown because of limited data; theoretical concerns include QT effects and subtle neurobehavioral impacts. Neonatal risks include **extrapyramidal symptoms** (e.g. tremor, hypertonia, feeding difficulties) [^1116r9vu] reported with dopamine antagonists in late pregnancy, and neonatal withdrawal has been described with dopamine antagonists after third-trimester exposure, though specific data for domperidone are limited.

## Comparison with alternative antiemetic medications

| **Medication** | **Safety profile in pregnancy** | **Efficacy** | **Recommended use** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Doxylamine-pyridoxine | - Extensive data <br/> - No major teratogenicity <br/> - First-line | Effective for mild-to-moderate NVP | First-line [^115Au6Tg] |
| Metoclopramide | - Extensive data <br/> - No major teratogenicity <br/> - Second-line | Effective for moderate-to-severe NVP | Second-line [^117URK8X] |
| Ondansetron | - Extensive data <br/> - Slight cleft risk in first trimester <br/> - Third-line | Effective for severe NVP/HG | Third-line [^114u7LCF] |
| Domperidone | - Limited data <br/> - QT risk <br/> - Use if benefits outweigh risks | Unknown; limited evidence | Last resort |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line**: Doxylamine-pyridoxine for mild-to-moderate NVP [^115Au6Tg].
- **Second-line**: Metoclopramide or ondansetron for moderate-to-severe NVP/HG [^111LDZ6X] [^1114UojN].
- **Domperidone**: Not recommended as first- or second-line; consider only if alternatives fail and benefits outweigh risks, with ECG and electrolyte monitoring [^115mDqzw].

---

## Clinical scenarios for domperidone use in the third trimester

Domperidone may be considered only in **refractory cases** in which first- and second-line therapies (doxylamine-pyridoxine, metoclopramide, ondansetron) have failed or are contraindicated, and when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Use should be individualized, with careful monitoring and shared decision-making.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Maternal monitoring**: Baseline and periodic ECGs; electrolytes; review for CYP3A4 inhibitors [^117KXMDy].
- **Neonatal monitoring**: Observe for extrapyramidal symptoms, feeding difficulties, and withdrawal after birth [^1116r9vu].
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Domperidone is **not first-line** for nausea/vomiting in the third trimester because of limited pregnancy data and potential fetal risks. It may be considered only if first-line therapies fail and benefits outweigh risks, with close maternal and neonatal monitoring. Preferred options remain doxylamine-pyridoxine, metoclopramide, and ondansetron [^111LDZ6X].

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114jJMNP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding is the most advantageous nutrition for infants because of its many health benefits. However, lactation insufficiency is a prevalent issue among women, particularly those who give birth prematurely. Galactagogues, such as domperidone and metoclopramide, have been reported and may be beneficial for lactation insufficiency. However, the optimal pharmacological galactagogue remains unclear.

Methods

The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from their inception to April 23, 2023. The primary aim of this research was to assess the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide using Bayesian network meta-analysis. The efficacy outcome was the increased breast milk volume (in mL/day). The safety outcome was the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse events during the study period.

Results

Seventeen randomized controlled trials were included in the final analyses. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62). However, in the term mothers, domperidone did not show the above benefit compared with metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 93.67, 95% CI: -186.11–375.59; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 126.25, 95% CI: -49.91–304.55). Both in preterm and term mothers, metoclopramide was no better than the placebo. There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^114L5ZH5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the fourth week and disappears by the sixteenth week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to September 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 22 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure, acupuncture, antihistamines, corticosteroids, corticotrophins, diazepam, dietary interventions other than ginger, domperidone, ginger, metoclopramide, ondansetron, phenothiazines, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^1172Awex]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Thus, domperidone, a peripheral dopamine antagonist, may be safer than metoclopramide. Drug levels of domperidone in breast milk are also significantly lower than metoclopramide (p < 0.05). Studies have shown that breast milk samples taken from women receiving either a 10 mg dose of domperidone or a 10 mg dose of metoclopramide contained 10.3 ng/ml of domperidone and 68.5 ng/ml of metoclopramide (p < 0.05). Domperidone has been shown to significantly increase milk production without evidence of adverse effects in the infant. Domperidone has been shown to raise the serum prolactin level in non-lactating women from 8.1 to 110.9 ng/ml after one 20 mg dose. In a double-blind placebo controlled trial, 32 mothers of full term infants experiencing failure of lactogenesis were randomized to receive either domperidone (10 mg TID) or placebo. Prolactin levels were reported as significantly higher after the 2 nd day of treatment in the domperidone group (p < 0.01). The mean daily milk yield was also increased significantly in the domperidone group (P < 0.01), with a corresponding higher infant weight gain. In a small double blind, randomized controlled trial (n = 16), a 7 day course of domperidone (10 mg TID) given to mothers of preterm infants experiencing insufficient milk production resulted in a significantly increased milk supply (P < 0.05), low levels of drug detected in breast milk (< 0.2 mcg/kg/d) and significantly higher maternal prolactin level when compared to the placebo group. No infant or maternal side effects were reported in the above trials. Both the Canadian and American Academy of Pediatrics have approved the use of domperidone for breast-feeding mothers.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^114vbx4V]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone ER IM (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) in pregnant patients for third trimester: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. When considering the use of risperidone during pregnancy, the possibility of risperidone-related adverse outcomes in the fetus or neonate should be weighed against the risks of an untreated maternal psychiatric condition, which may include hospitalization, relapse, suicide, and increased adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., pre-term birth). Drug-induced hyperprolactinemia may impair reproductive function in both male and female patients. Hyperprolactinemia causes a reduction in the pituitary secretion of gonadotropin which, in turn, impairs gonadal steroidogenesis. The drug risperidone ER IM (also known as Uzedy, Perseris) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

Ethics, informed consent and safety

Documented approval has been obtained from the Research Ethics Boards/Institutional Review Boards of the participating centres prior to study start. In addition documented approval has been obtained from Health Canada to study domperidone for this off-label indication. The study is also designed to conform to the International Conference on Harmonization of good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, as well as local regulations and policies as well as with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent must be obtained from each participant.

There is no interim analysis planned but regular safety reviews are scheduled for every 100 patients recruited at which time all adverse and serious adverse events are reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB will also have the right to review any variables that may have an impact on the trial.

Eligibility

Inclusion criteria

The goal is to identify those mothers truly at higher risk of not being able to produce and maintain a supply of breast milk in sufficient quantities for her infant.

i. mothers of a preterm infant born ≤ 29 completed weeks gestation (23 1/7–29 6/7 weeks)

ii. postpartum period of 7–21 days

iii. mechanically pumping an minimum average of 6 times a day in the 4–7 days prior to entry

iv. experiencing inadequate milk supply defined as providing < 100% of the average of the daily nutritional intake during the previous 72 hour period prior to entry based on a fluid intake of 150 ml/kg/d or experiencing a clinical reduction of 30% from a peak volume during the previous 72 hour period prior to entry (maternal report). The 30% reduction reported by the mother will be confirmed by lactation support personnel in the NICU. In the case of mothers with twins, the estimated fluid volume to be produced will be based on the weight of the larger twin. Mothers can be identified in the NICU as early as day 4 until day 18 post delivery.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — Table 1 pharmacologic galactogogues (domperidone and metoclopramide) summarize evidence, dosing, duration, effects on lactation, and safety. Domperidone has "Five Level IB studies; others have inadequate methodology or excessive dropout rates" and was used at "10 mg, orally, 3 times per day" in most trials, with one study comparing "10 mg 3 times per day with 20 mg 3 times per day" and noting more milk production; "Doses > 60 mg per day have not been studied in this context". Reported treatment courses were "between 7 and 28 days", with "Increased rate of milk secretion in both pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants and other mothers with low milk supply". Adverse events included "psychomotor withdrawal symptoms from a dose of 160 mg per day" and rare arrhythmias "(1.3/10,000 postpartum women)". For metoclopramide, evidence is "IB-IIB… mixed results; effect on overall rate of milk secretion is unclear, but may be effective", with dosing "10 mg, orally, 3 to 4 times per day" for "7–14 days in various studies", effects described as "Possible increased rate of milk secretion; possible responders versus nonresponders", and safety concerns including "Reversible CNS effects with short-term use… " and "Rare reports of tardive dyskinesia (usually irreversible), causing the FDA to place a black box warning on this drug in the United States".

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^1157GeCG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Domperidone, a drug that enhances upper gastric motility, is an anti-dopaminergic medication that also elevates prolactin levels. It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using domperidone. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of domperidone (given to lactating mothers of very preterm infants) on the macronutrient composition of breast milk.

Methods/Design

Mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, who are at least 3 weeks postpartum, and experiencing lactational failure despite non-pharmacological interventions, will be randomized to receive domperidone (10 mg three times daily) or placebo for a 14-day period. Breast milk samples will be obtained the day prior to beginning treatment and on days 4, 7 and 14. The macronutrient (protein, fat, carbohydrate and energy) and macromineral content (calcium, phosphorus and sodium) will be analyzed and compared between the two groups. Additional outcome measures will include milk volumes, serum prolactin levels (measured on days 0, 4, and 10), daily infant weights and breastfeeding rates at 2 weeks post study completion and at discharge. Forty-four participants will be recruited into the study. Analysis will be carried out using the intention to treat approach.

Discussion

If domperidone causes significant changes to the nutrient content of breast milk, an alteration in feeding practices for preterm infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth, nutrition and neurodevelopment outcomes.

### Domperidone for lactation: what health care providers need to know [^117H38Dc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This commentary serves to raise health care provider awareness about the regulatory status and available evidence regarding domperidone for insufficient lactation. Breastfeeding provides significant health benefits for mothers and infants, and insufficient milk production remains the most common reason for early weaning. Domperidone, a dopamine receptor antagonist that may increase milk production, is not approved for any human use in the United States. It is approved in some countries for certain gastrointestinal disorders, but is not approved in any country for lactation enhancement. Domperidone is associated with serious cardiac arrhythmias. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an import alert in 2004, updated in 2012, explaining that the importation of domperidone is illegal with limited exceptions, including when imported pursuant to an investigational new drug application. The FDA also issued a public safety warning regarding the use of domperidone for lactation. Nonetheless, domperidone is sometimes being obtained illegally and used in attempts to increase milk production in lactating mothers. There is limited quality evidence for the effectiveness of domperidone for lactation enhancement. In contrast, considerable information exists on domperidone's cardiac risks including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death, including among lactating women. In light of limited efficacy data that do not offset safety concerns from a public health perspective, we continue to caution against using domperidone for lactation enhancement. Research and drug development are needed to address the significant unmet medical need for lactation disorders.

### Central mechanisms of emesis: a role for GDF15 [^111ohXNP]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

6 | HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM AND GDF15: A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN MECHANISTIC INSIGHT

Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) affects ~70% of women with often debilitating consequences. It usually begins at approximately 6–8 weeks of gestation and generally diminishes in intensity by the end of the first trimester. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), a severe and highly dangerous emetic condition associated with pregnancy, has been reported to occur in up to 11% of pregnant women and it is characterized by nausea and emesis that are so severe that normal eating/drinking is negatively impacted and often leads to weight loss and electrolyte disturbances which carry significant risks to the longer-term health of both mother and offspring. In fact, HG is the primary cause of hospitalization in the first trimester, and the second most common cause of pregnancy hospitalization overall in the United States. Despite being a severe problem, only in the last few years have significant advances in the understanding of its underlying pathophysiological mechanism(s) been made. Traditional forms of interventions or management for HG encompass dietary supplementation (e.g. vitamin supplements), lifestyle adjustments (like consuming smaller and more frequent meals), and medical treatments (e.g. metoclopramide, ondansetron). The latter is used by ~20% of pregnant women in the United States. While demonstrating some efficacy in alleviating HG symptoms, these medications were not originally designed for HG and are considered off-label for treating other types of nausea and emesis, making them suboptimal choices at best and likely unable to qualitatively improve the condition.

### Practice bulletin summary no. 153: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^111Q7Szq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Gastroparesis in pregnancy [^111WNgMk]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Gastroparesis is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that more commonly affects women, with most cases being diagnosed during childbearing age. However, there is a paucity of data and guidelines to specifically highlight the epidemiology, disease course, maternal and fetal impact, and the management of existing gastroparesis during pregnancy. Apart from metoclopramide, there is no approved therapy specifically indicated for gastroparesis. More importantly, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic agents in the management of gastroparesis. This poses a real challenge to healthcare providers in counseling and managing patients with gastroparesis. In this systematic review, we summarize the current available literature and the knowledge gaps in the impact of pregnancy on gastroparesis and vice versa. We also highlight the efficacy and safety profiles of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies in the management of patients with gastroparesis, with emphasis on judicious use of dietary approaches that are deemed relatively safe during pregnancy.

Study outcomes

Primary outcome

The primary outcome is the difference between the two groups in achieving a 50% increase in breast milk volume at the end of the first 2-week period (mean day 14 volume- mean day 0 volume at entry).

Secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes include:

i. mean difference in the tabulated volume in breast milk recorded between the two groups at 2 and 4 weeks (mean day 14 or 28 volume- mean day 0 volume at entry)

ii. mean within-subject differences between the two groups at 2 and 4 weeks (mean day 14 or 28 volume- mean day 0 volume at entry)

iii. effect of gestational age at the time of delivery on the volume of milk (23–26 and 27–29 weeks gestation at delivery) between the two groups

iv. effect of timing of inadequate milk supply post delivery on the volume of milk (7–14 and 15–21 days) between the two groups

v. difference in the use of supplementation to expressed breast milk, such as formula or donor breast milk between the two groups during the study period (day 14 and 28)

vi. rates of breastfeeding, use of supplementation, such as formula or donor breast milk at 40 weeks post conceptual age (term) and at 6 weeks post term between the different groups

vii. potential differences in adverse events, in particular, those related to gastrointestinal or cardiac difficulties

Constipation in pregnancy — Best Practice Advice 5 outlines causes and safe treatments. Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes, and treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol–based laxatives. Constipation may be experienced by 20%–40% of pregnant persons, and hemorrhoids occur in approximately 80% of pregnant persons, more commonly during the third trimester. Increasing dietary fiber to approximately 30 g/d and adequate fluids can help promote regular bowel movements and prevent constipation. Bulk-forming agents such as psyllium husk or methylcellulose are safe to administer in pregnancy, and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose can also be administered safely; stimulant laxatives should be avoided because safety data on these medications are conflicting. In a prospective study of 204 patients treated with hydrocortisone foam for hemorrhoids in the third trimester, no adverse events were seen compared with placebo, and encouraging pregnant women to avoid straining by providing ample time, using relaxation techniques, and adjusting diet and hydration is helpful.

### Use of prescription antiemetics among US commercially insured pregnant patients, 2005–2019 [^114u7LCF]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

According to the 2004 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline, pyridoxine or a combination of doxylamine and pyridoxine is recommended as first-line therapy, whereas ondansetron should be reserved as a last-line therapy to control nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP). The 2018 ACOG guideline recommends use of ondansetron as third-line therapy. Given the treatment guidelines' updates, little is known regarding how antiemetics have been used. We aimed to address this evidence gap by describing prescription antiemetic treatment patterns considering monotherapy, switching, and combination therapy during the first trimester. We also evaluated factors associated with ondansetron use, the most commonly used prescription antiemetic during the study period.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113yFYce]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study reviewed the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues in postpartum mothers through network analysis. Our paper involved 17 trials and nearly 800 women, which significantly surpassing previous meta-analyses. We also compared the efficacy and safety between domperidone and metoclopramide as galactagogues, which was analyzed and published in a meta-analysis for the first time. In this first comprehensive NMA, we found domperidone was more efficacious than metoclopramide and placebo in improving breast milk insufficiency. This benefit was only revealed in mothers with preterm infants. Orally domperidone 30 mg/day for seven days (cumulative doses = 210 mg) had maximal efficacy based on available data for improving breast milk insufficiency. Meantime, domperidone did not increase the maternal drug-related adverse outcomes, compared with metoclopramide and placebo.

Ethics

Informed consent will be obtained from the women prior to study entry. The IWK Health Centre Research Ethics Board has approved this study. Domperidone is considered safe for use in lactating women. Nevertheless, a careful watch will be kept on all study participates with regard to side effects of drug administration. Participants will be made aware of possible side effects and given contact numbers in the event they experience an adverse effect. The research nurse or a member of the research team will ask each participant if they are experiencing any possible side effects on day 4, 7, and 14 of the study when breast milk samples are collected. Infants will be monitored as per the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit standard of care and their clinical condition will be evaluated daily as part of medical rounds.

The current standard of care at the IWK Health Centre Neonatal Intensive Care Unit does not recommend pharmacological management for lactation failure. The use of domperidone is based on the individual management practices of each woman's physician. There will be no study restrictions regarding the continued use of domperidone following the two-week study period. Any decision to do so would occur based on discussions between the participant and her family doctor. A letter informing the participant and the family doctor which study arm the participant had been randomized to will be sent following completion of the study.

### Omeprazole dr [^117GBG4m]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with omeprazole in pregnant women. Available epidemiologic data fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use. Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits resulted in dose-dependent embryolethality at omeprazole doses that were approximately 5.5 to 56 times higher than the human dose. Omeprazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Human Data

Four epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.

A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995 to 99, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed in utero to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole-exposed infants than the expected number in this population.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^113uKcEg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Currently, there is no clear approach in managing mothers of preterm infants experiencing an inadequate production of breast milk. With EMPOWER, we hypothesize that domperidone, through its pharmacologic action on increasing prolactin levels, will assist mothers of very preterm infants, experiencing inadequate breast milk production, in increasing breast milk volumes to a level identified as being sufficient for continued pumping in the hospitalization period. We also hope to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in helping a mother who is experiencing an inadequate milk supply, and how it should be considered in the care of the mother and her preterm infant without causing adverse consequences to either the mother or infant.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — Domperidone safety, interactions, dosing, and FDA status: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an advisory against the use of domperidone in lactating women and has explicitly recommended against the use of Domperidone to increase milk production; domperidone is not approved by the FDA for use in the United States, except for some specific circumstances, and prescription medications used as galactogogues constitute off-label use in most countries. Neonatal findings report very low levels in milk and no QTc prolongation in premature infants who had ingested breast milk of mothers on domperidone. Interactions note increased blood levels of domperidone when combined with some substrates metabolized by CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors, for example, fluconazole, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit juice, cannabinoids, antipsychotics, and others. Use comments include do not advise exceeding maximum recommended dosage; for gastrointestinal dysmotility, doses of 20 mg 3 or 4 times per day may be recommended if no response to lower doses, with some areas using this dose initially to stimulate prolactin and only one study using this dose in lactating women; tapering of dose usually recommended. Potential side effects (minor and significant) should be weighed carefully against any potential benefit.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111fLnjL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply.

Methods/Design

EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80% power and alpha = 0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to 560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36–40 months.

Discussion

The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^111QVVBo]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Domperidone courses

Fifty-two per cent (n = 362) of women received two or more dispensing of domperidone during the infant's hospitalisation. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of receiving two or more courses of domperidone included primiparity, gestational age < 28 weeks, use of assisted reproductive techniques and higher socioeconomic status (online supplemental table 1). The ITS analysis showed no significant changes over time with respect to the proportion of women who received one compared with two or more treatment courses for domperidone. Following the 2014 recommendations, there was a non-significant change in level (1.58%; 95% CI −14.79% to 17.94%), with a non-significant change in trend (0.18% per half year, 95% CI −2.76% to 3.12%; online supplemental figure 3).

Impact on breastfeeding outcomes

Any domperidone dispensing was associated with a reduced likelihood of breast milk feeding at infant discharge (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.46, 0.77). From 2004 to 2018, breast milk feeding rates among women dispensed domperidone were consistently lower than in those not (figure 2). When stratified according to the timing of first dispensing, compared with those not dispensed domperidone, the likelihood of continued breastmilk feeding at discharge was lowest in women dispensed domperidone 8–28 days post partum (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.65; online supplemental table 2). Two or more dispensings were associated with increased odds of continued breast milk feeding at infant discharge (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.49) compared with those who received a single domperidone dispensing. Infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation had the lowest rates of breast milk feeding at infant discharge across the study period (56%, n = 122, not breast feeding; online supplemental figure 4).

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114U5zL1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of a pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish a woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (1, 2). Because morning sickness is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric care providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (1). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about the safety of medications (3). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms. Treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (4). Safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases, and mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^114GzBeP]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) and heartburn — prevalence, timing, and initial treatment are outlined: Heartburn, nausea, and vomiting are common during pregnancy, with frequency ranging from 30%–90%. NVP usually begins at 4–6 weeks and peaks at 8–12 weeks. Diet and lifestyle modification are the initial steps in managing these symptoms in pregnancy. H2-receptor blockers are the most used antireflux medications during pregnancy, and cimetidine and famotidine are administered routinely in pregnancy. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole or pantoprazole, can be considered if lifestyle modifications and antacids fail to alleviate symptoms; in a meta-analysis of 26 studies, no significant associations between proton pump inhibitor use and abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, and low birth weight were observed, although a nonsignificant increase in the risk of congenital malformations was seen.

Domperidone — clinical evidence and safety in lactating women are summarized as follows: Domperidone and metoclopramide are the most commonly used pharmaceutical galactogogues at present. Randomized trials report increased milk output with short courses postpartum and during milk expression; in one study of 45 women, 22 were given domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 4 days postcesarean section and were found to have increased milk production, and in a second study of only 15 women there was a 300-mL per day difference when comparing 60 mg per day versus 30 mg per day for 4 weeks. A third trial compared domperidone, 30 mg per day, with metoclopramide, 30 mg per day. The largest trial (EMPOWER) included 90 women randomized between 8 and 21 days postpartum to domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 28 days or placebo for 14 days then domperidone, 30 mg per day, for 14 days; at 14 days, 77.8% in the domperidone-first group increased milk production by 50% compared with 57.8% in the placebo-first group, but by 28 days there were no significant differences and none at term or at 6 weeks post-term. One older very small study (n = 6) suggested that individual women may be responders or nonresponders and that primiparas may respond to domperidone with higher prolactin levels than multiparas. Regarding cardiac risk, there is evidence that domperidone increases the QTc interval and it has been implicated in ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, and in a study of more than 225,532 postpartum women, the only women who developed ventricular arrhythmias while taking domperidone had a past history of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Metoclopramide in pregnancy and risk of major congenital malformations and fetal death [^1115cvFq]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Metoclopramide, a drug frequently used for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, is thought to be safe, but information on the risk of specific malformations and fetal death is lacking.

Objective

To investigate the safety of metoclopramide use in pregnancy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Register-based cohort study in Denmark, 1997–2011. From a cohort of 1,222,503 pregnancies, metoclopramide-exposed and unexposed women were matched (1:4 ratio) on the basis of age, calendar year, and propensity scores.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were major congenital malformations overall, 20 individual malformation categories (selected according to power criteria), spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth. In matched analyses, logistic regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios of malformations and Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of spontaneous abortion.

Results

Among 28,486 women exposed to metoclopramide in the first trimester, 721 had an infant with a major congenital malformation (25.3 [95% CI, 23.5–27.1] cases per 1000 births), compared with 3024 among 113,698 unexposed women (26.6 [95% CI, 25.7–27.5] per 1000 births). There were no significant associations between metoclopramide use and malformations overall (prevalence odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86–1.02]) or any of the 20 individual malformation categories, eg, neural tube defects, transposition of great vessels, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, cleft lip, cleft palate, anorectal atresia/stenosis, and limb reduction (upper limit of 95% CI below 2.0 for 17 of 20 categories). Metoclopramide was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion (757 cases [20.0 {95% CI, 18.5–21.4} per 1000] among 37,946 metoclopramide-exposed women and 9414 cases [62.1 {95% CI, 60.9–63.3} per 1000] among 151,661 unexposed women; HR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.33–0.38]) and stillbirth (142 cases [3.5 {95% CI, 2.9–4.1} per 1000] among 40,306 metoclopramide-exposed women and 634 cases [3.9 {95% CI, 3.6–4.2} per 1000] among 161,098 unexposed women; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.74–1.08]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Metoclopramide use in pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of major congenital malformations overall, any of the 20 individual malformation categories assessed, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. These safety data may help inform decision making when treatment with metoclopramide is considered in pregnancy.

### Nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy [^115jXL5z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than half of pregnant women suffer from nausea and vomiting, which typically begins by the 4th week and disappears by the 16th week of pregnancy. The cause of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is unknown, but may be due to the rise in human chorionic gonadotrophin concentration. In 1 in 200 women, the condition progresses to hyperemesis gravidarum, which is characterised by prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatment for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy? What are the effects of treatments for hyperemesis gravidarum? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 30 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupressure; acupuncture; antihistamines; corticosteroids; corticotrophins; diazepam; dietary interventions other than ginger; domperidone; ginger; metoclopramide; ondansetron; phenothiazines; and pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^116xhnZN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale for phase II trial

Mothers of preterm infants are at a higher risk of a decline in milk production. It has been recommended that they should be evaluated no later than two weeks postpartum to determine what intervention may be required to assist them in augmenting and maintaining an adequate supply of milk. Although other measures can and should be considered, the use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. The limited body of research on domperidone suggests that it has potential as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants; this has led to widespread use of this medication. However, there is a paucity of research to best guide clinicians as to the optimal dose, timing of administration and duration of treatment and to reaffirm safety. EMPOWER was initiated to firmly establish the safety of domperidone for mothers of preterm infants but also guide clinicians regarding initiation, timing and duration of treatment.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^112bZoKX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Breast milk is widely recognised as the best source of nutrition for all infants, particularly for preterm infants. However, lactation insufficiency, when a mother cannot produce enough breast milk to meet her infant's requirements, is frequent after preterm birth and is one of the most common reasons women discontinue breast feeding. Despite recognition that mothers of preterm infants face additional challenges with breastfeeding, lactation support for this high-risk group is often suboptimal. When lactation insufficiency persists following non-pharmacological supports, medications such as domperidone are often used to increase breast milk production.

Domperidone increases serum prolactin, a hormone required for breast milk production. Meta-analyses of trials involving mothers of preterm infants with diagnosed lactation insufficiency demonstrate that domperidone is effective for increasing short-term breast milk production by up to 88 mL/day at doses of 30 mg/day for 5–14 days. In contrast, limited evidence supports using domperidone as a preventative therapy immediately or soon after birth. Consequently, use is not typically recommended until after milk letdown has occurred and a trial of non-pharmacological strategies has been completed.

Whether identified short-term benefits of domperidone translate to improved longer-term breast milk feeding outcomes for mothers of preterm infants remains inconclusive. Previous studies report continued breast milk feeding rates at infant discharge from hospital ranging from 58% to 95% among women prescribed domperidone. Clinical trial evidence is inconsistent, with reports of higher breastfeeding rates at discharge or no difference, based on domperidone use. These studies also have significant limitations, including small sample sizes and differences in the treatment regimens. Consequently, it remains difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the longer-term impacts of domperidone use for lactation insufficiency.

Despite uncertainties surrounding longer-term breastfeeding outcomes, the use of domperidone among mothers of preterm infants has increased in high-income countries such as the UK and Canada, with reports suggesting up to 44% of all mothers of preterm infants are prescribed domperidone. Concurrently, safety concerns have been raised about domperidone. In 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed domperidone's safety and efficacy data and recommended changes in practice due to a small risk of serious cardiac side effects.

Stratified by different cumulative doses during trials

We used 210 mg (30 mg/day × 7 days) as a boundary for the cumulative dose and divided domperidone and metoclopramide into four groups: "domperidone > 210 mg" (5 trials), "domperidone 210 mg" (6 trials), "metoclopramide > 210 mg" (4 trials), and "metoclopramide 210 mg" (3 trials).

After analysis, we found that both "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume ("domperidone > 210 mg" vs. placebo: MD = 150.80, 95% CI: 80.55–216.73; "domperidone 210 mg" vs. placebo: MD = 74.42, 95% CI: 21.47–129.06; Fig. 4 C). Meanwhile, there was no difference between "domperidone > 210 mg" and "domperidone 210 mg" (MD = 76.54, 95% CI: -13.39–160.33; Supplemental Table S7).

There was no difference among "metoclopramide > 210 mg", "metoclopramide 210 mg", and placebo (Fig. 4 C and Supplemental Table S7).

Safety of galactagogues

There was no difference in the frequency of maternal drug-related adverse outcomes among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo (Fig. 5 and Supplemental Table S8). Four trials investigated the neonatal adverse effects: three trials did not reveal any drug-related adverse events, and one trial found there was no difference of the frequency of neonatal adverse events between domperidone and placebo.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^111pACGD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods/design

Primary research question

The primary research question is: in mothers of preterm infants 23–29 completed weeks (23 1/7–29 6/7 weeks) gestation at birth who are pumping to provide expressed breast milk for their infant(s) and are identified as having an inadequate milk supply, does the administration of domperidone compare to placebo increase breast milk volume without any signs of harm over a 2 week period?

Secondary research questions

There are several secondary research questions:

i. Is there a relationship between the volume of breast milk produced and timing of initiation and duration of domperidone to treat mothers with defined low breast milk supply?

ii. Does gestation at birth contribute to any treatment effect from domperidone in mothers with defined low breast milk supply?

iii. Is there a difference in the volume of breast milk produced in mothers identified having an inadequate supply within 7–14 days post delivery versus mothers identified 15–21 days post delivery?

iv. Is there a difference in the use of supplementation such as donor breast milk or preterm infant formula between the different strategies of administration during the study period?

v. Is there a difference in the use of supplementation, such as formula or donor breast milk by the mother to her infant at 40 weeks post conceptual age (term) and at 6 weeks corrected age (6 weeks post term) between the two groups?

vi. Is there a difference in potential adverse events or effects, in particular, those related to gastrointestinal or cardiac difficulties between the two approaches?

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^113ocEVA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Design

EMPOWER is a multi-centre, double-masked, randomized controlled trial in which 560 mothers will randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily for 14 days. (Figure 1) The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the first 2-week period comparing study drug and placebo; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. The mothers will be contacted when their infants are term gestation (40 weeks post conceptual age) and 6 weeks corrected (6 weeks post date of confinement) to document the feeding patterns (breastfeeding/bottle feeding), continued frequency of breast stimulation, additional use of a galactogogue or alternative after the study period, and the use of supplementation other than mother's own milk for their infants at these time points. In addition, the mothers will be asked to a few questions regarding the intervention and their participation in the trial.

Figure 1
EMPOWER Schema.

Randomization

Upon consent, the site co-ordinator will be able to randomize the mother using a 24 hour/day web-based randomization service at the data coordinating centre (DCC) at the Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research (CMICR) in Toronto. A treatment number will be issued which will correspond to the study medication at the centre which has been previously sent to the site. The study allocation will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio in blocks of 4 and 8. The study participants will be stratified by centre, gestational age groupings (23–26 and 27–29 weeks gestation at delivery) and days post delivery (7–14 and 15–21 days post delivery).

Study setting

The study setting is multi-national with approximately 20–25 centres in Canada, Israel, Qatar, and Chile. Enrollment began in June 2012 and is expected to be completed in 36–42 months.

### The safety of metoclopramide use in the first trimester of pregnancy [^117LEyZT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

In various countries, metoclopramide is the antiemetic drug of choice in pregnant women, but insufficient information exists regarding its safety in pregnancy.

Methods

We investigated the safety of metoclopramide use during the first trimester of pregnancy by linking a computerized database of medications dispensed between January 1, 1998, and March 31, 2007, to all women registered in the Clalit Health Services, southern district of Israel, with computerized databases containing maternal and infant hospital records from the district hospital during the same period. We assessed associations between the use of metoclopramide in pregnancy and adverse outcomes for the fetus, adjusting for parity, maternal age, ethnic group, presence or absence of maternal diabetes, smoking status, and presence or absence of peripartum fever.

Results

There were 113,612 singleton births during the study period. A total of 81,703 of the infants (71.9%) were born to women registered in Clalit Health Services; 3458 of them (4.2%) were exposed to metoclopramide during the first trimester of pregnancy. Exposure to metoclopramide, as compared with no exposure to the drug, was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations (5.3% and 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89 to 1.21), low birth weight (8.5% and 8.3%; odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.14), preterm delivery (6.3% and 5.9%; odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.34), or perinatal death (1.5% and 2.2%; odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.38). The results were materially unchanged when therapeutic abortions of exposed and unexposed fetuses were included in the analysis.

Conclusions

In this large cohort of infants, exposure to metoclopramide in the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of any of several adverse outcomes. These findings provide reassurance regarding the safety of metoclopramide for the fetus when the drug is given to women to relieve nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.

### Practice bulletin no. 153: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^114NMNyC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a common condition that affects the health of the pregnant woman and her fetus. It can diminish the woman's quality of life and also significantly contributes to health care costs and time lost from work (). Because "morning sickness" is common in early pregnancy, the presence of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be minimized by obstetricians, other obstetric providers, and pregnant women and, thus, undertreated (). Furthermore, some women do not seek treatment because of concerns about safety of medications (). Once nausea and vomiting of pregnancy progresses, it can become more difficult to control symptoms; treatment in the early stages may prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization (). Mild cases of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy may be resolved with lifestyle and dietary changes, and safe and effective treatments are available for more severe cases. The woman's perception of the severity of her symptoms plays a critical role in the decision of whether, when, and how to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. In addition, nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be distinguished from nausea and vomiting related to other causes. The purpose of this document is to review the best available evidence about the diagnosis and management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy.

### Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy [^115mhRdR]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting is extensive and the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose. Treatment of nausea and vomiting also can be unsatisfactory because the available pharmacotherapy does not correct the fundamental underlying pathophysiologic abnormalities. In contrast, the diagnosis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally is straightforward. Almost 80% of women have some degree of nausea in the first trimester of pregnancy, and the diagnosis of pregnancy is established easily by the patient or physician. The spectrum varies from mild nausea to hyperemesis gravidarum. Various treatment approaches are addressed.

Results

Baseline of involved studies

410 potentially relevant publications were retrieved from five databases. After screening and reading the full-text articles, 17 RCTs were included in our final analyses (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Flow chart of study selection

The first trial was carried out in 1983 and the latest one was in 2021 (Table 1). All trials were carried out in Asia (India, Indonesia, Iran, Singapore, and Thailand), Australia, Europe (Belgium, Finland, Italy, and the United Kingdom), and North America (Canada and USA). Sixteen studies were two-arm: nine trials compared domperidone with placebo; six trials compared metoclopramide with placebo; and one trial compared domperidone with metoclopramide. One study was three-arm: they distributed domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo in their trial (Fig. 2). 787 postpartum mothers were involved: 226 mothers received domperidone, 210 received metoclopramide, and 351 received placebo. The eligibility criteria, the number of participants, the gestational age, the details of interventions, and outcomes are shown in Table 1 and Supplemental Table S2.

Efficacy of galactagogues

16 RCTs reported the increased breast milk volume (in mL/day). Before subgroup analysis, we found that mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 78.13, 95% CI: 12.28–145.91; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 103.55, 95% CI: 59.18–148.36; Fig. 3 and Supplemental Table S3). There was no difference between metoclopramide and placebo (MD = 25.38, 95% CI: -34.10–82.92; Fig. 3).

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QtGsZ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide used by breastfeeding women. Methods: A systematic literature search retrieved citations from PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Medline, EBSCO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov (from inception to January, 2021) and bibliographies of known articles. Randomized controlled trials exploring the effects of domperidone and metoclopramide in breastfeeding women with term and preterm infants experiencing adequate or low milk supply were identified. Human milk volume and maternal side effects were presented as mean difference (MD) or relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Sixteen trials involving 729 women were included in the qualitative analysis and 14 trials involving 607 women were included in the meta-analysis. In mothers of preterm infants with low milk supply, domperidone demonstrated a significant increase in daily human milk volume (MD = 90.53mL/day, 95% CI [65.42 to 115.64], I² = 9%). However, metoclopramide did not show significant difference in daily human milk volume in women with preterm infants (MD = -1.14mL/day, 95% CI [-31.42 to 29.14], I² = 0%). No differences in maternal side effects were noted with domperidone (RR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.74 to 1.97], I² = 0%) or metoclopramide (RR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.52 to 2.11], I² = 27%) in women with preterm infants. Regarding the women with term infants, there were insufficient data in the current review. Conclusions: Domperidone can be used to treat low milk supply in women with preterm infants without significant side effects based on the current review. More evidence exploring the efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide are still needed for breastfeeding women in the future.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112U9yjE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Domperidone increased the daily breast milk volume in mothers of preterm infants, without serious adverse events. However, this conclusion is limited due to the small sample sizes in the studies analyzed. The use of domperidone for breast milk stimulation must be prescribed by a physician, and potential side effects should be considered. Women should receive appropriate guidance on ways to enhance breast milk production in hospital and in the 30 days following hospital discharge, before considering to medication to increase milk production.

Methods

Setting

The Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH) is an Australian tertiary metropolitan hospital and South Australia's largest maternity, obstetric and neonatal care provider. During the study period, the neonatal unit had no dedicated lactation consultant position, with lactation support instead provided by midwifery staff of the general postnatal wards. Before 2014, the WCH had a standard domperidone prescribing checklist (online supplemental appendix 1), with 30 mg/day of domperidone prescribed for 5 days, followed by a 7-day tapering course (20 mg/day for 3 days, then 10 mg/day for 4 days). Prescriptions were provided by medical officers, following the checklist to ensure that patients had received adequate lactation support prior, were not taking medications or had known cardiac conditions contraindicating domperidone use, and that advice on potential side effects had been provided. From 2014 onwards, the prescribing checklist was amended to recommend a shorter 7-day treatment course at a maximum dose of 30 mg/day (online supplemental appendix 2).

### Evaluating the effect of a 14-day course of domperidone on breast milk production: a per-protocol analysis from the EMPOWER trial [^115uCS1e]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Galactogogues are often considered when mothers of very preterm infants experience challenges in producing adequate amounts of breast milk. We conducted a per-protocol analysis of those mothers who completed a 14-day course of domperidone during the EMPOWER trial. Our primary aim was to evaluate the response to a completed course of domperidone and whether the response was affected by the timing of the initiation of intervention.

Methods

For this analysis, 83 mothers of infants ≤ 29 weeks gestation were included: 45 mothers who received domperidone from days 1 to 14 of the trial study treatment period and 38 mothers who received domperidone from days 15 to 28. Domperidone was given at a dose of 10mg thrice daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the proportion of mothers who achieved a modest 50% increase in breast milk volume from the volume at the end of the 2-week period of treatment of domperidone.

Results

When adjusted for the initiation of domperidone treatment, the proportion of mothers in the days 1–14 group (77.8%) was similar compared to those in the days 15–28 group (65.8%), OR 1.96 (95% CI 0.72–5.32; p = 0.19).

Conclusion

Taking into consideration potential limitations in power, this secondary analysis was able to show that the mothers in the EMPOWER study who were identified as actually completing a 14-day treatment course responded irrespective of the timing of their initiation of domperidone and demonstrated a modest increase in breast milk volume.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^113vng9t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

Significance of study

To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. Currently, guidelines for fortification of human milk for preterm infants do not distinguish between women using or not using domperidone. Domperidone causes an increase in maternal prolactin levels and has been shown to significantly increase human breast milk volumes. No study has examined the effect of domperidone use (to augment lactation) on the composition of breast milk. The purpose of this study is to compare the macronutrient and macro mineral composition of breast milk between mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, receiving domperidone versus placebo. If significant differences in nutrient content occur between groups, alterations to current standards of feeding practices for premature infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth and nutrition. The results of this study will provide clinicians with valuable information to aid in guiding feeding practices for preterm infants.

### Effects of domperidone on augmentation of lactation following cesarean delivery at full term [^114aU1Qc]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of domperidone on breast milk production in women who underwent cesarean at full term.

Methods

Women who underwent uncomplicated full-term cesarean were randomly assigned to receive domperidone or placebo for 4 consecutive days post partum. Breast milk was collected twice daily via electric breast pump. Baseline milk production was determined by measuring the volume of milk collected on the 1st postpartum day, before initiation of study medication (day 0). The daily volume of milk collected was compared between groups. Adverse treatment-related effects were recorded.

Results

The study was completed by 22 women in the domperidone group and 23 in the placebo group. Compared with day 0, mean increases in milk volume per participant collected on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 were significantly higher in the domperidone (13.6 ± 23.2 mL, 68.5 ± 71.9 mL, 144.5 ± 122.3 mL, and 191.3 ± 136.1 mL) than in the placebo (2.5 ± 4.6 mL, 24.5 ± 26.5 mL, 72.1 ± 55.6 mL, and 91.4 ± 60.3 mL) group. Minor adverse effects were reported by 7 women in the domperidone group.

Conclusion

Postpartum treatment with domperidone can augment breast milk production after full-term cesarean, with minimal adverse effects.

### Study protocol: a double blind placebo controlled trial examining the effect of domperidone on the composition of breast milk [NCT00308334] [^111noydb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

What is the planned recruitment rate?

In the year 2000, 58 surviving infants less than 31 weeks gestation were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Of these 20–25 percent were multiple births. Breastfeeding initiation rates are 80–85 percent in our nursery. Due to the lack of information regarding the incidence of lactation failure in this population, a convenience (2001) survey of mothers of preterm infants providing breast milk for their babies was carried out. Fifty-five percent of these mothers had experienced lactation failure, several of whom had been prescribed domperidone (domperidone is not prescribed routinely in this centre). Therefore, 20–23 women a year will be eligible for the study. Recruitment rates for research studies in our NICU range from 60–100 percent. Based on previous studies done in this setting where risk is minimal and side effects are rare, we estimate a greater than 90 percent recruitment rate.

### Longitudinal trends in domperidone dispensing to mothers of very preterm infants and its association with breast milk feeding at infant discharge: a retrospective study [^115c9NZ7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Results

Domperidone prevalence

From 2004 to 2018, 1688 mothers met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 41% (n = 691) were dispensed domperidone. Maternal age, BMI and decreased gestational age at birth were significantly associated with an increased likelihood of being dispensed domperidone (all p < 0.05; table 1). Prior to 2014, the proportion of women dispensed domperidone was stable. Following the recommendations, there was a non-significant change in level (3.10%; 95% CI −11.10 to 17.29), with a significant change in trend (−2.55% per half year, 95% CI −4.57% to –0.53%; figure 1). Further, similar reductions in dispensing over time were evident across all gestational age groups (online supplemental figure 1).

Following the recommendations, there was a non-significant change in level (3.10%; 95% CI −11.10 to 17.29), with a significant change in trend (−2.55% per half year, 95% CI −4.57% to –0.53%).

Dispensing timing

Of the 691 women dispensed domperidone, 15% (n = 107) received their first dispensing in the first 7 days after delivery, while 51% (n = 350) received it from postnatal days 8–28 (table 2). Among those receiving domperidone, factors associated with an increased likelihood of domperidone dispensing within the first 7 days post partum included older maternal age, higher socioeconomic status, private patient status and higher gestational age (table 2). The ITS analysis showed a non-significant immediate reduction in the proportion of women first dispensed domperidone within the first 7 days post partum compared with more than 7 days post partum following the 2014 recommendation (level change −4.01%; 95% CI −13.68 to 5.66), with a non-significant change in trend (−0.36% per half year, 95% CI −1.70% to 0.98%; online supplemental figure 2).

### Vomiting in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of low birth weight: a cohort study [^115d5aTU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Each of the study participants was given a printed questionnaire at recruitment with questions to answer and return once the pregnancy was completed. They were encouraged to fill it in as the pregnancy progressed. The questionnaires included boxes to tick if the participants had experienced nausea or had vomited during pregnancy. If either of these boxes were ticked there were further boxes to fill in concerning the timing (i.e. week(s) of pregnancy) when the nausea or vomiting were experienced. A further question asked "Have you taken any medicine during this pregnancy?" Those women who responded in the affirmative were then asked to complete a table with the following headings: "Name", "Disease", "Daily Dose", "No. of Days" and "Gestational Week(s)". This means that nausea and vomiting prior to attending the booking clinic would have had to have been recalled over a maximum period of several weeks whereas nausea and vomiting subsequent to that could be recorded as the pregnancy progressed (requiring recollection over a much shorter period of time). A total of 1238 women (54.6%) filled in the questionnaires; those that did not were excluded from the present analysis. For 598 of the pregnancies where the mother failed to return a filled-in questionnaire the baby's birth weight was also missing. The birth weights of the remaining babies, adjusted for pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, gestational age at birth, parity and sex, were not different between those that completed the questionnaire and those that did not (filled in questionnaire 3.482 (3.456, 3.508) kg v. did not fill in questionnaire 3.403 (3.310, 3.497) kg, p = 0.1), although the prevalence of LBW in the offspring of the women that returned the questionnaires was lower (filled in questionnaire 37/1218 v. did not fill in questionnaire 27/431, p = 5 × 10⁻³). Of those women that filled in their questionnaires only 3 reported that they had hyperemesis gravidarum and a further 17 were treated with anti-emetics: cyclizine (7), promethazine (5), prochlorperazine (4), metoclopramide (2), domperidone (2), prednisolone (2), chlorphenamine (1), ondansetron (1), chlorpromazine (1) and unknown (1). These 20 women were excluded from this specific analysis in order to test only those women who had a potentially milder phenotype. The self-reported timings of exposure to nausea and/or vomiting were divided into trimesters (first trimester being up to gestational week 12, second trimester being weeks 13 to 27 and third trimester being from week 28 onwards).

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^112LJMF5]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmaceutical galactogogues — mechanism and overall evidence limitations are noted: Domperidone and metoclopramide are the most commonly used pharmaceutical galactogogues at present, and both are dopamine antagonists that increase prolactin secretion. A number of older mainly observational or controlled studies documented increased baseline prolactin levels in lactating women who took metoclopramide or domperidone and provide some evidence for their effectiveness; however, high-quality evidence is lacking, the numbers of women in randomized, placebo-controlled blinded studies are small, and most studies also had limited follow-up.

### Metoclopramide for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a prospective multicenter international study [^114kRg5n]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are very common during pregnancy, mainly throughout the first trimester. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor blocking drug that is commonly used to treat nausea and vomiting. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the effect on the fetus of intrauterine exposure to metoclopramide. One hundred and seventy-five women who received metoclopramide and consulted 6 teratogen information centers in Israel, Italy, Brazil, and Canada were studied. Women exposed to metoclopramide were paired for age, smoking and alcohol consumption habits with women exposed to nonteratogens. Women in the metoclopramide group had a significantly higher rate of premature births (8.1%) as compared with the control group (2.4%) (p = 0.02, relative risk = 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.12–10.12). Rates of major malformations in the metoclopramide group (4.4%) did not differ from controls (4.8%) (p = 0.84, relative risk = 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.34–2.45). According to our findings, metoclopramide use during the first trimester of pregnancy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of malformations, spontaneous abortions, or decreased birth weight, however, larger studies are needed to confirm these observations.

### Efficacy and safety of domperidone and metoclopramide on human milk production in postpartum mothers: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117JLwwn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Stratified by gestational week (Preterm/term subgroup analysis)

12 RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with preterm infants. Preterm mothers who took domperidone had a greater increase in breast milk volume than those who took metoclopramide or placebo (domperidone vs. metoclopramide: MD = 82.84, 95% CI: 37.04–118.95; domperidone vs. placebo: MD = 88.30, 95% CI: 59.48–118.62; Fig. 4 A and Supplemental Table S4). There was no difference between metoclopramide and placebo (MD = 3.95, 95% CI: -22.52–46.59; Fig. 4 A).

Fig. 4
Subgroup analysis of efficacy. (A) Stratified by gestational week (preterm or term); (B) Stratified by different daily doses; (C) Stratified by different cumulative doses during trials

5 RCTs reported the efficacy outcome in mothers with term infants. There was no difference among domperidone, metoclopramide, and placebo (Fig. 4 A and Supplemental Table S5).

Stratified by different daily doses

According to the different daily doses, all trials received domperidone have been divided into 2 groups: "domperidone 30 mg/day" (9 trials) and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" (2 trials). All doses of metoclopramide taken were 30 mg per day.

Therefore, the results revealed both "domperidone 30 mg/day" and "domperidone > 30 mg/day" were more effective than placebo in increasing breast milk volume ("domperidone 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 100.52, 95% CI: 50.49–150.31; "domperidone > 30 mg/day" vs. placebo: MD = 120.35, 95% CI: 3.01–240.43; Fig. 4 B). Meanwhile, "domperidone 30 mg/day" was more efficacious than "metoclopramide 30 mg/day" for increasing breast milk volume (MD = 75.81, 95% CI: 6.13–147.15; Supplemental Table S6).

There was no difference between "metoclopramide 30 mg/day" and placebo (MD = 24.59, 95% CI: -36.93–84.64; Fig. 4 B).

### The impact and management of hyperemesis gravidarum: current and future perspectives [^117URK8X]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Antiemetics used in the treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).

Metoclopramide and ondansetron are considered second‐line antiemetic treatments for HG. Metoclopramide is considered safe and effective; however, due to a risk of extrapyramidal effects, a prescription should be provided with information on the potential side effects, and treatment should be discontinued if such side effects arise. Ondansetron should be considered as a second‐line treatment. One study found a slightly increased risk of orofacial clefting in babies born to individuals using ondansetron during the first trimester. However, due to extremely low absolute incidence (14 per 10 000 pregnancies compared with 11.4 per 10 000 pregnancies) some guidelines, including the RCOG guideline, state that use should not be discouraged if first‐line antiemetics are insufficiently effective. Individuals should be informed of potential side effects, which should be weighed against the risks of poorly managed HG (including termination of pregnancy), and healthcare professionals should not avoid ondansetron as a second‐ or third‐line treatment in the first trimester.

If symptoms cannot be adequately contained with (combination) antiemetic treatment, corticosteroids should be considered. Corticosteroids may reduce the frequency of vomiting and need for readmission. Due to well‐known side effects of corticosteroids, which include their effect on immune, metabolic, and adrenal function as well as fetal growth, this therapy is reserved for cases in which other antiemetics have not provided sufficient relief. Individuals using corticosteroids should have their blood pressure monitored and should be screened for gestational diabetes mellitus. Fetal growth monitoring should be considered in cases with prolonged use.

Combination of drugs should be used in individuals who have not responded to single antiemetic treatment. Despite the fact that there is an absolute dearth of studies comparing multi‐drug combination antiemetic treatment in HG, synergism of antiemetics from different classes has been the established best practice in other conditions, including postoperative nausea and vomiting or chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. It is also important to consider the route of administration of drugs for people with HG, as oral medication is often poorly tolerated due to frequent vomiting. For individuals with HG, antiemetic formulations, including buccal melts, transdermal patches, and rectal administrations, should be considered, if possible. In severe cases, parenteral or intramuscular route of administration may be necessary.

Future directions

Domperidone and metoclopramide were evaluated in this study. However, some other pharmacological galactagogues have been reported, such as sulpiride, growth hormone, recombinant human prolactin, thyrotropin releasing hormone, oxytocin, and metformin. Due to the scarcity of studies on these drugs, our NMA did not include them. More RCTs on these drugs for postpartum women needed to be carried out in the future.

Although some literature has reported the use of domperidone for lactation in couples who are adopting or same-sex couples, and transgender women, more study is needed.

### Effect of domperidone on the composition of preterm human breast milk [^111QXtxo]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Domperidone is increasingly prescribed to improve breast milk volume despite a lack of evidence regarding its effects on breast milk composition. We examined the effect of domperidone on the nutrient composition of breast milk.

Patients and Methods

Forty-six mothers who had delivered infants at < 31 weeks' gestation, who experienced lactation failure, were randomly assigned to receive domperidone or placebo for 14 days. Protein, energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels in breast milk were measured on days 0, 4, 7, and 14, serum prolactin levels were measured on days 0, 4, and 14, and total milk volume was recorded daily. Mean within-subject changes in nutrients and milk volumes were examined.

Results

Maternal and infant characteristics, serum prolactin level, and breast milk volume and composition were not significantly different between domperidone and placebo groups on day 0. By day 14, breast milk volumes increased by 267% in the domperidone-treated group and by 18.5% in the placebo group (P = 0.005). Serum prolactin increased by 97% in the domperidone group and by 17% in the placebo group (P = 0.07). Mean breast milk protein declined by 9.6% in the domperidone group and increased by 3.6% in the placebo group (P = 0.16). Changes in energy, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, and phosphate content were also not significantly different between groups. Significant increases were observed in breast milk carbohydrate (2.7% vs -2.7%; p = 0.05) and calcium (61.8% vs -4.4%; p = 0.001) in the domperidone versus placebo groups. No significant adverse events were observed among mothers or infants.

Conclusion

Domperidone increases the volume of breast milk of preterm mothers experiencing lactation failure, without substantially altering the nutrient composition.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^114fc5KN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the recent perinatal and neonatal technological advances, at least 8.2% of births in Canada are preterm (< 37 weeks gestation), a figure that has continued to rise. The very preterm infant is often growth restricted because of the concurrent illnesses and difficulties in optimizing energy and nutrient intake for normal growth. Studies have suggested that early nutritional intervention (breast milk and preterm formula) that will support growth, in particular brain growth, will lead to an improved outcome even in the presence of injury. There is further evidence to suggest that the use of mother's own breast milk compared to infant formula during initial hospitalization has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. There is a growing movement in neonatal care for very preterm infants to receive breast milk as the primary source of nutrition rather than rely on preterm formula. Mothers are therefore encouraged to begin pumping their breasts to provide breast milk for their infants. With preterm infants requiring hospitalization for anywhere from 10–16 weeks before their discharge from initial hospitalization, continued and sustained breast milk volume can prove to be a challenge to even the most dedicated of mothers. Most mothers of very preterm infants, for a variety of reasons such as illness, stress and other factors related to preterm birth, are unable to express sufficient amounts of milk to exclusively feed their infants.

There have been many identified and studied non-pharmacological measures such as emotional support, kangaroo care, skin-to-skin contact, expressing breast milk at the infant's bedside, increasing pumping frequency and duration and types of mechanical expression that have been found to contribute to variable levels of success in augmenting the breast milk production in mothers of preterm infants. For those mothers in whom milk production has declined and is not responding to non-pharmacologic measures, the use of galactogogues is often considered. Galactogogues are medications that induce lactation generally from exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement. The primary galactogogues used today for prolactin enhancement are dopamine antagonists with the most widely studied being metoclopramide and domperidone. Domperidone is a potent dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist and was developed and marketed as a prokinetic and antiemetic agent. By blocking dopamine D 2 receptors in the anterior pituitary, domperidone stimulates the release of prolactin Table 1.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: what does the gastroenterologist need to know? [^1164cbRP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to nausea and vomiting entails the exclusion of other causes, especially if these symptoms persist during the second and third trimesters. Most women do not require pharmacological treatment and can be managed with alternative options and dietary modifications. Diet recommendations include fractionized meals and avoidance of fatty foods and fresh vegetables that can delay gastric emptying. Daily consumption of 1.5 L of water or drinks containing glucose, salt and potassium are recommended. Both thiamine (vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) have proven their efficacy and are indicated as routine supplements in patients with protracted vomiting. A 2010 Cochrane review evaluated nine randomized trials involving ginger. Based on expert experience, ginger can be considered a non-pharmacologic option during pregnancy.

Concerning the pharmacological treatment, antiemetics can be an option for women with persistent nausea and vomiting. Histamine receptor blockers (anti-H1), such as promethazine, cyclizine, cinnarizine, doxylamine and dimenhydrinate, are considered first-line treatment, because no adverse fetal effects have been described. Doxylamine has the advantage of being safe when symptoms begin (6–7 weeks). In a cohort of 608,385 pregnancies, Pasternak et al evaluated ondansetron, an H3 receptor blocker, and concluded that it was not associated with a significant increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defects, preterm delivery or small born infants for gestational age. However, there are studies documenting congenital heart defects, especially when ondansetron was taken in the first trimester. Consequently, it is recommended as second-line therapy. Phenothiazines are another first-line treatment option, including prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and perphenazine. Studies have not shown increased risk for major malformations. Finally, metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, can also be safely prescribed. However, it crosses the placenta and is considered a second-line treatment option, given its potential extrapyramidal effects on both the fetus (third trimester) and the mother (first trimester).

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics at 1–866–961–2388 or visit http://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry.

Lactation

Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain (8.2).

Risk Summary

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery (see Clinical Considerations). Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy can have variable effects on milk supply in the post-partum period [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)]. (NOTE: The summary of animal studies and background risk statement is not included for brevity.)

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^1154hqWY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Another agent which has been examined sufficiently as to its compatibility with pregnancy and its potency against nausea and vomiting is metoclopramide. In utero exposure to metoclopramide during the first trimester was not associated with significantly increased risks of major congenital malformations, LBW, pre-term delivery or perinatal death. In addition, a very large study comparing pregnancy outcomes between exposed and un-exposed mothers discovered no link between exposure and 20 individual major congenital malformation categories, spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Despite unanimity regarding metoclopramide's safety during pregnancy, there are some serious issues concerning maternal side-effects. Although comparable to ondansetron, metoclopramide is associated with increased frequency of drowsiness and dry mouth. What is far more important though, is that prolonged administration -beyond 12 weeks- is correlated with the development of irreversible tardive dyskinesia (FDA black box warning), especially in females.

### Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: an obstetric syndrome [^116aYt4Y]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Although the cause of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not known, there is strong evidence linking human chorionic gonadoptropin or estrogens. Evidence is presented to show that the incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is linked to temporal and pathologic alterations in these hormones during pregnancy. The way in which the pregnant woman responds to the primary stimulus to nausea and vomiting of pregnancy appears to depend on her susceptibility mediated by vestibular, gastrointestinal, olfactory, and behavioral pathways. Conceiving of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as a syndrome suggests new pathways of investigation and possible therapies.

### Complications in early pregnancy [^112jvSNK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Early in pregnancy women frequently experience nausea, vomiting, and vaginal bleeding. Nausea and vomiting can be mild, managed by dietary modifications and medications, or severe, requiring intravenous fluids and medications. Care should be used when selecting medications for nausea to avoid additional side effects or potential harm to the developing fetus. When evaluating vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy must be ruled out. If an intrauterine pregnancy is seen, threatened miscarriage should be considered and the patient appropriately counseled. If neither intrauterine pregnancy nor ectopic pregnancy can be established, a management algorithm for pregnancy of unknown location is presented.
