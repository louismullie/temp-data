## Question

Dysmenorrhea adolescence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dysmenorrhea in adolescence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions, classification, and epidemiology to anchor the clinical frame. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to justify first-line therapies. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including when to avoid or perform a pelvic exam and how to image. After that, I need to examine first-line treatments, dosing, and nonpharmacologic options. Then, I should confirm escalation strategies for refractory pain and the role of endometriosis. Finally, I will consider special populations, adherence and follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and classification so I don't mislabel disease. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain without identifiable pelvic pathology, whereas secondary dysmenorrhea reflects pain due to underlying pathology such as endometriosis, obstructive anomalies, or infection; in adolescents, endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, and primary dysmenorrhea typically begins within 6–12 months of menarche as ovulatory cycles emerge, which aligns with ACOG and contemporary reviews [^2891a88c] [^424248e7] [^a1d73580].

> I should double-check prevalence and burden before assuming rarity. Dysmenorrhea affects roughly 50–90% of adolescent girls and is a leading cause of school absenteeism, with about 12% reporting monthly missed school or activities; importantly, many adolescents self-treat and delay care, contributing to underrecognition and prolonged symptom burden, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion and proactively screen during routine visits [^435cb796] [^394a38b5] [^43802e3e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without verifying. The pain in primary dysmenorrhea is driven by excess prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the endometrium, causing myometrial hypercontractility, ischemia, and sensitization of nociceptive fibers; this mechanistic anchor explains why NSAIDs and hormonal suppression that reduce prostaglandin production or ovulation are effective first-line therapies [^2cb4a852] [^25405f3b].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and confirm when a pelvic exam is actually necessary. For adolescents with a history consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment can be initiated without a pelvic exam; a pelvic exam becomes important if there are red flags for secondary causes, abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, or if the patient is sexually active and needs STI screening, and I should remember that adolescents can often tolerate exams with education and support [^e752e6a9] [^271ac4f7] [^11f50930].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy so I don't over-order tests. If secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected or if there is no improvement after 3–6 months of appropriate therapy, pelvic ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality; transabdominal ultrasound is appropriate for non–sexually active adolescents, while transvaginal ultrasound is reasonable when tolerated, and MRI can be considered if ultrasound is inconclusive or if deep infiltrating endometriosis is suspected; I should also remember that a recent Delphi consensus supports ultrasound as the preferred initial diagnostic instrument in adolescents with suspected primary dysmenorrhea, which helps standardize care [^30cd0775] [^11f50930] [^2fed9576].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacologic therapy, and I need to ensure dosing is precise. NSAIDs are first-line and should be started 1–2 days before menses and continued through the first 2–3 days of bleeding; representative regimens include ibuprofen 800 mg then 400–800 mg every 8 hours, naproxen sodium 440–550 mg then 220–550 mg every 12 hours, or mefenamic acid 500 mg then 250 mg every 6 hours, with food to mitigate GI effects; if one NSAID is ineffective, switching to another is reasonable, and opioids should be avoided given risks of dependence and hyperalgesia [^02bcb5f2] [^fefa2d0e] [^837df4e6].

> Let me consider hormonal therapies next and confirm their role. Combined estrogen–progestin contraceptives, progestin-only pills, the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system, and the etonogestrel implant are all acceptable options; continuous or extended regimens can achieve faster pain control by suppressing ovulation and endometrial proliferation, and guidelines endorse offering hormonal suppression even when a precise secondary diagnosis has not been made, tailoring to contraceptive needs and contraindications; I should double-check that adolescents with contraindications to estrogen can still use progestin-only methods safely [^8742fee3] [^90421e92] [^66bd7633] [^368016e2].

> But wait, what if nonpharmacologic options are preferred or used adjunctively. Exercise, heat therapy, and self-acupressure have supportive evidence and can be encouraged; a recent network meta-analysis also suggests potential benefit from modalities like yoga and acupuncture, though heterogeneity and quality vary, so I should frame these as low-risk adjuncts rather than replacements for evidence-based pharmacotherapy [^193dff99] [^91b8be9f].

> I should confirm the escalation pathway for refractory symptoms. If there is inadequate response after 3–6 months of NSAIDs and/or hormonal therapy, I need to reassess adherence, reconsider the diagnosis, and evaluate for secondary causes; in adolescents with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite appropriate therapy, the likelihood of endometriosis is high, with estimates suggesting that at least two-thirds of such cases will have endometriosis at laparoscopy, so I should counsel on this probability and discuss diagnostic laparoscopy with shared decision-making [^d8585717] [^58f75704] [^134f016e].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuances of endometriosis in adolescents so I don't miss atypical lesions. Adolescent endometriosis often presents with clear or red lesions that are subtle and easily overlooked, and early-stage disease is common; conservative surgical diagnosis with lesion excision or ablation plus ongoing hormonal suppression is recommended, and if pain remains refractory, a GnRH agonist with add-back therapy can be considered for at least 6 months, with attention to bone health and calcium/vitamin D counseling; I need to ensure I do not overpromise fertility outcomes, as longitudinal adolescent data are limited [^91c7921f] [^89cc8d28] [^d3e35b80].

> Let me think about special populations and contraindications so I don't inadvertently cause harm. In adolescents with bleeding disorders, NSAIDs may be contraindicated and should be coordinated with hematology; conversely, the levonorgestrel IUS can reduce menstrual flow substantially and may be particularly beneficial for heavy menstrual bleeding with dysmenorrhea; in adolescents with disabilities, menstrual suppression may be indicated for hygiene and symptom control, and shared decision-making should incorporate functional goals and caregiver support [^c5d0a03a] [^ced82ac4] [^d8347f5e].

> I should double-check adherence and follow-up strategies because nonresponse often reflects implementation failure. Adolescents face barriers such as forgetfulness, cost, and stigma, and brief education improves adherence and outcomes; using simple pain scales at follow-up helps quantify response, and if there is no improvement, I should verify dosing, timing, and persistence before escalating diagnostics or therapy [^770dfa51] [^02bcb5f2].

> Next, I should review a practical clinical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Start with a focused history to distinguish primary from secondary features, screen sexually active adolescents for pregnancy and STIs, and initiate empiric NSAIDs and/or hormonal therapy for presumed primary dysmenorrhea; if no improvement in 3–6 months, obtain pelvic ultrasound and consider secondary causes, with a low threshold to discuss diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis; throughout, incorporate nonpharmacologic measures and address adherence, and avoid opioids [^4b373637] [^d8585717] [^02bcb5f2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key takeaways are explicit and evidence-aligned. Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent in adolescents and often underrecognized; most cases are primary and respond to NSAIDs and/or hormonal suppression; persistent or atypical pain warrants evaluation for endometriosis and other secondary causes; early, proactive management can reduce school absenteeism, improve quality of life, and may mitigate progression to chronic pain syndromes, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion, use shared decision-making, and escalate thoughtfully when indicated [^435cb796] [^377b74dd] [^d8585717].

Dysmenorrhea in adolescence is **common and often debilitating**, with prevalence ranging from 50% to 90% and causing significant school absenteeism and quality-of-life impairment [^435cb796] [^394a38b5]. Most cases are **primary dysmenorrhea** due to prostaglandin excess; secondary causes, especially endometriosis, should be considered if pain is refractory or atypical [^2891a88c] [^a6589510]. First-line management is **NSAIDs and hormonal suppression** (COCs, progestin-only methods, or LNG-IUS), with nonpharmacologic options like heat and exercise as adjuncts [^837df4e6] [^8742fee3] [^193dff99]. Persistent pain despite 3–6 months of therapy warrants evaluation for secondary causes, including ultrasound and consideration of laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis [^d8585717] [^11f50930]. Early recognition and treatment are essential to reduce pain, preserve function, and prevent chronic pain syndromes [^377b74dd].

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

- **Prevalence**: Dysmenorrhea affects 50–90% of adolescent girls, with 10–20% experiencing severe pain that limits activities [^435cb796] [^394a38b5].
- **Impact**: It is a leading cause of school absenteeism, with 12% of adolescents missing school monthly and 10–15% reporting regular absences [^435cb796] [^394a38b5].
- **Quality of life**: Severe dysmenorrhea is associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and reduced academic performance [^394a38b5] [^43802e3e].

---

## Pathophysiology

Primary dysmenorrhea results from **excess prostaglandins** (PGF2α, PGE2) that cause uterine hypercontractility, ischemia, and sensitization of pain fibers [^2cb4a852] [^25405f3b]. Secondary dysmenorrhea arises from pelvic pathology — most commonly **endometriosis** in adolescents — and may also result from obstructive anomalies, PID, or adenomyosis [^a6589510] [^80190be0].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include **crampy, suprapubic pain** starting 1–2 days before menses, peaking with flow, and lasting 2–3 days, often with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and fatigue [^2cb4a852] [^91b8be9f]. Red flags suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea include **pain beginning at menarche, progressive worsening, mid-cycle or acyclic pain, abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, or a family history of endometriosis** [^e752e6a9] [^73b384af].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **History**: Focus on menstrual pattern, pain characteristics, associated symptoms, sexual activity, and family history [^e752e6a9].
- **Examination**: Pelvic exam is not required for primary dysmenorrhea but should be considered if sexually active or if secondary causes are suspected [^e752e6a9] [^271ac4f7].
- **Imaging**: Transabdominal ultrasound is first-line if secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected; MRI if ultrasound is inconclusive [^30cd0775] [^2fed9576].
- **Laboratory tests**: Consider pregnancy test, STI screening, and CBC if indicated [^193dff99].

## Management

### Pharmacologic therapy

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Mefenamic acid | Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis | First-line; 70–90% pain relief [^notfound] |
| Combined hormonal contraceptives | - Combined oral contraceptives <br/> - Patch <br/> - Ring | Suppress ovulation and endometrial proliferation | Highly effective; continuous regimens preferred [^90421e92] [^f8bb352b] |
| Progestin-only methods | - Depot medroxyprogesterone <br/> - Implant <br/> - LNG-IUS | Suppress endometrial proliferation | Effective, especially LNG-IUS for pain and bleeding [^368016e2] [^ced82ac4] |
| GnRH agonists | Leuprolide | Suppress estrogen | Reserved for refractory cases with add-back therapy [^d3e35b80] |

---

### Nonpharmacologic therapy

Nonpharmacologic options include **heat therapy** — which provides modest pain relief and is recommended as an adjunct — and **regular aerobic exercise**, which reduces pain and improves mood. Mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategies may also help cope with pain and stress [^193dff99] [^f0bbed74].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral is indicated for **persistent pain despite 3–6 months of appropriate therapy**, suspicion of secondary dysmenorrhea (e.g. endometriosis, obstructive anomalies), or complex cases requiring multidisciplinary care [^d8585717] [^11f50930].

---

## Long-term outcomes and complications

Untreated dysmenorrhea can persist into adulthood and is associated with chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, and reduced fertility. Early diagnosis and treatment may **mitigate these risks** [^377b74dd] [^6ff71d40].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Education should explain the **physiology of dysmenorrhea**, review treatment options, and reinforce adherence. Counseling should address menstrual hygiene, sexual health, and when to seek care. School-based programs and peer support can reduce stigma and improve outcomes [^dee285df] [^43802e3e].

---

Dysmenorrhea in adolescence is **highly prevalent and impactful**, but most cases respond to NSAIDs and hormonal therapy. Persistent or atypical pain requires evaluation for secondary causes, with endometriosis as the leading concern. Early, individualized management reduces pain, preserves function, and may prevent chronic pain syndromes.

### Evaluation and management of endometriosis in the adolescent [^a7c18d22]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic condition, with debilitating symptoms affecting all ages. Dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain often begin in adolescence, affecting school, daily activities, and relationships. Despite the profound burden of endometriosis, many adolescents experience suboptimal management and significant delay in diagnosis. The symptomatology and laparoscopic findings of endometriosis in adolescents are often different than in adults, and the medical and surgical treatments for adolescents may differ from those for adults as well. This Narrative Review summarizes the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of endometriosis in adolescents. Given the unique challenges and complexities associated with diagnosing endometriosis in this age group, it is crucial to maintain a heightened level of suspicion and to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms. By maintaining this lower threshold for consideration, we can ensure timely and accurate diagnosis, enabling early intervention and improved management in our adolescent patients.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Initial management of suspected primary dysmenorrhea advises that when the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated, and most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal suppression, or both. If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults: etiology and management [^6f8cf215]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic complaint among adolescent and young adult females. Dysmenorrhea in adolescents and young adults is usually primary (functional), and is associated with normal ovulatory cycles and with no pelvic pathology. In approximately 10% of adolescents and young adults with severe dysmenorrhea symptoms, pelvic abnormalities such as endometriosis or uterine anomalies may be found. Potent prostaglandins and potent leukotrienes play an important role in generating dysmenorrhea symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the most common pharmacologic treatment for dysmenorrhea. Adolescents and young adults with symptoms that do not respond to treatment with NSAIDs for 3 menstrual periods should be offered combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills for 3 menstrual cycles. Adolescents and young adults with dysmenorrhea who do not respond to this treatment should be evaluated for secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. The care provider's role is to explain about pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea to every adolescent and young adult female, address any concern that the patient has about her menstrual period, and review effective treatment options for dysmenorrhea with the patient.

Menstrual disorders and abnormal uterine bleeding are common concerns of young women. Complaints include menses that are: too painful (dysmenorrhea), absent or occur irregularly (amenorrhea or oligoamenorrhea), or prolonged and heavy (menorrhagia, or excessive uterine bleeding). In providing optimal reproductive care, the medical provider must be able to distinguish between normal developmental patterns or symptoms requiring education and reassurance from pathologic conditions requiring prompt assessment and treatment. This article discusses the normal menstrual patterns seen in adolescent females and provides an evaluation and management approach to primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^e752e6a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG adolescent dysmenorrhea — evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea should include a focused history and selective examination, with attention to features of secondary causes and known diagnostic delays. Adolescents "may experience a longer time to diagnosis of pelvic pain (up to 5.4 years) compared with the time to diagnosis (1.9 years) in women whose symptoms began in adulthood", and "a delay in presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment is common for patients of all ages with dysmenorrhea". The "initial evaluation for all patients presenting with dysmenorrhea includes a medical, gynecologic, menstrual, family, and psychosocial history to determine whether the patient has primary dysmenorrhea or symptoms suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea". "When a patient presents with symptoms only of primary dysmenorrhea, a pelvic examination is not necessary", but "a pelvic examination should be conducted if symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are present". Clinicians "should suspect secondary dysmenorrhea" with severe dysmenorrhea immediately after menarche, progressive worsening, abnormal uterine bleeding, mid‑cycle or acyclic pain, infertility, lack of response to empiric treatment, family history of endometriosis, renal or other congenital anomalies, or dyspareunia; obstetrician–gynecologists "should be aware of cultural differences" and that "parental modeling also may play an important role" in symptom reporting and pain perception.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^a6589510]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Endometriosis in adolescents notes that endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents and should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify, endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated, and the goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician–gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^b59b4b3b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.

### How to manage endometriosis in adolescence: the endometriosis treatment Italian club approach [^176d1856]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of endometriosis in an adolescent girl is a challenging topic. The initial stage of the disease and the limited diagnostic instrument appropriate for the youth age and for its typical features can reduce the ability of the gynecologist. At the same time, missing a prompt diagnosis can delay the beginning of specific and punctual management of endometriosis, which could avoid a postponed diagnosis from 6 to 12 years, typical of adolescent girls complaining of dysmenorrhea. This article aimed to answer all the potential questions around the diagnosis and management of endometriosis in adolescents starting from a clinical case looking at the possible solution that is easily reproducible in the clinical practice.

### Dysmenorrhea [^193dff99]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is common and usually independent of, rather than secondary to, pelvic pathology. Dysmenorrhea occurs in 50% to 90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age and is a leading cause of absenteeism. Secondary dysmenorrhea as a result of endometriosis, pelvic anatomic abnormalities, or infection may present with progressive worsening of pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, or dyspareunia. Initial workup should include a menstrual history and pregnancy test for patients who are sexually active. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives are first-line medical options that may be used independently or in combination. Because most progestin or estrogen-progestin combinations are effective, secondary indications, such as contraception, should be considered. Good evidence supports the effectiveness of some nonpharmacologic options, including exercise, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, heat therapy, and self-acupressure. If secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapies may be effective, but further workup should include pelvic examination and ultrasonography. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist may be warranted for further evaluation and treatment.

### Oral contraceptives and dysmenorrhea in adolescents… [^bd14fe49]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

About 15 percent of adolescent girls report severe menstrual pain. Although dysmenorrhea is the largest cause of time lost from school or work in this population, a small percentage seek medical help. Most adolescents self-treat menstrual pain using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other nonprescription agents. Oral contraceptives commonly are used to treat dysmenorrhea in older women, and their effectiveness is supported by a few low-quality clinical trials. Davis and colleagues studied the effectiveness of low-dose oral contraceptives in treating dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls. The researchers recruited healthy nulliparous girls 19 years or younger who reported moderate to severe menstrual pain. The severity of dysmenorrhea was established using a standardized scale validated in earlier research. Eligible participants had regular menstrual cycles of 21 to 35 days, no gynecologic pathology, and no contraindication to oral contraceptive use.

The 38 adolescents assigned to oral contraceptive therapy were comparable with the 38 assigned to placebo in all significant variables. At baseline, 58 percent of participants reported severe dysmenorrhea, 55 percent reported associated nausea, and 39 percent reported missing usual activities at least one day per month because of menstrual pain. Measures of the duration and frequency of pain were lower in the treatment group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. No serious adverse effects were reported or noted during the study. The two discontinuations in the treatment group were attributed to acne and nausea. One participant in the placebo group withdrew because of mood changes. The authors conclude that a low-dose oral contraceptive is more effective than placebo in managing dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Although the study is relatively small, they recommend consideration of low-dose oral contraceptive therapy for adolescents with severe menstrual-related pain.

editor's note: Besides the primary result, this study has at least two messages of significance for family physicians. The first is the prevalence and morbidity of dysmenorrhea. Perhaps we regard menstrual cramps as a somewhat trivial concern and do not ask our adolescent patients about the impact on their lives and their openness to therapy. Just asking and advising may be sufficient to initiate enormous benefit, as indicated by the dramatic improvements in symptoms reported by the placebo group. A brief intervention by a skilled family physician could reduce pain scores for this common problem by more than two thirds. — A. D. W.

Figure 1. Approach to the adolescent with dysmenorrhea — When history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment includes Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Hormonal therapies, and Nonpharmacologic strategies (Exercise, Smoking cessation, Modification of diet, Acupuncture). If the patient responds to therapy, continue treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. If the patient does not respond to therapy or symptoms or history are suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhea, consider secondary dysmenorrhea and proceed to evaluation: consider pelvic examination and pelvic ultrasonography. With positive findings, treat etiology of secondary dysmenorrhea (eg, relieve obstruction). With negative findings, consider multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain evaluation, consider laparoscopy, and consider endometriosis.

### Primary dysmenorrhea: diagnosis and therapy [^2cb4a852]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as pain during the menstrual cycle in the absence of an identifiable cause. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Dysmenorrhea can negatively affect a woman's quality of life and interfere with daily activities. The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is likely a result of the cyclooxygenase pathway producing increased prostanoids, particularly prostaglandins (PGs). The increased PGs cause uterine contractions that restrict blood flow and lead to the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain receptors. Women with a history typical for primary dysmenorrhea can initiate empiric treatment without additional testing. Shared decision making is key to effective management of dysmenorrhea to maximize patient compliance and satisfaction. After a discussion of their risks and benefits, extremely effective empiric therapies are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and contraceptive hormonal therapy. Other treatments for primary dysmenorrhea can be employed solely or in combination with other modalities, but the literature supporting their use is not as convincing. The physician should initiate an evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea if the patient does not report improved symptomatology after being compliant with their medical regimen.

### Dysmenorrhea in adolescents [^a1d73580]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1–3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — Dysmenorrhea definitions and onset in adolescents states that most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, and that primary dysmenorrhea characteristically begins when adolescents attain ovulatory cycles, usually within 6–12 months of menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition, and the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea is endometriosis.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^11f50930]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of suspected secondary dysmenorrhea — Most adolescents who present with dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea and will respond well to empiric treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), hormonal suppression, or both; however, patients who present with symptoms suggesting secondary dysmenorrhea or who fail empiric treatment require further evaluation. Additionally, if a patient has pain for 3–6 months, a more comprehensive evaluation of chronic pelvic pain should be performed with a history and focused physical examination to assess potential gastroenterologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, and psychosocial etiologies of pain. A pelvic examination to evaluate potential etiologies of secondary dysmenorrhea should be considered, and with education and support many adolescents who are not sexually active are able to tolerate a pelvic examination. Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea, and ultrasonography is the most appropriate initial imaging modality to identify potential etiologies, including obstructive reproductive tract anomalies, uterine myomas, and adnexal masses with endometriomas.

### Definition and criteria for diagnosing primary dysmenorrhea: a modified Delphi procedure [^2fed9576]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To achieve consensus on a standardized definition and diagnostic criteria of primary dysmenorrhea.

Methods

A modified Delphi procedure was conducted from January to October 2024. Consensus on a question was predefined as a Rate of Agreement of 70% or higher. Participants were experts defined by their clinical experience in managing patients with primary dysmenorrhea, publishing on the topic, or membership in international pediatric and/or adolescent gynecology associations.

Results

Twenty of 41 invited experts participated. Three rounds were required to achieve consensus, with response rates for each round of 85%, 82%, and 86% respectively. Experts defined primary dysmenorrhea as dysmenorrhea in absence of any pelvic pathology. Primary dysmenorrhea may not start at menarche. Onset of symptoms may be prior to or during menstrual blood loss. The diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea requires the absence or low clinical suspicion of the following conditions: sexually transmitted infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, congenital uterine anomaly, endometriosis, adenomyosis, and fibroids. A pelvic examination is not required for diagnosis. Consensus was reached on using ultrasound examination (transabdominal ultrasound in non-sexually active patients or transvaginal ultrasound in sexually active patients) as the preferred initial diagnostic instrument, with magnetic resonance imaging if results are inconclusive. No minimum duration of dysmenorrhea is required. Severity assessment using a Verbal Multidimensional Scoring System (VMSS) of grade 2 or higher is part of the diagnostic criteria for primary dysmenorrhea. Systemic symptoms are not considered to be necessary for diagnosis.

Conclusion

Consensus was achieved regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria for primary dysmenorrhea.

### Experimental and procedural pain responses in primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review [^9d4ed823]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is a recurrent and disabling condition. Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) refers to menstrual-related pain without identified organic pathology, whereas "secondary" dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain due to an identified medical condition such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease.

Severe PD leading to medication use and absenteeism affects up to 25% of the female populationand can have a significant impact on quality of life.–Recent research has suggested that PD may contribute to the development of subsequent chronic pain disorders;, therefore a more complete understanding of this condition will facilitate improved management of PD and ultimately the prevention of future chronic pain syndromes. However, despite its high prevalence and notable impact, little is known about how and why PD occurs in some girls and women.

Conclusion

In this narrative review, we have highlighted the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment options for primary dysmenorrhea. NSAIDs and hormonal contraception are first-line treatments for primary dysmenorrhea. Surgical interventions should be reserved for women who fail medical management or for women who desire definitive treatment. While many non-pharmacologic interventions have minimal data behind their use, low-risk behaviors should be encouraged. Further research with sufficient sample sizes and high-quality methodology is needed measuring the socioeconomic impact primary dysmenorrhea has on the healthcare system. Additionally, given that the treatment of dysmenorrhea is typically multi-modal, further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment methods.

### Diagnosis and initial management of dysmenorrhea [^f14bcfd3]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. It negatively affects patients' quality of life and sometimes results in activity restriction. A history and physical examination, including a pelvic examination in patients who have had vaginal intercourse, may reveal the cause. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic pathology. Abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, noncyclic pain, changes in intensity and duration of pain, and abnormal pelvic examination findings suggest underlying pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea) and require further investigation. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed if secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. Symptoms and signs of adenomyosis include dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and a uniformly enlarged uterus. Management options for primary dysmenorrhea include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. Topical heat, exercise, and nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in patients who have dysmenorrhea; however, there is not enough evidence to support the use of yoga, acupuncture, or massage.

### The comorbidities of dysmenorrhea: a clinical survey comparing symptom profile in women with and without endometriosis [^f010a3b8]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study has demonstrated four clinical findings. First is that additional symptoms are common in women with dysmenorrhea. Second is that the symptom profile in our study was generally independent of the presence or absence of endometriosis lesions, and independent of the use or non-use of hormonal therapy in those with confirmed endometriosis. Third is that the presence of stabbing pains in women with endometriosis is highly associated with the severity of dysmenorrhea, days per month of dysmenorrhea, days per month of pelvic pain, and diagnosis of migraine headache. And finally that a past history of distressing sexual events is associated with an increase in the severity and number of pain symptoms.

A woman's experience of dysmenorrhea includes all symptoms experienced at menstruation, both pelvic and extra-pelvic. A major strength of this study is its symptom-based applicability to the management of women presenting with dysmenorrhea and its associated symptoms, regardless of endometriosis status. While our group may represent a more complex subset of women with dysmenorrhea than is found in the general population, it is likely that they are similar to women referred to other gynecologists providing care for women with endometriosis and pelvic pain.

The lack of association between pain severity, presenting symptom profile and the presence of endometriotic lesions

Dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain have traditionally been associated with the presence of laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis lesions. While these conditions commonly coexist, the relationship between the clinical symptoms with which a girl or woman presents to her health practitioner (dysmen-orrhea) and the medical condition that may or may not be found at laparoscopy (endometriosis) remains controversial. A literature review by Janssen et alconsidered laparoscopic outcomes in adolescent girls aged 10–21 years presenting with pain. They found endometriosis lesions to be present in 62% of adolescents overall, in 75% of girls with chronic pelvic pain resistant to treatment with the oral contraceptive pill and anti-inflammatory medications, in 70% of girls with dysmenorrhea alone, and in 49% of girls with chronic pelvic pain not necessarily resistant to treatment. Additional factors affecting the experience of dysmenorrhea appear likely. A consensus paper published in 2013 included majority but not universal support for a statement describing a "philosophical shift to consideration of endometriosis and pelvic pain as a spectrum or continuum of disease". It was recognized that this approach would avoid excluding women who lack laparoscopic confirmation of a diagnosis of endometriosis, yet have similar symptoms and associated diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

Suspected endometriosis in adolescents — "endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea", should be considered in those with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and NSAIDs when no other etiology is identified, and family history raises suspicion because a first-degree relative confers a "7-fold to 10-fold increased risk"; it is "the most common finding in young women undergoing laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain", and although prevalence is unknown, "at least two thirds of adolescent girls with chronic pelvic pain or dysmenorrhea unresponsive to hormonal therapies and NSAIDs will be diagnosed with endometriosis".

### Characteristics and preoperative management of adolescent patients with pathology-confirmed endometriosis: a multi-institutional study [^9c176339]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

This multi-institutional, observational, retrospective cohort study aimed to characterize the demographics and preoperative medical management of patients with pathology-confirmed endometriosis.

Methods

We reviewed patients < 22 years at 8 tertiary care pediatric hospitals in the Midwestern United States who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and had biopsy-confirmed endometriosis. Patients were identified through pathology records. Demographics, medical history, clinical symptoms, and prior medical management were extracted. Descriptive statistics were computed.

Results

Among 305 patients, median age at first presentation to pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) was 15.6 years (interquartile range: 14.2–17.1). Most patients were White (83.3%) and most had commercial insurance (70.5%). Only 4.3% had a diagnosis of endometriosis prior to their initial presentation to PAG. Common symptoms included progressive dysmenorrhea (76.7%), heavy menstrual bleeding (50.8%), missed school/activities due to dysmenorrhea (55.1%). Patients sought care for their symptoms from a range of providers in addition to PAG, including primary care/adolescent medicine (75.1%), gastroenterology (18.7%), adult gynecology (22.3%), and physical therapy (13.4%). Nearly all patients (92.8%) tried oral hormonal menstrual suppression prior to laparoscopy. Hormonal management included combined oral contraception (62.3%), medroxyprogesterone acetate injection (15.7%), ≤ 5mg daily norethindrone (14.8%), > 5mg daily norethindrone (13.4%), hormonal intrauterine system (13.1%), and contraceptive implant (5.3%).

Conclusions

Patients with pathology-proven endometriosis typically presented with progressive dysmenorrhea, missed school or activities, and heavy menstrual bleeding. They sought care from a variety of providers and while most tried hormonal management of symptoms, the method used varied.

### The perfect balance? Managing heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea in a patient with hereditary hemochromatosis and von Willebrand disease [^3ce569ef]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary hemochromatosis typically presents in adulthood with organ damage secondary to iron overload. In women, menstrual periods are a protective mechanism allowing for monthly loss of iron stores.

Case

We report the case of a female adolescent whose family history, clinical presentation, and laboratory investigation revealed a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis and von Willebrand disease. For control of heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual suppression was started with a subsequent increase of her ferritin levels.

Summary and Conclusion

No significant data exist regarding the management of women with hereditary hemochromatosis who require menstrual suppression. This case highlights the difficulty in balancing the need for hormonal menstrual suppression with its effect on treatment choices, monitoring, and managing iron levels.

### Committee opinion no. 705: mental health disorders in adolescents [^bc5b5a96]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Somatization disorders in adolescents — Somatic symptoms, common in children and adolescents, are reported by females more than males, especially after puberty. The gynecologist may be consulted for chronic pelvic pain, severe dysmenorrhea, vulvovaginal pain or itching, ovarian cysts, or painful intercourse, and a patient may request repeated STI testing despite low-risk behavior and previous negative test results. In the extreme, pseudocyesis may present with amenorrhea, abdominal enlargement, and other pregnancy symptoms without confirmatory evidence for pregnancy. Body dysmorphic disorder usually begins during adolescence and is often associated with OCD or social anxiety disorder. Management guidance states the obstetrician–gynecologist should acknowledge the reality of the physical symptoms while emphasizing the normal findings on physical examination and avoiding excessive diagnostic testing; unless the symptom is gynecologic, the patient should be referred to her primary care provider for comprehensive care and close follow-up, and gynecologic symptoms should be managed with appropriate treatments (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or hormonal contraceptives for dysmenorrhea).

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^435cb796]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescent dysmenorrhea — prevalence, definitions, and symptom burden is outlined as the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women, with prevalence rates that range from 50% to 90%. Most adolescents have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology, and it usually begins within 6–12 months of menarche. Secondary dysmenorrhea is due to pelvic pathology, with endometriosis the most common cause, while chronic pelvic pain is defined as pain in the pelvic area that lasts 6 months or longer. Symptoms associated with dysmenorrhea in adolescents may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and muscle cramps, and poor sleep quality has been self-reported by those with severe dysmenorrhea compared with mild disease. Dysmenorrhea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absenteeism for adolescent girls; in one study, 12% of adolescent girls and young women aged 14–20 years lost days of school or work each month because of dysmenorrhea, and almost one in four respondents self-administered pain medication monthly without having seen a physician; notably, nearly two thirds of adolescents with chronic acyclic pain undergoing laparoscopy have endometriosis.

### Early pubertal timing is a risk factor for adolescent dysmenorrhea [^377b74dd]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea (heavy menstrual pain with/without organic cause) onsets at or shortly after menarche, severely impacting quality of life. By most estimates, dysmenorrhea affects over half of female adolescents, negatively impacting daily life; indeed, it is the leading cause of school absenteeism. Many adolescents with dysmenorrhea do not seek treatment, their pain frequently dismissed as a feature of menstruation, despite largely effective treatment options (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives). Left untreated, dysmenorrhea often persists and serves as a harbinger for future, more resistant chronic pelvic or widespread pain, potentially via sensitization of the central nervous system –. Thus, early detection and treatment of dysmenorrhea could significantly improve adolescent well-being, and for some individuals could even prevent the development of chronic pain.

Although dysmenorrhea is associated with pubertal status (or where an adolescent is in the course of pubertal maturation), the timing of pubertal milestones (or when an adolescent develops compared to same-sex peers) has largely been overlooked. Only a few studies have considered one indicator of pubertal timing, namely age at menarche. These studies revealed that earlier age at menarche (relative to peers) increases the likelihood of experiencing the menstrual pain that characterizes dysmenorrhea, especially frequent and intense pain. Yet, menarche is a relatively late event in the ~2-year process of pubertal development, preceded by height spurt, breast growth, skin changes, and body hair growth in most females. If dysmenorrhea is associated with the timing of aspects of puberty other than menarche, then early intervention through routine gynecologic healthcare for early-maturing females could disrupt a prognosis of lifelong pain.

### Bibliometric analysis of global research landscape and hotspots on dysmenorrhea: where are we now? [^8f5f3914]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is recurrent episodes of moderate-to-severe lower abdominal pain occurring before or during menstruation, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain without a definite pelvic pathology. Changes in pain intensity and duration suggest the possible coexistence of underlying pelvic lesions, ie secondary dysmenorrhea, which requires further investigation. Dysmenorrhea is considered the most common gynecological condition among adolescents and young women, with prevalence rates reported in the literature varying from 16% to 95%, although it is likely highly underestimated. For many women, it is a debilitating disease that can negatively impact multiple aspects of an individual's life, such as limited social interaction, reduced productivity, exacerbated psychological distress, increased medical expenditures, and even disability. In the United States alone, absenteeism due to menstrual pain results in a loss of approximately two billion dollars annually. While, in developing countries, it can pose a heavier disease burden than any other gynecological complaint. However, dysmenorrhea's pathogenesis and risk factors are still not completely elucidated, and the optimal treatment strategy has not yet been determined.

Given the aspects mentioned above, dysmenorrhea has become a significant public health issue and has received considerable attention from scholars. To date, a substantial amount of literature has been published in the field of dysmenorrhea, and the rapid accumulation of knowledge has made it increasingly tricky to identify critical information and track the latest research hotspots, especially for those new to the field. Furthermore, although some systematic reviews can provide conclusions from quantitative analyses, they currently focus on a specific subfield, eg, Armour et alinvestigated the prevalence of dysmenorrhea, while more studies focus on evaluating different treatment modalities. However, macroscopic analyses of this field, such as research profiles and the evolution of topics, are still unavailable. Although extensive research has been conducted on dysmenorrhea, various scientific issues related to dysmenorrhea still require continued academic exploration. Therefore, assessing the research performance in this field is necessary to better prepare for further studies.

ACOG adolescent primary dysmenorrhea — nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line and patient education and dosing timing are emphasized, while opioids should not be used. "When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated". "Because NSAIDs interrupt cyclooxygenase-mediated prostaglandin production, they are considered a first-line treatment option", and "NSAIDs are significantly better than placebo in providing pain relief from primary dysmenorrhea". "Obstetrician–gynecologists should recommend NSAID dosage on an individual basis", with use "most effective when started 1–2 days before the onset of menses and continued through the first 2–3 days of bleeding", and taking with food and fluids may mitigate adverse effects. If inadequate relief occurs, "a different agent can be tried". Education is key because "patient education is essential" and "a brief educational intervention can result in enhanced medication knowledge and a decrease in pain associated with dysmenorrhea". Given risks, "opioids (including tramadol) should not be used as a treatment for dysmenorrhea", as dependence can occur "for as few as 7 days", hyperalgesia can result from repeated use, and these effects "make opioids an inappropriate treatment for adolescents with dysmenorrhea".

### Unmet needs and experiences of adolescent girls with heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea: a qualitative study [^dee285df]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To identify and examine the key areas of need and explore the experiences of adolescent girls with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea.

Design and Setting

Qualitative interview study using semi-structured interviews. Gynaecology outpatient clinic at The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

Adolescent girls (12–18 years; mean age, 14.8 ± 1.5 years) presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea at the clinic (N = 30).

Interventions and Main Outcome Measures

In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted between May and August 2018. Interview data were thematically analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Themes covered experiences and unmet needs of adolescent girls with heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea.

Results

A total of 12 themes were identified, and covered the impact of symptoms, experiences, and/or unmet needs of these adolescents. Key themes highlighting experiences and unmet needs related to (1) coordination of healthcare, (2) day-to-day coping, (3) school, and (4) information surrounding menstrual issues. From these themes, 7 unmet needs emerged and were organized under 3 key areas of need: (1) treatment, management, and care, (2) improvements in the school environment, and (3) menstrual health as a gendered issue.

Conclusion

Menstrual concerns can have a profound physical and psychosocial impact on adolescents. Effective school-based menstrual education programs may be key in reducing stigma, fear, and shame surrounding menstruation, in teaching positive management strategies and in encouraging adolescents to seek help for their menstrual concerns.

### Heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea in adolescents: a systematic review of self-management strategies, quality of life, and unmet needs [^43802e3e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and dysmenorrhea (DM) are common gynecological problems.

Objective

To systematically review the needs, quality of life (QOL), and effectiveness of self-management strategies among young women (12-25years) with DM or HMB.

Search Strategy

Relevant terms were searched through PubMed, EBSCO, Google Scholar, ProQuest, and Ovid between 2010 and 2022.

Selection Criteria

Qualitative and quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals, females aged 12–25, exploring DM or HMB, reporting supportive care needs, quality of life, self-treatment strategies, and/or treatment-seeking behavior.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts were reviewed for eligibility by two researchers. Included studies were extracted and assessed for quality independently by two authors, with discrepancies resolved through consensus or the involvement of a third researcher. Data extracted included study details, menstrual history, symptoms, self-care strategies, and quality of life. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklists were used for quality assessment.

Main Results

The search returned 285190 studies, of which 55 were eligible for inclusion. Prevalence rates of HMB and DM were in the ranges 4%-63% and 42%-94%, respectively. Over 80% of young women with DM and HMB experienced physical and psychological problems, including pelvic pain, sleep issues, mood disturbance, diarrhea, and nausea. Academic performance and daily activities were severely affected. Most (> 62%) named their mothers as their primary source of information, and friends as the secondary source (10%-65%). Few studies explored needs, but they could be inferred and fell under school-related and social needs. QOL was poorer in those who had DM than those who did not. Pain was the most common issue that drove young women to find treatment. More than 70% used medication to reduce pain. More than half chose home remedies (e.g., heat therapy, massages, herbal tea, hot drinks). No studies provided information about the efficacy and dosage of medication and herbal remedies.

Conclusions

HMB and DM have a large impact on daily living, with large areas of unmet need. Limited access to information impairs the management of symptoms and consequent QOL.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^25405f3b]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea is the most common pathology faced by women of childbearing age, regardless of race, age, and/or economic status. The worldwide prevalence of dysmenorrhea ranges from 45% to 95% in females of reproductive age and 2 to 29% of women experience severe pain. Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful uterine cramping associated with menstruation. It has been both underdiagnosed and inadequately treated and can be classified as primary or secondary dysmenorrhea depending on the etiology.

Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful cramping in the lower abdomen during the menstrual cycle that begins before or at the onset of menses in the absence of an organic cause. Pain with primary dysmenorrhea has a specific cyclic pattern — it is usually most severe during the first day of menses and can last for several days. Secondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain associated with an underlying pelvic pathology. This pathology can include endometriosis, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, adenomyosis, fibroids, endometrial polyps, ovarian cysts, congenital anomalies, and complications from intrauterine contraceptive devices. Pain caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is typically more diffuse, constant and may not always sync with the onset of menses.

Although dysmenorrhea is widely prevalent among women of childbearing age, many women do not seek treatment. Furthermore, it is imperative that healthcare professionals are well equipped to diagnose dysmenorrhea, and subsequently educate and treat patients in order to improve their quality of life. Here we present an up-to-date, evidence-based perspective on this topic. The goal of this narrative is to educate providers on first-line pharmacologic treatments for dysmenorrhea and discuss the evidence behind non-pharmacologic interventions. We also aim to review the role of surgical interventions in refractory disease.

Pathophysiology

While the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea is not completely understood; current research suggests that prostaglandins play a major role. During menses, endometrial sloughing releases prostaglandins, stimulating myometrial contraction and vasoconstriction. This subsequently causes uterine ischemia, anaerobic metabolite formation, and hypersensitization of nociceptive fibers. Interestingly, women with dysmenorrhea have higher levels of prostaglandin E2 and F2 in menstrual fluid, further supporting the role of prostaglandins in the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea. Additionally, uterine artery dopplers are elevated during menses in women with dysmenorrhea, most likely due to higher resistance blood flow through the uterine arteries.

### Adolescent endometriosis [^5b96d42e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a cause of chronic, pelvic pain in adolescents. Lack of response to NSAIDS and OCPs should prompt further investigation and subsequent treatment. The goal of therapy is to minimize pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea primarily through long-term, medical therapy. Surgical intervention is principally indicated to establish a diagnosis. The poor response to surgical therapy negates the need for repetitive or radical surgery. Much patience and care should be directed toward these patients to provide them with an understanding of their disease and to help enhance the quality of their life.

Introduction

Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is defined as painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin in the absence of pelvic pathology. It is often characterized by congestive (deep, dull ache) and/or spasmodic (sharp spasms) pain and associated with a number of additional symptoms including fatigue, headache, backache, moodiness, irritability, constipation, and painful urination. PD is known to negatively affect quality of life and can result in absenteeism from school and work. Despite this, given the nonmalignant nature of the condition, PD is generally understudied and poorly managed.

PD is the most common gynecological condition among women of reproductive age. It affects an estimated 45–95% of menstruating women globally; however, prevalence estimates vary widely, in part due to methodological differences but also cultural differences that may limit the generalizability of international estimates. Clinical risk factors for PD include younger age at menarche, irregular menstruation, and heavy menstrual flow. Women with PD report significantly lower quality of life during their menstruation phase in comparison with their pain-free follicular phases and compared with those without pain during menstruation. PD can also lead to significant interference with daily activities. Importantly, for those in the critical developmental phases of adolescence and emerging adulthood, which typically coincide with secondary school and higher education, PD may negatively impact educational attainment through absenteeism and/or presenteeism, whereby people who menstruate may not be able to perform academically due to interference with concentration and performance during their period.

Secondary dysmenorrhea, defined as menstrual pain resulting from anatomic or macroscopic pelvic pathology, is typically caused by a gynecologic disorder such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, or fibroids, or by congenital anomalies of the pelvic reproductive organs. Such conditions, particularly endometriosis, are not uncommon in young people; however, diagnoses are often delayed. This may be in part due to low healthcare consultation rates for people with dysmenorrhea. Reasons for not seeking care for dysmenorrhea identified by Chen et al. include assuming symptoms are normal, thinking providers would not offer help, being unaware of treatment options, and feeling embarrassed or afraid to seek care. In addition to the risk of underlying medical causes of menstrual pain going undetected, underutilization of healthcare for dysmenorrhea may contribute to suboptimal self-management through lack of awareness and underuse of effective strategies.

### Comment on dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [letter] [^7732e7d0]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, although the systematic review offers valuable insights into the treatment of dysmenorrhoea, the lack of detailed inclusion criteria and the handling of study heterogeneity are areas of concern. Future reviews should establish and transparently report rigorous criteria for study selection to include only high-quality, relevant studies. Additionally, addressing heterogeneity through subgroup or sensitivity analyses could enhance the reliability of the conclusions. By improving these aspects, systematic reviews can better serve as a foundation for evidence-based clinical guidelines and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^d3e35b80]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 760 — endometriosis in adolescents — medical management emphasizes continued hormonal suppression and appropriate use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Because endometriosis is a chronic condition, patients should continue hormonal suppression unless they are actively trying to become pregnant, and options include a progestin-only agent or 52 mg of LNG- IUS. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of GnRH agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Patients treated with GnRH agonists should begin add-back hormone therapy at the initiation of treatment to prevent bone loss and avoid the onset of menopausal symptoms, and in a 2017 trial in adolescents, add-back therapy using conjugated equine estrogen (0.625 mg) plus norethindrone acetate (5 mg) daily was superior to norethindrone acetate alone for quality of life and preservation of bone density. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning is not needed before initiation of therapy, during GnRH agonist treatment of less than 12 months in duration, or after treatment; obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel patients on adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake and the benefits of weight-bearing exercise during GnRH agonist therapy. After leuprolide is discontinued, patients should begin continuous hormone-suppression therapy. Although serum CA 125 levels may be increased in patients with endometriosis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not endorse using CA 125 to monitor treatment or screen for endometriosis; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term outside of a specialized pain management team.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^2788126a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adolescent endometriosis — diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment considerations include that if a patient is undergoing a diagnostic laparoscopy for dysmenorrhea or chronic pain, or both, consideration should be given to placing a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) at the time of laparoscopy to minimize the pain of insertion. Recommended treatment for endometriosis in adolescents is conservative surgical therapy for diagnosis and treatment combined with ongoing suppressive medical therapies to prevent endometrial proliferation. For pain refractory to conservative surgical therapy and suppressive hormonal therapy, patients often benefit from at least 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy with add-back medicine. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs should be the mainstay of pain relief for adolescents with endometriosis, and adolescents should not be prescribed narcotics long-term to manage endometriosis outside of a specialized pain management team. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman, and in adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents.

Surgical Management

Most cases of dysmenorrhea are managed with non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments; however, if unable to provide relief, surgical management is an alternative option (Table 3). For women who do not desire future fertility and have associated heavy menstrual bleeding, endometrial ablation may be a good option. One study of women treated with endometrial ablation for heavy menses who also had pelvic pain, approximately half had significant reduction in pelvic pain. Presacral neurectomy (PN) and Laparoscopic Uterosacral Nerve Ablation (LUNA) have also been used as an alternative surgical intervention for chronic pelvic pain. Both methods involve transecting sensory nerve fibers. During a Presacral Neurectomy, the somatic pain fibers from the uterus that course within the superior hypogastric plexus are interrupted. The surgery involves incising the pelvic peritoneum over the sacrum and transecting the sacral nerve plexus. Success rates of this procedure range from 60% to 75%; however, long-term postoperative constipation and urinary retention are common side effects, and further research is needed studying the long-term effect of PN on dysmenorrhea.LUNA involves transecting the nerve plexuses in the uterosacral ligaments, the structural tissue that connects the junction of the uterus and cervix to the sacrum. This method has had mixed data in regard to the success of treating pelvic pain. One study showed no significant reduction in pain than patients that underwent diagnostic laparoscopy without nerve ablation; however, this study included patients that had chronic pelvic pain from various etiology, including mild endometriosis, pelvic adhesions and pelvic inflammatory disease. Other studies show improvement in pain overtime and improvement in quality of life. Lastly, hysterectomy would be the definitive surgical treatment for chronic pelvic pain refractory to medications. Hysterectomy is typically reserved for patients with secondary dysmenorrhea, such as endometriosis, who fail more conservative measurements. However, it may be considered as a last-resort-measure for patients with no alternative reason for pelvic pain and who failed non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends against treating adolescents with dysmenorrhea with hysterectomy.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents and young female adults: a systematic review [^e4187a7d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Our aim was to review the evidence concerning the noninvasive diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents.

Methods

A systematic review was written following the SWiM reporting guidelines. The study research was made across three databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to identify articles about the adolescent population and the diagnosis of endometriosis through noninvasive methods. The search included the keywords "endometriosis", "adolescents", "diagnosis", "ultrasound", and "MRI". Only English-language articles were considered, and those published prior to 2000 were excluded. The established outcomes focused on clinical symptoms, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggestive of endometriosis.

Results

We included 26 articles, mostly comprising case series and cross-sectional studies. The pooled analysis involved 2,299 female adolescents (age range 8–25 years old) with clinically suspected, imaged, and/or surgically confirmed endometriosis. The most frequently reported symptom was dysmenorrhea, followed by chronic pelvic pain. Among adolescents clinically suspected of endometriosis undergoing ultrasound (US), 32.8% exhibited at least one sign of endometriosis. Of the 167 patients with ultrasound-diagnosed endometriosis, 48.5% had deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), and 45.5% had an endometrioma detected. Three studies assessed MRI findings, revealing that 49.8% presented with signs of endometriosis.

Conclusions

Dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain stand out as key symptoms of adolescent endometriosis. Although their diagnostic accuracy varies, US and MRI have emerged as valuable tools for diagnosing the disease. While the US may have limitations, especially in detecting subtle lesions, MRI shows promise, even in cases with normal previous ultrasounds. Early recognition and proactive diagnosis are crucial for improving the management of endometriosis in adolescents.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) is a vital medical specialty that addresses the unique reproductive health needs of adolescent girls, tackling issues such as high adolescent birth rates (42 per 1000 girls aged 15–19 years globally in 2021). It also addresses prevalent menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea affecting school attendance, and rising sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with nearly half of new cases occurring in 15‐ to 24‐year‐olds. By providing specialized and developmentally appropriate care, PAG experts empower girls and young women to navigate these challenges, fostering informed decision‐making and improved health outcomes. PAG providers are dedicated to the comprehensive care of young girls, adolescents, and their families. This specialty also adopts a biopsychosocial approach, emphasizing respect for diversity and inclusion. Furthermore, it addresses the emotional, psychological, social, and cultural aspects alongside medical needs.

Girls and adolescents may present with a wide range of gynecologic conditions requiring tailored expertise to ensure that their unique healthcare needs are met. Pediatric and adolescent gynecologists provide holistic and personalized care that goes beyond traditional gynecological treatment, ensuring that patients are supported in their physical health, mental well‐being, and social development.

This specialty spans various fields and actions, including the management of menstruation and sexual development and the diagnosis and treatment of congenital and acquired reproductive anomalies. This also includes sexual health education, prevention and management of STIs, and addressing psychosocial issues related to puberty and reproductive health and rights of the child. The interdisciplinary approach emphasizes close collaboration with mental health professionals, social workers, and other healthcare providers to serve the overall well‐being of the adolescent patient (Box 1).

Discussion

This paper has reviewed recent literature on the rates, pathophysiology and treatment modalities for dysmenorrhea, the most common gynecologic condition affecting women of reproductive age. Dysmenorrhea prevalence rates in females or reproductive age have been estimated to be from 45% to 95% worldwide, and there is a considerable impact on quality of life, including school and work productivity. Here, we aim to provide a clinical framework for patient care.

First-line treatment of dysmenorrhea should include NSAIDs, as prostaglandins are thought to play the largest role in the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea. While some data point to Diclofenac providing the maximal analgesia, other studies did not find superiority amongst various types of NSAIDs. Ibuprofen was shown to have the best safety profile from the list of NSAIDs reviewed, and the most common side effects to discuss with patients is gastrointestinal upset. Another first-line pharmacologic option for patients is hormonal contraception, including combined OCPs and progestin-only contraceptives. There is a lack of studies comparing NSAID use to OCPs for dysmenorrhea, and both options should be offered to patients for maximum analgesia. If patients have contra-indications to estrogen, then progestin-based contraception, including the levonorgestrel IUD or progestin-only pills, are good options for patients. With regard to non-pharmacologic treatment, substantial data exists to support behavioral modifications such as exercise, as well as heat therapy, and should be encouraged by providers.

### Adolescent chronic pelvic pain [^7c8e0ebb]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The presentation of chronic pelvic pain in the adolescent can at times be quite daunting. A careful and insightful approach to obtaining the history and physical examination must be implemented while maintaining an appreciation of the various stages of adolescent development. The etiologies can range from gynecologic to nongynecologic causes. The ability to render an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment in this population of patients can significantly improve future reproductive health outcomes. The following minireview will outline a systematic approach to the adolescent with chronic pelvic pain.

### Dysmenorrhea… [^394a38b5]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Dysmenorrhea, which is defined as painful menstruation, affects up to 50% to 90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age. 1, 2 Nearly one-half of patients with symptoms of dysmenorrhea will present first to their primary care physician. 3 Dysmenorrhea leads to decreased quality of life, absenteeism, and increased risk of depression and anxiety. 4, 5 Up to one-half of patients with dysmenorrhea miss school or work at least once, and 10% to 15% have regular absences during menses. 6–8 A prospective longitudinal study of 400 patients with dysmenorrhea revealed that most have persistent symptoms throughout their years of menstruation, although some improvement in severity may occur, for example, after childbirth. 9 Secondary dysmenorrhea is due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition and accounts for about 10% of cases of dysmenorrhea.

Risk Factors Age younger than 30 years, body mass index less than 20 kg per m², smoking, earlier menarche, longer menstrual cycles, heavy menstrual flow, and history of sexual abuse increase the risk of primary dysmenorrhea. Nulliparity, premenstrual syndrome, and a history of pelvic inflammatory disease are also associated with the disorder. Protective factors include increasing age, increasing parity, exercise, and oral contraceptive use. 9, 12. Primary dysmenorrhea begins an average of six to 12 months following menarche, corresponding with the initiation of ovulatory cycles, and tends to recur with every menstrual cycle.

1. Diagnosis Evaluation should begin with a complete medical, gynecologic, menstrual, family, and surgical history. 8, 17 In a study of more than 4, 300 patients seeking care for symptoms of dysmenorrhea, nearly two-thirds were told nothing was wrong; this was even more likely when symptoms began during adolescence.

3 A substantial delay from symptom onset to diagnosis is common, ranging from 5. 4 years in adolescents to

1. 9 years in adults. 3 In secondary dysmenorrhea, the time from onset of symptoms to surgically confirmed diagnosis may range from four to 11 years.
18. Combined estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives are effective in adolescents and adults with primary dysmenorrhea, leading to significant improvement in pain and decreased frequency and dose of analgesics.

As demonstrated in Figure 8, the thematic evolution map was distributed vertically over three periods. The size of the nodes was proportional to the volume of literature. The thickness of the lines represented the proximity of themes. Solid lines represented the dominant direction of thematic evolution within adjacent periods, while dashed lines represented the evolution of thematic branches. Among the three periods, "adolescents" had been the focus of growing research attention. "Randomized controlled trials" appeared in third place in the 2010–2019 periods, rising to second place in the 2020–2023 periods. Moreover, pain management for PD progressed from a focus on "analgesics" in the earlier periods, transitioning to "fish oil", and ultimately evolving into a concentration on "fatty acids" in the later periods. Notably, the circadian rhythm was found to have a limited correlation with the previous themes, indicating its emergence as a distinct and separate theme.

In essence, our work, despite drawing from known conclusions, offers a contribution by providing a systematic, organized, and accessible framework for understanding the existing literature in the field. It adds value by simplifying the research process, identifying trends, and facilitating future research endeavors.

### The comorbidities of dysmenorrhea: a clinical survey comparing symptom profile in women with and without endometriosis [^12876a23]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea, the experience of painful menstruation, is common. A study of Australian girls aged 16–18 years showed that while 93% experienced some pain with menstruation, 21% experienced severe pain, frequently associated with disruption of life activities and school absence. While dysmenorrhea may be present as a sole symptom without evidence of disease, it may also be associated with the medical condition endometriosis, or may pre-date chronic pelvic pain.–Endometriosis is associated with an average of 11 hours of lost workplace productivity per week, and pelvic pain has been estimated to cost the Australian economy over US$6 billion per year. Dysmenorrhea in isolation, whether as a symptom of endometriosis or when associated with chronic pelvic pain, is clearly a condition with important educational, employment, quality of life, financial, and health economic implications.

Developing effective clinical guidelines for the management of dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain is complicated due to their overlapping symptomatology, a lack of biomarkers, and the requirement that women undergo laparoscopic surgery to determine whether endometriosis lesions are present. In addition, confounding factors, potentially including a past history of sexually distressing events, may modify the pain experience.

While several studies have linked a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis with a wide range of additional symptoms at a rate higher than the general population,–few papers have investigated the frequency of these symptoms in women presenting with dysmenorrhea in clinical practice. In addition, they have not determined whether a specific symptom profile is associated with the presence of endometriosis lesions.

This study investigates the prevalence of 14 symptoms in women with dysmenorrhea who were referred to a pelvic pain and endometriosis unit with ready access to laparoscopic surgery. It compares the symptom profile of women with and without a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis, and the severity of symptoms in women with and without a history of distressing sexual events. Three specific hypotheses were investigated:
That the prevalence of additional symptoms is high in women with dysmenorrhea,
That a specific symptom profile may indicate the presence of endometriosis lesions, and
That experience of distressing sexual events may alter the symptom profile of women with dysmenorrhea.

This study provides an insight into both the pain experience and the symptom profile of women presenting to gynecologists and laparoscopic surgeons in real-life clinical practice.

### Primary dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls and treatment with oral contraceptives [^0a5a49e5]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

This review examines the prevalence, associated morbidity, and treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls. Relevant literature was examined by systematic, evidence-based review using MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration databases. Dysmenorrhea is highly prevalent during adolescence. Despite differences in measurement methods, 20%-90% of adolescent girls report dysmenorrhea and about 15% of adolescents describe their dysmenorrhea as severe. During adolescence, dysmenorrhea leads to high rates of school absence and activity nonparticipation. Most adolescents with dysmenorrhea self-medicate with over-the-counter preparations; few consult healthcare providers. Combined oral contraceptives (COC) are an accepted treatment for dysmenorrhea in nonadolescent women. However, data supporting the efficacy of COC is limited. Very small studies show decreased prostaglandin in menstrual fluid associated with high-dose COC use. Larger studies are limited to cross-sectional comparisons showing lower prevalence of dysmenorrhea in low-dose COC users compared to non-COC users. One small, randomized controlled trial including some adolescents demonstrated an improvement in dysmenorrhea with high-dose COC treatment compared to placebo. The efficacy of low-dose COC in the treatment of adolescent dysmenorrhea has yet to be determined. If effective, well-established safety and noncontraceptive health benefits may make COC an ideal treatment for dysmenorrhea in adolescent girls.

(2) The 345-Primary Dysmenorrhea Consensus Guideline, issued by the Canadian Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (SOGC), outlines the precise criteria for diagnosing PD. The criteria encompass: 1) menstrual pain absent of pelvic pathology, 2) typical onset in adolescence post-ovulation cycles, 3) typical crampy, suprapubic pain starting hours before or after menstruation, 4) peak symptoms characterized by intense flow and persisting for 2 to 3 days, 5) pain often colicky with a focus on the lower abdomen's midline, though it can be mild and spread to the lumbar area or thighs, and 6) related symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, lightheadedness, headaches, dizziness, and occasionally syncope and fever. (3) NPT encompass moxibustion (MOX), yoga, acupressure, electroacupuncture (EA), acupuncture (ACU), and auricular point therapy (APT). (4) The control group consisted of either a blank control or rest for the same times at the school health center without treatment. During the study, the control group was advised to abstain from regular exercise, rest for 20 minutes at the school health center without treatment, or receive only a menstrual health education manual without interventions. (5) The placebo group underwent placebo acupuncture using a non-penetrating sham needle. (6) The study outcomes were evaluated using the response rate, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and the Cox menstrual symptom scale (CMSS).

Initial evaluation — elements and counseling considerations: As part of the initial evaluation, the pediatrician addresses the menstrual cycle, including regularity and heaviness of bleeding, associated dysmenorrhea, behavioral and mood changes, and the impact on the adolescent's life, and symptom calendars can be helpful in identifying noncyclical versus cyclical problems, such as catamenial seizure. Other reproductive topics may include assessment of sexual knowledge, interest in sexual activity, and the need for relationship safety education. Although confidential discussions about sexuality and sexual activity are recommended for all teenagers by the AAP and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), teenagers with any disability are often incorrectly considered to be asexual or uninvolved in relationships, and confidential conversations with their pediatrician may not occur.

### Long-acting reversible contraception: specific issues for adolescents [^ced82ac4]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Adolescent bleeding disorders and dysmenorrhea — In a small study of adolescent girls with known bleeding disorders, 100% experienced an improvement in heavy menstrual bleeding and 60% experienced amenorrhea after levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) placement, and adult studies reported LNG-IUS associated bleeding pattern satisfaction rates ranging from 68% to 100%. The role of the subdermal implant as a treatment option for adolescents with bleeding disorders is described as unclear given the higher rate of prolonged irregular bleeding and lower rate of amenorrhea as compared to the LNG-IUD, and no studies investigating the efficacy of using the subdermal implant in this population have been reported. Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic complaint during adolescence and is associated with a relatively high rate (12%) of monthly school absenteeism; treatment in adolescents is primarily medical with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal contraceptive methods as initial agents, and the LNG-IUD and subdermal implant have been shown to provide effective treatment. Evaluation for causes requiring surgical treatment such as obstructive Müllerian anomalies or ovarian cysts is warranted if medical management is suboptimal, risk factors for congenital anomalies are present, or pain is acyclic, and even in secondary dysmenorrhea attributable to endometriosis, fibroids, or adenomyosis, the LNG-IUD and subdermal implant have been found to be effective treatment options.

Omission of Age Stratification and Concealed Efficacy in Adolescent Subgroups

Wang et al included patients aged 14–35 years, with 10 studies enrolling minors (< 18 years); however, they did not conduct age-stratified analyses. Research has shown that progesterone and estrogen can alleviate pain associated with endometriosis. However, the levels of sex hormones in adolescents differ significantly from those in adults, characterized by greater fluctuations and an unstable hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This physiological feature makes clinical treatment plans based directly on adult data potentially unsuitable for the adolescent population. Given that adolescents are a high-risk group for primary dysmenorrhea, this oversight may lead to a lack of targeted treatment recommendations.

Endometriosis, a disease of young females that is possibly a devastating ailment requiring surgery, appears to be associated with certain features encountered in adolescence. First among these symptoms is the history of severe and lasting dysmenorrhea at the time of adolescence and the need to use oral contraceptives (OCs) for alleviating dysmenorrhea that failed to respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Further awareness about existing associations between certain symptoms experienced at adolescence and the later development of endometriosis is important. Indeed, the possibility of diagnosing endometriosis earlier when suggested by clinical history could lead to less extensive surgery and thus, less damage. Experimental verification of this insight, however, is needed before the concept that early diagnosis means lesser destructive surgery can be ascertained.

### Self-treatment patterns among adolescent girls with dysmenorrhea [^4bd6d0a0]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To describe both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments used by adolescents with dysmenorrhea.

Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting

Urban academic medical center.

Participants

Healthy adolescents aged 19 years or younger (n = 76) with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea were included; those using hormonal contraception were excluded.

Intervention

We collected baseline data via interview from adolescent girls at enrollment in a clinical trial of oral contraceptives versus placebo for primary dysmenorrhea. The interview data, collected prior to any intervention, included information on demographics, dysmenorrhea duration and severity, and self-treatment. We used the validated pain subscale of the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire and a 0–10 pain rating scale to estimate pain severity.

Main Outcome Measure

Investigator-administered questionnaire.

Results

Adolescents' mean age was 16.8 years (SD = 2). Similar proportions described themselves as white (26%), black (30%) or Hispanic (28%). Dysmenorrhea was moderate in 42%, severe in 58%, associated with nausea in 55%, and vomiting in 24%. Of those attending school (n = 66), 46% reported missing one or more days monthly due to dysmenorrhea. Nearly all discussed their pain with someone; however, a minority sought formal medical care. All used nonpharmacological remedies such as sleeping and heat application. Nearly all used at least one medication, 31% reported using two, and 15% used three medications (not concurrently). Many participants reported using medication at sub-therapeutic doses for pain.

Conclusions

Adolescents with moderate and severe dysmenorrhea reported high morbidity. Girls used numerous non-pharmacologic remedies as well as medications for pain but infrequently accessed formal medical care. Medication dosing was often sub-therapeutic.

Diagnostic laparoscopy counseling — "endometriosis remains a surgical and pathologic diagnosis in adolescents requiring the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in the biopsy specimen", and patients with persistent dysmenorrhea despite treatment and no other identified etiologies "should be counseled about the high likelihood of endometriosis and the risks and benefits of diagnostic laparoscopy"; benefits include confirmation of presence or absence of disease and opportunities to treat lesions and adhesions, while risks include "adverse effects from anesthesia, venous thromboembolism, bleeding, infection, wound infection, adhesion formation, and injury to surrounding structures", and after shared decision making some "may opt for medical treatment… without having a confirmed pathologic diagnosis to avoid laparoscopy".

### The pediatric clinician's approach to adolescent reproductive health in females with sickle cell disease [^4446f98c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

With improvements in health care, most females with sickle cell disease (SCD) are surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Delayed onset menarche, increased risk of acute vaso-occlusive pain associated with menstruation and dysmenorrhea, and increased odds of pregnancy-related complications are prevalent in females with SCD. Significant knowledge gaps exist in the management of reproductive health issues in adolescent females with SCD. This article highlights the pediatric clinicians' approach to essential reproductive health issues such as menarche, acute vaso-occlusive pain temporarily associated with menstruation and dysmenorrhea, and pregnancy in adolescent females with SCD.

Introduction

Dysmenorrhea (i.e. painful menstruation) is one of the most common reproductive problems and occurs as acute pelvic pain around the time of menstruation. It is defined as primary or secondary according to the underlying pathological condition. Primary dysmenorrhea is the presence of painful menstruation in the absence of provable pelvic disease and secondary dysmenorrhea is the occurrence of bleeding and painful menstruation due to pathological pelvic problems. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins one to two years after menarche and with the onset of ovulation. Different prevalence rates ranging from 16% to 91% have been reported for primary dysmenorrhea, with moderate to severe pain in 40%. Adolescents and young adults often experience dysmenorrhea without any underlying cause (primary dysmenorrhea).

Dysmenorrhea is usually accompanied by menstrual distress. Menstrual distress can comprise both physical and psychological symptoms including irritability and tenderness of the breasts, back pain, skin disorders, fatigue, palpitations, withdrawal, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and general weakness. It can occur before, during and/or after menstruation. Menstrual distress, like dysmenorrhea, is a common problem for women of childbearing age with prevalence rates reported to be 75%–94%.

Dysmenorrhea, especially when accompanied by symptoms of menstrual distress, is a major factor in disrupting the quality of life and social activities of young women. Although primary dysmenorrhea is not life-threatening, it can adversely affect performance and quality of life among females. Dysmenorrhea has many adverse effects on women's lives, including reduced daily activities, lower academic performance in adulthood, decreased sleep quality, and negative effects on mood (e.g. anxiety and depression). With the increase in medical expenses and medical care and the decrease in the efficiency of individuals, dysmenorrhea has always been considered in terms of economic and social effects.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents [^3b584895]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Abnormal and irregular bleeding are extremely common in the adolescent period and can be looked upon as a part of normal reproductive development. It is essential to have a firm grasp on the normal, physiologic development of the menstrual cycle. Prompt recognition and treatment of the situations that may indicate underlying disorders or diseases is possible. It is important to recognize the distinct needs, goals, and developmental stages of adolescent patients. No single therapy or approach is universal in the diagnosis and treatment, but must be tailored to the needs of the individual adolescent and her situation.

### A treatment algorithm for familial mediterranean fever patients with menstruation-associated attacks [^d6522a42]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The most important limitation of this study was the self-reported assessment methodology. This might have introduced recall bias. The high rate of dysmenorrhea in patients with menstruation-associated FMF attacks was another limitation. Since we have included adolescent patients, there is a possibility that a few might have misinterpreted dysmenorrhea as FMF attack on some occasions. This might have caused a miscalculation of the post-menarche attack frequency in these patients. However, we re-questioned the details regarding the discrimination between dysmenorrhea and menstruation-associated attacks in patients with afebrile attacks to rule out the possibility of misinterpretation.

To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study analysing menstruation-associated attacks in adolescent female FMF patients and the first proposal for a management algorithm for these patients. Increasing the compliance and dose of colchicine, initiating on-demand therapies or anti-IL-1 drugs were effective management strategies. Monitoring the subclinical inflammation is rather important, especially when using on-demand therapies. Managing FMF effectively in patients with menstruation-associated attacks will improve the quality of life and prevent inflammation-associated complications.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^cf4fec6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 780 — Outcomes and follow-up indicate that most patients will have resolution of pain after hymenectomy. Imperforate hymen is not associated with concomitant uterine anomalies, and in the absence of symptoms postoperative uterine imaging usually is not required. Although stenosis and adhesions have been reported after hymenectomy, these complications are extremely rare, and in these situations dilator therapy may be considered. If an adolescent is doing well after the procedure, she may not need additional care; however, because of the risk of endometriosis after hematometrocolpos, she should be encouraged to return if she experiences significant dysmenorrhea.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 760: dysmenorrhea and endometriosis in the adolescent [^f8bb352b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — hormonal therapy for primary dysmenorrhea notes that the mechanism of action for hormonal methods is likely related to prevention of endometrial proliferation or ovulation, or both, thus decreasing prostaglandin and leukotriene production; compared with cyclic use of combined oral contraceptives, continuous regimens may result in a more rapid onset of pain reduction, but long-term success with both regimens is possible; continuous norethindrone acetate 5 mg (norethindrone) has been shown to be equally effective as a cyclic combined hormonal contraceptive and also decreases dysmenorrhea in women aged 18–23 years; gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are not recommended for empiric use in suspected primary dysmenorrhea because of bone mineral density concerns.
