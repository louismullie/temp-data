## Question

Has the patient experienced recent trauma or injury to the knee?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the patient has experienced recent trauma or injury to the knee. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "recent" in a clinically meaningful way. Then, I should verify the key elements of the history that distinguish traumatic from atraumatic knee pain. Next, I will review the mechanism of injury patterns that point toward specific internal derangements. After that, I should check for temporal clues in symptom onset and effusion timing that support an acute injury. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like occult foreign body or high-risk occupational exposures and outline how to reconcile conflicting histories with targeted examination and imaging if indicated [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr].

> Let me first confirm the time frame for "recent". In acute knee evaluation, "recent" typically refers to symptoms beginning within the past 1–2 weeks, often immediately after a discrete event; however, some traumatic meniscal tears and ligament injuries can declare themselves over days to weeks, so I should keep a window of up to several weeks in mind while correlating with mechanism and exam findings [^notfound].

> I need to check the core history elements that separate traumatic from atraumatic etiologies. I should ask explicitly about a precipitating event, whether the patient could continue activity or bear weight immediately after, and whether there was a pop, locking, or giving-way sensation; inability to bear weight, immediate swelling, and mechanical symptoms increase the likelihood of significant internal derangement or fracture, whereas delayed swelling and no mechanical symptoms favor atraumatic or degenerative causes [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the mechanism details because they refine pretest probabilities. Noncontact twisting with a planted foot, sudden deceleration or pivot, hyperextension, or a direct blow can injure menisci, cruciates, or collaterals; a dashboard-type anterior force suggests PCL injury, whereas a valgus blow suggests MCL injury, and a varus force suggests LCL injury; these patterns help me anchor the diagnosis before imaging [^112WwUqr] [^117K5pcc].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of swelling because that is a key discriminator. Immediate swelling within minutes to hours after injury suggests hemarthrosis from ACL rupture, intra-articular fracture, or patellar dislocation, whereas swelling that evolves over 24–48 hours suggests a meniscal tear or lower-energy ligament sprain; recurrent effusions after activity also point toward meniscal pathology and should prompt me to revisit the trauma narrative carefully [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr].

> I should confirm mechanical symptoms next. Locking, catching, or popping at the time of injury increase the likelihood of meniscal or ligamentous injury; a knee locked in flexion that cannot be extended is classic for a displaced meniscal fragment and mandates urgent evaluation for potential arthroscopic management, so I need to ask about these features explicitly and correlate with exam maneuvers [^113sejqK] [^111KphMb].

> But wait, what if the patient denies trauma yet has persistent monoarthritis or synovitis? I need to consider occult intra-articular foreign body, especially in children and adolescents, where a trivial puncture can be forgotten; radiolucent materials like wood or plastic may be invisible on standard imaging, so persistent or recurrent pain with effusion despite negative films should trigger a high index of suspicion and early arthroscopic evaluation when noninvasive workup is unrevealing [^116ZZzhk] [^116cz1n6] [^1132QK6L].

> Let me think about occupational and recreational context because it can uncover trauma the patient minimizes. First responders and athletes have higher rates of acute meniscal and ligament injuries due to repetitive loaded maneuvers; if the patient's work or sport involves lifting, pivoting, or impact, I should double-check for subtle mechanisms and cumulative microtrauma that could culminate in an acute presentation [^114rPJVG].

> I should double-check for red flags that mandate urgent imaging and referral even if the trauma story is incomplete. Severe pain with immediate swelling, inability to bear weight, gross instability, or deformity raise concern for fracture, dislocation, or complete ligament rupture; in these cases, radiographs are indicated before MRI, and clinical decision rules like the Ottawa or Pittsburgh Knee Rules can guide imaging decisions while ensuring we do not miss significant bony injury [^113sejqK] [^1126KWWt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought any effusion within 24 hours proves trauma, but I should correct that; while immediate effusion is highly suggestive of hemarthrosis from acute injury, early inflammatory effusions from crystal arthropathy or infection can also present within 24 hours, so I need to integrate the whole picture — mechanism, mechanical symptoms, and exam — before concluding trauma solely from the timing of swelling [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr].

> Next, I should review how to reconcile a negative trauma history with positive findings. If the exam shows joint line tenderness, positive McMurray or Lachman, or mechanical symptoms, I should revisit the history with targeted prompts about pivoting, squatting, stairs, or minor twists; patients often forget or downplay low-energy events, and careful questioning can recover the traumatic mechanism that aligns with the objective findings [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr].

> I will now examine how to proceed if trauma remains uncertain but suspicion persists. A comprehensive physical examination is the low-cost, low-risk next step; combining tests improves diagnostic accuracy, and if instability or internal derangement is suspected, MRI is appropriate after plain radiographs to exclude fracture, particularly when management would change with a definitive soft-tissue diagnosis [^113PXsn7] [^116U6LHU].

> In summary, I need to ensure the history captures whether there was a discrete injury, the mechanism, immediate versus delayed swelling, mechanical symptoms, and functional impact; recent trauma is supported by a clear mechanism, immediate swelling, mechanical symptoms, and inability to bear weight, whereas atraumatic presentations typically lack a precipitating event, have delayed swelling, and no mechanical symptoms, with the caveat that occult trauma and high-risk contexts can blur this distinction and warrant a low threshold for targeted examination and imaging when indicated [^113sejqK] [^112WwUqr] [^117K5pcc].

I can't tell if the patient had a recent knee injury from the information provided. Please confirm whether there was any **recent trauma or injury** to the knee, including the mechanism, timing, and any immediate swelling, locking, or instability. If trauma is suspected, I should apply the **Ottawa Knee Rules** to decide on imaging and proceed with a focused exam to assess for fracture, ligament, or meniscal injury [^1126KWWt] [^113PXsn7]. If there was no trauma, I will consider nontraumatic causes and tailor the evaluation accordingly [^113sejqK].

## Clinical significance of recent knee trauma

Recent knee trauma can cause **significant morbidity**, including:

- **Fractures**: Tibial plateau, patellar, or femoral condyle fractures [^112WwUqr].
- **Ligamentous injuries**: ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL tears [^112WwUqr].
- **Meniscal injuries**: Medial or lateral meniscal tears [^112jPrGX].
- **Soft tissue injuries**: Contusions, bursitis, tendon ruptures [^113sejqK].

Prompt recognition and management are essential to prevent **complications** such as chronic pain, instability, and osteoarthritis [^115yuzUM].

---

## Clinical evaluation of recent knee trauma

A thorough **clinical evaluation** should include:

- **History**: Mechanism of injury, timing, swelling, locking, instability, pain location, and functional impairment [^113sejqK].
- **Physical examination**: Inspection, palpation, range of motion, stability tests (Lachman, anterior/posterior drawer, valgus/varus stress), McMurray test, and neurovascular assessment [^1126KWWt].
- **Imaging**: Plain radiographs (Ottawa Knee Rules) [^1126KWWt], MRI for soft tissue injuries [^112GtVF2], CT for complex fractures [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **AAOS** provides evidence-based guidelines for managing acute isolated meniscal pathology, emphasizing the importance of clinical evaluation, imaging, and individualized treatment plans [^115ahWt3]. The **Cambridge Knee Injury Tool (CamKIT)** is a validated clinical prediction tool that aids in diagnosing acute soft tissue knee injuries, streamlining care pathways, and reducing unnecessary imaging [^114eBk27].

---

## Documentation and communication

Accurate documentation and communication are essential in managing recent knee trauma. Healthcare providers should **document**:

- **Detailed history**: Mechanism, timing, symptoms, functional impairment [^113sejqK].
- **Physical examination findings**: Swelling, tenderness, instability, range of motion [^113sejqK].
- **Imaging results**: Radiographs, MRI, CT findings [^116cnjji].
- **Treatment plan**: Conservative management, surgical intervention, follow-up care [^114eBk27].

## Conclusion

I can't tell if the patient had a recent knee injury from the information provided. Please confirm whether there was any **recent trauma or injury** to the knee, including the mechanism, timing, and any immediate swelling, locking, or instability. If trauma is suspected, I should apply the **Ottawa Knee Rules** to decide on imaging and proceed with a focused exam to assess for fracture, ligament, or meniscal injury [^1126KWWt] [^113PXsn7]. If there was no trauma, I will consider nontraumatic causes and tailor the evaluation accordingly [^113sejqK].

### Post-traumatic and OA-related lesions in the knee at baseline and 2 years after traumatic meniscal injury: secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^116obfWp]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the presence of early degenerative changes on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 24 months after a traumatic meniscal tear and to compare these changes in patients treated with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or physical therapy plus optional delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.

Design

We included patients aged 18–45 years with a recent onset, traumatic, MRI verified, isolated meniscal tear without radiographic osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or standardized physical therapy with optional delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. MRIs at baseline and 24 months were scored using the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS). We compared baseline MRIs to healthy controls aged 18–40 years. The outcome was the progression of bone marrow lesions (BMLs), cartilage defects and osteophytes after 24 months in patients.

Results

We included 99 patients and 50 controls. At baseline, grade 2 and 3 BMLs were present in 26% of the patients (n = 26), compared to 2% of the controls (n = 1) (between group difference 24% (95% CI 15% to 34%)). In patients, 35% (n = 35) had one or more cartilage defects grade 1 or higher, compared to 2% of controls (n = 1) (between group difference 33% (95% CI 23% to 44%)). At 24 months MRI was available for 40 patients randomized to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and 41 patients randomized to physical therapy. At 24 months 30% (n = 12) of the patients randomized to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy showed BML worsening, compared to 22% (n = 9) of the patients randomized to physical therapy (between group difference 8% (95% CI -11% to 27%)). Worsening of cartilage defects was present in 40% (n = 16) of the arthroscopic partial meniscectomy group, compared to 22% (n = 9) of the physical therapy group (between group difference 18% (95% CI -2% to 38%)). Of the patients who had no cartilage defect at baseline, 33% of the arthroscopic partial meniscectomy group had a new cartilage defect at follow-up compared to 14% of the physical therapy group. Osteophyte worsening was present in 18% (n = 7) of the arthroscopic partial meniscectomy group and 15% (n = 6) of the physical therapy group (between group difference 3% (95% CI -13% to 19%)).

Conclusions

Our results might suggest more worsening of BMLs and cartilage defects with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compared to physical therapy with optional delayed arthroscopic partial meniscectomy at 24-month follow-up in young patients with isolated traumatic meniscal tears without radiographic OA.

### Knee injuries in first responders [^114rPJVG]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

First responders, including firefighters, law enforcement, and emergency medical services, represent a unique patient population at high risk of knee injury. High rates of on-scene and training injuries are driven by dynamic and repetitive maneuvers often done under load. Excellent care of first responders starts with an understanding of the patient's occupational demands to provide the treatment and rehabilitation that optimizes their ability to return to high-level activity. By aligning treatment algorithms with real-world job demands and realistic return-to-duty timelines, orthopaedic surgeons can optimize functional outcomes and maintain the operational readiness of these essential public safety professionals. This review discusses the current literature pertaining to knee injuries in first responders.

### Lower extremity MRI: are their requests always appropriate in France? [^116U6LHU]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) today enables diagnostic evaluation for many clinical indications, including lesion detection, characterization, functional assessment, and response to treatment. The main advantages of MRI are that it is non-irradiating and non-invasive. However access to MRI can take a long time in France: a study commissioned by the National Union of the Medical Technology Industry (Syndicat national de l'industrie des technologies médicales) showed that in 2018, the estimated waiting time for an MRI scan in oncology was 32.3 days.

According to international guidelines, lower extremity MRI is not a first-line imaging: its request should be discussed after the X-rays have been performed. As lower extremity MRI mainly concerns the knee, according to clinicians' feedback in France, the National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé [HAS]) and the National Professional Council for Radiology and Medical Imaging (G4) published two guidelines in 2022 on the relevant imaging in cases of non-traumatic knee pain or after knee trauma in adults. In the case of non-traumatic knee pain, the main recommendations are:
carry out a thorough history and clinical examination before any knee imaging;
knee X-rays are the first-line imaging procedure;
MRI should not be performed as a first-line imaging procedure;
imaging should not be repeated in the event of a new episode of knee pain in a patient with a known pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis) and usual symptomatology.

A review of the practice showed a steady increase in the use of lower extremity MRI in France. According to the analysis of patient care 3 months before and after the request for a lower extremity MRI by a general practitioner (GP) in the first half of 2012, MRI was not always relevant. In fact, this study showed that 61% of patients did not have a prior X-ray (recommended before MRI), and 6% underwent a repeat MRI examination.

The main objective of our observational study is to establish an up-to-date overview of lower extremity MRI practices almost ten years after this study, with a secondary focus on the knee.

### The cambridge knee injury tool (camKIT): a clinical prediction tool for acute soft tissue knee injuries [^116AETFe]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical implications

The CamKIT can potentially impact both primary and secondary healthcare settings by aligning patient care with injury risk levels. In primary healthcare, the tool could help identify cases with a high likelihood of severe injury that requires urgent specialist intervention versus minor injuries that can be managed conservatively.

Patients with low-risk injuries can be initially managed with education on acute injury management and safety netting advice. Patients with high-risk injuries can be prioritised for an in-person consult or further diagnostic imaging. Settings that could be utilised include telehealth for rural populations, virtual fracture clinics for orthopaedic referrals and matchday and pitchside sports injury assessment. Patients categorised as medium risk can be advised to present to the nearest emergency department (if assessed pitchside) or referred to an orthopaedic specialist (if assessed in a general practice setting). These patients can provide a clear summary of their CamKIT assessment, including risk factors, injury mechanism and clinical signs and symptoms, to assist in further evaluation.

Recent advancements in clinical decision-making tools should be integrated into the further development of the CamKIT and subsequent management pathways. By integrating comprehensive clinical decision-making pathways, these tools can improve diagnostic accuracy, streamline care pathways and personalise treatment strategies based on patient-specific and external risk factors. Such integration enables early non-operative management or timely surgical intervention, as appropriate, while aligning diagnostic imaging criteria with evidence-based findings to reduce unnecessary MRI utilisation, healthcare costs and wait times. These advancements support efficient resource allocation and improve patient outcomes by enabling earlier interventions, reducing secondary injury risks and mitigating long-term degenerative complications. This approach underscores the potential of CamKIT-informed pathways to standardise and optimise care for knee injuries, addressing key challenges in contemporary healthcare delivery.

The tool is designed for use by medics or physiotherapists, as they are typically responsible for assessments either in pitchside or in clinical environments. CamKIT is intended to complement standard history-taking and physical examination, particularly for clinicians who may lack confidence or experience in musculoskeletal injury assessments.

### National institute of health and care excellence clinical criteria for the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis: a prospective diagnostic accuracy study in individuals with type 2 diabetes [^114TeFxd]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of false positives and negatives

False positives (ie, individuals who were positive for knee OA by the NICE criteria but negative for knee OA by rheumatologist assessment) included individuals with prior (self‐limited) knee pain, recent knee trauma, fibromyalgia, and infrapatellar bursitis. Further details on the characteristics of the false positives are presented in Supplementary Table S2.

False negatives (ie, individuals who were negative for knee OA by the NICE criteria but positive for knee OA by rheumatologist assessment) included individuals who self‐identified as having joint stiffness only and not "pain" (n = 2), those who reported > 30 minutes of morning joint stiffness (n = 3), and an individual who described during clinical assessment that they tended to minimize their joint symptoms. Further details on the characteristics of the false negatives are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

Characteristics of "possible" and validation of rheumatologist assessment

We identified three individuals as having "possible OA" (ie, that additional information or longitudinal follow‐up was required to make a diagnosis of established knee OA). For these individuals, history was compatible with knee OA; however, there were minimal clinical findings on knee examination. Clinician suspicion was for initial manifestations of knee OA. Further details on the characteristics of those with "possible OA" are presented in Supplementary Table 3. There was high rheumatologist interrater reliability for OA diagnosis (weighted κ = 0.86, 95% CI 0.60–1.00).

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116ZZzhk]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Review and Discussion

"Silent" intra-articular FBs are relatively uncommon in pediatric medical settings. We present the largest series of such cases reported to date. The deceptive presentation of symptoms poses a unique diagnostic challenge. The often-unremarkable nature of the injury combined with apparently negative radiographs and nonspecific soft-tissue inflammation on MRIs, frequently lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Our case 1 illustrates these features. The clinical picture was misleading, and the imaging results were noninformative, whereas the arthroscopy procedure revealed and enabled the removal of an intra-articular FB. This case underscores the significance of vigilance and awareness of subtle clinical presentations, particularly when initial imaging assessments yield normal or ambiguous results. Patients may present with recurrent or persistent joint pain, swelling, and numbness weeks or even months after an injury that may have not been remarkable enough to recall as the cause of joint trauma. This is particularly relevant to the pediatric population, especially with regard to patients without rheumatological characteristics and those who already have a history of trauma to the affected joint with no signs of skin penetration on physical examination.

### Chronic osteomyelitis of patella in a child [^11349WWf]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric patients with osteomyelitis present with nonspecific symptoms and systemic signs of illness; therefore, it is important to evaluate a patient with extremities pain with high suspicion of osteomyelitis. In our case, patients presented with knee pain and swelling for 4 months. No hallmark symptoms and signs were present for diagnosis of osteomyelitis. In a report by Sperl et al, the child had a similar history of nonspecific knee pain but without swelling in the first 2 months of presentation. Presence of healed scar was present in our case; however, Shamsunder et alreported a case of chronic osteomyelitis with pus discharge from the wound. Our case was secondary to trauma; however, osteomyelitis may develop with or without the history of trauma or recent infection.

Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent dreadful complications. Initial diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis and osteomyelitis of patella was made. Whether prepatellar bursitis leads to osteomyelitis of patella or vice versa is still debatable. Osteomyelitis in patella is a rare occurrence and is frequently misdiagnosed at first as prepatellar bursitis, peripatellar cellulitis, septic arthritis, synovitis, or septic bursitis. Bipartite patella, Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease, and rare tumors, including chondroblastomas and osteoid osteomas, are other differential diagnosis for patellar lesions.

### The cambridge knee injury tool (camKIT): a clinical prediction tool for acute soft tissue knee injuries [^114eBk27]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

STKIs are a complex diagnosis due to influences of risk factors, injury mechanisms, concomitant injuries and clinical findings. In the study cohort, 56% of injuries involved other soft tissue knee structures, indicating the complexity of STKI presentations (figure 2). These injuries, whether isolated or concomitant, presented with a range of signs and symptoms, each with varying degrees of importance (figure 4). Given the multifactorial nature of STKIs, achieving accurate diagnosis requires specialised training and precise clinical decision-making. Furthermore, only 30% of all presentations to A&E had a clinically significant injury, and only 17% required surgical intervention (figure 3). Considering the already challenging nature of diagnosing STKIs, the small proportion of clinically significant injuries among the presenting cohort underscores the need for accurate diagnostic tools in acute settings.

The cohort referred for specialist consultation had a low proportion of significant injuries and subsequent surgical interventions. Only 56% of the cohort referred for specialist consultation were found to have a confirmed injury, and only 34% required further surgical intervention (figure 3). This suggests suboptimal diagnostic accuracy in acute settings and overutilisation of the current referral pathway. Currently, orthopaedic specialists conduct many unnecessary evaluations, where physiotherapy or occupational therapy treatment pathways may be more appropriate. Similarly, there was a low injury rate among the cohort who received an MRI referral. Of the cohort who underwent MRI, 76% were found to have a confirmed injury and only 46% required surgery (figure 3). These results suggest that accurate diagnosis earlier in the pathway may enable the referral of patients to the appropriate management streams. By increasing the accuracy of diagnosis on index presentation, an appropriate referral could improve the efficiency of that STKI pathway, reducing the burden of unnecessary imaging requests.

The CamKIT offers a promising development in the diagnosis of acute STKIs, demonstrating significant accuracy in identifying patients with clinically significant injuries. The subsequent utilisation of a three-tier risk stratification model achieves a near-perfect balance by correctly identifying almost all cases with significant injuries while excluding all those without (table 2). The CamKIT was calculated to have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94%, a PPV of 89% and an NPV of 100% (table 3). These results align with the principles of the Ottawa knee rules, where a sensitivity of 100% is suggested to promote clinical uptake by providing reassurance that no injuries are missed

### Academy of orthopaedic surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of acute isolated meniscal pathology [^113PXsn7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Acute isolated meniscal pathology — physical examination benefits, importance, and implementation are summarized as follows: Physical examination will assist clinicians with assessing for the presence of meniscus tears and other knee injuries. There are no known risks from a comprehensive physical examination. The four high quality and eight moderate quality studies demonstrate the importance of physical examination in the diagnosis of meniscus tears, although there is variability in the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests. A comprehensive physical exam is a low-cost method for assessing patients for meniscus tears, and physical examination should have high acceptability as it is routinely performed. Physical examination is a feasible and expected component to evaluating patients for meniscal injury, and future research could determine the most useful and accurate examination maneuver or combination of examination maneuvers for diagnosing patients with meniscal injury.

### Modern vascular trauma and preparing tomorrow's workforce [^113VS41o]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Parihar et al specifically focused on consultation rates for lower extremity vascular injuries at Emory University. Vascular surgeons were not consulted for these injuries in 2011; however, they were consulted 70% of the time in 2019. The same group then examined all trauma consultations obtained for patients who required an emergent operation. Vascular surgeons were most frequently consulted compared with other subspecialties. The intraoperative rate of consultations to vascular surgery increased significantly over the 5-year study period.

A recent publication from the group at Los Angeles General showed that outcomes for peripheral vascular injuries were similar whether the repair was performed by a trauma surgeon or by a vascular surgeon. Vascular surgeons were more likely to be called for an injury distal to the elbow or the knee, and for multiple vascular injuries. These injuries are presumably more technically difficult. Hypotensive patients and those with hard signs of injury were more likely to be managed by a trauma surgeon. Each incremental increase in the injury severity scale was associated with fewer vascular surgery consultations. As the technical complexity of the case increased, vascular surgery was more likely to perform repairs, whereas trauma surgery was more likely to manage cases if a patient decompensated.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116ggFTa]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Most foreign bodies (FBs) are discovered in the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, - but penetrating joint injuries may occur in the pediatric population but are often diagnosed by plane radiographs when the foreign object is radiodense. However, when the foreign body is not detectable on imaging, the inflammation and possible infection may persist for extended periods, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Children and young adults may complain of pain weeks or months following a penetrating injury that is often not recalled. – Cases presenting as knee pain and swelling, sometimes with no apparent traumatic injury can cause septic arthritis, elicit an extensive imaging and laboratory workup and may not be recognized until arthroscopic exploration. Because of the often-obscure presentation of these injuries, general physicians, pediatricians, emergency department physicians, and orthopaedic surgeons should be thorough in taking history from patients presenting with joint pain disorders. In this report, we present four such cases of pediatric arthroscopic extraction of a foreign body in the knee joint undetectable by imaging technologies at a large, urban, tertiary university-affiliated medical center. We also review currently available data on foreign body extraction from joints along with management and approach of pediatric patients presenting with suspected intra-articular FBs.

### Common sports-related nerve injuries seen by the electrodiagnostic medical consultant [^1147VKYB]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

6 MULTI‐LIGAMENTOUS KNEE INJURY

6.1 Background

Knee dislocation is a rare but devastating injury, which is commonly associated with neurovascular injury. Approximately one‐third of knee dislocations are caused by sports‐related injuries. Traumatic peripheral nerve injury is seen in up to 40% of cases, with the common fibular nerve most frequently affected in approximately 25% of cases.

The sciatic nerve typically bifurcates in the popliteal fossa into the common fibular and tibial nerves. The common fibular nerve provides a sensory cutaneous branch to the lateral knee, before wrapping around the fibular neck and subsequently dividing into the superficial and deep fibular nerves. The common fibular nerve is particularly vulnerable at the level of the fibular head and neck, where it is both superficially exposed and tethered to bone. As such, it is at risk for both compression and traction.

6.2 Clinical presentation

Knee dislocations in the anterior direction are most common and are usually secondary to a hyperextension mechanism. These dislocations are associated with a high risk of popliteal artery and tibial nerve injury due to traction forces. Comparatively, posterior knee dislocations occur most commonly due to dashboard mechanisms. While less common, lateral dislocations may occur as a result of a varus force and present an extremely high risk of fibular nerve injury due to traction of the nerve at the fibular head.

Nerve injury should be suspected in any patient presenting with a history of knee dislocation, posterolateral corner injury, or fibular head fracture. In most cases, the knee joint will be relocated at the time of assessment. Hence, it is crucial to perform a careful neurological examination to assess both the fibular and tibial innervated muscles. In addition, side‐to‐side comparison of the tibialis posterior and dorsalis pedis pulses and arterial studies are advised to investigate for concurrent vascular injury.

Acute meniscus tears — symptoms, treatment goals, and contraindications include swelling, pain, decreased range of motion, limited function or inability to return to sport, with the goal of treatment being relief from pain, improvement in function, and return to sports and activities; given associations with knee osteoarthritis, treatment focuses on preserving as much healthy meniscus as possible by only resecting injured or unstable tissue and repairing when possible; contraindications vary by the type and location of meniscal injury and surgical procedure.

### Femoral diaphyseal fatigue stress fracture in an older adult male with normal bone mineral density [^114ASbtv]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

During the initial two ED presentations, the provisional diagnosis of knee OA was arrived at through consideration of the potential differential diagnoses. The history and examination findings of localised unilateral thigh pain aggravated by weightbearing were suggestive of either bone or joint pathology. A femoral fracture was considered unlikely given the lack of identified trauma or repetitive loading, no history of osteopenia/osteoporosis, absence of constitutional symptoms suggestive of underlying metastatic disease and unremarkable X-ray imaging. Gout was considered unlikely given the clinical features such as location of the tenderness (distal femur), lack of knee joint erythema or tenderness, a subacute onset of moderate pain and a lack of clinical risk factors (eg, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, renal disease, dietary habits and medications that increase urate levels). The routine biochemistry of normal inflammatory markers further reduced clinical suspicion for gout. The lower limb X-ray findings on both occasions of mild degenerative changes of the tibiofemoral joint with no other abnormalities significantly reduced the likelihood of an overt femoral fracture or bony malignancy causing insufficiency fracture and increased the likelihood of knee OA as the cause of the clinical presentation.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^11454QcC]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative preparation for exploratory laparotomy in renal trauma — standard resuscitation and setup steps are specified. Manage all trauma patients taken to the OR for exploratory laparotomy in the same way, regardless of the underlying injury. Resuscitate patients using balanced resuscitation (e.g., permissive hypotension, limited crystalloid fluid use, and blood product transfusions), and activate the massive transfusion protocol when appropriate. Send blood for type- and crossmatching so type-specific blood can be used when needed. In the OR, place the patient in the supine position with arms abducted. Preparation for exploration includes preoperative antibiotics, wide skin preparation with antiseptic solution, and draping (chin to knees, table to table).

### Deep vein thrombosis after gunshot injury [^1129duVk]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and incidence for VTE: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE), represent significant complication in trauma patients, particularly in combat settings where injuries often involve high-energy mechanisms such as blasts and ballistic trauma. Combat casualties face additional risks less prevalent in civilian settings, including early transfusion of blood products, the use of fresh frozen plasma outside of large volume blood transfusions, the use of tourniquets and multiple or above-knee amputations, contributing to the higher VTE incidence in military subgroups. The incidence of VTE in civilian patients who sustain firearm injuries is not available in the literature. Risk factors and scores for VTE: Trauma Embolic Scoring System (TESS) stands out as the most validated and effective clinical tool that assesses the risk of VTE for combat casualties due to its sensitivity in military trauma settings, addressing factors like shock and major leg injuries. Thromboprophylaxis strategies and guidelines: Guidelines for preventing VTE in patients suffering combat gunshot wounds emphasizes early prophylaxis, typically within 24 h of injury, using both mechanical and chemical methods.

Search strategy and quality assessment

We conducted comprehensive searches of Medline, Embase, Web of Science and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering their inception up until 18 May 2023. All retrieved records were imported into Rayyan. Search terms used are included in the Supporting Information materials.

After eliminating duplicate citations, titles and abstracts were screened based on predefined criteria. Two authors (A. R. and S. R.) independently evaluated each paper. In cases of discrepancies, discussions were held with senior authors (C. K. and I. A.) to reach a consensus. Following the initial screening, full‐text reviews were undertaken. Protocols screened during the initial abstract phase were revisited to check if a subsequent publication resulted from the trial, and these were included for review if applicable. We also examined the bibliographies of included studies and included any that met our inclusion criteria.

### Do existing magnetic resonance imaging definitions of knee osteoarthritis identify knees that will develop clinically significant disease over up to 11 years of follow-up? [^117Ukkiq]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteophyte presence was scored in six TF locations (0, none; 1, small; 2, medium; 3, large) (Figure 2A and B). Articular cartilage was scored for lesion size and degree of full‐thickness loss in 10 TF subregions (0, normal; 1.0, 1%–10% area damaged, no full thickness; 1.1, 1%–10% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 2.0, 10%–75% area, no full thickness; 2.1, 10%–75% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 2.2, 10%–75% area, 10%–75% full thickness; 3.0, > 75% area, no full thickness; 3.1, > 75% area, 1%–10% full thickness; 3.2, > 75% area, 10%–75% full thickness; 3.3, > 75% area, > 75% full thickness) (Figure 2C). Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) were scored in 10 TF subregions (0, none; 1, < 25% of subregion; 2, 25%–50%; 3, > 50%) (Figure 2D). Meniscal damage was scored in six locations (0, normal; 1, signal abnormality; 2, radial tear; 3, horizontal tear; 4, vertical tear; 5, complex tear; 6, partial maceration; 7, progressive partial maceration; 8, complete maceration) (Figure 2D). Meniscal extrusion was scored in two locations (0, < 2 mm; 1, 2–2.9 mm; 2, 3–4.9 mm; 3, > 5 mm). Figure 2E and F illustrate the 10 subregions for cartilage and BML assessment.

### Evaluation and management of knee dislocations in low-income settings: evidence-based strategies and practical considerations [^11488tGE]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Evaluation and Diagnosis in Resource-limited Settings

The initial evaluation of a suspected knee dislocation must begin with a thorough clinical assessment, given the high risk of associated vascular and neurologic injuries. In resource-constrained settings, where access to advanced imaging may be delayed or unavailable, clinical vigilance and systematic examination are essential.

A visibly deformed, unstable, or shortened limb should raise immediate suspicion for dislocation, even in cases where spontaneous reduction has occurred before evaluation. Palpation of distal pulses — particularly the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries — is mandatory and should be compared with the contralateral limb. Capillary refill, skin temperature, and limb color provide additional clues to vascular status. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) remains a low-cost, reliable tool: Values < 0.9 suggest potential arterial injury and warrant additional vascular investigation.

Neurologic assessment should include motor and sensory testing of the peroneal and tibial nerves, with special attention to foot dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, as well as light touch sensation over the dorsum and sole of the foot. Ultrasound may also be employed to characterize the pattern of peroneal nerve injury, thereby aiding surgical planning, especially in cases of complete disruption (neurotmesis). Peroneal nerve palsy, either transient or permanent, is reported in up to 40% of high-energy knee dislocations.

In the absence of overt ischemia, Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable first-line tool in low-resource environments. It is portable, widely available, and allows dynamic assessment of arterial flow. If Doppler findings are abnormal or inconclusive, CT angiography (CTA) is preferred — when available — due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Plain radiographs (anterior-posterior and lateral) are essential to confirm joint alignment, assess for fractures, and exclude spontaneous relocation. When accessible, point-of-care ultrasonography can also assist in identifying hemarthrosis or posterior capsule disruptions.

The challenge in these settings is to balance urgency with pragmatism: Clinical judgment must drive decision-making when technology is lacking. Early recognition and documentation of vascular and neurologic status are crucial to guide timely referral or intervention.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116cz1n6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing and managing acute knee monoarthritis in children presents a complex challenge, and when an etiology is not clear, it might be the result of an occult presence of a radiolucent foreign body. We report on four instances of acute monoarticular knee arthritis in pediatric patients. Despite employing standard imaging techniques, patient history, and laboratory tests, no foreign bodies (FBs) were initially identified. However, arthroscopy conducted in all cases, unveiled FBs that might have otherwise gone unnoticed and led to proper treatment of the problem. Despite their rarity, a unique challenge arises in this population due to the deceptive presentation of symptoms. The often-inconspicuous nature of the injury, combined with negative radiographs and nonspecific soft-tissue inflammation, on MRI frequently leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Our study and broader literature highlight the limitations of standard imaging in detecting FBs, especially in children. In cases of persistent or recurring knee pain, a high index of suspicion for undetected FBs and prompt arthroscopic evaluation are paramount for achieving optimal outcomes in children with otherwise unexplained monoarticular knee arthritis.

### Outcomes after multiligament knee injury worsen over time: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112G8Wyt]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The most important finding of the present systematic review and meta‐analysis is the worsening of the clinical outcomes over time, when measured with Lysholm, IKDC and Tegner scores. Furthermore, long‐term results of PCLb injuries are significantly worse than those in nPCLb injuries at minimum 2‐year follow‐ups and with progression over time.

In the present systematic review, 6 studies investigated ≥ 10 year follow‐up. On average, the present meta‐analysis estimates the Lysholm score at 10 years to around 78, providing a good overall estimate and overlapping with the results of these long‐term studies, but this is very dependent on the type of injury. If this is compared to results at 2 years, the difference is clear. In the lack of similar studies on multiligament injuries, a comparison to ACL reconstruction and long‐term outcomes can be performed. After 20 years, the results of ACL reconstruction are considered satisfactory but with 10% of patients having residual laxity. Osteoarthritis prevalence is high, especially in patients with concomitant injuries to the cartilage, meniscus and extensor mechanism, as well as delayed surgery. The heterogeneity of the possible injured‐ligament combinations renders any systematic review complex: surgery or no surgery, repair or reconstruct, what to use for reconstruction, which technique to use and, finally, when to do the surgery. Several systematic reviews on the subject of MLKIs have been published in the literature, addressing various aspects. None have provided an answer to long‐term recovery and progression of functional outcomes over time. It can be hypothesized that the injury pattern of MLKIs, including neurovascular damage, causes significantly faster deterioration of knee function at long‐term follow‐ups.

### The large language model chatGPT-4 exhibits excellent triage capabilities and diagnostic performance for patients presenting with various causes of knee pain [^115UcxQn]. Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide a proof-of-concept analysis of the appropriateness and performance of ChatGPT-4 to triage, synthesize differential diagnoses, and generate treatment plans concerning common presentations of knee pain.

Methods

Twenty knee complaints warranting triage and expanded scenarios were input into ChatGPT-4, with memory cleared prior to each new input to mitigate bias. For the 10 triage complaints, ChatGPT-4 was asked to generate a differential diagnosis that was graded for accuracy and suitability in comparison to a differential created by 2 orthopaedic sports medicine physicians. For the 10 clinical scenarios, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to provide treatment guidance for the patient, which was again graded. To test the higher-order capabilities of ChatGPT-4, further inquiry into these specific management recommendations was performed and graded.

Results

All ChatGPT-4 diagnoses were deemed appropriate within the spectrum of potential pathologies on a differential. The top diagnosis on the differential was identical between surgeons and ChatGPT-4 for 70% of scenarios, and the top diagnosis provided by the surgeon appeared as either the first or second diagnosis in 90% of scenarios. Overall, 16 of 30 diagnoses (53.3%) in the differential were identical. When provided with 10 expanded vignettes with a single diagnosis, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 increased to 100%, with the suitability of management graded as appropriate in 90% of cases. Specific information pertaining to conservative management, surgical approaches, and related treatments was appropriate and accurate in 100% of cases.

Conclusions

ChatGPT-4 provided clinically reasonable diagnoses to triage patient complaints of knee pain due to various underlying conditions that were generally consistent with differentials provided by sports medicine physicians. Diagnostic performance was enhanced when providing additional information, allowing ChatGPT-4 to reach high predictive accuracy for recommendations concerning management and treatment options. However, ChatGPT-4 may show clinically important error rates for diagnosis depending on prompting strategy and information provided; therefore, further refinements are necessary prior to implementation into clinical workflows.

Clinical Relevance

Although ChatGPT-4 is increasingly being used by patients for health information, the potential for ChatGPT-4 to serve as a clinical support tool is unclear. In this study, we found that ChatGPT-4 was frequently able to diagnose and triage knee complaints appropriately as rated by sports medicine surgeons, suggesting that it may eventually be a useful clinical support tool.

### Clinically relevant stabilizers of the posteromedial and posterolateral knee: normal anatomy, scanning technique, and ultrasound findings in patients with anterior cruciate ligament tear [^112GtVF2]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Unrecognized and untreated injuries of the posteromedial and posterolateral corners of the knee are more common than previously thought and have been linked to poor outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Amongst imaging modalities, magnetic resonance is currently referred to as the gold standard for the evaluation of these regions, but has several limitations, in particular in the identification of subacute and chronic lesions. Recent technological advancements and the progressive refinement of linear probes have expanded the potential of High-resolution ultrasound in demonstrating the stabilizers of the posteromedial and posterolateral corners in both normal and pathological cases, and now this modality may be considered as a useful complementary tool for the evaluation of these structures. The aim of this work is twofold: (i) to review, also with the support of dedicated dissections and schematic drawings, the normal anatomy and the biomechanical role of the clinically relevant stabilizers of the posteromedial and posterolateral knee, including the distal expansion of the semimembranosus tendon, the popliteus muscle-tendon unit, and the posterior oblique ligament; (ii) to illustrate the normal ultrasound appearance of these structures and the spectrum of pathological findings that this modality may disclose in patients with anterior cruciate ligament tear. KEY POINTS: Question Injuries of the posteromedial and posterolateral knee worsen the outcome after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction but are often underdiagnosed on imaging. Findings Ultrasound has potential in diagnosing tears of stabilizers of the posteromedial and posterolateral knee and provides complementary information to MRI about ligament status and continuity. Clinical relevance In subacute and chronic injuries, ultrasound has some advantages over MRI as it can disclose subtle abnormalities that might otherwise be unrecognized, thereby improving diagnostic confidence and patient counselling.

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^117UvspK]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for knee osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering topical NSAIDs as a first-line pain treatment in patients with knee OA because of effectiveness and minimal adverse effects, followed by oral NSAIDs (due to similar effectiveness with more adverse effects) and duloxetine.

### Physical therapy vs. glucocorticoid injection in patients with meniscal tears and knee osteoarthritis: a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial [^114SQJCC]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A meniscal tear is a common degenerative alteration of the knee that can be caused by minor twisting or stress while the individual is participating in competitive sports. Degenerative tears in the knee are more common in older individuals because of the age-related loss of elasticity in the menisci. Previous studies have shown that severe meniscus injuries can lead to knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Furthermore, deterioration of the meniscus has been associated with the deterioration of cartilage in the knee joint, indicating a significant relationship between these two forms of joint pathology. Meniscal tears are particularly common among individuals who suffer from KOA, which is a common cause of joint pain and dysfunction among middle-aged and older people. The scourge of plagiarism afflicts countless individuals globally, imposing immense strain upon both those affected directly and our collective social fabric through its pervasiveness and financial implications. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that KOA may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.

The most common approach for managing meniscus injuries usually focuses on addressing symptoms alone until the injuries progress to the point where knee replacement is necessary due to the worsening of KOA. Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are commonly administered to treat degenerative meniscus injuries associated with KOA. A variety of treatment methods, such as intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, and platelet-rich plasma, have been proposed for the nonsurgical management of KOA. These therapeutic approaches are designed to alleviate pain and enhance functionality in individuals who are affected by KOA.

Intra-articular corticosteroids are highly effective anti-inflammatory agents that are injected directly into the knee joint. These injections can help alleviate inflammation and provide significant relief for individuals who suffer from KOA. Nonetheless, intra-articular corticosteroid injections are associated with certain risks, such as infection, joint cartilage deterioration, and subchondral insufficiency fractures. Therefore, it is important for patients to discuss these risks with them healthcare provider before proceeding with treatment. Exercise-based physical therapy has become the cornerstone for treating osteoarthritis. Studies have shown that physical therapy provides both short-term and long-term pain relief and improves functionality. Both physical therapy and steroid injections have been recommended by medical professionals for the treatment of knee arthritis. However, there is no consensus about which method is more effective for relieving pain and improving joint function over time. Previous clinical trials have shown that physical therapy combined with glucocorticoid injections does not provide further benefits.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^1132QK6L]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Review of the Literature

Early and accurate diagnosis of intra-articular FBs in children is crucial to prevent sequelae such as chronic joint irritation and infection. This necessitates the following:
(1) Understanding the limitations of each imaging modality. Although radiograph, ultrasonography, and MRI can be helpful, they often miss subtle FBs. Unlike metals and glass, materials such as wood and plastics are often undetectable and require arthroscopic examination and treatment. Moreover, FBs may have undergone inclusion or be hidden behind structures that obscure their presence.
(2) Consider arthroscopy earlier rather than later when noninvasive investigations are inconclusive. Direct visualization offers definitive diagnosis and allows immediate intervention.
(3) Meticulous history taking in children with unexplained joint inflammation. Engaging both the child and parents can unearth crucial clues and expand the differential diagnosis.

The cases we describe illustrate the limitations of both conventional and advanced imaging in detecting FBs especially in children. A high index of suspicion and prompt arthroscopic evaluation are essential for achieving optimal outcomes in cases of persistent or recurring monoarticular knee pain. We believe that the relief of pain and the potential pathological ramifications of an indwelling FB supersede any potential risks associated with procedures performed under general anesthesia.

### The diagnostic test accuracy of bone sound conduction testing for the diagnosis of fractures of the upper and lower limbs and ribcage [^112pCzaV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical pathway

The clinical pathway starts with a patient presenting to a healthcare professional. The healthcare professional will check the symptoms and take a history. The most likely symptoms are pain, discoloration, difficulty or inability to bear load, or even hypermobility. Relevant parts of the clinical history are the presence of or absence of significant trauma or factors that make a pathological fracture more likely. Based on this, the decision is made whether imaging is necessary. The placement of BSCT is after the clinical examination and history taking and prior to any imaging to aid decision‐making for whether imaging is necessary. At this point in the clinical pathway, the Ottawa Ankle Rules, the Ottawa Knee Rules, and point‐of‐care ultrasound (POCUS) might be performed prior to imaging.

Alternative test(s)

Another test that might be confused with BSCT is the tuning fork test. It is performed by the application of a vibrating tuning fork directly to the site of the suspected fracture. The aim of this test is to elicit pain in the patient and thus judge whether imaging is needed or not. However, confusion may arise because a tuning fork is also a valid source of sound generation for BSCT yet BSCT does not elicit pain but rather investigates the ability of the bone to conduct sound.

There are other clinical tests that are similarly placed in the clinical pathway. First, there are the Ottawa Ankle Rules and the Ottawa Knee Rules, as described above. Then there is POCUS, which uses non‐hazardous ultrasound to compute an image of bodily tissues and identify fractures. In 2016, one systematic review found POCUS to be very sensitive and specific for forearm fractures in children, with both sensitivity and specificity of 93%. While POCUS can potentially identify the fracture site and reduce exposure to X‐rays, it has the disadvantage of needing an electricity source and expensive equipment.

Rationale

BSCT may be a valuable tool to screen for fractures of the limbs and the ribcage, since it is applicable to all parts of the body except the spine (since bony prominences of the spine, i.e. the spinous processes, are less likely to be identified correctly).

### Radiofrequency for chronic knee pain: a literature review [^114PyXsd]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety of RF Therapy

Efficacy Assessment Indicators

The efficacy of RF treatment can be evaluated according to the specific clinical situation using various indicators. Commonly assessed measures include pain relief or functional improvement. For instance, in the management of chronic pain, studies have shown that pain scores significantly reduce after treatment, and numerous patients experience remarkable pain relief that lasts for several months following RF treatment. Patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and satisfaction scores, also play a vital role in assessing the overall success of RF treatment, reflecting the importance of a holistic approach to evaluate treatment efficacy. Consequently, combining clinical, radiological, and patient-reported measures provides a comprehensive assessment of RF therapy's efficacy across various applications.

Evaluation of the Safety of RF Therapy

RF therapy is a minimally invasive treatment that has gained popularity due to its efficacy in managing various medical conditions, particularly tumors, heart diseases, and pain management. The assessment of RF safety relies primarily on the outcomes of clinical trials and subsequent observational studies. The current literature indicates that RF has a high overall safety profile; however, it is associated with risks and complications. Therefore, despite the high safety of RF, it is imperative for clinicians to thoroughly evaluate patients prior to treatment and maintain vigilant monitoring to mitigate potential risks and ensure patient safety. Prior research indicated that RF therapy maintains analgesic effects for up to 12 months in some patients, although more effective treatments may be required to sustain long-term benefits. While RF therapy is generally well tolerated, rare complications, such as neuritis and dysesthesia, have been reported, necessitating careful patient selection and post-procedural monitoring.

Potential Side Effects and Complications of RF Therapy

Although RF therapy is generally considered safe, it is not without risks. Potential side effects can range from mild to severe, depending on the anatomical location being treated and the patient's underlying condition. Common mild adverse effects include localized pain, swelling, and bruising at the treatment site, which typically resolve within a few days without intervention. More serious complications, though rare, may involve thermal injury to adjacent structures, potentially causing unintended nerve or blood vessel damage. Additionally, there is a risk of infection at the puncture site, necessitating strict adherence to aseptic techniques during the procedure. Long-term complications, such as scar tissue formation or fibrosis, may also occur and impact the function of the treated area. Therefore, clinicians must carefully weigh the benefits and risks of RF therapy and provide patients with thorough preoperative counseling on potential complications.

### Nonspecific knee synovitis caused by foreign bodies undetectable on imaging studies: four cases and literature review [^116uX6Ed]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

FBs can present as recurrent monoarthritis in children and are often missed on initial evaluation. Pathinathan et alreported a 3-year-old girl with 6 weeks of knee pain and swelling after a thorn prick. Imaging and aspiration were inconclusive, but arthroscopy revealed a thorn in the Hoffa fat pad. Similarly, Kandel et aldescribed three pediatric cases where joint pain persisted for months until detailed history raised suspicion of FBs. They emphasized arthroscopy as essential for early diagnosis in such cases. Oztekin et alretrieved sewing needle fragments arthroscopically from the medial compartment in three patients. They recommended arthroscopy with fluoroscopic guidance for suspected radiopaque FBs, especially when symptoms mimic septic arthritis.

Case reports that appeared in the literature from 2001 to 2022 have documented a diverse range of unusual intra-articular FBs, including pencil tips, glass shards, splinters, plastics, and even a palm tree thorn.– In all cases, arthroscopy emerged as the definitive management tool. These diverse and intriguing cases emphasize the critical role of arthroscopy in not only identifying the culprit FB but also facilitating its safe and effective removal in elusive musculoskeletal presentations. A 2022 study by Dai et alidentified a group of pediatric patients with subtle knee symptoms of pain, swelling, and limited mobility. Although no obvious puncture wounds were found, radiographs surprisingly revealed retained FBs. Notably, 93% of these FBs, which were mostly glass or needles, were clearly visible on simple radiographs. In three of their cases, the FBs had migrated to the posterior compartment, thus posing an additional challenge to their arthroscopic removal, and the surgeon switched to open surgery to remove the FB from the posterior compartment in two of those cases. By contrast, although our patients also had similar presentations of knee pain and swelling, both standard and advanced imaging modalities failed to detect any of the FBs that turned out to be responsible. Following a secondary review by the radiology team over all four of our cases, they could not detect FB except in case 2. In all these cases, the diagnosis was primarily guided by clinical findings, often subtle and, in some instances, elevated inflammatory markers, which pointed toward the presence of retained FBs and the possible involvement of indolent pathogens, particularly in the context of negative culture results. Notably, no external sign of abrasion or puncture wounds were noted on physical examinations in all four cases, both preoperatively and postoperatively. The series of Dai et al clearly showed that arthroscopic retrieval surgery emerged as the treatment of choice, proving highly effective in extracting FBs from the children's knee joints (Table 1).

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^114sWbsW]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines across all four musculoskeletal complaints and clinical care standards for low back and knee complaints consistently recommend against routine imaging unless there are clinical features suggestive of serious pathology. Based upon the small number of people attending general practice with serious pathology, it is likely our findings are at odds with recommended practice. For example, the estimated proportion of people attending primary care with low back pain who have serious pathology ranges from 1% to 6%. Overuse of imaging for musculoskeletal complaints has also been recognized as a low‐value practice that should be questioned across several Australian and international Choosing Wisely recommendations. Yet, our data indicate that, to date, these have had little if any impact in changing practice.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the timing of GP imaging requests relative to diagnosis. We found the majority of diagnostic imaging requests occurred at or around the same time as the diagnosis with 31% occurring in the 2 weeks before diagnosis, although we cannot discount the possibility that our cohort received previous care for the same complaint or that imaging was performed only after a period of unsatisfactory improvement. Qualitative research, GP surveys, and Australian Medicare Statistics suggest both clinicians and patients continue to have misconceptions about the value of diagnostic imaging for musculoskeletal complaints. Shoulder MRI, knee CT, and low back MRI were the only modalities to be requested after diagnosis, suggesting perhaps that these are requested if initial management does not help or if symptoms do not subside.

### Significance of differential diagnosis for the elucidation of rare and complicated diseases [^1161KHYu]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the article by Karami et al. titled "Pigmented villonodular synovitis in pediatric population: review of literature and a case report". Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS; now classified under tenosynovial giant cell tumors) is extremely rare in children. Karami et al. conclude that PVNS can cause patellar dislocation; however, we suggest considering a different perspective on this issue. Hemosiderotic synovitis (HS) may be caused by trauma and is difficult to differentiate from PVNS. Given that HS may result from patellar dislocation, we present the main points of differentiation between HS and PVNS. The influence of age and sex on HS remains unclear; however, HS in a child has previously been reported.

HS occurs after repeated joint hematomas and has various causes, including hemophilia, anticoagulant use, trauma, and osteoarthritis. HS often affects the knee, with typical symptoms including swelling and pain. Similarly, PVNS frequently presents with knee pain and swelling; as such, it is difficult to differentiate from HS based on clinical presentation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for examining intra-articular lesions, but faces challenges in distinguishing between HS and PVNS. Several characteristics on MRI in HS, such as lateral meniscus or cartilage damage, synovial thickening, and contrast enhancement level, might be of use in this regard. However, these features were noted in only a few cases, none of which included pediatric patients; therefore, further studies are required.

Pathological examination remains crucial, with most cases being diagnosed based on histological findings. In our review of the histopathological findings in this case, mononuclear cells and osteoclast-type multinucleated giant cells, which are characteristic of PVNS, were less abundant; however, macrophages — especially hemosiderin-laden macrophages — were noticeably present. HS is morphologically characterized by the presence of hemosiderin, mainly restricted to the inner cellular layer of the synovium, and a finer villous appearance compared to the plump papillary pattern seen in PVNS. Therefore, to improve diagnostic accuracy, we recommend assessment of the histopathological presentation of PVNS while taking into account a potential diagnosis of HS. Furthermore, recent research has reported the usefulness of clusterin, colony-stimulating factor 1, and desmin immunohistochemistry for PVNS diagnosis.

### A randomized trial of physical therapy for meniscal tear and knee pain [^1152aVRM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background:

Physical therapy (PT) is routinely recommended for knee pain attributed to a degenerative meniscal tear, but its efficacy has not been established.

Methods:

We randomized participants 45–85 years old with knee pain, osteoarthritis, and meniscal tear to four arms: (1) Home Exercise (3-month home exercise program); (2) Home Exercise + text messages to encourage exercise adherence; Home Exercise + text messages + Standard PT (supervised strengthening, stretching, neuromuscular exercise, and manual therapy); and (4) Home Exercise + text messages + Sham PT (in-clinic sham manual therapy and sham ultrasound). The primary outcome was between-group difference in change in KOOS (Knee Osteoarthritis and injury Outcome Score) Pain scale (0 best to 100 worst) between baseline and 3-months, adjusting for site, baseline KOOS Pain, and radiographic grade.

Results:

We randomized 879 participants with mean age 59.2 (SD 7.8) years. The difference in three-month change between Home Exercise versus Home Exercise + text messages was −0.1 points (98.3% CI −3.8, 3.7), and Home Exercises versus Home Exercise + text messages + Standard PT was 2.5 points (98.3% CI −1.3, 6.2); the difference between Home Exercises + text messages versus Home Exercises + text messages + Standard PT was 2.5 points (98.3% CI −1.4, 6.5). Adverse events were rare, generally minor, and evenly distributed overall across arms.

Conclusion:

For patients with degenerative meniscal tear and knee pain, the addition of physical therapy or text messages to encourage adherence to home exercises was not superior in reducing pain to a home exercise program alone.

### Early musculoskeletal pain management in the general practitioner's office&E-referral: a multidisciplinary expert opinion [^112iEk2w]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The algorithm suggested by experts regarding the early management of acute or acute-on-chronic MP is resumed in Figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm on the early management of acute or acute-on-chronic MP.

As first step, the GP must carry out an anamnestic evaluation (pain at night or at rest, specific irradiation, trauma, non-response to first-line drug therapy, indicators of the likelihood of becoming chronic, including contextual factors, patient's history, age, working, and social conditions), also by means of phone or web contact. If red flags are identified (eg, trauma, infection, neurologic disease), e-referral or in-person referral are necessary. On the contrary, while awaiting the appointment, the patient should be advised with behavioral indications and can start pain killers. Paracetamol is firstly indicated as a safe and versatile choice, also possibly in association with other drugs (NSAIDs or steroids) depending on the type of pain, the patient's response and comorbidities. Therapeutic exercise, physical therapies (such as heat therapy) and postural education are also an integral part of the treatment. The doctor should provide practical advice to the patient on how to manage pain at home. It is important to educate patients on the importance of movement and appropriate drug treatment.

### Enhancing X-ray orders by utilizing proper physical examination and applying clinical guidelines [^115a2k5x]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Many pediatric injuries can be diagnosed with one radiograph. Because of health care costs and radiation risks, provider prudence while ordering radiographs is crucial. Although clinical guidelines like Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) and Ottawa Knee Rules (OKR) exist, the decision to order radiographs often bypasses clinical judgment. The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of the radiographic practices of providers.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort of 179 pediatric patients with an extremity injury. Detailed chart review was performed on patients regarding demographics, HPI, physical exam, radiographs, and follow-up. Primary outcomes included radiographs and their relationship to the physical examination. Specifically, knee, ankle, and foot complaints were examined in relation to OAR and OKR. Predictor variables included age, sex, ordering provider, and location of presentation.

Results

At least one set of unnecessary radiographs was performed in 139 (86.3%) of 161 patients with documentation of physical examination. Decreased age was significantly associated with outcomes: unnecessary knee and foot radiographs per OAR and OKR, having completely negative radiographs, having unnecessary radiographs performed, and having zero radiographs indicated. Increased age was correlated with an increase in unnecessary radiographs ordered. Neither provider type nor location of triage showed significant outcomes.

Conclusions

There is a significant number of patients that are not receiving a proper screening before radiographic orders. Providers should return to physical examination and the utilization of clinical guidelines to best serve their patients, while understanding some of the ways that age may negatively impact their habits.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^117STTiE]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

A more recent successful approach was an Australia‐wide factorial cluster trial of individualized audit and feedback targeting top requestors of 11 commonly overused musculoskeletal diagnostic imaging tests. This significantly decreased the rate of imaging requested over 6, 12, and 18 months compared with no audit and feedback. Further study of this relatively simple, low cost, and easily scalable intervention targeting clinicians to reduce overused diagnostic imaging tests is warranted.

We examined imaging requested by GPs in a large sample of people with regional musculoskeletal complaints that are broadly representative of the wider population, which is a study strength. Another strength was that we were able to capture all imaging requests irrespective of whether or not they would attract a government subsidy, whereas Medicare statistics are only able to capture tests that receive a government subsidy. Limitations of our study include that we do not know how many patients received imaging because the POLAR dataset did not include these data. We also could not determine the clinical appropriateness of the imaging requested. Our estimates of the patients receiving imaging requests are likely to be an undercount because we did not include an entire year of follow‐up for patients diagnosed in 2018. We excluded younger adults (< 45 years) with knee, shoulder, and neck complaints as well. Nonaccredited, corporate‐owned general practices and those without EMRs are also likely underrepresented, and our findings may not be generalizable to them. Further, there may be some variability in our estimates of the timing of imaging requests because GPs may record a diagnosis at the first presentation or at a later visit when the diagnosis is confirmed. We also assumed that the imaging request was related to the diagnosis. Although it is possible that an imaging test could be requested for another reason, it is unlikely their frequency would be sufficient to alter our results. Similarly, it is unlikely exclusion of a small proportion of general practices because of inconsistent activity recording (11%) or uncoded tests (< 5%) would have substantially altered our findings.

GPs frequently request diagnostic imaging for people with regional musculoskeletal complaints, and this most commonly occurs simultaneously with the diagnosis. It is likely a substantial proportion of requests are discordant with evidence‐based practice. Identification and testing of strategies that target patients, clinicians, and policy to improve appropriate use of imaging in people with musculoskeletal complaints is urgently needed.

RESULTS

Study cohort

Our eligible study cohort (133,279 patients, 4,538 GPs, and 269 general practices) has been described previously. More than half the cohort were female (n = 73,428, 55%), and approximately two thirds had at least one comorbidity (n = 83,816, 63%). Mean (SD) age of the study cohort at diagnosis was 49.2 (18.5) years for those with low back complaints and 61.9 (12.0), 62.8 (11.8), and 64.2 (11.5) years for those with neck, shoulder, and knee complaints, respectively. Based on diagnostic codes, more than half (n = 76,504, 57%) had a low back complaint, a quarter (n = 33,438) had a knee complaint, a fifth (n = 26,335) had a shoulder complaint, and 11% (n = 14,492) had a neck complaint. This includes one tenth (n = 15,176, 11%) of the cohort who had multiple body regions affected by an eligible musculoskeletal complaint.

### The diagnostic test accuracy of bone sound conduction testing for the diagnosis of fractures of the upper and lower limbs and ribcage [^115evDA1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

To reduce radiation exposure and cut costs, some clinical diagnostic tests have been proposed to rule out fractures, such as the Ottawa Ankle Rules and Ottawa Knee Rules, thus reducing the demand for imaging. These clinical decision rules are of another utility that lies in being independent of electricity and X‐ray devices, and thus being useful in situations or areas without access to either. However, these clinical decision rules are limited to injuries of the ankle or knee, and, therefore, only applicable in a fraction of cases. Bone sound conduction testing (BSCT) has a longer history than the Ottawa Knee or Ankle Rules and aims to provide a more comprehensive and accessible diagnostic tool. BSCT was described as early as 1840 by American physicians Cammann and Clark to identify the outline of internal organs and detect the presence of fractures and called auscultatory percussion. In 1878, German surgeon Carl Hueter published another formal description of the index test and named it osteophony.

Despite its long history, only insufficient systematic reviews have evaluated the diagnostic test accuracy of the index test. One 2012 systematic review and meta‐analysis of clinical tests of the hip evaluated BSCT and showed promising results; however, it only included studies conducted on the hip joint. Another systematic review of tests for the hip showed promising results for the use of this test, but only in the context of occult hip fractures. Thus, an overarching review of all modes of applying BSCT is necessary.

Target condition being diagnosed

There are many different types of fractures, so to reduce complexity, we will differentiate between complete and incomplete fractures in accordance with the assumed mechanism of the test. Complete fractures completely interrupt the bone continuity along a fracture line, whereas incomplete fractures partially interrupt bone continuity along a fracture line, but the fractured parts remain connected by an intact portion of bone.

Important subclassification categories of complete fractures depend on the orientation of the fracture line and whether the fracture fragments are displaced or not.

Fracture types classified according to orientation of the fracture line are shown below.

Fractures can also be classified according to displacement.

### A randomized trial of physical therapy for meniscal tear and knee pain [^114qBFBJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Physical therapy is routinely recommended for knee pain attributed to a degenerative meniscal tear, but its efficacy has not been established.

Methods

We randomly assigned participants 45 to 85 years of age with knee pain, osteoarthritis, and meniscal tear to one of four groups: home exercise (3-month home-exercise program), home exercise plus text messages to encourage exercise adherence, home exercise plus text messages plus sham physical therapy (in-clinic sham manual therapy and sham ultrasound therapy), and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy (supervised strengthening, functional, and stretching exercises and manual therapy). The primary outcome was the change in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscore (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain) between baseline and 3 months, with adjustment for trial site, baseline KOOS pain subscore, and radiographic grade.

Results

A total of 879 participants underwent randomization (mean [± SD] age, 59.2 ± 7.8 years). The difference in the 3-month change in the KOOS pain subscore between home exercise and home exercise plus text messages was -0.1 points (98.3% confidence interval, -3.8 to 3.7) and between home exercise and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy was 2.5 points (98.3% CI, -1.3 to 6.2); the difference between home exercise plus text messages and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy was 2.5 points (98.3% CI, -1.4 to 6.5). Adverse events were generally nonserious and evenly distributed overall across groups.

Conclusions

For patients with degenerative meniscal tear and knee pain, the addition of physical therapy or text messages to encourage adherence to home exercises was not superior in reducing pain to a home-exercise program alone.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^114Bz4cs]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diagnostic imaging for the majority of people with nonspecific regional musculoskeletal complaints has limited value. First, degenerative findings are common in asymptomatic people and increase with age. For example, a systematic review including 33 studies (n = 3,110) found vertebral disc degeneration is present in approximately 37% and 96% of asymptomatic 20‐ and 80‐year‐olds, respectively. Similarly, other reviews have found knee osteophytes and rotator cuff abnormalities are seen in imaging of asymptomatic people, more commonly in those with increasing age. Second, because imaging abnormalities are so common in asymptomatic people, their clinical relevance in symptomatic individuals is questionable. For example, two recent longitudinal studies, one based on lumbar spine x‐ray and the other on MRI, reported no association between degenerative findings and current or future back pain. Finally, evidence suggests patient‐reported outcomes such as pain and function do not improve in patients who receive imaging compared with those who do not.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

This study presents data from a large sample of people with regional musculoskeletal complaints that are broadly representative of the wider population using routinely collected data.
We observed general practitioners commonly request early diagnostic imaging for musculoskeletal complaints and a trend toward more complex imaging for neck and low back complaints.
These findings are at odds with recommended practice.
Multifaceted strategies to improve appropriate imaging requests for people with musculoskeletal complaints are urgently needed.

For these reasons, clinical care standards and clinical practice guidelines discourage imaging for regional musculoskeletal complaints unless serious pathology is suspected, there is an unsatisfactory response to conservative care, and/or imaging is likely to change management. In addition, Choosing Wisely recommendations such as "do not undertake imaging for low back pain for patients without indications of an underlying serious condition" and "do not request shoulder ultrasound to diagnose nonspecific shoulder pain which on clinical evaluation is suggestive of rotator cuff pathology and in which surgery is not planned" have been developed as part of a global campaign encouraging conversations about reducing unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures.

Timing of diagnostic imaging requests

Almost a third (n = 22,571, 30%) of eligible imaging requests were made within the 2‐week period before diagnosis (Supplementary Figure 1). The median timing was on the same day as the diagnosis except for shoulder MRI, knee CT, and low back MRI, which were all requested at a later time (median [IQR] days: 42 [2–147], 11 [0–73], and 3 [−1 to 60]) (Figure 2).

Association between diagnostic imaging and patient‐ and practice‐related characteristics

Body region was the strongest predictor of diagnostic imaging requests (Table 2). Compared with patients with knee complaints, the odds of receiving any imaging request were 49% (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.49–0.52) and 31% (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.66–0.73) lower for patients with low back and neck complaints, respectively, and 56% higher (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.50–1.62) for those with shoulder complaints. Compared with patients with knee complaints, those with shoulder complaints were 86% less likely (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.13–0.15) to receive an x‐ray request than those with knee complaints but were 11 times more likely (OR 11.33, 95% CI 10.23–12.56) to receive an ultrasound request.

### Denosumab (Bildyos) [^117UgjzF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures

Atypical low energy or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents.

Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral, and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture.

During Bildyos treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Bildyos therapy should be considered, pending a benefit-risk assessment, on an individual basis.

5.6 Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Discontinuation of Treatment

Following discontinuation of denosumab treatment, fracture risk increases, including the risk of multiple vertebral fractures. Treatment with denosumab results in significant suppression of bone turnover and cessation of denosumab treatment results in increased bone turnover above pretreatment values 9 months after the last dose of denosumab. Bone turnover then returns to pretreatment values 24 months after the last dose of denosumab. In addition, bone mineral density (BMD) returns to pretreatment values within 18 months after the last injection [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

New vertebral fractures occurred as early as 7 months (on average 19 months) after the last dose of denosumab. Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab discontinuation. Evaluate an individual's benefit-risk before initiating treatment with Bildyos.

If Bildyos treatment is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to an alternative antiresorptive therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Diclofenac (Diclofenac sodium) [^1171Ui93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

For relief of the pain of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee(s), the recommended dose is 40 mg of diclofenac sodium (2 pump actuations) on each painful knee, 2 times a day.

Apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to clean, dry skin.

The pump must be primed before first use. Instruct patients to fully depress the pump mechanism (actuation) 4 times while holding the bottle in an upright position. This portion should be discarded to ensure proper priming of the pump. No further priming of the bottle should be required.

After the priming procedure, diclofenac sodium topical solution is properly dispensed by completely depressing the pump 2 times to achieve the prescribed dosage for one knee. Deliver the product directly into the palm of the hand and then apply evenly around front, back, and sides of the knee.

Application of diclofenac sodium topical solution in an amount exceeding or less than the recommended dose has not been studied and is therefore not recommended.

2.2 Special Precautions

- Avoid showering/bathing for at least 30 minutes after the application of diclofenac sodium topical solution to the treated knee.

- Wash and dry hands after use.

- Do not apply diclofenac sodium topical solution to open wounds.

- Avoid contact of diclofenac sodium topical solution with eyes and mucous membranes.

- Do not apply external heat and/or occlusive dressings to treated knees.

- Avoid wearing clothing over the diclofenac sodium topical solution -treated knee(s) until the treated knee is dry.

- Protect the treated knee(s) from natural and artificial sunlight.

- Wait until the treated area is dry before applying sunscreen, insect repellant, lotion, moisturizer, cosmetics, or other topical medication to the same knee you have just treated with diclofenac sodium topical solution.

- Until the treated knee(s) is completely dry, avoid skin-to-skin contact between other people and the treated knee(s).

- Do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium topical solution and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.

5.6 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures

Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are traverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.

Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone) at the time of fracture.

Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.

5.7 Renal Impairment

Risedronate sodium tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min).

5.8 Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Before initiating risedronate sodium tablets treatment for the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the sex steroid hormonal status of both men and women should be ascertained and appropriate replacement considered.

5.9 Laboratory Test Interactions

Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents. Specific studies with risedronate sodium tablets have not been performed.

### Bupivacaine and meloxicam (Zynrelef) [^1124s71t]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions Reported in Phase 3 and 2b Placebo-controlled Trials

Three randomized, bupivacaine-controlled and saline placebo-controlled studies were conducted in patients undergoing bunionectomy (STUDY 1, Table 1 and Table 2), open inguinal herniorrhaphy (STUDY 2, Table 3), and total knee arthroplasty (STUDY 3, Table 4). The bunionectomy procedures in STUDY 1 were performed under regional anesthesia, a lidocaine Mayo block, and intravenous sedation. The herniorrhaphy procedures in STUDY 2 were performed under general anesthesia. The total knee arthroplasty procedures in STUDY 3 were performed under either general or spinal anesthesia. Patients in STUDY 1 and STUDY 2 were allowed opioid rescue with intravenous (IV) morphine and oral oxycodone, and/or non-opioid rescue with oral acetaminophen. Patients in STUDY 3 were pretreated with oral pregabalin and acetaminophen, and allowed opioid rescue with IV morphine and oral oxycodone postoperatively.

In STUDY 1, bone healing was assessed by X-ray on Days 28 and 42. There was no clinically meaningful difference in bone healing between treatment groups. A total of 4 subjects had delayed bone healing: 1 in the ZYNRELEF group, 1 in the saline placebo group, and 2 in the bupivacaine HCl group.

The incidence of local inflammatory adverse events was higher in the ZYNRELEF group than in either control group (Table 2).

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ZYNRELEF or other products containing NSAIDs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

ZYNRELEF

Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: Wound necrosis, Wound dehiscence.

Surgical and Medical Procedures: Post-procedural drainage.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^111btvXW]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study of routine Australian general practice based upon longitudinal consultation data indicates that GPs frequently request diagnostic imaging for people with regional musculoskeletal complaints, and this most commonly occurs at the time the diagnosis is made. Although we observed no change in overall imaging rates over the 5‐year study period, there was a trend toward more complex imaging requests in patients with neck and low back complaints. Diagnostic imaging modality varied by musculoskeletal complaint and, to a lesser extent, by patient socioeconomic status and gender and practice location. We also observed that over 1 in 10 people with a shoulder complaint had at least one image‐guided procedure.

Our findings are broadly consistent with previous studies. Previous estimates of imaging request rates by Australian GPs have varied between 33% and 43% for shoulder complaints, 25% and 36% for knee complaints, and 15% and 24% for patients with low back complaints. Another study found 23% (95% CI 21–24%) of patients with a first visit for neck pain had imaging requested. The slightly lower rates compared with our study is likely because these studies reported point prevalence rates from a single consultation, whereas our study measured cumulative imaging request rates over the course of 1 year.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^113qeLTu]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Imaging requests

Over one‐third (n = 49,174, 37%) of the cohort had at least one eligible imaging request (diagnostic or procedural) within the eligible study period. There were 76,249 imaging requests overall, with a median (IQR) of 1 requests per patient.

Imaging requests varied by musculoskeletal complaint. From the 2 weeks before the index diagnosis to 1 year after diagnosis, patients with a shoulder complaint had diagnostic imaging requested most commonly (n = 12,959, 49% patients), followed by knee (n = 14,405, 43%), neck (n = 4,871, 34%), and low back complaints (n = 19,545, 26%) (Table 1). Ultrasound (n = 12,329, 57% requests) and x‐ray (n = 8,718, 40%) were the most frequently requested modality for shoulder complaints, x‐rays for knee complaints (n = 13,879, 62%), CT for low back complaints (n = 11,160, 50%), and MRI (n = 2,064, 37%) and x‐ray (n = 1,960, 36%) were most frequently requested for neck complaints. Over 1 in 10 patients with a shoulder complaint had at least one image‐guided procedure requested compared with less than 1% of patients with low back, neck, and knee complaints. There were 500 requests for shoulder hydrodilatation among 445 (2%) patients with a shoulder complaint.

Many patients had requests for more than one type of diagnostic imaging (n = 6254, 48% patients with at least one shoulder imaging request; n = 3419, 24% for knee; n = 1856, 9% for low back; and n = 504, 10% for neck complaints). The most frequent combinations were shoulder x‐ray and ultrasound (n = 5,856, 45% patients with at least one imaging request), knee x‐ray and either MRI (n = 1,521, 11%) or ultrasound (n = 1,333, 9%), and low back x‐ray and CT (n = 1,070, 5%) (Figure 1).

### Denosumab (bilprevda) [^115So8PB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture

Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with denosumab products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.

Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.

During Bilprevda treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of Bilprevda therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.

5.6 Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons

Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in denosumab product-treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons. Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation. After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, assess serum calcium periodically, reevaluate the patient's calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and manage patients as clinically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

5.7 Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation

Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab products. Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures.

When Bilprevda treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient's risk for vertebral fractures [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^116cnjji]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine imaging requested by general practitioners (GPs) for patients with low back, neck, shoulder, and knee complaints over 5 years (2014–2018).

Methods

This analysis from the Australian Population Level Analysis and Reporting database included patients presenting with a diagnosis of low back, neck, shoulder, and/or knee complaints. Eligible imaging requests included low back and neck x‐ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); knee x‐ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound; and shoulder x‐ray, MRI, and ultrasound. We determined number of imaging requests and examined their timing, associated factors, and trends over time. Primary analysis included imaging requests from 2 weeks before diagnosis to 1 year after diagnosis.

Results

There were 133,279 patients (57% low back, 25% knee, 20% shoulder, and 11% neck complaints). Imaging was most common among those with a shoulder (49%) complaint, followed by knee (43%), neck (34%), and low back complaints (26%). Most requests occurred simultaneously with the diagnosis. Imaging modality varied by body region and, to a lesser extent, by gender, socioeconomic status, and primary health network. For low back, there was a 1.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.0–1.6) annual increase in proportion of MRI and a concomitant 1.3% (95% CI 0.8–1.8) decrease in CT requests. For neck, there was a 3.0% (95% CI 2.1–3.9) annual increase in proportion of MRI and a concomitant 3.1% (95% CI 2.2–4.0) decrease in x‐ray requests.

Conclusion

GPs commonly request early diagnostic imaging for musculoskeletal complaints at odds with recommended practice. We observed a trend towards more complex imaging for neck and back complaints.

### No difference in ACL revision rates between hamstring and patellar tendon autograft in patients with ACL-R and a concurrent meniscal injury irrespective of meniscal treatment [^1146H9K5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Subjective knee function

The goal following ACL‐R is to attain a satisfactory knee function. A meta‐analysis comparing outcomes between HT and PT autografts reported no significant differences in PROMs. Another systematic review reported that HT autograft and the absence of concurrent injuries, such as meniscal injuries, were associated with superior PROMs after ACL‐R. In the present study, patients who underwent ACL‐R treated with HT autograft and concurrent meniscal resection achieved a significantly greater rate of PASS in the KOOS‐P subscale than the corresponding group with PT autograft. This was observed at the 1 (48.9% vs. 32.3%), 2 (53.0% vs. 39.8%) and 5‐year follow‐up (57.1% vs. 43.0%). Previous studies have reported a greater prevalence of anterior knee pain associated with PT autografts, which may have potentially contributed to the inferior PASS rate for KOOS‐P among patients treated with PT autografts compared with patients with HT autografts. However, differences in achieving PASS in terms of the KOOS‐P were mainly noticeable between graft selection among patients treated with meniscal resection. Furthermore, patients with ACL‐R using an HT autograft and concurrent meniscal resection achieved a PASS in the Sport/Rec subscale to a greater extent than patients with PT autografts and meniscal resection at 1 (50.8% vs. 28.0%), 2 (53.0% vs. 40.9%) and 5 years (55.6% vs 39.8%). Interestingly, the significantly lower rates of achieving PASS in KOOS‐SR were not observed in patients with ACL‐R treated with PT autograft and meniscal repair compared with patients treated with HT autograft and meniscal repair. Meniscal resection has previously been associated with inferior PROMs, reduced activity levels and increased rate of postoperative knee osteoarthritis compared to meniscal repair. The use of the PT autograft has also been related to knee extensor strength deficit compared with HT autografts, and being symmetrical in knee extensor strength has been associated with the achievement of PASS in KOOS subscales and may reduce the odds of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Data suggest that initial signs of knee osteoarthritis, such as bone marrow, cartilage and meniscal lesions, and osteophytes, may manifest as early as one year after ACL‐R in individuals who return to sport prematurely with compromised lower limb function. However, whether our cohort exhibited early signs of knee osteoarthritis at 1 and 2 years, impacting their pain and activity levels, is unknown. The reasons behind the lower proportion of patients treated with PT autograft and meniscal resection or untreated meniscal injury achieving PASS in KOOS‐P and KOOS‐SR — whether due to anterior knee pain, diminished knee extensor strength, early onset of knee osteoarthritis or other causes — remain elusive and requires further investigation.

### Excellent results of restricted kinematic alignment total knee arthroplasty at a minimum of 10 years of follow-up [^1143rF6M]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

The number of patients who completed the PROMs or radiographic evaluation at the last follow‐up was affected by the 13.5% death rate (causes unrelated to the TKA). Additionally, other medical conditions, as well as refusal to come for an in‐person visit, reduced even further the number of patients available for PROMs (64 knees, 62%) and radiographic evaluation (62 knees, 60%). However, regarding our primary outcome, implant survivorship, at the last follow‐up, the information is missing only for 2% of the cases. The results of the current study should be taken with caution, as they represent the first 104 cases of rKA by a single surgeon using a specific implant and computer navigation system; thus, the results may not be generalizable. Moreover, the limited number of cases would only allow the detection of a significant statistical difference of 10% in a comparative study with MA cases (with an alpha error of 5% and a power of 80%). However, the patients in this study represent a continuous series of cases performed in an academic centre using very few exclusion criteria. Therefore, we expect them to correspond to the general spectrum of patients needing TKA.

Overall, this study's results support the clinical values and safety of the rKA protocol proposed by Vendittoli. As most cases were within the rKA boundaries, anatomical modifications were performed only for deviant cases (8% of tibias and femurs were outside rKA boundaries). Related soft tissue releases to restore ligament balance were required in only five cases (5%). Avoiding reproducing deviant anatomies might be protective for some specific KA complications like patellofemoral problems. As a stepwise transition from MA to a more personalized procedure, rKA represents a valuable and safe alternative to MA. According to implant material and fixation method performances, future research should define the real boundaries if there are some needed. Furthermore, apart from the frontal plane measurements, the decisional algorithm should include a sagittal and axial plane analysis.

### Long-term outcomes and determinants of new-onset mental health conditions after trauma [^113p2U9U]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Injury accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The cost of care for traumatic injuries is staggering. The development of trauma systems and designated trauma centers has been proven to save lives of patients who would have died without advanced trauma care. Nonetheless, recent evidence suggests that trauma mortality and morbidities may follow a multiphasic pattern, with increasing number of survivors experiencing long-term morbidities after hospital discharge.

Trauma most commonly affects young persons with few preexisting diseases; yet, the results from previous studies, have shown that severely injured patients have a higher cumulative mortality in the years following the initial trauma admission. Many of the severely injured patients sustain trauma involving several body systems. They are at risk of developing long-term physical, mental, and psychological disabilities after their trauma admission. Previous studies, have described adverse consequences, including the inability to return to previous levels of activity or employment and delayed mortality due to long-term complications of trauma, a second episode of major trauma, or suicides.

The mental health issues following trauma are not limited to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Other mental health conditions, such as suicidality, depression, and substance abuse, have also been reported as sequelae of trauma. The Victoria State Trauma Registry in Australia reported on 2757 adult patients with trauma and found that 50% of the survivors experienced ongoing pain or discomfort, and 41% had symptoms of anxiety or depression 3 years after their injuries. Although long-term health sequelae of trauma are common and substantial, most trauma hospitals and registries currently do not track patients' trajectories after trauma hospitalizations, and longitudinal studies of the long-term health outcomes of seriously injured people are sparse. A 2018 Canadian studyin Ontario with 19 338 patients examined mental health outcomes within 5 years following trauma and found that the survivors of major trauma were at a heightened risk of developing mental health conditions or death by suicide in the years after their injury. Maximizing long-term outcomes, based on data from longitudinal studies, including identifying which groups may benefit the most from intervention after trauma center discharge, is considered the next important challenge that trauma centers must face.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^114kh1cq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — clinicians should perform digital palpation of the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) transrectally in men to identify tenderness suggesting a diagnosis of pelvic floor myalgia (Expert Opinion). Digital palpation for PFM tenderness can be easily adopted in clinical practice, and a pelvic examination that assesses for the presence of tenderness of the anterior levator ani muscle, posterior levator ani muscle, and obturator internus muscle through a transrectal approach, and the perineal body through an external palpation in men has been previously described; in men, the PFM can be palpated through the rectum in the usual prostate examination position with the patient bending over facing down or lying laterally with the knees bent, with the standardized examination template depicted in Figure 3.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1121YYxQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Dosing interval adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.

5.3 Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV

Due to the risk of development of HIV-1 resistance, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be used in HIV-1 and HBV coinfected patients as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen.

HIV-1 antibody testing should be offered to all HBV-infected patients before initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. It is also recommended that all patients with HIV-1 be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^114g9GzR]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these recommendations, there is evidence that imaging rates for musculoskeletal complaints have increased over time. For example, a systematic review including 27 studies found a 53.5% increase in complex imaging requested for low back pain over 21 years from 1995–2015. In Australia, the likelihood of general practitioner (GP)–requested imaging tests increased by 9% from one period between 2002 and 2005 to a second period between 2009 and 2012 for patients with shoulder and knee complaints. Similarly, the likelihood of GP‐requested CT scans for patients with neck complaints more than doubled from 2.6%–5.9% during the same time periods.

Monitoring imaging trends over time is important to ensure the provision of high‐quality care. However, in Australia, previous studies seeking to understand imaging requests in primary care have relied on data from the Medicare Benefits Schedule or cross‐sectional databases such as the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health dataset, which cannot evaluate changes in GP imaging requests over time for people with specific conditions.

General practice databases using routinely collected data from electronic medical records (EMRs) provide an efficient way of examining imaging requests over time. To our knowledge, these databases have not yet been used to examine patterns of care over time for people with musculoskeletal complaints. The objective of this study was to investigate the imaging requested by GPs for people with low back, neck, shoulder, and knee complaints using prospectively collected longitudinal data among general practices participating in the Population Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) database. It specifically examined the proportion of patients with imaging requests, imaging modalities, timing of diagnostic imaging requests, associated factors, and changes in diagnostic imaging requests over a 5‐year study period. This study forms part of a larger project that has examined patterns of care for people with musculoskeletal complaints provided also including GP consultations, referrals to other health care providers, and prescriptions for pain relief.

### Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate [^113ZL66r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17	PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use)

Somnolence: Somnolence has been reported in some patients (8 of 1,269 patients) taking azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in controlled clinical trials. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Concurrent Use of Alcohol and other Central Nervous System Depressants: Advise patients to avoid concurrent use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Local Nasal Effects: Nasal corticosteroids are associated with epistaxis, nasal ulceration, nasal septal perforation, Candida albicans infection and impaired wound healing. Patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Outcomes and characteristics differ between homeless and housed trauma patients following the COVID-19 pandemic [^116KMCDq]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Americans experiencing homelessness are uniquely vulnerable to traumatic injuries and morbidity. Despite a high and increasing number of persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), American researchers have not comprehensively described the impact of this social problem on trauma patients in recent years.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons TQIP 2021–2022 data. We performed descriptive statistics and multivariable modeling to test for differences in clinical characteristics and discharge dispositions between adult trauma patients experiencing homelessness (n = 20,692) and housed trauma patients (n = 1,927,159).

Results

Trauma patients experiencing homelessness are more likely to be male, younger, and belong to different racial / ethnic groups. Homeless trauma patients have 37% longer hospital stays than housed trauma patients and are more likely to experience an assault (adjusted OR: 2.92) or self-inflicted injury (adjusted OR: 1.50) and less likely to experience an unintentional injury (adjusted OR: 0.33). Homeless trauma patients' mechanisms of injury differ from those of housed trauma patients. They are similarly likely to have an ISS score of 12 or higher (adjusted OR: 1.01). They are slightly less likely to experience in-hospital mortality than housed trauma patients (adjusted OR: 0.85). They are more likely to be discharged to court or law enforcement (adjusted OR: 1.89); to a psychiatric facility or unit (adjusted OR: 2.99); leave against medical advice (adjusted OR: 3.89); or to a skilled nursing facility (adjusted OR: 2.01) than housed trauma patients. They are less likely to be discharged to inpatient rehab or home health than housed trauma patients.

Conclusions

This study describes differences in injury outcomes and clinical characteristics affecting homeless trauma patients compared to housed trauma patients since the COVID-19 pandemic, such as longer lengths of hospital stay, greater propensity to have violent injuries, and different discharge dispositions.

### Similar fixation of total knee arthroplasty components with medial congruent and cruciate retaining polyethylene inserts. A randomised double-blinded controlled radiostereometry trial with 24 months of follow-up [^113aLvot]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical procedure

All procedures were performed by three experienced knee arthroplasty surgeons using a standardised technique with an anterior midline incision and a medial parapatellar arthrotomy. Surgery followed the manufacturer's guidelines with a proximal tibial resection aligned with the patient's native tibial slope, using mechanical alignment principles and a 7‐degree cutting guide. All patients received a CR femoral implant and a tibial component paired with either an MC or CR polyethylene insert. Patella resurfacing with all polyethylene patella implants was used in all patients. All components were cemented. Due to a departmental product transition during the study period, unintendedly three different cement types were used. Refobacin‐Optipac® bone cement (Zimmer Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) in 44 patients, Palacos‐closed bone cement (PALACOS® R + G, Heraeus Medical GmbH, Weirheim, Germany) in nine, and Palacos‐open (PALACOS® MV, Heraeus Medical GmbH, Weirheim, Germany) in thirteen. A minimum of six tantalum bone markers were inserted in both the femoral and tibial bone during surgery (Figure 3). Postoperative rehabilitation and discharge followed standard clinical protocols.

The tantalum beads are marked on the RSA images (red) with connected lines (black). Their 3D representations (red) are illustrated centrally.

Radiostereometric analysis (RSA)

The study was conducted per the RSA guidelines. Baseline RSA images were obtained supine on the first postoperative day (after allowance of full weight bearing) and the operated knee secured in a foam positioner. Follow‐up RSA images were captured at 3‐, 12‐, and 24 months. The RSA setup utilised a direct digital synchronised radiostereometric system (AdoraRSA suite, NRT X‐RAY A/S, Hasselager, Denmark) equipped with digital static CXDI‐70C detectors (Canon, Tokyo, Japan). The X‐ray tubes were positioned at a 40‐degree angle, and a uniplanar carbon calibration box (Box 19 Medis Specials, Leiden, The Netherlands) was used for all recordings.

### Poor knee strength is associated with higher incidence of knee injury in adolescent female football players: the karolinska football injury cohort [^117NgQzo]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the limitations is the risk of non‐differential misclassification of exposure and outcomes. When classifying the ROM measures in tertiles and comparing the highest tertile with the lowest, a potential U‐shaped association may be overlooked. However, comparisons of all three tertiles in Table 4 show that no clear U‐shaped associations were present. In addition, strength and ROM may be misclassified due to the young age of the players. Further, there is a risk of non‐differential misclassification of the outcome when our young players answered the OSTRC‐O questionnaire. The extensive questionnaires used in this study and the frequent follow‐up surveys posed a risk of misclassifying outcomes and confounders, particularly given the young age of the participants. However, because the potential misclassification of exposures and outcomes is probably non‐differential, the risk for bias was considered low. The baseline tests were performed at different time points during the year, and players' strengths may vary over the season. However, the unexposed are compared at the same time point regarding the risk of injury in the longitudinal design. Using the OSTRC‐O questionnaire, the incidence of specific knee injuries could not be established. Detailed information about knee injuries was missing for 16 of the 71 (23%) knee injuries; however, the aim of this study was not to investigate risk factors for specific knee injuries. The data are player‐reported, introducing uncertainty regarding the validity of injury and exposure data. To improve the validity, training and match exposure, and injuries, were reported weekly. The majority of studies examining potential risk factors for knee injuries in female football players have primarily concentrated on ACL injuries. However, ACL injury is a severe and relatively uncommon injury and comprises a part of the overall knee injury burden. Our purpose was to study player‐reported knee complaints leading to moderate, severe reduction in training volume and/or sports performance, or complete inability to participate in sport irrespective of the diagnosis. Different knee injuries and knee complaints may have different aetiologies and injury mechanisms. Various factors could be associated with different knee injuries and must be considered when interpreting the results. Therefore, this study does not inform about the association between the screening tests and the risk of specific knee injuries. Players with substantial knee injury at baseline were not included, but they could have had knee complaints at baseline that were not classified as substantial. Another limitation is that knee ROM, knee flexors and hip external rotation strength were not considered in this study.

### Pexidartinib hydrochloride (Turalio) [^113Svke9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) at Week 25 using RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures were mean change from baseline in range of motion of the affected joint at Week 25 and ORR as assessed by BICR at Week 25 using tumor volume score (TVS). Range of motion was measured as a percent of normal reference range for the affected joint. Range of motion assessments were performed by a third-party clinical assessor using a goniometer. TVS was defined in ENLIVEN as the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved, measured in 10% increments. Patients in the placebo arm were offered TURALIO at Week 25 beginning with a 400 mg twice daily dose, as permitted by the study protocol.

A total of 120 patients were randomized, 61 to the TURALIO arm and 59 to the placebo arm. The median age was 44 years (range: 18–79); 59% were females; 88% were White; 53% had prior surgery; 88% were diagnosed with diffuse TGCT; and 9% had previously been treated with systemic therapy. Disease locations were knee (61%), ankle (18%), hip (11%), wrist (3%), foot (3%) and other (5%).

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^113Le5wV]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Urethral catheter placement in trauma — caution and consultation guidance explains that indwelling urinary catheters are commonly used to monitor urine output and guide resuscitation. The presence of gross hematuria or blood at the urethral meatus may suggest the presence of GU trauma, but the absence of these findings does not entirely rule out these injuries. When a urethral injury is present, blind placement of an indwelling urinary catheter may result in the creation of a false passage or complicate existing urethral tears; a best practice is to perform a bedside RUG before placing an indwelling urinary catheter when the index of suspicion of a urethral injury is very high. In situations where a catheter is needed and imaging not readily available, a single attempt at indwelling urinary catheter placement by an experienced trauma team member may be appropriate, only limited data exist to suggest that this will worsen any potential injuries; otherwise, urological consultation is advised, and urological consultation is also advised when a urethral injury is suspected in a trauma patient with female anatomy.

### Sulindac [^115rQPHX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Special Populations

Pediatric

The pharmacokinetics of sulindac have not been investigated in pediatric patients.

Race

Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified.

Hepatic Insufficiency

Patients with acute and chronic hepatic disease may require reduced doses of sulindac tablets compared to patients with normal hepatic function since hepatic metabolism is an important elimination pathway.

Following a single dose, plasma concentrations of the active sulfide metabolite have been reported to be higher in patients with alcoholic liver disease compared to healthy normal subjects.

Renal Insufficiency

Sulindac pharmacokinetics have been investigated in patients with renal insufficiency. The disposition of sulindac was studied in end-stage renal disease patients requiring hemodialysis. Plasma concentrations of sulindac and its sulfone metabolite were comparable to those of normal healthy volunteers whereas concentrations of the active sulfide metabolite were significantly reduced. Plasma protein binding was reduced and the AUC of the unbound sulfide metabolite was about half that in healthy subjects.

Sulindac and its metabolites are not significantly removed from the blood in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Since sulindac tablets are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, patients with significantly impaired renal function should be closely monitored.

A lower daily dosage should be anticipated to avoid excessive drug accumulation.

In controlled clinical studies sulindac tablets were evaluated in the following five conditions:

1.000000000000000e+00 Osteoarthritis

In patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of sulindac tablets was demonstrated by clinical measurements that included: assessments by both patient and investigator of overall response; decrease in disease activity as assessed by both patient and investigator; improvement in ARA Functional Class; relief of night pain; improvement in overall evaluation of pain, including pain on weight bearing and pain on active and passive motion; improvement in joint mobility, range of motion, and functional activities; decreased swelling and tenderness; and decreased duration of stiffness following prolonged inactivity.

In clinical studies in which dosages were adjusted according to patient needs, sulindac tablets 200 to 400 mg daily were shown to be comparable in effectiveness to aspirin 2400 to 4800 mg daily. Sulindac tablets were generally well tolerated, and patients on it had a lower overall incidence of total adverse effects, of milder gastrointestinal reactions, and of tinnitus than did patients on aspirin.

### Palovarotene (Sohonos) [^111eZtKw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Bone Safety

In clinical studies with SOHONOS, assessments of growth and bone safety in growing children included linear and knee height, femur and tibia length measured by Whole-Body Computed Tomography (WBCT), and hand/wrist and knee radiographs. Premature epiphyseal closure has been identified as an irreversible serious risk associated with SOHONOS treatment. Premature epiphyseal closure was observed as early as 6 months after initiating therapy with the majority occurring at or after 12 months. In SOHONOS treated subjects there was a trend of declining height Z-scores in adolescent subjects, potentially due to a loss of linear height and/or increasing spinal deformity. The long-term effects on final height in subjects with FOP treated with SOHONOS have not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitoring Recommendation

Prior to starting treatment with SOHONOS, all growing children should undergo baseline clinical and radiological assessments including but not limited to an assessment of skeletal maturity via hand/wrist and knee x-rays, standard growth curves and pubertal staging. Continued monitoring is recommended every 6–12 months until patients reach skeletal maturity (e.g., epiphyseal closure) or final adult height [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Five-step knee adjustment manipulation based on the 'muscle and bone balance' principle for treating knee osteoarthritis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^114DsiFy]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Locations

① Patellar tendon: From the patellar apex to the tibial tuberosity.

② Rectus femoris: At the junction of the middle and lower third of the line between the anterior superior iliac spine and the midpoint of the patellar base.

③ Vastus lateralis: At the lower third of the line between the anterior superior iliac spine and the lateral edge of the patellar base.

④ Vastus medialis: At the junction of the middle and lower third of the line between the anterior superior iliac spine and the medial edge of the patellar base.

⑤ Semimembranosus: At the junction of the middle and lower third of the line between the midpoint of the gluteal crease and the midpoint of the popliteal crease.

⑥ Semitendinosus: On the posterior medial side of the thigh, intersecting the line through the gluteal muscle and the midpoint of the popliteal crease at the junction of the middle and lower third.

⑦ Biceps femoris: On the posterior lateral side of the thigh, parallel to the semitendinosus muscle.

Operation Methods

① The participant assumes a prone position with the hip joint in neutral rotation and the knee joint fixed at 30 degrees of flexion using a brace. Meanwhile, measurements of the knee extensor group and patellar tendon are taken.

② An experienced sonographer with over 10 years of ultrasonography experience performs both gray-scale and elastic ultrasound on the patellar tendon and knee extensors. To ensure good contact between the probe and the skin, an adequate amount of gel will be used. Initially, a conventional two-dimensional ultrasound examination was conducted with a uniform depth setting of 3–4 cm. The patellar tendon and extensors will be scanned longitudinally along the tendon and muscle. Then, the elastography mode will be activated, and the rectangular region of interest will be set to the system's maximum size of 13.5×12.5 mm. When measuring the elastic modulus using the Q-box quantitative analysis system, the Q-box diameter will be adjusted according to the thickness of the tendon or muscle. The system automatically calculates the average, maximum, and minimum elastic modulus values (kPa) of the tendon and muscle within the Q-box region. The average elastic modulus will be selected for statistical analysis. For hamstring measurements, the participant remains in the prone position with the knee joint naturally extended. The ultrasound examination will be performed similarly to the prior measurements.

### Triamcinolone acetonide extended-release injectable suspension (Zilretta) [^1154FRvE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Triamcinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. It binds to and activates the glucocorticoid receptor, leading to activation of anti-inflammatory transcription factors such as lipocortins and inhibition of inflammatory transduction pathways by blocking the release of arachidonic acid and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Studies indicate that following a single intramuscular dose of 60 to 100 mg of immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, adrenal suppression occurs within 24 to 48 hours and then gradually returns to normal, usually in 30 to 40 days. To assess potential effects of the systemic levels of triamcinolone acetonide associated with a single intra-articular (IA) administration of ZILRETTA on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function, serum and urine cortisol levels were monitored over 6 weeks post injection. Adrenal suppression with ZILRETTA occurred within 12–24 hours and then gradually returned to normal, within 30–42 days.

Corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations.

In a study where 18 patients with osteoarthritis knee pain and controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus received a single IA injection of ZILRETTA into the knee, the change from baseline in average blood glucose over the 72 hours after injection as measured by a continuous glucose monitoring device was 8.2 mg/dL (95% confidence interval 0.1, 29.2).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

ZILRETTA is an extended-release dosage form consisting of microspheres of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) containing triamcinolone acetonide. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for triamcinolone acetonide following IA administration of ZILRETTA or 40 mg immediate-release triamcinolone acetonide into the knee are provided in Table 4.

### Electric scooter related injuries among children: a single institutional experience [^113zWJce]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Electric scooter (ES) injuries are common among children, accounting for approximately 3% of all trauma-related pediatric hospitalizations. The majority of affected patients were under 15 years of age, with a predominance of males and orthopedic injuries. Upper and lower limb fractures represented approximately half and one-third of orthopedic injuries, respectively. Not wearing a helmet was significantly associated with head trauma, with nearly half of those cases involving intracranial hemorrhage. Approximately 12% of patients required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, with a longer hospital stay compared to others. Half of the patients underwent surgical procedures, primarily orthopedic interventions. During the follow-up period, one-fifth of patients experienced sequelae. No clear trend in patient age or injury incidence was observed throughout the study period.

In recent years, ES-related injuries have increased exponentially. Most reports in the medical literature focus on adult cases, where the predominant injuries are facial and extremity fractures. One pediatric study evaluating the epidemiology of admitted ES injuries compared to adults found that children had a higher rate of fractures but fewer facial injuries, despite a similar incidence of head trauma. This study also identified helmet non-use as a key risk factor for pediatric head injuries, mirroring findings in adults. Our results align with these observations, with fractures accounting for over two-thirds of injuries and a significant association between head trauma and lack of helmet use. Additionally, our study documented a relatively low rate of facial injuries among children (5.8%).

In contrast to other studies, the present study did not observe an increasing trend in hospital admissions due to ES-related injuries over the study period. We hypothesize that recent traffic regulations introduced and updated in 2021 and 2024, respectively, may have contributed to this stabilization. These laws require ES riders to be at least 16 years old and mandate the use of protective equipment, including helmets.

The rate of polytrauma in our pediatric cohort (13.6%) was higher than previously reported in adults, where approximately 10% experienced multiple injuries related to ES use. This difference may be attributed to children's relative inexperience with motorized vehicles and reduced caution compared to adults. Similar findings have been reported in other pediatric study.

Despite age restrictions on ES riding in Israel, the mean age of participants in this study was under 16 years, consistent with national data and other reports in the literature.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (viread) [^111xcHzD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients with HBV Infection

All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating VIREAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Discontinuation of anti-HBV therapy, including VIREAD, may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue VIREAD should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.

5.2	New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment

Tenofovir is principally eliminated by the kidney. Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia), has been reported with the use of VIREAD [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Prior to initiation and during use of VIREAD, on a clinically appropriate schedule, assess serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, urine glucose, and urine protein in all patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, also assess serum phosphorus.

Dosing interval adjustment of VIREAD and close monitoring of renal function are recommended in all patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. No safety or efficacy data are available in patients with renal impairment who received VIREAD using these dosing guidelines, so the potential benefit of VIREAD therapy should be assessed against the potential risk of renal toxicity.

VIREAD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent (e.g., high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF. Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.

Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures and/or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction.

### Delafloxacin meglumine (Baxdela) [^117Lk3gY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Serious Adverse Reactions

Advise patients to stop taking BAXDELA if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider for advice on completing the full course of treatment with another antibacterial drug.

Inform patients of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with BAXDELA or other fluoroquinolone use:

Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions that may occur together: Inform patients that disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathies, and central nervous system effects, have been associated with use of fluoroquinolones and may occur together in the same patient. Inform patients to stop taking BAXDELA immediately if they experience an adverse reaction and to call their healthcare provider.
Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture: Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain, swelling, or inflammation of a tendon, or weakness or inability to use one of their joints; rest and refrain from exercise; and discontinue BAXDELA treatment. Symptoms may be irreversible. The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants.
Peripheral Neuropathy: Inform patients that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with BAXDELA use, symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible. If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness and/or weakness develop, immediately discontinue BAXDELA and tell them to contact their physician.
Central Nervous System Effects: (for example, convulsions, dizziness, lightheadedness, increased intracranial pressure): Inform patients that convulsions have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones. Instruct patients to notify their physician before taking this drug if they have a history of convulsions. Inform patients that they should know how they react to BAXDELA before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in other activities requiring mental alertness and coordination. Instruct patients to notify their physician if persistent headache with or without blurred vision occurs.
Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any history of myasthenia gravis. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, including respiratory difficulties.
Hypersensitivity Reactions: Inform patients that BAXDELA can cause hypersensitivity reactions, even following a single dose, and to discontinue BAXDELA at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (for example, swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.
Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection: Inform patients to seek emergency medical care if they experience sudden chest, stomach, or back pain.
Antibacterial Resistance: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including BAXDELA Tablets and Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by BAXDELA Tablets and BAXDELA Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Technology-assisted revision knee arthroplasty reduces radiographic outliers compared with standard revision knee surgery: a systematic review [^116skNaA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Initial searches on PROSPERO revealed no ongoing or completed systematic reviews on the designated topic. The current review was not listed on PROSPERO. A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, was conducted to identify relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were limited to published articles from inception to 31 March 2025. The combination of search terms and the research question employed to systematically retrieve pertinent studies can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The following search terms and Boolean operators were used: ((('total knee replacement' OR 'total knee arthroplasty' OR 'unicompartmental knee replacement' OR 'unicompartmental knee arthroplasty' OR 'partial knee replacement' OR 'partial knee arthroplasty' OR TKA OR TKR OR UKA) AND revision) AND (robot OR 'robotic assisted' OR 'robot assisted' OR navigation OR navigator OR mako OR rosa OR cori OR mazor OR velys OR navio OR excelsiusGPS OR skywalker OR computer OR 'computer assisted' OR CAS OR RA OR accelerometer)).

Eligibility criteria

The articles selected for inclusion in the report were further filtered based on the following eligibility criteria, as outlined in the PICO question (provided in Supporting Information S1). For inclusion, a study had to meet the following criteria: a randomised controlled trial or observational analysis involving more than 10 patients undergoing revision knee arthroplasty, evaluating clinical and/or radiological outcomes or complication rates. The exclusion criteria were in vitro studies, letters to the editor, previous systematic reviews, book chapters, conference papers, and studies for which the full text was not accessible. Revision arthroplasty was defined as any operation in which the femoral and/or tibial component was exchanged. Polyethylene exchange or secondary patellar resurfacing without component exchange was not considered relevant for this review.

Study selection

Initially, Zotero (Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, 2016) was employed to remove duplicate publications. Two independent reviewers conducted a thorough screening of references based on titles and abstracts. Full texts deemed eligible for inclusion were then acquired. Following the initial screening, the selected articles were further examined for relevant literature within their citation sections. In cases where the independent reviewers disagreed on whether to include or exclude a particular reference, a final decision was made by a senior author to resolve any discrepancies.

### Knee pain in adults and adolescents: the initial evaluation | AAFP… [^113sejqK]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

History When evaluating knee pain, key aspects of the patient history include age; location, onset, duration, and quality of pain; mechanical or systemic symptoms; history of swelling; description of any precipitating trauma; and pertinent previous medical or surgical procedures. Patients requiring urgent referral generally have severe pain, immediate swelling, and instability or inability to bear weight in association with acute trauma, which suggests fracture, dislocation, or tendon or ligamentous rupture. Referral is also indicated for possible joint infection signs such as fever, swelling, and erythema with limited range of motion. PAIN LOCATION Anterior. Isolated anterior knee pain suggests involvement of the patella, patellar tendon, or its attachments. Anterior knee pain that is dull or aching and exacerbated by prolonged sitting or climbing stairs is common in patellofemoral pain syndrome.

3, 18 Athletes or other adults with overuse from running or jumping sports can develop quadriceps or patellar tendinopathy. Medial or Lateral. Medial or lateral knee pain with corresponding joint-line tenderness can result from acute injury or chronic overuse and may indicate meniscal derangement or a sprain or rupture of a collateral ligament. 3, 18 Pes anserine bursitis is a common cause of medial knee pain instigated by overuse or blunt injury; the pain is exacerbated by flexion and extension of the knee. Adolescents experiencing medial knee pain with or without concurrent hip pain should be evaluated for slipped capital femoral epiphysis, caused by a fracture through the femoral physis. 26 Chronic lateral knee pain in runners or cyclists is a common presentation of iliotibial band syndrome.
3. Posterior.

Isolated posterior knee pain is less common but may occur from a symptomatic popliteal cyst. 3, 28 Posterior knee pain after acute trauma raises suspicion for injury of the posterior cruciate ligament and posterior portions of the meniscus, quadriceps tendons, or neurovascular structures. 28 Chronic posterior knee pain can suggest hamstring tendinopathy.
28. Diffuse. Chronic, diffuse knee pain in adults older than 50 years is commonly attributable to degenerative knee osteoarthritis, particularly when the pain is worse at the end of the day, is exacerbated by weight-bearing activity, and is relieved by rest. 20 Acute onset of diffuse atraumatic knee pain may indicate an infectious etiology, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis; the latter is especially suspected when the pain is bilateral or when it occurs simultaneously in other joints.

MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS Mechanical symptoms, such as locking, buckling, or catching, suggest internal derangement and possible instability but can also occur in medial plica syndrome 18. A popping sensation at the time of injury may occur in meniscal or ligamentous tears. A knee that is "locked" in flexion and that cannot be extended should be examined for a meniscal tear. 4, 14, 15. SWELLING If the patient has an acute injury, a knee joint effusion strongly suggests internal derangement. 14, 26 Swelling that occurs immediately after injury suggests a ligament rupture, intra-articular fracture, or patellar dislocation; swelling that appears within hours to a few days suggests a meniscal tear. 15, 19 Atraumatic swelling with erythema or palpable warmth implies gout or pseudogout, arthritic flare, or infection. Swelling that is limited to the borders of the patella suggests prepatellar bursitis. 4, 14, 15.

### A tool for evaluating patients with knee injury… [^1126KWWt]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old patient experiences sudden, severe pain in his left knee as he pivots on that leg to lift a couch up some stairs. He is able to ambulate initially but later develops locking relieved by shaking his leg gently. On examination, he has a small effusion, no erythema, nearly normal range of motion and slight joint line tenderness medially. There is no tenderness of the patella or head of the fibula. How would you evaluate this patient. Treatment options Physical examination maneuvers such as the Lachman test, the anterior drawer test, the pivot test and the McMurray test have traditionally been recommended for patients with acute or subacute knee injury. A recent systematic review looked at which of these maneuvers are most effective. 1 The systematic review identified 35 studies involving the maneuvers that used arthroscopic results as the reference standard. Although most of the studies contained design flaws, they still provide important guidance regarding the relative accuracy of the most widely used maneuvers. Findings from the systematic review are summarized in "Comparing maneuvers. " They suggest that a positive Lachman test or pivot test is strong evidence in favor of an anterior cruciate ligament tear, while a negative Lachman test is fairly good evidence against that injury. Although widely used, the anterior drawer is actually the least accurate maneuver for diagnosing this injury. Regarding meniscal injury, joint line tenderness is not very helpful at ruling in or ruling out the injury, while the McMurray test is most helpful when positive. Radiography is also widely used but in many cases is unhelpful. Several clinical decision rules have been developed to assist physicians in identifying patients who are at very low risk of bony injury and do not require radiograph.

The Pittsburgh Knee Rule recommends a radiograph for anyone with a fall or blunt-trauma mechanism, anyone younger than 12 years or older than 50 years, and anyone unable to take four weight-bearing steps in the emergency department. 2 In a prospective validation by the developers of the rule using a convenience sample of 934 patients age 6 years to 96 years with acute knee injury, the rule was 99 percent sensitive and 60 percent specific. 3 Twenty-five percent of the patients with a positive Pittsburgh Knee Rule evaluation had a fracture. Most importantly, 99. 7 percent with a negative evaluation using the Pittsburgh Knee Rule had no fracture. The Ottawa Knee Rule recommends a radiograph if any of the following characteristics are present: age 55 years or older, tenderness at the head of the fibula, isolated tenderness of the patella, inability to flex knee to 90 degrees and inability to take four weight-bearing steps both at the time of injury and in the exam room. This rule has been more extensively validated in a greater variety of adult populations. 4 than other rules and was therefore recommended in a recent systematic review as the preferred clinical decision rule for acute knee injury. 1 However, a study of the Ottawa Knee Rule that included adults and children 3 and one of children only 5 both showed lower sensitivity than the Pittsburgh Knee Rule; therefore, the Ottawa Knee Rule should not be used in pediatric populations. The Pittsburgh Knee Rule found adequate sensitivity in a mixed population of adults and children by ordering a radiograph for children under age 12.
3. COMPARING MANEUVERS The following table compares the accuracy of specific physical examination maneuvers for the diagnosis of knee injuries. 1.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part I [^112WwUqr]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Knee pain accounts for approximately one third of musculoskeletal problems seen in primary care settings. This complaint is most prevalent in physically active patients, with as many as 54 percent of athletes having some degree of knee pain each year. 1 Knee pain can be a source of significant disability, restricting the ability to work or perform activities of daily living. History PAIN CHARACTERISTICS The patient's description of knee pain is helpful in focusing the differential diagnosis. 4 It is important to clarify the characteristics of the pain, including its onset, location, duration, severity, and quality. Aggravating and alleviating factors also need to be identified. If knee pain is caused by an acute injury, the physician needs to know whether the patient was able to continue activity or bear weight after the injury or was forced to cease activities immediately.

MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS The patient should be asked about mechanical symptoms, such as locking, popping, or giving way of the knee. A history of locking episodes suggests a meniscal tear. A sensation of popping at the time of injury suggests ligamentous injury, probably complete rupture of a ligament. Episodes of giving way are consistent with some degree of knee instability and may indicate patellar subluxation or ligamentous rupture. EFFUSION The timing and amount of joint effusion are important clues to the diagnosis. Rapid onset of a large, tense effusion suggests rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament or fracture of the tibial plateau with resultant hemarthrosis, whereas slower onset of a mild to moderate effusion is consistent with meniscal injury or ligamentous sprain. Recurrent knee effusion after activity is consistent with meniscal injury.

MECHANISM OF INJURY The patient should be questioned about specific details of the injury. It is important to know if the patient sustained a direct blow to the knee, if the foot was planted at the time of injury, if the patient was decelerating or stopping suddenly, if the patient was landing from a jump, if there was a twisting component to the injury, and if hyperextension occurred. A direct blow to the knee can cause serious injury. Anterior force applied to the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion can cause injury to the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial collateral ligament is most commonly injured as a result of direct lateral force to the knee; this force creates a valgus load on the knee joint and can result in rupture of the medial collateral ligament. Conversely, a medial blow that creates a varus load can injure the lateral collateral ligament.

Noncontact forces also are an important cause of knee injury. Quick stops and sharp cuts or turns create significant deceleration forces that can sprain or rupture the anterior cruciate ligament. Hyperextension can result in injury to the anterior cruciate ligament or posterior cruciate ligament. Sudden twisting or pivoting motions create shear forces that can injure the meniscus. A combination of forces can occur simultaneously, causing injury to multiple structures. MEDICAL HISTORY A history of knee injury or surgery is important. The patient should be asked about previous attempts to treat knee pain, including the use of medications, supporting devices, and physical therapy. The physician also should ask if the patient has a history of gout, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, or other degenerative joint disease.
