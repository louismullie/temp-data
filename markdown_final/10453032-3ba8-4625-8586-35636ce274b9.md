## Question

What is the duration of therapy for endocarditis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to determine the duration of antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis, including when to start counting, how to handle surgery, and how to apply organism-specific durations and oral step-down strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that duration must be sufficient to sterilize vegetations. Then, I should verify when the clock starts and how to monitor clearance of bacteremia. Next, I will examine how surgery alters duration. After that, I need to review organism-specific durations for native versus prosthetic valves. Finally, I should consider oral step-down therapy, special scenarios, and a practical decision framework, making sure I double-check any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: endocarditis requires prolonged bactericidal therapy because vegetations harbor high bacterial density in biofilm with slow metabolic activity, so duration must be adequate to achieve sterilization. Shorter courses are generally unsafe unless there is strong evidence for a specific exception, and even then I should be cautious and verify clinical stability and clearance of bacteremia before shortening therapy [^114v2mc3] [^11191Rth].

> Wait, let me verify when to start counting the duration, because this is easy to misstate. I initially thought we always start counting from the first negative blood culture, but hold on, that's not quite right — guidelines say it is reasonable to begin counting on the first day blood cultures are negative if they were initially positive, which implies that the clock can start at clearance, but it is not a universal mandate. Practically, many clinicians align the formal duration with sustained culture clearance while also ensuring at least 2 sets of cultures every 24–48 hours until clearance is documented, and I should confirm that approach with the treating ID specialist to avoid premature truncation [^117Tf8UH] [^117J4rfp] [^112Ksffe].

> Next, I should review how surgery modifies duration. If operative tissue cultures are positive or a perivalvular abscess is present, an entire antimicrobial course is recommended after surgery, whereas if tissue cultures are negative, it may be reasonable to count preoperative days toward the total duration. Let me double-check the nuance here — some centers have safely shortened postoperative therapy when cultures are negative, but guidelines still advise individualized decisions and ID input, so I should not overgeneralize and must document the rationale for any abbreviated postoperative course [^117WmHNo] [^113pTHFf] [^115HgmMD].

> I will now examine organism-specific durations for viridans streptococci and Streptococcus gallolyticus on native valves. For highly penicillin-susceptible strains, 4 weeks of penicillin G or ceftriaxone is reasonable, and a 2-week combination regimen with gentamicin can be considered in select uncomplicated cases with rapid response and no renal disease. For relatively resistant strains, 4–6 weeks of penicillin or ceftriaxone plus gentamicin for the first 2 weeks is advised, and I should confirm MICs to guide the need for synergy and duration [^114LqVaW].

> For prosthetic valve infection due to viridans streptococci or S. gallolyticus, I need to ensure a longer course. 6 weeks of therapy is recommended, with extension of gentamicin to 6 weeks if the penicillin MIC is greater than 0.12 mcg/mL, and I should verify that this MIC threshold is the trigger for prolonged aminoglycoside exposure to mitigate relapse risk [^116wCzCt] [^116SA5ku].

> Now, enterococcal native valve endocarditis. Let me think about the classic split by symptom duration — if symptoms are less than 3 months, 4 weeks of ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin is reasonable, but if symptoms are 3 months or longer, 6 weeks is advised. Alternatively, double beta-lactam therapy with ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks is reasonable and avoids aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, and I should confirm renal function before committing to gentamicin because nephrotoxicity risk increases with longer aminoglycoside exposure [^116TQpBK] [^113yxx9w] [^1158WWn5].

> For enterococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis, I should confirm that 6 weeks is the minimum, and if high-level aminoglycoside resistance is present, double beta-lactam therapy with ampicillin plus ceftriaxone for 6 weeks is preferred. I need to check that this approach maintains bactericidal activity without relying on synergistic aminoglycoside activity that won't work in HLAR strains [^116TQpBK] [^111dUa6A].

> Turning to Staphylococcus aureus on native valves, I should confirm that uncomplicated left-sided MSSA IE warrants at least 6 weeks of a beta-lactam such as nafcillin or cefazolin, and MRSA IE warrants 4–6 weeks of vancomycin or daptomycin. Hold on, I should verify that some centers extend to 6 weeks for MRSA given higher failure rates, and indeed ESC 2023 allows 4–6 weeks for MRSA NVE, so I should individualize based on response and complications [^112VixYi] [^116nbZoN].

> For S. aureus prosthetic valve endocarditis, I need to ensure combination therapy with a beta-lactam or vancomycin plus rifampin for at least 6 weeks and add gentamicin for the first 2 weeks. I should double-check dosing and drug–drug interactions with rifampin and monitor for nephrotoxicity with gentamicin during that initial window [^111NQ97g] [^111C3TfD].

> But wait, what about right-sided S. aureus IE in people who inject drugs? Cure rates are high and shorter courses of 2–4 weeks can be effective in select uncomplicated cases, yet I need to ensure there is no left-sided involvement, no large vegetations, and no persistent bacteremia before choosing a shorter duration, and I should confirm this plan with ID given relapse risk if criteria are not strictly met [^1158YPii] [^115Wsw9V].

> For HACEK organisms, I should confirm that 4 weeks of ceftriaxone is reasonable for native valves and 6 weeks for prosthetic valves, and I need to remember that gentamicin is not recommended due to nephrotoxicity risk without added benefit in this setting [^111Cbwds].

> Let me consider oral step-down therapy because this changes practice. After at least 10 days of effective IV therapy and documented clinical stability with clearance of bacteremia, switching to highly bioavailable oral agents is noninferior to continued IV therapy for left-sided IE in appropriately selected patients, and I should verify that this approach reduces line complications and length of stay without compromising outcomes. Guidelines now endorse early transition in stable patients, but I must ensure reliable adherence and close follow-up before discharge [^1152W5uJ] [^113nE1b2] [^113dzUMi].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that require longer therapy. Musculoskeletal complications such as vertebral osteomyelitis or abscesses due to difficult organisms like S. aureus or Candida may need more than 6 weeks, and culture-negative IE due to organisms like Bartonella or Coxiella burnetii requires prolonged courses — Bartonella often needs at least 2 weeks of aminoglycoside-containing therapy and Coxiella typically requires 18 months to years of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine, so I must tailor duration to the pathogen and site involvement [^1174MuGT] [^114C97Ac] [^111Habup].

> I should double-check device-related IE. After extraction of infected pacemaker or defibrillator systems, extending therapy to 4–6 weeks is reasonable in the presence of septic emboli or prosthetic valves, and I need to coordinate electrophysiology and ID to balance clearance of infection with risks of prolonged therapy [^116wEY4M].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework so I don't miss steps: determine native versus prosthetic valve and identify the organism and its susceptibilities. Assess symptom duration for enterococci. Confirm clinical stability and clearance of bacteremia before contemplating any shortening or oral switch. Involve ID early. And if surgery occurs, integrate operative culture results into the total duration plan. I need to ensure each of these elements is documented to justify the chosen duration [^112nSjQJ] [^117J4rfp] [^114K2w8q].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing reassessment. Obtain repeat blood cultures every 24–48 hours until clearance, monitor for complications that might extend therapy, and adjust the plan if new foci emerge or if the clinical course deviates from expectations. If I initially assumed a fixed 6-week course for all left-sided IE, I should correct that assumption — evidence and guidelines support organism- and scenario-specific durations, with room for shorter courses in carefully selected right-sided or streptococcal cases and validated oral step-down strategies after initial IV stabilization [^112Ksffe] [^116UfQMd] [^1152W5uJ].

---

Endocarditis treatment duration is tailored to **valve type, pathogen, and clinical course** [^116TQpBK]. For native valve endocarditis (NVE), typical durations are 4–6 weeks; for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), 6 weeks is standard [^116TQpBK]. Shorter courses (**2–4 weeks**) may be appropriate for select right-sided staphylococcal infections or uncomplicated viridans streptococcal disease [^1158YPii] [^114LqVaW]. After clinical stabilization and clearance of bacteremia, **oral step-down therapy** is safe and effective, reducing hospital stay without compromising outcomes [^112RcDNJ] [^113dzUMi]. Therapy should be individualized by an infectious diseases specialist, with adjustments for complications, surgery, or persistent infection [^113YBBdH].

## General principles influencing duration

Several factors guide **duration**:

- **Valve type**: native vs prosthetic [^111Cbwds].
- **Pathogen**: virulence, resistance, and biofilm formation [^114v2mc3].
- **Clinical course**: complications, response, and surgery timing [^117J4rfp].
- **Patient factors**: renal function, allergies, and comorbidities [^113YBBdH].

## Pathogen-specific duration recommendations

| **Pathogen** | **Native valve endocarditis (nve)** | **Prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve)** |
|-|-|-|
| Viridans streptococci | 4–6 weeks; 2 weeks if uncomplicated and rapid response | 6 weeks |
| Enterococci | 4–6 weeks (6 weeks if symptoms > 3 months) | 6 weeks minimum |
| Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) | 4–6 weeks | 6 weeks minimum |
| Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) | 4–6 weeks | 6 weeks minimum |
| Coagulase-negative staphylococci | 4–6 weeks | 6 weeks minimum |
| HACEK organisms | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |
| Culture-negative IE | 4–6 weeks | 6 weeks minimum |

---

## Special considerations

- **Right-sided staphylococcal IE**: 2–4 weeks if uncomplicated and rapid response [^115Wsw9V].
- **Oral step-down therapy**: after ≥ 10 days IV and clinical stability, oral therapy is noninferior to IV-only regimens [^1152W5uJ] [^113dzUMi].
- **Surgical management**: extend or adjust therapy based on culture results and clinical course [^113pTHFf] [^116DH7GB].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Blood cultures**: obtain every 24–48 hours until clearance [^112Ksffe].
- **Clinical response**: adjust duration based on complications or persistent infection [^117J4rfp].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: involve infectious diseases, cardiology, and surgery [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **NVE**: 4–6 weeks, pathogen-specific.
- **PVE**: 6 weeks minimum.
- **Right-sided staphylococcal IE**: 2–4 weeks if uncomplicated.
- **Oral step-down**: after ≥ 10 days IV and clinical stability [^1152W5uJ].
- **Individualization**: based on complications, surgery, and persistent infection [^117J4rfp].

Endocarditis treatment duration is individualized by valve type, pathogen, and clinical course, with **oral step-down therapy** as a safe, effective option after initial IV stabilization [^1152W5uJ].

Antimicrobial therapy duration determinants — best practice statement (BPS): We recommend determining duration by site of infection, microbial etiology, response to treatment, and ability to achieve source control (BPS). The text notes there is no evidence that severity of sepsis determines optimal duration and no data that organ dysfunction or higher initial illness severity necessitates longer therapy for specific infection types. Duration can differ by site due to pathogen burden, penetration, or biofilms; longer courses are typically required for endocarditis, undrained abscesses, and prosthetic joint infection without device removal. Examples include that 7–10 days of therapy is appropriate for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia in immunocompetent hosts, whereas uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia requires a longer course, and therapy in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients is often continued until resolution of neutropenia.

2.3 Data Extraction

Articles obtained from the systematic search were transferred to EndNote Reference Library software to identify and remove duplicates. The remaining articles were then reviewed by two independent reviewers, and only those meeting the predetermined criteria were included. The initial screening involved selecting studies based on their titles and abstracts, followed by a thorough review of the full‐text articles to ensure their relevance. Any conflicts were resolved through consensus or by consulting a third reviewer.

Data extracted from the studies included: (1) study characteristics, such as the first author, publication year, country, and study design; (2) patient demographics, including the number of patients, mean age, and sex ratio; (3) disease characteristics, such as type of endocarditis and diagnosis according to Duke's criteria; (4) treatment details, including OPAT duration, mean inpatient length of stay, and follow‐up time; and (5) outcomes and complications. If data for multiple outcomes were reported collectively, the corresponding authors were contacted via email to request separate results.

2.4 Quality Assessment

The risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non‐randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) tool. Two authors independently assessed the studies based on the tool's criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

In each study, bias was assessed in seven domains: confounding, selection of participants, classification of interventions, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selection of reported results. Bias in each domain was categorized as low, moderate, serious, or critical. Finally, the prior assessment results were used to determine the overall risk of bias in each study.

Enterococcus faecalis IE susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides — treatment duration and renal considerations: Patients with < 3 months' duration of symptoms were treated successfully with 4 weeks of antimicrobial therapy, whereas patients with ≥ 3 months' duration were successfully treated with 6 weeks; in prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable. Patients with preexisting mild (creatinine clearance, 30–50 mL/min) or severe (creatinine clearance, < 30 mL/min) renal failure may not be able to safely complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy; alternative regimens that should be considered include the use of streptomycin instead of gentamicin and short-course gentamicin therapy (2–3 weeks).

### Partial oral versus intravenous antibiotic treatment of endocarditis [^1152W5uJ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with infective endocarditis on the left side of the heart are typically treated with intravenous antibiotic agents for up to 6 weeks. Whether a shift from intravenous to oral antibiotics once the patient is in stable condition would result in efficacy and safety similar to those with continued intravenous treatment is unknown.

Methods

In a randomized, noninferiority, multicenter trial, we assigned 400 adults in stable condition who had endocarditis on the left side of the heart caused by streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, or coagulase-negative staphylococci and who were being treated with intravenous antibiotics to continue intravenous treatment (199 patients) or to switch to oral antibiotic treatment (201 patients). In all patients, antibiotic treatment was administered intravenously for at least 10 days. If feasible, patients in the orally treated group were discharged to outpatient treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, or relapse of bacteremia with the primary pathogen, from the time of randomization until 6 months after antibiotic treatment was completed.

Results

After randomization, antibiotic treatment was completed after a median of 19 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the intravenously treated group and 17 days (interquartile range, 14 to 25) in the orally treated group (P = 0.48). The primary composite outcome occurred in 24 patients (12.1%) in the intravenously treated group and in 18 (9.0%) in the orally treated group (between-group difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -3.4 to 9.6; P = 0.40), which met noninferiority criteria.

Conclusions

In patients with endocarditis on the left side of the heart who were in stable condition, changing to oral antibiotic treatment was noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotic treatment. (Funded by the Danish Heart Foundation and others; POET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01375257 .).

### Sequential antibiotic therapy [^1166H8qp]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials are an important source of hospital expenditure. Traditionally, severe bacterial infections have been treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, followed by physician-directed switch to oral therapy. Unfortunately this approach results in unnecessary prolongation of intravenous treatment, with all its inherent disadvantages. Sequential antibiotic therapy, however, ensures an early switch to the oral route when the patient is clinically stable. This increasingly employed strategy is safe and results in improved quality and cost-effectiveness of health care. To ensure timely and appropriate switch, such programmes need to be underpinned by clear guidelines and supported by a multidisciplinary team. In the future, key questions, such as what is the optimal time of switch for specific infections, and can conditions such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis be efficaciously treated with oral therapy, need to be answered. Only then will clinicians be able to practise evidence-based infection management incorporating sequential antimicrobial therapy.

### Using antibiotics wisely [^112DpcPo]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will describe role of shorter antibiotic therapies, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and artificial intelligence in infectious diseases.

Recent Findings

There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia that can be treated with 7days of therapy, community acquired pneumonia with 3days and ventilator associated pneumonia with just 7days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis and bone and joint infections is safe and effective and reduces line complications and costs. Also, for clean surgical procedures only one dose of antibiotic is needed, but it should be the most effective antibiotic which is cefazolin. This means avoiding clindamycin, removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence to incorporate into using antibiotics wisely is rapidly emerging but is still in early stages.

Summary

In using antibiotics wisely, targeting such as durations of therapy and conversion from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low hanging fruit. The future of artificial intelligence could automate a lot of this work and is exciting but needs to be proven.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (antibiotic therapy, enterococci), ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to administer vancomycin 30 mg/kg/day IV in 2–3 equally divided doses for 6 weeks combined with gentamicin 3 mg/kg/day IV or IM in 1 dose for 2 weeks in pediatric patients with IE caused by β-lactam-resistant Enterococcus species (E. faecium).

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^111NQ97g]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcal prosthetic valve infective endocarditis — oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant regimens are as follows: For oxacillin-susceptible strains, nafcillin or oxacillin 12 g/24 h IV in 6 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6 (Class I; Level of Evidence B), plus rifampin 900 mg per 24 h IV or orally in 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6, and gentamicin 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV or IM in 2 or 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk 2; vancomycin should be used for immediate-type β-lactam hypersensitivity and cefazolin may be substituted for non–immediate-type reactions, and doses are for patients with normal renal function. For oxacillin-resistant strains, vancomycin 30 mg/kg 24 h in 2 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6 (Class I; Level of Evidence B), plus rifampin 900 mg/24 h IV/PO in 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk ≥ 6, and gentamicin 3 mg/kg per 24 h IV/IM in 2 or 3 equally divided doses, duration, wk 2; adjust vancomycin to a trough concentration of 10–20 µg/mL; gentamicin should be administered in close proximity to companion dosing.

### Identifying heterogeneity of treatment effect for antibiotic duration in bloodstream infection: an exploratory post-hoc analysis of the BALANCE randomised clinical trial [^1138xVho]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our study include the large sample size and detailed daily clinical data, which allowed us to evaluate different combinations of clinical variables in three different clinical decision rules. We also formulated and pre-specified these rules based on clinical reasoning, ensuring that they would be applicable to different clinical settings. There are several limitations with our study. First, the dataset was limited to variables that were collected in BALANCE, which did not capture some relevant variables that survey respondents considered important in deciding on duration of therapy. For example, we had no data on history of recurrent infection, timing of symptom resolution, or presence of non-vascular prosthetic material. Formulation of the candidate decision rules was thus constrained by data availability. Similarly, the primary outcome of this post-hoc analysis was determined by the primary outcome of the BALANCE trial; the authors recognize that 90-day all-cause mortality does not encompass other important clinical outcomes, such as recurrence of BSI and development of BSI complications (e.g. infective endocarditis, vertebral osteomyelitis, etc.) within 90 days of the index BSI. Second, collection of some of the variables required in this analysis were not protocolised and hence there were missing daily data required for the dynamic stopping rule and ECFC score. We tried to address this with sensitivity analyses using different imputation scenarios which showed similar results to the primary analyses. Third, the sample size of BALANCE was calculated based on the primary non-inferiority analysis and not these post-hoc analyses; this study may thus have been underpowered to detect small but clinically meaningful interactions. Fourth, there was differential non-adherence across the risk groups in each of the clinical decision rules, with higher risk groups having a higher degree of non-adherence and slightly longer actual antibiotic durations received. This difference was greater in the 7-day treatment group vs the 14-day treatment group, which may have resulted in bias due to post-randomization confounding. Nonetheless, results were consistent across the intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses. Fifth, BALANCE excluded patients with prosthetic valves or vascular grafts, severe immunocompromise, specific infection foci requiring prolonged therapy, or infection by S. aureus or S. lugdunensis; no conclusions can be drawn among these patients. While our analyses did not identify specific patient subgroups who convincingly benefited from longer therapy durations than 7 days, this should not imply that there are no patients who would, but instead, that those decisions are best made by clinicians considering available clinical evidence, which may be more detailed than was available for these analyses.

### Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis: a pilot study of the relationship between duration of gentamicin treatment and outcome [^116PeCcD]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Because of the nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycosides, the Danish guidelines on infective endocarditis were changed in January 2007, reducing gentamicin treatment in enterococcal infective endocarditis from 4 to 6 weeks to only 2 weeks. In this pilot study, we compare outcomes in patients with Enterococcus faecalis infective endocarditis treated in the years before and after endorsement of these new recommendations.

Methods and Results

A total of 84 consecutive patients admitted with definite left-sided E faecalis endocarditis in the period of 2002 to 2011 were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated before and 43 patients were treated after January 1, 2007. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. At hospitalization, the 2 groups had similar estimated glomerular filtration rates of 66 and 75 mL/min (P = 0.22). Patients treated before January 2007 received gentamicin for a significantly longer period (28 versus 14 days; P < 0.001). The primary outcome, 1-year event-free survival, did not differ: 66% versus 69%, respectively (P = 0.75). At discharge, the patients treated before 2007 had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (45 versus 66 mL/min; P = 0.008) and a significantly greater decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (median, 11 versus 1 mL/min; P = 0.009) compared with those treated after 2007.

Conclusions

Our present pilot study suggests that the recommended 2-week treatment with gentamicin seems adequate and preferable in treating non-high-level aminoglycoside-resistant E faecalis infective endocarditis. The longer duration of gentamicin treatment is associated with worse renal function. Although the certainty of the clinical outcomes is limited by the sample size, outcomes appear to be no worse with the shorter treatment duration. Randomized, controlled studies are warranted to substantiate these results.

### Bacteriological outcome after valve surgery for active infective endocarditis: implications for duration of treatment after surgery [^116DH7GB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There has been no systematic evaluation of outcome after surgery for infective endocarditis with respect to duration of antibiotic treatment.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of episodes of valve surgery for active infective endocarditis at Green Lane Hospital (Auckland, New Zealand) for 1963–1999. We recorded the duration of antibiotic treatment before and after valve surgery; the extent of infection at operation; Gram stain, culture, and histopathological testing results for valve samples; and the bacteriological outcome after surgery. The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as endocarditis due to the same species within 1 year after surgery.

Results

For the 358 patients in our study, the median duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. Thirty-two patients (9%) had 36 subsequent episodes of endocarditis. Relapse occurred after 3 (0.8%) of the operations (95% CI, 0.2%-2.0%). Relapse of infection was unrelated to the duration of antibiotic treatment before or after surgery, positive valve culture results, positive Gram stain results, or perivalvular infection. Since 1994, we have reduced the duration of antibiotic treatment by approximately 7 days for those with positive valve culture results and by approximately 14 days for those with negative valve culture results, without any increase in the number of relapses.

Conclusions

Relapse is an uncommon event following surgery for endocarditis. Commonly suggested indications for prolonging postoperative treatment are not associated with higher relapse rates, and their relevance is debatable. We conclude that it is unnecessary to continue treatment for patients with negative valve culture results for an arbitrary 4–6-week period after surgery. Two weeks of treatment appears to be sufficient, and, for those operated on near the end of the standard period of treatment, simply completing the planned course should suffice.

### A comparison of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infective endocarditis [^115M5uRd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment, but due to the differences in presentation, populations affected, and the wide variety of micro-organisms that can be responsible, their use is not standardised. This is an update of a review previously published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the existing evidence about the clinical benefits and harms of different antibiotics regimens used to treat people with infective endocarditis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on 6 January 2020. We also searched three trials registers and handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of antibiotic regimens for treating definitive infective endocarditis diagnosed according to modified Duke's criteria. We considered all-cause mortality, cure rates, and adverse events as the primary outcomes. We excluded people with possible infective endocarditis and pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and data extraction in duplicate. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. We described the included studies narratively.

Main Results

Six small RCTs involving 1143 allocated/632 analysed participants met the inclusion criteria of this first update. The included trials had a high risk of bias. Three trials were sponsored by drug companies. Due to heterogeneity in outcome definitions and different antibiotics used data could not be pooled. The included trials compared miscellaneous antibiotic schedules having uncertain effects for all of the prespecified outcomes in this review. Evidence was either low or very low quality due to high risk of bias and very low number of events and small sample size. The results for all-cause mortality were as follows: one trial compared quinolone (levofloxacin) plus standard treatment (antistaphylococcal penicillin (cloxacillin or dicloxacillin), aminoglycoside (tobramycin or netilmicin), and rifampicin) versus standard treatment alone and reported 8/31 (26%) with levofloxacin plus standard treatment versus 9/39 (23%) with standard treatment alone; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.56. One trial compared fosfomycin plus imipenem 3/4 (75%) versus vancomycin 0/4 (0%) (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.47 to 103.27), and one trial compared partial oral treatment 7/201 (3.5%) versus conventional intravenous treatment 13/199 (6.53%) (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.31). The results for rates of cure with or without surgery were as follows: one trial compared daptomycin versus low-dose gentamicin plus an antistaphylococcal penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin and reported 9/28 (32.1%) with daptomycin versus 9/25 (36%) with low-dose gentamicin plus antistaphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.89. One trial compared glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) plus gentamicin with cloxacillin plus gentamicin (13/23 (56%) versus 11/11 (100%); RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85). One trial compared ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus ceftriaxone alone (15/34 (44%) versus 21/33 (64%); RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.10), and one trial compared fosfomycin plus imipenem versus vancomycin (1/4 (25%) versus 2/4 (50%); RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.55). The included trials reported adverse events, the need for cardiac surgical interventions, and rates of uncontrolled infection, congestive heart failure, relapse of endocarditis, and septic emboli, and found no conclusive differences between groups (very low-quality evidence). No trials assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

This first update confirms the findings of the original version of the review. Limited and low to very low-quality evidence suggests that the comparative effects of different antibiotic regimens in terms of cure rates or other relevant clinical outcomes are uncertain. The conclusions of this updated Cochrane Review were based on few RCTs with a high risk of bias. Accordingly, current evidence does not support or reject any regimen of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of infective endocarditis.

### Treatment of Q fever endocarditis… [^111Habup]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The mean duration of therapy for cure in this group was 55 months. Twenty-one patients received the doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine regimen: 1 patient died of a surgical complication, 2 are still being treated, 17 were cured, and 1 is currently being evaluated. Two patients treated for 12 months but none of the patients treated for longer than 18 months relapsed. The mean duration of treatment in this group was 31 months. No significant differences were observed between the 2 regimens in terms of death, valve surgery, or tolerance. The mortality rate for both regimens in this study was 5%. Conclusion Prescription of the doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine combination for at least 18 months allows shortening of the duration of therapy and reduction in the number of relapses. In some series, 4 two thirds of the patients died. Since that time, the role of combined and prolonged antibiotic drug therapy for these patients has been emphasized.

5–7 The current recommended treatment duration is from 3 years to lifetime, even when quinolone is added to the reference tetracycline therapy. The mean treatment duration for patients considered cured was 55 months. No patient relapsed when treated for longer than 4 years, and only 1 patient relapsed after 3 years of treatment. However, 8 patients are still being treated or were switched to a doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine regimen. Nine patients required a second dosage reduction to 150 mg within a mean of 3. 4 months. The mean treatment duration for cured patients was 31 months, with a median of 26 months. Two patients are still undergoing treatment. Only 2 patients have been treated for longer than 4 years. This progress has previously been reported, 6 although the treatment duration, when quinolones were used, remained long.

Comparing the 2 regimens, treatment with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine was more effective in terms of the percentage of relapses and the treatment duration. We think that doxycycline and ofloxacin should be prescribed for at least 4 years, whereas doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine should not be prescribed for shorter than 112 years or longer than 4 years.

### Accelerated treatment of endocarditis-the POET II trial: rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial [^116UfQMd]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antibiotic treatment length for infective endocarditis (IE) is uncertain. International guidelines recommend treatment duration of up to 6 weeks for patients with left-sided IE but are primarily based on historical data and expert opinion. Efficacies of modern therapies, fast recovery seen in many patients with IE, and complications to long hospital stays challenge the rationale for fixed treatment durations in all patients.

Objective

The objective was to conduct a noninferiority randomized controlled trial (acronym POET II) investigating the safety of accelerated (shortened) antibiotic therapy as compared to standard duration in patients with left-sided IE.

Methods

The POET II trial is a multicenter, multinational, open-label, noninferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients with definite left-sided IE due to Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis will be eligible for enrolment. Each patient will be randomized to accelerated antibiotic treatment or standard-length treatment (1:1) following clinical stabilization as defined by clinical parameters, laboratory values, and transesophageal echocardiography findings. Accelerated treatment will be between 2 and 4 weeks, whereas standard-length treatment will be between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on microbiologic etiology, complications, need for valve surgery, and prosthetic versus native valve endocarditis. The primary outcome is a composite of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, relapse of bacteremia, or embolization within 6 months of randomization.

Conclusions

The POET II trial will investigate the safety of accelerated antibiotic therapy for patients with left-sided IE caused by Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus, or Enterococcus faecalis. The results of the POET II trial will improve the evidence base of treatment recommendations, and clinical practice may be altered.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Penicillin G|- 12–18 million U/day IV in 4–6 doses or continuously|

Infective endocarditis (IE) — antibiotic penetration into vegetations is a key determinant of efficacy because vegetations composed of layers of fibrin and platelets pose a mechanical barrier; efficacy varies with penetration, distribution pattern, and vegetation size, and diffusion differs by antibiotic class; in designing dose regimens, it is important to fully optimize the PK/PD parameter for the selected antibiotic to increase the likelihood of success.

### Partial oral treatment of endocarditis [^116UoKv4]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis (IE) recommend 4 to 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Conversion from intravenous to oral antibiotics in clinically stabilized patients could reduce the side effects associated with intravenous treatment and shorten the length of hospital stay. Evidence supporting partial oral therapy as an alternative to the routinely recommended continued parenteral therapy is scarce, although observational data suggest that this strategy may be safe and effective.

Study Design

This is a noninferiority, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study of partial oral treatment with antibiotics compared with full parenteral treatment in left-sided IE. Stable patients (n = 400) with streptococci, staphylococci, or enterococci infecting the mitral valve or the aortic valve will be included. After a minimum of 10 days of parenteral treatment, stable patients are randomized to oral therapy or unchanged parenteral therapy. Recommendations for oral treatment have been developed based on minimum inhibitory concentrations and pharmacokinetic calculations. Patients will be followed up for 6 months after completion of antibiotic therapy. The primary end point is a composition of all-cause mortality, unplanned cardiac surgery, embolic events, and relapse of positive blood cultures with the primary pathogen.

Conclusion

The Partial Oral Treatment of Endocarditis study tests the hypothesis that partial oral antibiotic treatment is as efficient and safe as parenteral therapy in left-sided IE. The trial is justified by a review of the literature, by pharmacokinetic calculations, and by our own experience.

Recommendations — highly penicillin‑susceptible viridans group streptococci and S gallolyticus (bovis) native valve IE: Both aqueous crystalline penicillin G and ceftriaxone are reasonable options for a 4‑week treatment duration (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). A 2‑week treatment regimen that includes gentamicin is reasonable in patients with uncomplicated IE, rapid response to therapy, and no underlying renal disease (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). Vancomycin for a 4‑week treatment duration is a reasonable alternative in patients who cannot tolerate penicillin or ceftriaxone therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). The desired trough vancomycin level should range between 10 and 15 μg/mL (Class I; Level of Evidence C).

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^115HgmMD]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial treatment perspectives in infective endocarditis (IE) note that initial therapy is empirical and is revised once a pathogen and susceptibilities are defined, and infectious diseases consultation should occur at empirical therapy initiation. It is reasonable for the counting of days for the duration of therapy to begin on the first day on which blood cultures are negative, and it is reasonable to obtain 2 sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until clearance. After valve surgery, an entire course of antimicrobial therapy is reasonable if resected valve tissue is culture positive or a perivalvular abscess is found, whereas if tissue is culture negative, it may be reasonable for the duration of postoperative treatment given less the number of days of treatment administered for native valve infection before valve replacement. Retrospective data from 2 medical centers suggest that 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy may be sufficient after surgery when valve tissue cultures are negative, particularly in IE caused by viridans group streptococci or Streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis); whether 2 weeks is sufficient with positive valve cultures was not addressed in one survey and included only 5 patients in another, and histopathological Gram staining with negative cultures is not a factor in defining length of therapy after surgery.

Treatment Duration

The most commonly identified durations of therapy between geographic regions for SAB-associated syndromes were similar. Thus, the majority of respondents from each continent indicated the same duration of treatment for native valve endocarditis (6 weeks), septic arthritis (4 weeks), and spondylodiscitis (6 weeks). Despite these similarities in practice amongst the majority of practitioners across geographic regions, substantial "within-region" variation existed for these syndromes. For each infectious complication of SAB, individual respondents within each continent indicated longer and shorter durations of therapy (Figure 4).

Figure 4.
Treatment duration for S. aureus bacteremia. Percentage (count) of total respondents of the question per continent. P < .01 for comparison between continents for all categories (χ2 test).

The finding of blood cultures positive for S. aureus after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy was identified as the most important reason to extend therapy duration in SAB patients beyond 2 weeks in all continents (range: 66% in South America to 90% in North America). Immunocompromised status was identified as an indication to extend antibiotic treatment beyond 2 weeks for most North American physicians (72%) but less than half (43%) of European physicians. By contrast, community acquisition of SAB was considered a reason to extend antibiotic treatment in only 20%–41% of physicians (Table 1; P < .01 for all above mentioned comparisons between continents).

18F-FDG PET/CT Scan use

The availability, insurance coverage, and use of 18F-FDG PET/CT scans differed significantly between geographic regions (Table 1). All were highest in Europe and lowest in Africa. The direct availability of 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for SAB patients ranged from 9% in Africa and 29% in South America, to 78% in Europe. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were used for SAB patients by 94% of European, 83% of Oceanian, 61% of South American, 57% of Asian, and 51% of North American physicians (P < .01 for both above mentioned comparisons between continents). Survey respondents indicating that they ordered 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in patients with SAB were asked to specify for which indications they did so. Globally, the most important and most agreed upon indication for 18F-FDG PET/CT scan in SAB was persistent bacteremia: 62%–70% of physicians in every continent ordered 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for this indication (Supplementary Table 2; p = 0.66).

Enterococcus endocarditis — aminoglycoside use and dosing: Approximately 97% of cases of enterococcal IE are caused by E faecalis, and in older, comorbid patients gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity may complicate a "standard" 4- to 6-week course; in some situations the potential risk of attempting to complete a 4- to 6-week course of gentamicin therapy may exceed the benefit. Human studies used dosing intervals ranging from once daily to 3 times daily, and the data were insufficient to compare the efficacy of once-daily with divided doses; until more convincing data demonstrate once-daily dosing is as effective, in patients with normal renal function, gentamicin should be administered in daily multiple divided doses (total, ≈3 mg·kg−1·d−1). In patients with normal renal function, it is reasonable to administer gentamicin every 8 hours with the dose adjusted to achieve a 1-hour serum concentration of ≈3 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL; increasing the dose did not enhance efficacy but did increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### A comparison of different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of infective endocarditis [^114wcFgB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment, but their use is not standardised, due to the differences in presentation, populations affected and the wide variety of micro-organisms that can be responsible.

Objectives

To assess the existing evidence about the clinical benefits and harms of different antibiotics regimens used to treat people with infective endocarditis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE Classic and EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on 30 April 2015. We also searched three trials registers and handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of antibiotic regimens for treating possible infective endocarditis diagnosed according to modified Duke's criteria. We considered all-cause mortality, cure rates and adverse events as the primary outcomes. We excluded people with possible infective endocarditis and pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We constructed 'Summary of findings' tables and used GRADE methodology to assess the quality of studies. We described the included studies narratively.

Main Results

Four small randomised controlled trials involving 728 allocated/224 analysed participants met our inclusion criteria. These trials had a high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored two of the trials. We were unable to pool the data due to the heterogeneity in outcome definitions and the different antibiotics used. The included trials compared the following antibiotic schedules. The first trial compared quinolone (levofloxacin) plus standard treatment (anti-staphylococcal penicillin (cloxacillin or dicloxacillin), aminoglycoside (tobramycin or netilmicin) and rifampicin) versus standard treatment alone reporting uncertain effects on all-cause mortality (8/31 (26%) with levofloxacin plus standard treatment versus 9/39 (23%) with standard treatment alone; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.56, very low quality evidence). The second trial compared daptomycin versus low-dose gentamicin plus an anti-staphylococcal penicillin (nafcillin, oxacillin or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin. This showed uncertain effects in terms of cure rates (9/28 (32.1%) with daptomycin versus 9/25 (36%) with low-dose gentamicin plus anti-staphylococcal penicillin or vancomycin, RR 0.89 95% CI 0.42 to 1.89; very low quality evidence). The third trial compared cloxacillin plus gentamicin with a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) plus gentamicin. In participants receiving gentamycin plus glycopeptide only 13/23 (56%) were cured versus 11/11 (100%) receiving cloxacillin plus gentamicin (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85; very low quality evidence). The fourth trial compared ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus ceftriaxone alone and found no conclusive differences in terms of cure (15/34 (44%) with ceftriaxone plus gentamicin versus 21/33 (64%) with ceftriaxone alone, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.10; very low quality evidence). The trials reported adverse events, need for cardiac surgical interventions, uncontrolled infection and relapse of endocarditis and found no conclusive differences between comparison groups (very low quality evidence). No trials assessed septic emboli or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited and very low quality evidence suggested that there were no conclusive differences between antibiotic regimens in terms of cure rates or other relevant clinical outcomes. However, because of the very low quality evidence, this needs confirmation. The conclusion of this Cochrane review was based on randomised controlled trials with high risk of bias. Accordingly, current evidence does not support or reject any regimen of antibiotic therapy for treatment of infective endocarditis.

Empirical therapy for suspected Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (IE) and penicillin susceptibility considerations: Vancomycin is often included with cefazolin while awaiting susceptibilities, and literature analysis showed β-lactam–containing empirical regimens were superior to vancomycin monotherapy for bacteremic MSSA infections, including IE, but the meta-analysis was small and retrospective and the usefulness of empirical combination therapy until oxacillin susceptibility is known is uncertain. Because most staphylococci are penicillin resistant and laboratory screening for penicillin susceptibility may be unreliable, IE due to penicillin-susceptible strains should be treated with regimens outlined for MSSA that include nafcillin rather than penicillin, and there are no evidence-based data defining the most appropriate duration of nafcillin therapy for left-sided NVE caused by MSSA.

Limitations of current studies and their clinical implications

Despite their important contribution, most trials evaluating PCT-guided antibiotic therapy present several limitations that preclude their safe extrapolation to the clinical decision-making process. Namely, the high rate of patient exclusion (reaching > 80% in the Svoboda and colleagues trial) and the high rate of algorithm overruling (reaching > 50% in the PRORATA trial) disregard the impact of renal failure as well as renal replacement therapy on PCT levels, and above all the heterogeneity of duration of antibiotic therapy in the controls. Contrary to Prkno and colleagues' opinion, since 2003 it has been clear that the duration of antibiotic therapy could be safely reduced in critically ill patients to 6 to 8 days. Consequently, this duration of therapy should be used as the best care in clinical trials. Besides, some infections (for example, infectious endocarditis, and nosocomial infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii) were not systematically evaluated. Finally, the costs associated with daily measurement of PCT in all ICU patients should not be ignored, since we have cheaper and widely available alternatives with proven safety and efficacy.

### Enterococcal endocarditis in Sweden, 1995–1999: can shorter therapy with aminoglycosides be used? [^111M2EKh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A 5-year nationwide prospective study in Sweden during 1995–1999 identified 881 definite episodes of infective endocarditis. Definite enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in 93 episodes (11%), the largest series of enterococcal endocarditis so far presented. Mortality during treatment was 16%, the relapse rate was 3%, and clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 81% of the episodes. Clinical cure was achieved with a median duration of cell wall-active antimicrobial therapy of 42 days combined with an aminoglycoside (median treatment time, 15 days). International guidelines generally recommend a 4–6-week combined synergistic treatment course with a cell wall-active antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. Treatment regimens in Sweden often include a shortened aminoglycoside treatment course in order to minimize adverse effects in older patients. Fatal outcome seemed not to be due to the shortened aminoglycoside therapy course. In many enterococcal endocarditis episodes, duration of aminoglycoside therapy could probably be shortened to 2–3 weeks.

### Evaluation of a paradigm shift from intravenous antibiotics to oral step-down therapy for the treatment of infective endocarditis: a narrative review [^113dzUMi]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The requirement of prolonged intravenous antibiotic courses to treat infective endocarditis (IE) is a time-honored dogma of medicine. However, numerous antibiotics are now available that achieve adequate levels in the blood after oral administration to kill bacteria. Moreover, prolonged intravenous antibiotic regimens are associated with high rates of adverse events. Accordingly, recent studies of oral step-down antibiotic treatment have stimulated a reevaluation of the need for intravenous-only therapy for IE.

Observations

PubMed was reviewed in October 2019, with an update in February 2020, to determine whether evidence supports the notion that oral step-down antibiotic therapy for IE is associated with inferior outcomes compared with intravenous-only therapy. The search identified 21 observational studies evaluating the effectiveness of oral antibiotics for treating IE, typically after an initial course of intravenous therapy; none found such oral step-down therapy to be inferior to intravenous-only therapy. Multiple studies described an improved clinical cure rate and an improved mortality rate among patients treated with oral step-down vs intravenous-only antibiotic therapy. Three randomized clinical trials also demonstrated that oral step-down antibiotic therapy is at least as effective as intravenous-only therapy in right-sided, left-sided, or prosthetic valve IE. In the largest trial, at 3.5 years of follow-up, patients randomized to receive oral step-down antibiotic therapy had a significantly improved cure rate and mortality rate compared with those who received intravenous-only therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

This review found ample data demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness of oral step-down vs intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for IE, and no contrary data were identified. The use of highly orally bioavailable antibiotics as step-down therapy for IE, after clearing bacteremia and achieving clinical stability with intravenous regimens, should be incorporated into clinical practice.

### Treatment… [^115LRU9T]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

S. bovis is another streptococcal species that causes bacterial endocarditis. Most of these organisms are highly sensitive to penicillin. Patients infected with one of these organisms should be treated for four weeks with intravenous penicillin in doses of 12 million to 18 million units every 24 hours or 2 g of ceftriaxone in a single daily dose given intravenously or intramuscularly. The penicillin can be administered continuously or in six divided doses. The bacteriologic cure rate with such treatment is approximately 98 percent. Accumulating evidence has shown that an equivalent cure rate can be achieved with a two-week combination of penicillin or ceftriaxone and gentamicin administered intramuscularly or intravenously. 13 This alternative two-week regimen is appropriate for uncomplicated bacterial endocarditis in patients with a low risk of complications from gentamicin.

Occasionally, bacterial endocarditis is caused by viridans streptococci that are moderately susceptible to penicillin. These patients should be treated with intravenous penicillin at a dosage of 18 million units every 24 hours for four weeks and with gentamicin for the first two weeks. The unusual patient with bacterial endocarditis due to viridans streptococci with low susceptibility to penicillin should be treated with a combination of intravenous penicillin and gentamicin for four to six weeks. Adding gentamicin for the first three to five days of treatment may protect the infected valve from further damage and may decrease the duration of bacteremia, thus reducing the risk of extracardiac infection. Extending the use of gentamicin beyond three to five days does not favorably affect the course. Injection drug users with right-sided endocarditis caused by MSSA can be effectively treated with a two-week course of nafcillin or oxacillin and gentamicin.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^1136Zghu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

### Management of infective endocarditis: challenges and perspectives [^115Wk3Hq]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Despite improvements in medical and surgical therapies, infective endocarditis is associated with poor prognosis and remains a therapeutic challenge. Many factors affect the outcome of this serious disease, including virulence of the microorganism, characteristics of the patients, presence of underlying disease, delays in diagnosis and treatment, surgical indications, and timing of surgery. We review the strengths and limitations of present therapeutic strategies and propose future directions for better management of endocarditis according to the most recent research. Novel perspectives on the management of endocarditis are emerging and offer hope for decreasing the rate of residual deaths by accelerating the process of diagnosis and risk stratification, reducing delays in starting antimicrobial therapy, rapid transfer of high-risk patients to specialised medico-surgical centres, development of new surgical methods, and close long-term follow-up.

### Should we extend the use of oral antibiotics in infective endocarditis? The ENDO-ORAL study [^112RcDNJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Switching to oral therapy has become an option for treating infective endocarditis (IE) in well selected patients. This study aimed to assess its effectiveness in real-life settings, including patients who would not have been eligible in current guidelines based on the POET trial results.

Methods

All adults treated for IE in two French tertiary centers from January 2016 to December 2023, were included in a retrospective cohort. For each participant, clinical, microbiological and therapeutic data were collected retrospectively. Patients who received at least 10 days of effective antibiotic therapy, were included and categorized based on the route of administration (exclusively intravenous or with a switch to oral therapy). POET-ineligible patients were those who were not eligible in the POET trial. Treatment failure (death, recurrence, or need for suppressive therapy, within three months following completion of the initial antibiotic course) was assessed using propensity score analysis, with oral switch as a time-dependent variable.

Results

Three hundred and thirty-three participants were included (233 in the intravenous group and 100 patients in the oral group). No significant difference in treatment failure was observed between groups after adjustment using a propensity score (HR = 0.55 in favor of oral switch, 95%CI: 0.27–1.17). The results were similar in the POET-ineligible subgroup, which accounted for 44.7% of participants. Days alive outside the hospital were significantly higher in the oral group (59 vs 47 days, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Oral switch is a suitable option beyond "classical" frontiers in the management of IE, with potential direct and indirect benefits.

### Outcome and treatment of Bartonella endocarditis… [^114C97Ac]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

One hundred of the 101 patients received antibiotics for a mean ± SD duration of 43 ± 17 days. Eighty-two patients received aminoglycosides, for a mean ± SD duration of 15 ± 11 days; 64 of these received a β-lactam. Aminoglycoside-treated patients were hospitalized for a mean ± SD of 17 ± 12 days following the onset of therapy vs 17 ± 10 days for those who were treated with other antibiotics. Aminoglycoside dosage was monitored in 76 of 82 patients to achieve therapeutic levels. Among patients treated with aminoglycosides, 65 of the 69 patients who recovered had received aminoglycosides for 14 or more days vs 9 of the 13 patients treated for fewer than 14 days.

The shorter course of aminoglycoside therapy taken by the 4 patients who died was due to the interruption of therapy because of acute renal failure in 1 patient and the duration of prescribed therapy in the remaining 3. Among these 18 patients, the administration of aminoglycosides was precluded by renal failure in
4. The remaining patient underwent valvular replacement but was not administered antibiotics, except for a prophylactic antibiotic therapy during surgery. We observed that those patients who recovered had received aminoglycoside therapy for at least 14 days, significantly longer than the duration of treatment among those who died. Therefore, the empiric treatment of blood culture–negative endocarditis, which frequently combines a β-lactam and an aminoglycoside, may be effective for Bartonella endocarditis. For patients with bacillary angiomatosis, one of the keys to success is the duration of treatment, which may include macrolides.

27, 28 However, to the best of our knowledge, aminoglycosides have never been tested in such an indication. Finally, our data strongly suggest that aminoglycosides are effective therapy for the treatment of Bartonella endocarditis, and a minimum 2-week course is the optimal therapy duration.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^1156SRX6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Using the shortest duration of antibiotics based on evidence

The duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed in daily practice is often longer than recommended by guidelines. WHO recommends against prolonging the administration of SAP after surgical intervention to prevent SSIs, based on a meta-analysis of 69 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the optimal duration of SAP. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, CDC guidelines recommend not to give additional doses of prophylactic antibiotics after the surgical incision has been closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Updated guidelines of IDSA and SHEA recommend stopping all SAP at incision closure, regardless of procedure type or duration.

de Jonge et al. examined the effect of continued SAP on the rate of SSI. Eighty-three RCTs were evaluated; 52 (19,273 participants) were included in the primary meta-analysis. No conclusive evidence for the benefit of the post-operative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis (vs. discontinuation) was identified. When combined with a comprehensive approach to best practices in SSI prevention, post-operative continuation of SAP produced no additional benefit in reducing the incidence of SSI in any surgical setting. In a 2019 multicenter retrospective cohort study, increased duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury and CDI, but no reduction in SSIs.

A study of 34 urban and rural South African hospitals demonstrated that implementation of process improvement initiatives and principles targeted to institutional needs, utilizing pharmacists, effectively improved SAP guideline compliance and sustainable patient outcomes. Efforts to shorten antibiotic therapy duration in hospital practice are a growing area of focus for ASPs. However, Langford et al. showed that ASP advice to stop antibiotics or reduce their duration was accepted less often than advice to start or increase antibiotic exposure.

Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy is a crucial tactic for reducing unnecessary inpatient antibiotic use, where antibiotic pressure is intense. Although there are circumstances that may require prolonged antibiotic therapy (e.g. endocarditis, osteomyelitis), the duration of antibiotic therapy should always be as brief as possible. Regarding intra-abdominal infections, the STOP-IT trial demonstrated that, in the setting of adequate source control, 4 days of antibiotic therapy was non-inferior to 8 days of therapy. In the DURAPOP randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with post-operative intra-abdominal infections treated with a short course of antibiotics (8 days) showed similar outcomes compared with those treated for 15 days.

Infectious diseases specialist

The ID specialist provides expertise in both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of IE management. Common clinical scenarios include non-infectious IE, culture-negative IE, extra-cardiac foci of infection, and identification or unusual or atypical microorganisms that must be distinguished from contamination isolated from blood or other specimen sources. The ID specialist has a crucial understanding of the clinical probability of IE, and must indicate when IE remains strongly suspected despite absence of imaging evidence to suggest infection. The ID specialist also guides appropriate investigation to identify the source of infection. The decision on duration of anti-microbial therapy, need and timing of synergistic combination antibiotic therapy, and mitigating the risk of adverse drug events require timely understanding, especially when surgical therapy or device extraction is planned. The ID specialist plays also a key role in adapting antibiotic doses in cases of renal insufficiency, in the choice of antibiotics in cases of allergy, in evaluating whether a course of antibiotics could be completed at home (outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment) and the appropriateness of transitioning from intravenous to oral antibiotics in select patients. In patients with IE episodes managed without surgery despite indications for such, decisions regarding whether long-term suppressive therapy is an option and, if so, what drug(s) are appropriate are better made by ID specialists.

### Evolving trends in infective endocarditis [^115qEfE6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardial surface and, despite improvements in diagnostic accuracy, medical therapy and surgical techniques, mortality remains high. This review focuses on changes in epidemiology, microbiology and diagnosis, as well as changes in medical and surgical management of infective endocarditis affecting native and prosthetic valves in adults, that have evolved during the past two decades. Significant changes have included an increasing involvement of prosthetic valves and nosocomially-acquired disease, an increased involvement of staphylococci as the causative agents, and a recognition that elderly individuals with degenerative valvular disease are the most vulnerable population. Topics still requiring study include whether and when valve replacement should be performed, and how to predict perivalvular complications or embolisation based on echocardiography findings. Optimisation of antimicrobial treatment schemes (choice of the antibiotic, dose and duration) also requires further investigation.

Enterococcus endocarditis — β-lactam–tolerant patients with strains susceptible to penicillin and gentamicin: Regimen options include ampicillin sodium 2 g IV every 4 h for 4–6 weeks plus gentamicin sulfate 3 mg/kg ideal body weight in 2–3 equally divided doses, or aqueous penicillin G sodium 18–30 million U/24 h IV either continuously or in 6 equally divided doses for 4–6 weeks plus gentamicin, each with Class IIa; Level of Evidence B. For native valve disease, 4-wk therapy is recommended for symptoms of illness < 3 mo, with 6-wk therapy for native valve symptoms > 3 mo and for patients with prosthetic valve or prosthetic material, and use is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min; gentamicin dosing should target a peak serum concentration of 3 to 4 μg/mL and a trough concentration of < 1 μg/mL. An alternative double β-lactam regimen is ampicillin 2 g IV every 4 h for 6 weeks plus ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 12 h for 6 weeks (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), recommended for patients with initial creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min or who develop creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min during therapy with a gentamicin-containing regimen.

### Disseminated nocardiosis with infective endocarditis of a transplanted heart [^112dARcg]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Due to lack of randomised trials, the most effective treatment for nocardiosis is not clear. Currently, standard therapy depends on the severity of disease; TMP/SMX is often the initial treatment of choice. When infection is severe (all cases of disseminated disease or CNS involvement as well as infections that involve more than one site in immunocompromised hosts), the combination of intravenous TMP/SMX and amikacin or imipenem is recommended. Life-threatening infections may benefit from treatment with three intravenous antibiotics. Therapy may be adjusted later depending on microbial susceptibilities. While linezolid may be effective against Nocardia, it should generally be avoided when possible given serious side effects such as peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression.

The duration of therapy for nocardiosis depends on the severity of infection, but a typical regimen consists of 6–8 weeks of intravenous therapy followed by prolonged oral therapy. In cases of disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, or in any patient with CNS involvement, a duration of therapy of at least 1 year is recommended. Efficacy of therapy is influenced by the extent of disseminated disease and underlying health of the host. Overall prognosis is improved with early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy. When the underlying cause of immunocompromise cannot be reversed, a higher dose of TMP/SMX for secondary prophylaxis should be considered in patients who recover from nocardiosis; however, more research is needed to determine whether higher doses of TMP/SMX would provide adequate coverage.

Learning points

Nocardiosis is most often a disease of the immunocompromised; Nocardia has the ability to disseminate, most commonly involving the lungs, subcutaneous tissues and central nervous system.
Heart transplant recipients represent a large proportion of immunocompromised patients who become infected with Nocardia.
Infective endocarditis should be considered in patients with disseminated nocardiosis. Physical examination is essential for the identification of regurgitant murmurs and other suggestive findings.
Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) at doses used for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients may not provide coverage for Nocardia. Higher doses of TMP/SMX should be considered for secondary prophylaxis.
The treatment strategy for nocardiosis depends on severity, but generally requires a long duration of intravenous and oral antibiotics.

### Infective endocarditis in adults: diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, and management of complications: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association [^114QwYYb]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, enterococci, susceptible, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering regimens including either ampicillin or aqueous crystalline penicillin G plus gentamicin or ampicillin plus ceftriaxone in patients with IE caused by enterococci susceptible to penicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides. Consider completing either 4 or 6 weeks of ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin therapy in patients with native valve IE, depending on the duration of IE symptoms before the initiation of therapy. Consider completing a 6-week therapy if ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is selected as the treatment regimen, regardless of symptom duration. Consider administering a 6-week antimicrobial therapy in patients with prosthetic valve IE.

### Oral is the new IV. challenging decades of blood and bone infection dogma: a systematic review [^1111jrSf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to determine if controlled, prospective clinical data validate the long-standing belief that intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy is required for the full duration of treatment for 3 invasive bacterial infections: osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and infective endocarditis.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published, prospective, controlled trials that compared IV-only to oral stepdown regimens in the treatment of these diseases. Using the PubMed database, we identified 7 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of osteomyelitis, 9 of bacteremia, 1 including both osteomyelitis and bacteremia, and 3 of endocarditis, as well as one quasi-experimental endocarditis study. Study results were synthesized via forest plots and funnel charts (for risk of study bias), using RevMan 5.4.1 and Meta-Essentials freeware, respectively.

Results

The 21 studies demonstrated either no difference in clinical efficacy, or superiority of oral versus IV-only antimicrobial therapy, including for mortality; in no study was IV-only treatment superior in efficacy. The frequency of catheter-related adverse events and duration of inpatient hospitalization were both greater in IV-only groups.

Discussion

Numerous prospective, controlled investigations demonstrate that oral antibiotics are at least as effective, safer, and lead to shorter hospitalizations than IV-only therapy; no contrary data were identified. Treatment guidelines should be modified to indicate that oral therapy is appropriate for reasonably selected patients with osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis.

### Early and intermediate outcomes for surgical management of infective endocarditis [^111Pq5ot]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

One mechanism to improve outcomes of patients with endocarditis is early detection and treatment. The recommendations for management of these patients was recently published by Baddour et al. All patients with suspected endocarditis should have 3 sets of blood cultures drawn from separate sites and an echocardiogram performed expeditiously. Once the organism is identified then antibiotic specific therapy to sterilize vegetations in IE are started. Furthermore, the duration of therapy must be sufficient to ensure complete eradication of microorganisms within vegetations.

### Safety and efficacy of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) in patients with infective endocarditis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116xRAkt]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis demonstrate that OPAT is an effective and safe treatment option for IE, with favorable mortality, relapse, and readmission outcomes during both treatment and follow‐up periods. However, future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to directly compare OPAT with inpatient care, refine patient selection criteria, and enhance monitoring strategies to optimize outcomes.

### Patient selection criteria and management guidelines for outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy for native valve infective endocarditis [^116VBP7b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) for infective endocarditis (IE) is being applied widely, despite the absence of controlled data that demonstrates that outcomes are equivalent to those with standard inpatient antibiotic therapy. We review existing OPAT guidelines, published data on the timing of complications from IE, and data on risk factors that can be used to predict complications. These data are used to propose more stringent criteria for patient selection and clinical management of OPAT for native valve IE. We recommend a conservative approach (inpatient or daily outpatient follow-up) during the critical phase (weeks 0–2 of treatment), when complications are most likely, and we recommend consideration of OPAT for the continuation phase (weeks 2–4 or 2–6 of treatment) when life-threatening complications are less likely.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis — timing and counting of antimicrobial therapy and combination administration: Infectious diseases consultation should be obtained to define an optimal empirical treatment regimen at the time of initiation of antimicrobial therapy (Class I; Level of Evidence B). It is reasonable that the counting of days for the duration of antimicrobial therapy begin on the first day on which blood cultures are negative in cases in which blood cultures were initially positive (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable to obtain at least 2 sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until bloodstream infection has cleared (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). If operative tissue cultures are positive, then an entire antimicrobial course is reasonable after valve surgery (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B). If operative tissue cultures are negative, it may be reasonable to count the number of days of antimicrobial therapy administered before surgery in the overall duration of therapy (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). It is reasonable to time the administration of antimicrobial therapy at the same time or temporally close together for regimens that include > 1 antimicrobial agent (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).
