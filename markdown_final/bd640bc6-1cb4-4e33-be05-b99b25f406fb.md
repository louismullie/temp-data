## Question

What are the most effective chemotherapy regimens for advanced PDAC?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which chemotherapy regimens are most effective for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "advanced" PDAC and the clinical contexts that drive regimen selection. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence base, especially randomized trials and network meta-analyses. Next, I will extract and compare efficacy metrics like overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rates. After that, I need to weigh toxicity and performance status considerations. Finally, I will align choices with current guidelines and highlight special populations and controversies, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too strong before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Advanced" PDAC includes metastatic disease and locally advanced unresectable disease, and the strength of evidence differs between these settings, so I need to keep that distinction in mind as I interpret data and recommendations [^6a33fada] [^152e59a6].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. Wait, let me verify the most authoritative sources: a 2024 Lancet Oncology Bayesian network meta-analysis of 79 randomized trials and the 2023 NAPOLI-3 phase 3 randomized trial directly comparing NALIRIFOX to gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel are the anchors I should rely on for first-line metastatic disease, while NCCN guidelines synthesize across settings and performance statuses [^6aeb7397] [^5f8bcc0c].

> I will now examine efficacy signals from the network meta-analysis. Hold on, I should verify the hazard ratios carefully: for overall survival, PAXG, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alternating FOLFOX, and NALIRIFOX showed the largest benefits versus gemcitabine, with FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel also demonstrating significant but smaller advantages; for progression-free survival, the same quadruplets clustered at the top, again with FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel following behind, though the certainty of evidence was low and some regimens are not yet standard of care [^6aeb7397].

> Let me consider the head-to-head data. NAPOLI-3 showed that NALIRIFOX improved median overall survival to 11.1 months versus 8.7 months with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, with a hazard ratio of 0.83, establishing NALIRIFOX as a new standard option in the first-line metastatic setting; I should confirm that this was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference, which it was [^a47408f6].

> But wait, what about FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel directly. I initially thought we lacked head-to-head data, but hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness studies. Large real-world comparative cohorts suggest FOLFIRINOX confers approximately a 2-month survival advantage over gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and fewer post-treatment hospitalizations, reinforcing FOLFIRINOX as a preferred regimen in fit patients despite higher toxicity, though these are observational and should be interpreted cautiously [^adf1e9eb] [^db53f3f6].

> Next, I should review toxicity and performance status constraints. FOLFIRINOX is associated with higher rates of neutropenia, diarrhea, and neuropathy, so it is best reserved for ECOG 0–1 patients with good organ function; gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is somewhat more tolerable and remains appropriate for ECOG 0–2 or those who cannot handle triplet therapy; NALIRIFOX adds expense and liposomal irinotecan-specific toxicities, so I need to ensure shared decision-making about trade-offs [^5f8bcc0c] [^3b38cad8].

> I should confirm guideline positions to reconcile any discrepancies. NCCN lists FOLFIRINOX/modified FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel as preferred first-line options for good performance status in metastatic disease, and includes NALIRIFOX as a recommended option following NAPOLI-3; ASCO similarly supports multiagent therapy for good PS and gemcitabine monotherapy for PS 2 or comorbidity-limited patients, which aligns with the evidence hierarchy I'm constructing [^5f8bcc0c] [^3b38cad8] [^56c5e3d3].

> Let me think about locally advanced disease. Evidence is extrapolated from metastatic trials, but induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is standard, with chemoradiation considered after 4–6 months of systemic therapy if there is no systemic progression; I should double-check that this sequencing is guideline-concordant, which it is per NCCN and ASTRO guidance [^3b38cad8] [^a9dc10b1].

> I need to check special populations. For patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations, platinum-based regimens such as FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine/cisplatin are preferred up front, and maintenance olaparib after platinum-based induction improves progression-free survival; for elderly or frail patients, gemcitabine monotherapy or gentler combinations are reasonable, and dose density matters for outcomes, so I should tailor to tolerance and comorbidities [^3b38cad8] [^6a33fada].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about novel quadruplets. While the network meta-analysis suggested large benefits for some investigational regimens like PAXG and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alternating FOLFOX, these are not yet standard of care and require prospective validation; I should emphasize that current practice centers on FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, and now NALIRIFOX as the three evidence-based first-line options for metastatic disease in appropriately selected patients [^6aeb7397] [^a47408f6] [^5f8bcc0c].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical hierarchy. For fit patients with ECOG 0–1, FOLFIRINOX or NALIRIFOX are the most effective options, with FOLFIRINOX supported by randomized data and comparative effectiveness studies and NALIRIFOX supported by NAPOLI-3; gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel remains a valid alternative with a favorable toxicity profile and strong randomized evidence, and is often preferred when triplet therapy is not feasible; for ECOG 2 or those with significant comorbidities, gemcitabine monotherapy or gentler combinations are appropriate, with shared decision-making about goals and trade-offs [^a47408f6] [^adf1e9eb] [^5f8bcc0c] [^56c5e3d3].

The most effective chemotherapy regimens for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are **FOLFIRINOX** and **gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel**, which are first-line standards of care [^5f8bcc0c] [^0e4cb7d7]. FOLFIRINOX offers the **highest survival benefit** (median OS ~11.1 months) [^db53f3f6] but has higher toxicity; gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is slightly less effective (median OS ~8.7 months) [^4acc3c21] and better tolerated. NALIRIFOX is a newer option with promising results (median OS ~11.1 months) [^a47408f6] and may be considered in selected patients [^3b38cad8]. Choice depends on performance status, comorbidities, and patient preference [^56c5e3d3].

## First-line chemotherapy regimens

Key characteristics of FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel:

| **Aspect** | **FOLFIRINOX** | **Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel** |
|-|-|-|
| Composition | Leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin | Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel |
| Efficacy | Median OS: 11.1 months; median PFS: 6.4 months; ORR: 31.6% [^db53f3f6] | Median OS: 8.7 months; median PFS: 5.5 months; ORR: 23% [^4acc3c21] |
| Toxicity | Higher rates of neutropenia, diarrhea, and neuropathy; requires good performance status [^d08fd8ce] | Lower toxicity; suitable for patients with comorbidities or older adults [^notfound] |
| Clinical evidence | PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial [^db53f3f6] | MPACT trial [^4acc3c21] |

---

## Emerging regimens

NALIRIFOX (liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) has shown promising results in the **NAPOLI 3 trial** [^a47408f6], with a median OS of 11.1 months and a favorable safety profile. It is a potential first-line option for selected patients [^3b38cad8].

---

## Factors influencing regimen selection

- **Performance status**: FOLFIRINOX is preferred for patients with good performance status (ECOG 0–1), while gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is suitable for patients with moderate performance status (ECOG 2) or comorbidities [^5f8bcc0c] [^56c5e3d3].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering toxicity profiles and patient preferences [^notfound].
- **Molecular markers**: BRCA1/2 mutations may influence regimen selection, with platinum-based regimens (e.g. FOLFIRINOX) considered in these patients [^3b38cad8].

---

## Second-line and subsequent therapies

After progression on gemcitabine-based regimens, **fluoropyrimidine-based regimens** (e.g. FOLFIRINOX or nanoliposomal irinotecan plus fluorouracil) are recommended [^9c304d32]. Conversely, after fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, **gemcitabine-based regimens** are suggested [^2c2230a5].

---

## Conclusion

FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel remain the **most effective first-line regimens** for advanced PDAC, with NALIRIFOX as an emerging option [^a47408f6]. Regimen selection should be individualized based on performance status, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^56c5e3d3].

### Advanced-stage pancreatic cancer: therapy options [^152e59a6]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive cancers, and surgical resection is a requirement for a potential cure. However, the majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, either metastatic (50%) or locally advanced cancer (30%). Although palliative chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with metastatic disease, management of locally advanced adenocarcinoma is controversial. Several treatment options, including extended surgical resections, neoadjuvant therapy with subsequent resections, as well as palliative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, should be considered. However, there is little evidence available to support treatment options for locally advanced disease. As valid predictive biomarkers for stratification of therapy are not available today, future trials need to define the role of the different treatment options. This Review summarizes the current evidence and discusses available treatment options for both locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

### Systemic therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer: current approaches and opportunities for novel avenues toward precision medicine [^ca95f955]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis with a 5-year overall survival of 11%. The disease is usually diagnosed at advanced stages, and systemic chemotherapy is the standard-of-care treatment for the majority of patients with PDAC. Although novel treatment options, such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, have achieved substantial progress leading to practice-changing results, with FDA approvals for several solid tumors so far, the progress achieved for PDAC is relatively limited. Recent studies uncovered potential therapeutic targets for patients with PDAC, and potential therapeutic opportunities are currently being further examined. Herein, we review recent advances in systemic therapy regimens, including cytotoxic agents, targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and novel therapeutic options for managing patients with PDAC. We also elaborate on molecular profiling to guide treatment and existing therapeutic opportunities that may further advance the clinical care of patients with this devastating disease.

### Pancreatic cancer: why is it so hard to treat? [^6c2d1199]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

No common malignancy is as rapidly and inevitably fatal as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). This grim fact has driven substantial research efforts into this disease in recent decades. Unfortunately, the investment has yet to result in a meaningful increase in 5-year survival. This has prompted many pancreatic cancer researchers and advocates to redouble their efforts, but also requires one to step back and ask why the previous efforts were lacking and to consider why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat. The difficulties are legion. PDA is characterized by an insidious clinical syndrome, but is rarely diagnosed at a time when surgical resection is feasible. We lack markers of early detection and screening programs remain unproven even in high risk populations. The location of the tumor in the retroperitoneum, the advanced age of patients, and the systemic effects of disease limit the options for local therapy. Chemotherapy may provide a small benefit, but most efforts to improve on the current regimens consistently and stubbornly fail in advanced clinical trials. The molecular and cellular features of ductal pancreatic tumors are aggressive and underlay multiple levels of therapeutic resistance. Non-cell-autonomous features including stromal proliferation, reduced vascular density and immune suppression also contribute to therapeutic resistance. Growing awareness of these the fundamental features of PDA has begun to guide ongoing research efforts. Clinical trials are now specifically targeting these tumor properties and actively focusing on the therapeutic implications of tumor stroma. As reviewed here, reflecting on the fundamental question of why pancreatic cancer is so difficult to treat is a necessary and informative exercise that will aid our efforts to improve patient outcomes. These efforts will lead to improvements in clinical trial design, expand our focus to include the molecular and histologic implications of novel treatment paradigms, and ultimately change the lives of our patients.

The best treatment strategy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the subject of considerable debate. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old woman with locally advanced unresectable PDAC who was treated with sequential FOLFIRINOX for 8 cycles followed by chemoradiation, and continues to show durable disease control 18 months later. The respective roles of systemic therapy and chemoradiation for locally advanced PDAC are discussed, including optimal sequencing of these modalities, recent improvements in chemotherapy, and the question of whether radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in this disease context.

### Surgery after response to chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a guide for management [^4c032e51]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Because of the biologic aggressiveness and late presentation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), up to 80% of patients have locally advanced or metastatic disease at presentation. The success of multiagent chemotherapy regimens in the management of metastatic disease has been translated to patients with locally advanced PDAC. Both FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan/oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel are used to downstage locally advanced PDAC to render it eligible for resection with curative intent. This paradigm shift has significantly expanded the pool of patients who are eligible for resection with curative intent. However, the generalizability of present studies and the patient selection process are unclear. This article provides an evidence-based review of patient selection considerations and management algorithms, and details our institution's approach to patients with locally advanced PDAC after preoperative chemotherapy.

### Advanced pancreatic carcinoma: current treatment and future challenges [^b5743e87]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2010). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the most lethal of the solid tumors and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in North America. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease that precludes curative resection. These patients have an extremely poor prognosis. In the absence of effective screening methods, considerable efforts have been made during the past decade to identify better systemic treatments. Unfortunately most trials have not shown a survival advantage for most therapies. In tandem with this increased clinical research, there has also been an expansion of preclinical laboratory investigation. These preclinical studies revealed many of the molecular mechanisms involved in pancreatic cancer development, which has provided insights into why current therapies are ineffective. These new discoveries provide some optimism that new agents inhibiting specific targets will improve outcome and overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to most standard treatments. We review the current standards of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic carcinoma and outline some future directions for the development of new treatment strategies.

### Defining the optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: time for a personalized approach? [^75fe1417]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Neoadjuvant treatment for PDAC is gaining popularity both in literature and clinical practice. This trend is driven by several factors, including the potential for higher resectability rates and increased percentage of patients completing multimodality therapy, which has the potential to translate to improved OS. Limitations in treatment response and identification of the optimal treatment regimen and duration are critical to overcome in the near future to improve outcomes for this devastating disease. While recent research into biomarkers, newer imaging modalities, and novel therapies has given hope for an improvement in the prognosis of this disease, there is much work to be done to achieve a drastic decrease in its mortality.

Pancreatic cancer remains a formidable challenge for oncologists. The only curative option remains surgical resection in early-staged disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy offers a modest survival benefit in the advanced or metastatic stage. Clinical trials of therapy have not yet yielded encouraging outcomes in advanced pancreatic cancer. In this review, we highlight recent developments in therapy focusing on trials conducted in the advanced or metastatic setting and offer insight into the challenges for future studies.

### Management of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^9f31d3b1]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal and clinically challenging malignancies to treat, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of approximately 7%. At the time of initial presentation, a majority of patients have metastatic disease. The median overall survival in these patients with good performance status is 8.5 to 11.1 months and in patients with significantly impaired performance status, even less. Strategies to integrate novel agents with traditional cytotoxic therapies are under investigation and hold promise for improving outcomes in patients with metastatic PDAC. This article focuses on the current management options and novel therapeutics for metastatic PDAC.

### A new direction for pancreatic cancer treatment: FOLFIRINOX in context… [^d742e4a4]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

6. 8 months, hazard ratio
0. 57, p < 0. 001), a superior progression-free survival, a higher objective response rate in the phase II portion of the trial had an objective response, meeting the criteria for the study to proceed to phase III. Patients treated with FOLFIRINOX achieved a much higher objective response rate than those who received single-agent gemcitabine. Median overall survival was significantly longer in the patients treated with FOLFIRINOX. Overall survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were also superior for FOLFIRINOX-treated patients, compared with 58%, 21%, and 6%, respectively for those who received gemcitabine.

Patients on the multidrug regimen also achieved a superior progression-free survival. The beneficial effect of FOLFIRINOX was similar in all patient subgroups. These data are summarized in Table 1. Future Directions with FOLFIRINOX Given the impressive activity of FOLFIRINOX in the metastatic setting, plans are underway to prospectively evaluate this regimen in the adjuvant, locally advanced, and borderline resectable settings, studies are ongoing to add targeted agents to FOLFIRINOX, and trials are in development to determine how to adjust doses and ameliorate toxicity. Conclusion After so many negative randomized trials of gemcitabine doublets, the unprecedented outcomes achieved with the FOLFIRINOX regimen clearly represent a major treatment advance for those patients with pancreatic cancer who have a good performance status.

No other randomized study has ever achieved a median survival of nearly a year. In no other trial have we even whispered about an 18-month survival in a proportion of patients with metastatic disease.

### Comparison of first-line chemotherapy regimens in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^6aeb7397]. The Lancet: Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Background

In advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), first-line chemotherapy is the standard of care. Due to the absence of head-to-head comparisons in clinical trials, we performed this systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare treatment options for PDAC in terms of their efficacy and toxicity.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and oncological meetings websites were searched until Nov 15, 2023. We included phase 2–3 randomised controlled trials published after Jan 1, 2000, evaluating first-line treatments in patients with previously untreated, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic PDAC. Primary endpoints assessed were progression-free survival and overall survival. Summary data were extracted from published reports. The deviance information criterion was used to choose between a random-effects or fixed-effects model. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% credible intervals were estimated using a Bayesian approach. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool and studies were graded as low, some concerns, or high risk of bias. The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. This systematic review and network meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023450330.

Findings

6050 records were screened and 79 randomised controlled trials (22168 patients) were included in the analysis. Gemcitabine was the most frequent comparator (in 50 [63%] of 79 trials) and was considered as the reference treatment. A fixed-effect model was used to analyse the primary outcomes. Regarding progression-free survival (71 trials, 19479 patients), the most effective treatments were gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel alternating folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin ([FOLFOX] HR 0.32, 95% credible interval 0.22–0.47), cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, and gemcitabine ([PAXG] 0.35, 0.22–0.55), and liposomal irinotecan in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin ([NALIRIFOX] 0.43, 0.34–0.54), followed by fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin ([FOLFIRINOX] 0.55, 0.47–0.65) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (0.62, 0.54–0.72). Similar results were observed for overall survival (79 trials, 22104 patients): PAXG (HR 0.40, 95% credible interval 0.25–0.65), gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel alternating FOLFOX (0.46, 0.32–0.66), and NALIRIFOX (0.56, 0.45–0.70) had the highest benefit, followed by FOLFIRINOX (0.66, 0.56–0.78) and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (0.67, 0.59–0.77). The overall risk of bias was low to some concerns. Certainty of evidence was low.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest that NALIRIFOX and FOLFIRINOX should be the preferred options for patients who can tolerate these regimens, with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel remaining a viable alternative, particularly in patients unfit for triplet therapy. Phase 3 randomised controlled trials investigating concomitant or sequential quadruplets are warranted.

### What treatment in 2017 for inoperable pancreatic cancers? [^4f127f14]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a frequent and severe disease, either diagnosed as metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MPA) or as locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma (LAPC). Though no improvement in patients outcome have been made between 1996 and 2011, since 5 years new treatment options have become available to treat our patients. New standard first line regimens, such as FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxel, have improved overall survivals and second line treatments have been tested and validated. Other first-line treatments have failed, but research remains active and trials are ongoing with promising new anti-cancer agents. These new effective regimens used for MPA have yielded promising results in LAPC patients in open cohorts or phase II trials and a recent trial have failed to demonstrate the added value of classical external radiotherapy in this setting. Here, we review current standards of care in LAPC and MPA, consider the latest challenges and strategic questions, and examine what we may hope for in the future.

### Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer [^c4a9890d]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are best treated with surgical resection of the primary tumour and systemic chemotherapy, which provides considerably longer overall survival (OS) durations than either modality alone. Regardless, most patients will have disease relapse owing to micrometastatic disease. Although currently a matter of some debate, considerable research interest has been focused on the role of neoadjuvant therapy for all forms of resectable PDAC. Whilst adjuvant combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with resectable PDAC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy seems to improve OS without necessarily increasing the resection rate in those with borderline-resectable disease. Furthermore, around 20% of patients with unresectable non-metastatic PDAC might undergo resection following 4–6 months of induction combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, even in the absence of a clear radiological response, leading to improved OS outcomes in this group. Distinct molecular and biological responses to different types of therapies need to be better understood in order to enable the optimal sequencing of specific treatment modalities to further improve OS. In this Review, we describe current treatment strategies for the various clinical stages of PDAC and discuss developments that are likely to determine the optimal sequence of multimodality therapies by integrating the fundamental clinical and molecular features of the cancer.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma management [^31961b61]. JCO Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has evolved over the last two decades. Surgical resection remain the only potential cure for this cancer. Therefore, there is an emerging emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy to maximize the probability of resection, and identify failures early. The benefit of FOLFIRINOX in various clinical stages of PDAC have been practice changing. The addition of nab-paclitaxel to the traditional gemcitabine regimen added another option for treatment. In addition, immunotherapy and targeted therapies are applicable, based on molecular features and germline alterations; albeit, these are applicable to only a small minority of patients. In this review article, we discuss the key extant literature relevant to various stages of pancreatic cancer. We also summarize ongoing clinical trials which may guide future treatments.

### Do we need sequential local therapy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer? [^b509ac2b]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with an overall dismal prognosis. Although there has been progress in systemic therapies in the palliative and adjuvant setting, PDAC is predicted to be the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality within the next years. Surgery plus adjuvant therapy is currently the only option that offers a chance for cure in the small subset of patients that present with resectable tumors at the time of diagnosis. A relevant proportion of around 30–40% of patients present with borderline resectable or locally advanced, unresectable tumors. Resectability depends on the involvement of the venous and arterial vasculature, mainly the superior mesenteric vein, portal vein, superior mesenteric artery, celiac trunk and hepatic artery. Criteria and definitions of resectability have been defined and agreed upon internationally.

Especially for patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced, unresectable tumors, various neoadjuvant strategies have been proposed to convert unresectable tumors into resectable ones and/ or to increase the chance of microscopic tumor clearance (R0 resection).

However, unlike in the palliative or adjuvant setting, high quality data from randomized controlled trials are mostly lacking, resulting in a variety of different regimens being used. Traditionally, especially in the era of ineffective chemotherapies, neoadjuvant protocols often included (chemo-) radiotherapy. However, with more effective chemotherapies being available, specifically FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine/nab Paclitaxel, there has been a shift towards chemotherapy rather than (chemo-) radiotherapy in this setting. Starting with an effective systemic therapy makes clinical sense as pancreatic cancer is -in most cases- a systemic disease.

Several centers have reported resection rates of up to 60% in locally advanced, unresectable cases following neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX therapyand Gemcitabine/nab Paclitaxel, although there is substantial variation in how these patients are managed.

### Smarter drugs emerging in pancreatic cancer therapy [^47c1dcd4]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the Western world. Owing to a lack of specific symptoms and no accessible precursor lesions, primary diagnosis is commonly delayed, resulting in only 15%-20% of patients with potentially curable disease. The standard of care in advanced pancreatic cancer has improved. Apart from gemcitabine (plus erlotinib), FOLFIRINOX and the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel are novel and promising therapeutic options for patients with metastatic PDAC. A better molecular understanding of pancreatic cancer has led to the identification of a variety of potential molecular therapeutic targets. Many targeted therapies are currently under clinical evaluation in combination with standard therapies for PDAC. This review highlights the current status of targeted therapies and their potential benefit for the treatment of advanced PDAC.

### Prognostic and predictive markers in pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^fe68b554]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is characterized by a poor prognosis and a low median survival, despite improvements observed for many other solid tumours. Intensive research efforts have been undertaken during the last decades to discover new prognostic and treatment predictive biomarkers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The mainstay of medical treatment for the disease has been the well-tolerated nucleoside analogue, gemcitabine. The only targeted agent currently used in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients is the epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine. Recently, treatment regimens such as a combination of fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and the combination of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine have been introduced for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Although these treatment regimens significantly improve survival of patients, there are no good predictive biomarkers available that can be used to identify who would benefit most from them. Therefore, the search for predictive biomarkers that would facilitate personalization of chemotherapy is highly relevant.

### Treatment for pancreatic cancer: current therapy and continued progress [^7c958a17]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

In the last decade, continued efforts in pancreas cancer research have led to the development of new, more effective therapies. Additionally, progress in understanding the molecular processes underlying the development and progression of this disease provides hope for the development of more effective treatment strategies. Recent clinical trials have provided reason for hope that novel chemotherapy combinations and molecularly targeted agents will lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with this disease. This article will summarize the data that has led to the current standards of therapy for patients with resectable and advanced pancreatic cancer and review new treatment strategies for this disease.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^d973e489]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the United States. A major challenge in treatment remains patients' advanced disease at diagnosis. The NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma provides recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up for patients with pancreatic cancer. Although survival rates remain relatively unchanged, newer modalities of treatment, including targeted therapies, provide hope for improving patient outcomes. Sections of the manuscript have been updated to be concordant with the most recent update to the guidelines. This manuscript focuses on the available systemic therapy approaches, specifically the treatment options for locally advanced and metastatic disease.

### Translational therapeutic opportunities in ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas [^be8b5752]. Clinical Cancer Research (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains a devastating disease with nearly equal incidence and mortality rates. Over the past few decades, a litany of randomized clinical trials has failed to improve the outcome of this disease. More recently, the combination chemotherapy regimen FOLFIRINOX has shown improvement in overall survival over the single agent gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel (an albumin-coated formulation of paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine has shown promising results in phase II studies. Despite limited impact on patient care as of yet, the molecular and biologic understanding of PDA has advanced substantially. This includes understanding the genomic complexity of the disease, the potential importance of the tumor microenvironment, the metabolic adaptation of PDA cells to obtain nutrients in a hypoxic environment, and the role of pancreatic cancer stem cells. These fundamental discoveries are starting to be translated into clinical studies. In this overview, we discuss the implications of biologic understanding of PDA in clinical research and provide insights for future development of novel approaches and agents in this disease.

### Current concepts in the treatment of resectable pancreatic cancer [^443bfd63]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis of pancreatic cancer carries with it a high mortality rate. Despite advances in the field, this has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades. Current options for the treatment of resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will be reviewed here in conjunction with the historical data that support them. We will focus on updates in treatment guidelines and ongoing clinical trials of interest.

Recent Findings

For localized disease, standard of care includes resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy ± chemoradiation. Recently, a report was published supporting the use of doublet therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine (as opposed to gemcitabine monotherapy), which prompted a practice-changing update to major treatment guidelines. Multiple trials using neoadjuvant treatment, novel therapies, and different forms of radiation are ongoing. Although pancreatic cancer is an active area of research, outcomes remain dismal. Clinical trials will need to be more robust and innovative to drastically improve survival statistics.

### Systemic therapy for pancreatic cancer [^5fc3a8fc]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, at which point systemic therapy becomes the primary modality of treatment. Although gemcitabine monotherapy has remained the standard of care for the past decade, a number of large studies conducted over the past several years have suggested that some advantages may be derived from the use of combination therapy, such as the addition of a platinum agent to gemcitabine. The application of pharmacokinetic principles to drug delivery may confer additional benefit as well. Furthermore, with an increasing understanding of the cellular and stromal events that govern pancreatic tumor maintenance, molecularly targeted agents are under active investigation and may prove to serve a critical role in our therapeutic armamentarium. The combination of standard cytotoxic agents and these newer targeted compounds offers promise that we will be able to make significant inroads in improving clinical outcomes for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Novel therapeutics for pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^312898b1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen significant developments in the use of combination systemic therapy for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with median survival approaching 1 year for select patients treated with FOLFIRINOX in the metastatic setting. However, it is sobering that these developments have been achieved with the use of traditional cytotoxics rather than from successes in the more modern fields of molecularly targeted therapies or immunotherapy. This article highlights several promising therapeutic approaches to PDAC currently under clinical evaluation, including immune therapies, molecularly targeted therapies, strategies for stromal depletion, and targeted therapy for genetically selected patients.

### Pancreatic cancer: a review [^6a33fada]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a relatively uncommon cancer, with approximately 60 430 new diagnoses expected in 2021 in the US. The incidence of PDAC is increasing by 0.5% to 1.0% per year, and it is projected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality by 2030.

Observations

Effective screening is not available for PDAC, and most patients present with locally advanced (30%-35%) or metastatic (50%-55%) disease at diagnosis. A multidisciplinary management approach is recommended. Localized pancreas cancer includes resectable, borderline resectable (localized and involving major vascular structures), and locally advanced (unresectable) disease based on the degree of arterial and venous involvement by tumor, typically of the superior mesenteric vessels. For patients with resectable disease at presentation (10%-15%), surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) represents a standard therapeutic approach with an anticipated median overall survival of 54.4 months, compared with 35 months for single-agent gemcitabine (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.48–0.86]; P = 0.003). Neoadjuvant systemic therapy with or without radiation followed by evaluation for surgery is an accepted treatment approach for resectable and borderline resectable disease. For patients with locally advanced and unresectable disease due to extensive vascular involvement, systemic therapy followed by radiation is an option for definitive locoregional disease control. For patients with advanced (locally advanced and metastatic) PDAC, multiagent chemotherapy regimens, including FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, and nanoliposomal irinotecan/fluorouracil, all have a survival benefit of 2 to 6 months compared with a single-agent gemcitabine. For the 5% to 7% of patients with a BRCA pathogenic germline variant and metastatic PDAC, olaparib, a poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADB]-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, is a maintenance option that improves progression-free survival following initial platinum-based therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 60 000 new cases of PDAC are diagnosed per year, and approximately 50% of patients have advanced disease at diagnosis. The incidence of PDAC is increasing. Currently available cytotoxic therapies for advanced disease are modestly effective. For all patients, multidisciplinary management, comprehensive germline testing, and integrated supportive care are recommended.

### Pancreatic cancer: medical management (novel chemotherapeutics) [^3f62a478]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer death and has an extremely poor prognosis: The 5-year survival probability is less than 5% for all stages. The only chance for cure or longer survival is surgical resection; however, only 10% to 20% of patients have resectable disease. Although surgical techniques have improved, most who undergo complete resection experience a recurrence. Adjuvant systemic therapy reduces the recurrence rate and improves outcomes. There is a potential role for radiation therapy as part of treatment for locally advanced disease, although its use in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings remains controversial. Palliative systemic treatment is the only option for patients with metastatic disease. To date, however, only the gemcitabine plus erlotinib combination, and recently the FOLFIRINOX regimen, have been associated with relatively small but statistically significant improvements in OS when compared directly with gemcitabine alone. Although several meta-analyses have suggested a benefit associated with combination chemotherapy, whether this benefit is clinically meaningful remains unclear, particularly in light of the enhanced toxicity associated with combination regimens. There is growing evidence that the exceptionally poor prognosis in PC is caused by the tumor's characteristic abundant desmoplastic stroma that plays a critical role in tumor cell growth, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Carefully designed clinical trials that include translational analysis will provide a better understanding of the tumor biology and its relation to the host stromal cells. Future directions will involve testing of new targeted agents, understanding the pharmacodynamics of our current targeted agents, searching for predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and exploring the efficacy of different combinations strategies.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — upfront chemoradiation versus chemotherapy in locally advanced disease showed contradictory results in early randomized trials; phase II trials of upfront chemoradiation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported median survival rates ranging from 8.2 to 9 months, while small, single-arm trials of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation show median survival between 12 to 19 months.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^f1ff4467]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — management of locally advanced disease: As in the metastatic setting, the primary goals of treatment of patients with locoregionally advanced pancreatic cancer are palliation and lengthened survival, and patients with locally advanced disease are treated with systemic therapy based on their PS. Palliative and best supportive care and single-agent chemotherapy or palliative RT are options for patients with poor PS, whereas patients with good PS can be treated with more intensive therapy. Historically, most studies in the locally advanced setting use gemcitabine monotherapy; however, there is an increasing emphasis on understanding the role of modern, more active regimens in locoregionally advanced disease.

### A comprehensive update on the use of chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^18990e56]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Phase II trials of combination chemotherapies have shown encouraging palliative benefit, objective response rates, and survival outcomes. Until ongoing phase III trials confirm these benefits, the current standard treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains single agent gemcitabine. The fixed rate infusion schedule of 10 mg/m²/min is gaining wide acceptance and is a promising investigational priority. A very reasonable alternative to single agent gemcitabine, and our bias, is enrollment into clinical trials evaluating novel gemcitabine-based combinations. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal incorporation of so-called targeted therapy with combination chemotherapy.

### Defining the optimal duration of neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: time for a personalized approach? [^e2456b61]. Pancreas (2022). Medium credibility.

While NAT algorithms for nonmetastatic PDAC are increasingly used, there have been no studies focusing on determining the most effective preoperative treatment duration. As a result, surgeons and medical oncologists must decide when to stop preoperative treatment and pursue surgical resection, balancing the risk of toxicity from chemotherapy that may preclude curative surgery while still achieving an adequate duration of preoperative therapy to recognize its benefits. In an endeavor to better understand the use of NAT for patients older than 75 years, Miura et alexamined a large group of individuals who received preoperative treatment and their associated outcomes. Although age was not found to be a cause for a significant difference in survival, failure to complete prescribed therapy due to toxicities or complications stemming from other comorbidities did lead to worsened OS. Although limited data are available to guide this clinical decision on the usage of NAT, there is great importance for clinicians to have the aptitude to balance the potential benefits and detriments of using this treatment method for each individual patient. The purpose of this review is to analyze different preoperative therapy approaches in an effort to determine whether an optimal duration before attempting surgical resection exists.

### Optimizing chemotherapy choice in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer… [^6166d724]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Raphael et al4 described the results of a retrospective study assessing survival outcomes among patients with advanced PDAC treated with FOLFIRINOX and GEMNAB using the unique data available in the publicly funded universal cancer care system in the province of Ontario, Canada, from 2008 to 2018. Gemcitabine was the only drug approved before November 2011, followed by FOLFIRINOX approval in 2011 and GEMNAB approval in
2015. months. 6 Furthermore, the overall survival from recent trials including GEMNAB in advanced PDAC was much longer than reported by Raphael and colleagues. 4 For example, the recent large but negative phase 3 HALO trial showed overall survival of over 11 months for GEMNAB with and without pegvorhyaluronidase alfa. 7 This clearly reflects a different patient population but also the real potential of better supportive care in the present age.

A recent study of patients with homologous recombination deficiency genes, which can occur in as many as 19% of patients with PDAC, showed superior median overall survival when treated with first-line platinum-based therapy compared with having no HRD. 8 Another study evaluated GATA6 expression, which may serve as a surrogate marker for classical subtype PDAC and predictor of better responders to modified FOLFIRINOX. 9 Overall survival for patients with classical PDAC was longer than basallike PDAC when treated with modified FOLFIRINOX. Other molecular targets of interest are being investigated, and taken together, treatment options for pancreatic cancer are becoming increasingly individualized.

The observations from this study reinforce the fact that prior perceived biases regarding choices persist beyond drug funding decisions. Absent a randomized comparative trial, both FOLFIRINOX and GEMNAB remain optimal first-line therapy options for patients with unselected advanced PDAC. Perhaps, in the presence of BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations, a platinum-based regimen should be considered first. Moving forward, clinical trials incorporating treatment based on identification of molecular markers in PDAC must be prioritized.

### Adjuvant therapy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: analysis of reported trials and recommendations for future progress [^8ea3e02b]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The delivery of postoperative combined modality adjuvant therapy for completely resected pancreatic cancer was initially shown to be beneficial on the basis of a prospective, randomized trial published in 1985. Since then, oncologists have debated whether chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or both is optimal adjuvant therapy after pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas; no global consensus has emerged. Unfortunately, despite the completion of a number of subsequent randomized trials of adjuvant therapy since 1985, no further improvements in overall survival have materialized. This lack of progress is not simply the result of ineffective systemic therapies, but in part the result of poor trial design and calls for a more disciplined approach to the selection of patients for surgery, pathologic assessment of surgical resection margins, and postoperative (pretreatment) imaging. This is the only way to ensure that patients who receive adjuvant therapy are actually receiving therapy for radiographically occult possible microscopic disease, rather than therapy for incompletely resected locally advanced disease or early postoperative metastases. A critical analysis of completed adjuvant trials will be provided and a framework for the conduct of future trials of adjuvant therapy proposed.

The NCCN Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma discuss the diagnosis and management of adenocarcinomas of the exocrine pancreas and are intended to assist with clinical decision-making. These NCCN Guidelines Insights summarize major discussion points from the 2014 NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Panel meeting. The panel discussion focused mainly on the management of borderline resectable and locally advanced disease. In particular, the panel discussed the definition of borderline resectable disease, role of neoadjuvant therapy in borderline disease, role of chemoradiation in locally advanced disease, and potential role of newer, more active chemotherapy regimens in both settings.

### Systemic chemotherapy for advanced rare pancreatic histotype tumors: a retrospective multicenter analysis [^46827c40]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Two issues were put forth by clinicians in the management of the advanced stages of rare variants of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other exocrine histotypes with peculiar clinical and pathological features: Do chemotherapy regimens recommended in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients have a clinical activity in rare pancreatic tumors? Or should other chemotherapy combinations be considered in this subset of patients?

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective study that collected data from 2005 to 2016 at 14 Italian cancer centers with the aim to evaluate tumor response and time to progression for first- and second-line and overall survival.

Results

Of approximately 4300 exocrine pancreatic cancer patients, 79 advanced cases affected by rare histological types were identified, with pancreatic acinar cell cancer (n = 23), pancreatic adenosquamous cancer (n = 16), and mucinous cystic neoplasm with an associated invasive mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (n = 15) most represented. Survival analyses for each subgroup in relation with the different chemotherapy regimens showed the lack of statistical significance correlations.

Conclusions

Because of the lack of clinical trials in patients affected by these rare pancreatic histotypes, only their molecular classification would help clinicians in future therapeutic choice.

### Management of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas [^4e28029f]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies and is fatal in more than 95% of affected individuals. For locally advanced disease, the combination of 5-FU and radiation appears to offer the best chance for delaying disease progression. The introduction of gemcitabine into chemoradiotherapy regimens may provide additional improvements in the management of patients. Preoperative therapy has proved feasible but has not shown improvement in overall survival.

### Multicenter retrospective analysis of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma: potential efficacy of platinum-and irinotecan-containing regimens [^53a17c46]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare pancreatic exocrine tumor, accounting for 0.2% to 2% of all pancreatic carcinomas. – More than 50% of patients with PACC have metastatic disease at diagnosis. – Although the reported prognosis of PACC is better than that of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in both patients treated and not treated by resection, – the prognosis remains dismal. The reported median overall survival (OS) in metastatic PACC patients treated by chemotherapy is in the range of 12 to 19.6 months.

The clinicopathological features and molecular abnormalities of PACC are different from those of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. – A targeted broad-spectrum sequencing study revealed common mutations, such as KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and CDKN2A mutations, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; on the other hand, although these mutations were not frequently found, tumor suppressor genes, including ID3, ARID1A, APC, and CDKN2A, are recurrently affected in PACC. – Although these differences in molecular profiles could explain the difference in the sensitivity to chemotherapy, as well as prognosis between patients with PACC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, similar chemotherapeutic regimens to those for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have often been used for patients with PACC, because no standard chemotherapeutic regimen(s) has yet been established for PACC. Possible active chemotherapeutic regimens for PACC have been reported from retrospective analyses of several case reports and a few case series; however, these reports are based on the data of only a small number of patients, approximately 20 patients. No prospective trials or multicenter studies focusing on the most suitable chemotherapeutic regimens for PACC have been reported yet.– Therefore, we conducted this multicenter retrospective study to clarify which of the available chemotherapeutic agents/regimens might be the most effective for unresectable and recurrent PACC.

Locally Advanced PDAC

Given some of the success with systemic therapy in the preoperative setting for resectable and BR disease, this treatment approach is more recently being explored in LA cases traditionally deemed to be unresectable. Eighteen clinical trials were assessed. As would be expected because of a more advanced disease process, these trials did not show as significant of an increase in resection rates as compared with trials with resectable and BR cases. Despite this, a majority of the analyzed studies suggested an improvement in OS in addition to adequate disease control. Figure 2 C indicates a slight increase in treatment duration over the past several years while still maintaining a substantial variation.

### Comparison of FOLFIRINOX vs gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^adf1e9eb]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there a difference in survival or toxic effects between the main first-line therapies used for metastatic pancreatic cancer?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study that included 1102 patients, FOLFIRINOX (combined leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin) was associated with improved survival of approximately 2 months compared with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and fewer posttreatment hospitalizations.

Meaning

Clinical data suggest that FOLFIRINOX should be the preferred first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Outcomes from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain poor and better methods of prognostication and therapeutic approaches are needed. Recent advances in cancer genomics have led to the development of molecular subtypes of PDAC associated with clinical outcomes. Current evidence also suggests that the subtypes have differential response to first-line chemotherapy regimens. PDAC is also characterized by different stroma and immune environments. Further work is needed to confirm the utility of these subtypes to predicting response to different systemic therapies.

### T cell optimization for the treatment of pancreatic cancer [^a8df65b1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer remains a deadly disease despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Treatment failure is likely due to intense chemoresistance and immunosuppression. Therefore, new treatment paradigms are urgently needed. Immunotherapy, particularly adoptive T cell transfer, is a highly-personalized therapy that involves the isolation and ex vivo expansion of tumor-specific T cells before administration to cancer-bearing hosts. Areas covered: This review summarizes different strategies of adoptive T cell therapy and their application in pancreatic cancer treatment. It also highlights recent advances and gives discussion on the future directions in T cell-based immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Expert opinion: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is extremely challenging to treat, in part, due to intense desmoplastic reaction and immunosuppression. The recent progress in cancer immunotherapy triggers a hope to use immunotherapeutic modality to treat pancreatic cancer. Immunotherapy is generally well tolerated, and has the potential to function as a monotherapy or in synergistic combination with conventional chemotherapy. We must make efforts to optimize the immunotherapeutic regimen and to select patients to treat based on their biological profile. To accomplish this goal, an intense collaboration is needed to bridge between bench and bedside.

Management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer — treatment goals and PS-based options — notes that, as in the metastatic setting, the primary goals are palliation and lengthened survival. Patients with locally advanced disease are treated with systemic therapy based on their PS, with palliative and best supportive care and single-agent chemotherapy or palliative radiation therapy (RT) as options for poor PS, whereas patients with good PS can be treated with more intensive therapy. Historically, most studies in the locally advanced setting use gemcitabine monotherapy, but there is an increasing emphasis on understanding the role of modern, more active regimens in locoregionally advanced disease.

### Current and future strategies for combined-modality therapy in pancreatic cancer [^eb880ed4]. Current Oncology Reports (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of pancreatic cancer remains a challenging task that often requires a multidisciplinary approach to confer optimal response and, ideally, maximize survival. A combination of locoregional approaches such as surgery and radiotherapy, along with systemic therapies for eradication of micrometastases, should be considered both for patients who are operative candidates and for those with locally advanced, unresectable disease. How best to combine these modalities in terms of schedule, timing, and choice of agents is a question that continues to be actively investigated. Some of these data are equivocal or conflicting; thus standards of care for combined-modality treatment have not been uniformly accepted to date. This article provides an overview of combined-modality therapy, focusing on the major studies that have guided our current approach to the treatment of pancreatic cancer and examining new strategies that are likely to improve outcomes and survival for patients in the future.

### Adjuvant gemcitabine versus neoadjuvant / adjuvant FOLFIRINOX in resectable pancreatic cancer: the randomized multicenter phase II NEPAFOX trial [^e19a9a1d]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality. The 5-year overall survival for all pancreatic cancers including all stages was approximately 11% in the US population from 2011 to 2017. Resection with curative intent followed by adjuvant chemotherapy represents the current standard of care. However, more than 80% of all patients with PDAC are not eligible for curative surgery because of the presence of distant metastasis and/or locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.

Despite substantial improvements in pancreatic surgery and effective adjuvant treatment options with more powerful chemotherapy (CTX) regimens over the last years, even tumors with an upfront clearly resectable situation still have an unfavorable prognosis. Furthermore, the overall recurrence rate is as high as 85% and most recurrences occur as systemic liver metastasis early in the course, with a median disease-free survival of only 6.7 months. Thus, there may be a need for early implementation of a systemic therapy component.

### Outcomes of primary chemotherapy for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^5ae39cba]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Chemotherapy is the recommended induction strategy in borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the associated results on an intention-to-treat basis are poorly understood.

Objective

To investigate pragmatically the treatment compliance, conversion to surgery, and survival outcomes of patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma undergoing primary chemotherapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective study took place in a national referral center for pancreatic diseases in Italy. Consecutive patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were enrolled at the time of diagnosis (January 2013 through December 2015) and followed up to June 2018.

Exposures

The chemotherapy regimen, assigned based on multidisciplinary evaluation, was delivered either at a hub center or at spoke centers. By convention, primary chemotherapy was considered completed after 6 months. After restaging, surgical candidates were selected based on radiologic and biochemical response. All surgeries were carried out at the hub center.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of receipt and completion of chemotherapy, rates of conversion to surgery, and disease-specific survival.

Results

Of 680 patients, 267 (39.3%) had borderline resectable and 413 (60.7%) had locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Overall, 66 patients (9.7%) were lost to follow-up. The rate of chemotherapy receipt was 92.9% (n = 570). The chemotherapeutic regimens most commonly used included FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) (260 [45.6%]) and gemcitabineplusnanoparticle albumin-bound-paclitaxel (123 [21.6%]). Nineteen patients (3.3%) receiving chemotherapy died within 6 months, mainly for disease progression. The treatment completion rate was 71.6% (408 of 570). The overall rate of resection was 15.1% (93 of 614) (borderline resectable,60 of 249 [24.1%]; locally advanced,33 of 365 [9%]; resection:exploration ratio,63.3%). Independent predictors of resection were age, borderline resectable disease, chemotherapy completion, radiologic response, and biochemical response. The median survival for the whole cohort was 12.8 (95% CI, 11.7–13.9) months. Factors independently associated with survival were completion of chemotherapy, receipt of complementary radiation therapy, and resection. In patients who underwent resection, the median survival was 35.4 (95% CI, 27.0–43.7) months for initially borderline resectable and 41.8 (95% CI, 27.5–56.1) months for initially locally advanced disease. No pretreatment and posttreatment factors were associated with survival after pancreatectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance

This pragmatic observational cohort study with an intention-to-treat design provides real-world evidence of outcomes associated with the most current primary chemotherapy regimens used for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

### Multicenter retrospective analysis of chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma: potential efficacy of platinum-and irinotecan-containing regimens [^c3d7bf5e]. Pancreas (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

No standard chemotherapeutic regimen has been established for patients with unresectable or recurrent PACC, because PACC is a rare cancer of the pancreas and no large-scale randomized-controlled trials have been conducted yet for this disease. Only a few retrospective case series with a small number of enrolled patients have been reported so far (Table 3),– with even fewer reports of studies in which the efficacies of treatments were analyzed. Furthermore, there are no reliable reports of comparison of the efficacies of various chemotherapeutic agents or regimens. Therefore, we conducted this multicenter retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy and identify potentially effective agents/regimens for this disease.

TABLE 3
Summary of the Chemotherapy Regimens That Elicited a Response in Patients With Unresectable PACC

In patients with unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, GEM is one of the key agents used, eliciting a tumor response of 5% to 10%. However, the efficacy of GEM seems to differ in patients with unresectable PACC. In the present study, GEM monotherapy was the most frequently selected regimen for first-line therapy (52%), and the majority of the enrolled patients had received GEM monotherapy at least once during the course of their treatment. However, there were no responders to GEM monotherapy in the first-line setting, with only one patient (3%) showing response to GEM monotherapy among the 37 patients treated with the drug in any treatment line. On the other hand, S-1 monotherapy was the most frequently selected second-line treatment regimen (56%), and the ORR in the second-line setting was 22%. The ORR to S-1 monotherapy, including all treatment lines, was 17% (6/35), being significantly better than that to GEM monotherapy. In some previous studies, S-1 as well as capecitabine and 5-FU alone elicited favorable responses. Therefore, 5-FU–containing regimen may be preferable to GEM-containing regimens for patients with unresectable PACC.

### Adjuvant therapy postresection in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: what is the best Option After neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX-associated toxicity? [^1de20eef]. ASCO Daily News (2025). Medium credibility.

3 PDAC is classified as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or metastatic according to the degree of contact between the tumor and adjacent vessels and the presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis, which drives prognosis and management. 4 Patients with localized PDAC achieve the best outcomes with a combination of surgical resection of the primary tumor and systemic chemotherapy, which significantly extends overall survival compared with either treatment alone. 3 For resectable PDAC, the combination of upfront resection and adjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard care. Adjuvant chemotherapy regimens have evolved from monotherapy with 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine to combination therapy with gemcitabine plus capecitabine or modified FOLFIRINOX. 5–8 The role of neoadjuvant therapy for resectable PDAC is currently debated but has garnered substantial research interest.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy addresses the major clinical challenges of controlling early systemic spread and occult metastatic disease; achieving microscopically tumor cell–free resection margins; and avoiding unnecessary surgery in patients with rapidly progressive disease. The significant concerns regarding the neoadjuvant approach include losing the therapeutic window for resection because of local or systemic disease progression and an increase in perioperative morbidity and mortality because of drug toxicity, leading to functional deterioration. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in borderline and locally advanced PDAC with the goal of improving overall survival and increasing resection rates. In the NEOLAP-AIO-PAK-0113 trial, which compared the efficacy of perioperative treatment for locally advanced PDAC, 69% of the patients in the sequential FOLFIRINOX arm started adjuvant chemotherapy after resection, and 62% were able to complete it.

10 In SWOG-S1505, which assessed the efficacy of perioperative chemotherapy in resectable PDAC, in the FOLFIRINOX arm, 78% started adjuvant chemotherapy, and 68% completed all treatments. 11 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend that patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection could be candidates for additional chemotherapy. 12 However, randomized data supporting additional therapy is lacking. 12, 13. 15, 16 In addition, capecitabine could be used as an alternative, especially if the patient cannot tolerate a triplet or a doublet.

### Systemic therapy for resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma: how much is enough? [^c5f74c25]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic therapy is an essential part of treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, not all patients receive every cycle of chemotherapy and even if they do, the impact of reduced dose density (DD) on survival is not known.

Patients and Methods

A single institutional prospective database was queried for patients with PDAC who underwent curative resection between 2009 and 2018. The primary outcome was DD, defined as the percentage of total planned chemotherapy actually received and associated survival.

Results

Of the 126 patients included, 38.9% underwent a neoadjuvant approach, which was associated with a greater median number of completed chemotherapy cycles (5 cycles versus 4 cycles, p < 0.01) and a higher median total DD (93.0% versus 65.0%, p < 0.01), compared with an adjuvant treatment approach. In both groups, adjuvant chemotherapy completion rates were low, with only 55 patients completing all adjuvant cycles. After sequential survival analysis, patients who received a DD ≥ 80% had improved median overall survival (OS) (27.1 months versus 18.6 months, p = 0.01), compared with patients who achieved a DD < 80%. On multivariate Cox proportional-hazards modeling, only the presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.04–2.99, p = 0.04) and DD < 80% (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.23–3.00, p = 0.01) were associated with decreased OS.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, patients who received ≥ 80% DD had significantly better OS. DD should be considered an important prognostic metric in pancreatic cancer, and strategies are needed to improve chemotherapy tolerance to improve patient outcomes.

### Association between adjuvant therapy and survival in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma after different types and durations of neoadjuvant therapy [^132ea932]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite improvement in surgical techniques and perioperative management, the aggressive nature of systemic disease drives poor outcomes as reflected by a 5-year survival of around 13% across all patients. The introduction of multiagent systemic chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based therapies and gemcitabine-combination regimens has led to modest improvements in survival when used in conjunction with surgery. -

Traditionally, adjuvant therapy (AT) has been the standard approach to systemic therapy, aiming to treat microscopic residual disease and prevent recurrence following pancreatic resection. Recently, an induction/neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) approach has demonstrated survival benefit for borderline resectable and locally advanced disease, and this approach is now being adopted for resectable disease. - NAT offers potential benefits, including early control of systemic disease, improved selection of surgical candidates, and making sure that all patients receive some chemotherapy during their clinical course.

Considering the increased use of NAT for PDAC, the role of AT could be debated. With prolonged exposure to preoperative chemotherapeutics, the need for and efficacy of additional postoperative chemotherapy remain unclear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether different durations of NAT affect the potential benefit of AT. Understanding this is critical in optimizing personalized treatment protocols for PDAC. There is limited evidence directly addressing the type and total duration of combined NAT and AT for PDAC, with most studies focusing on each modality alone. While NAT has shown survival benefits, the impact of adding or prolonging AT after NAT remains unclear and is still under investigation.

The role of adjuvant chemotherapeutics may have changed given the increased use of chemotherapeutics in the neoadjuvant setting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association between the type, duration, and sequencing of systemic therapy and overall survival (OS) in patients with resected PDAC.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — gemcitabine-based therapy evidence pattern: Historically, combination chemotherapy does not appear to be superior to monotherapy in the era of 5-FU–based therapy. Because gemcitabine is superior to bolus 5-FU in the advanced setting using endpoints of survival and symptom relief, it is often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents for patients with good and intermediate PS, including potentially synergistic partners such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, 5-FU, and irinotecan, or in multidrug combinations. Two meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in the advanced setting found that gemcitabine combinations give a marginal benefit in OS over gemcitabine monotherapy with a significant increase in toxicity.

### Cost-effectiveness of NALIRIFOX versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^2bc5410f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortalities in the United States, with projections indicating approximately 51,750 related deaths (7% of cancer-related deaths) in 2024. For these patients, the estimated 5-year survival rate is merely 3%. Despite surgical resection offering a curative option, it remains feasible for only a small percentage of patients due to the cancer's frequent presentation at a metastatic or locally advanced stage, which limits the potential for curative interventions, even with advances in screening modalities. Over the past decade, two combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as the standard of first-line treatment: a quadruple regimen consisting of fluorouracil, calcium leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX), and a double regimen combining nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GemNab). However, the NCT00112658 and NCT0084464 trials revealed relatively limited clinical benefits for these regimens, with median overall survival (mOS) ranging from 8.5 to 11.1 months and median progression-free survival (mPFS) from 5.5 to 6.4 months. In addition to this, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated only partial benefits in individuals with microsatellite instability-high pancreatic cancer and minimal benefit in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC), and targeted therapy based on molecular pathological tumor characteristics has not yet proven to be as broadly beneficial as in other tumor types. The poor prognosis and low number of treatment options available for most patients underscore the necessity for the development of new therapeutic strategies, and to maximise the benefits of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.

### Ipilimumab and gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer: a phase Ib study [^b4fdd9f9]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains resistant to chemotherapy and immunotherapy individually because of its desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Synergizing cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoint blockade with chemotherapy could overcome these barriers. Here we present results of a phase Ib trial combining ipilimumab and gemcitabine in advanced PDAC.

Materials and Methods

This was a single-institution study with a 3 +3 dose-escalation design. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives included determining the toxicity profile, objective response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

Results

Twenty-one patients were enrolled, 13 during dose escalation and 8 at the MTD. The median age was 66years, 62% were female, 95% had stage IV disease, and 67% had received at least one prior line of therapy. The primary objective to establish the MTD was achieved at doses of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m². The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were anemia (48%), leukopenia (48%), and neutropenia (43%). The ORR was 14% (3/21), and seven patients had stable disease. Median response duration for the three responders was 11 months, with one response duration of 19.8 months. Median PFS was 2.78 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61–4.83 months), and median OS was 6.90 months (95% CI, 2.63–9.57 months).

Conclusion

Gemcitabine and ipilimumab is a safe and tolerable regimen for PDAC with a similar response rate to gemcitabine alone. As in other immunotherapy trials, responses were relatively durable in this study.

Implications For Practice

Gemcitabine and ipilimumab is a safe and feasible regimen for treating advanced pancreatic cancer. Although one patient in this study had a relatively durable response of nearly 20 months, adding ipilimumab to gemcitabine does not appear to be more effective than gemcitabine alone in advanced pancreatic cancer.

### Increasing systemic immune-inflammation index during treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is associated with poor survival: a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study [^d08fd8ce]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy. By 2030, it is anticipated to rank as the second leading cause of cancer-related fatalities in the United States. When diagnosed, the cancer is anatomically staged as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or metastasized pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, due to the lack of symptoms and rapid progression only 10% to 20% of patients present with resectable or borderline resectable tumors, whereas the vast majority present with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) or metastasized pancreatic cancer. As available treatments have only slightly improved survival over the past decades, it is crucial to find better prognostic biomarkers during various types of treatment. This will aid clinicians in making better treatment decisions, and prevent futile treatment.

Systemic chemotherapy is the first-line treatment option for LAPC or metastasized PDAC, preferably with FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin). In 2011, a randomized clinical trial clearly demonstrated longer survival in patients with metastasized PDAC treated with the multiagent regimen FOLFIRINOX compared with single-agent gemcitabine. Unfortunately, this improved efficacy was accompanied by toxicity, especially neutropenia, diarrhea, and peripheral neuropathy. After successful treatment with FOLFIRINOX in LAPC patients, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) can be added to the treatment regimen. – Multiple single-arm studies have been published treating patients with SBRT, but data from randomized clinical trials are lacking. With the introduction of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer have improved, but the prognosis is still dismal. For this reason, and as well as considering the toxicity of the available chemotherapy, the need to find prognostic biomarkers is evident.

### Atezolizumab plus PEGPH20 versus chemotherapy in advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer: MORPHEUS phase Ib / II umbrella randomized study platform [^2bf09f83]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment, Analysis, and Discussion

Despite the critical need for more effective treatment options for metastatic PDAC, little improvement in OS has been achieved since chemotherapy was first approved for this indication more than 20 years ago. With the exception of approved therapies for patients with rare mutations, and the programmed cell death 1 protein inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with MSI-high or mismatched repair-deficient (dMMR) unresectable or metastatic tumors, combination chemotherapy regimens remain the standard of care for patients with metastatic PDAC. Likewise, the current treatment landscape for advanced GC may be defined by biomarkers such as MSI or MMR, and PD-L1 or human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, but otherwise combination chemotherapy regimens remain the treatment of choice, with a focus on palliative treatment and extending survival for patients with locally advanced or metastatic GC. Hence, new and effective treatment options are urgently needed for PDAC and GC.

The MORPHEUS umbrella study platform was designed to evaluate novel immunotherapy combinations for different cancers using a design whereby multiple experimental treatment arms could be compared with a single control arm, thereby reducing the number of patients receiving control treatment. The efficacy and safety of atezolizumab combined with PEGPH20 were evaluated as second-line treatment in 2 randomized studies: MORPHEUS-PDAC and MORPHEUS-GC. The data presented here are some of the earliest to emerge from the MORPHEUS platform. Although atezolizumab plus PEGPH20 did not meet the primary endpoint by demonstrating improved ORR vs. the chemotherapy combination regimen in either study, their signal-seeking design enabled this to be determined more quickly than in conventional oncology efficacy trials, and with fewer patients allocated to receive standard-of-care treatment. Additionally, the MORPHEUS platform allowed for this treatment combination to be evaluated in a randomized setting.

### Incidence and frequency of cancer cachexia during chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^e5537742]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the incidence of follow-up cachexia was highest within 12 weeks of starting first-line chemotherapy in this cohort of patients with advanced PDAC. Follow-up cancer cachexia occurred in 64% of patients within 48 weeks of starting first-line chemotherapy. However, it was not a prognostic factor for OS. The frequency and grade of appetite loss, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea showed greater increases over time in patients with follow-up cachexia. Because we cannot exclude the possibility that the effects of chemotherapy, especially multidrug chemotherapy, overcame any negative effects of cancer cachexia itself, future studies may need to focus on individual chemotherapeutic regimens.

NCCN pancreatic adenocarcinoma — upfront chemoradiation or induction strategies in locally advanced disease show mixed results: two early randomized trials comparing upfront chemoradiation to chemotherapy showed contradictory results and were not able to confirm superiority of upfront chemoradiation. Additional phase II trials of upfront chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) reported median survival rates ranging from 8.2 to 9 months, whereas small single-arm trials of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation showed median survival between 12 to 19 months. In ECOG-4201, an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of 74 patients found median overall survival (OS) significantly longer with chemoradiation (11.1 months vs. 9.2 months; one-sided P = 0.017), but poor accrual led to no difference in progression-free survival (PFS) and overlapping confidence intervals (CIs) for OS. The phase III FFCD-SFRO trial showed gemcitabine alone increased 1-year OS compared with chemoradiation (53% vs. 32%; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31–0.96; P = 0.006), and it was stopped before planned accrual due to lower survival and severe toxicity in the chemoradiation arm.

### Treatment approaches to locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^0ac939ed]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer, which should be treated as a distinct entity separate from metastatic disease and borderline resectable disease. Although the role, timing, and sequencing of radiation relative to systemic therapy in this disease are controversial, an emerging treatment paradigm involves induction chemotherapy, followed by consolidative chemoradiation in patients who do not progress. In addition, new chemotherapy regimens as well as novel radiosensitizers have shown promise and need to be tested further in the locally advanced setting. Advances in radiotherapy have enabled stereotactic body radiotherapy and should continue to be prospectively evaluated.

NCCN pancreatic adenocarcinoma — chemoradiation for locally advanced disease is supported by a meta-analysis of 15 RCTs showing chemoradiation improved survival compared to radiation alone but not to chemotherapy, and it was associated with higher hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. In an early GITSG regimen, bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with split-course radiation (total dose, 4000 cGy) produced a nearly 2-fold increase in median survival (42.2 vs. 22.9 weeks) versus radiation alone. Evidence indicates concurrent gemcitabine and radiation can yield similar or better outcomes than 5-FU–based chemoradiation, and health-related quality-of-life measures favored capecitabine-based chemoradiation over gemcitabine-based chemoradiation. Therefore, the Panel lists 5-FU- and capecitabine-based chemoradiation as preferred regimens and gemcitabine as another recommended chemoradiation-based regimen.

### A phase I study of gemcitabine / nab-paclitaxel / S-1 chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^ca9d035d]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy, accounting for more than 495,000 new cases and 466,000 deaths worldwide in 2020. The majority of pancreatic cancers are pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), and the 5-year survival of PDAC is less than 10%. For patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy is considered as the primary opinion. However, existing regimens of systematic therapy for PDAC are limited and far from ideal. Thus, exploring more effective regimens to improve survival in patients with locally advanced and metastatic PDAC is of great significance.

Based on the philosophy of using nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (AG) as a platform for combining with other agents proposed recent years, a phase I study in Japan proposed a biweekly triple regimen of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/S-1 (GAS) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced PDAC. This study revealed preliminary efficacy with mild toxicity. In order to expand the indication to metastatic PDAC and minimize toxicities, we implemented this phase I study of GAS chemotherapy on a 21-day cycle (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Patient flow diagram. The flow diagram follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).

This study evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of GAS chemotherapy (21-day cycle) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of S-1 in GAS chemotherapy was 80 mg/day (body surface area: > 1.5 m²). Three dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were detected at cohort of S-1 100 mg (grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage, grade 3 rash, and grade 3 mucositis/stomatitis). The DLTs and the spectrum of adverse events (AEs) reported by this trial were approximately consistent with other clinical trials. The efficacy of this modified GAS chemotherapy showed an improvement on objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Three of 9 (33.3%) patients with locally advanced PDAC were successfully converted to be resectable disease, suggesting the regimen of GAS chemotherapy may be effective as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It would be valuable to conduct further phase II trials.

### Clinical and biological markers predictive of treatment response associated with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^4acc3c21]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) generally have very poor overall survival, even with combination systemic therapy. Nab-paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine (nabP+gemcitabine) is an international standard of care for metastatic PDAC, albeit offering modest improved outcomes for treated patients. The MPACT international registration randomised trial compared the efficacy of nabP+gemcitabine with gemcitabine alone and reported an overall response rate (ORR) of 23% and median overall survival (OS) of 8.7 months with the combination regimen. NabP + gemcitabine chemotherapy was associated with a significant risk of toxicities, with 50% of treated patients experiencing a serious adverse event and 38% having grade 3 or higher neutropenia. In 431 patients randomised to receive nabP+gemcitabine, 11 (3%) failed to start chemotherapy, while the median duration of treatment was 3.9 months, ranging between 0.1 and 21.9 months; 35% of patients were alive at 12 months.

The UK SIEGE randomised phase 2 trial compared sequential scheduling of nabP + gemcitabine administered 24 h apart, with standard delivery of the 2 drugs on the same day, as a potential strategy to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic PDAC. Although ORR was higher in the sequential scheduling arm compared with standard concomitant drug delivery (51% versus 31%, P = 0.023), the OS in both arms was not statistically different (10.1 and 8.2 months, P = 0.70). One-year OS was 32% (95% CI 25–40%): remarkably similar to the MPACT trial population. The median number of 4-weekly cycles of chemotherapy delivered in the SIEGE trial was 3 (range 0–12) in the concomitant and 4 (range 0–24) in the sequential arm. In this trial, 25 (18%) treated patients failed to reach their first response assessment at 8 weeks, which, in 76% of cases, was due to rapidly progressing disease.

Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most lethal malignancies, with an estimated 5-year survival of only 3% for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease. In the past decade, two combination chemotherapy regimens, a quadruplet of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and a doublet, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, have emerged as first-line standard of care. – However, these regimens have never been compared directly leaving uncertainty about the optimal treatment regimen. With the exception of microsatellite instability-high pancreatic cancer, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated only partial benefits, and although there has been much interest in using genomic profiling to improve outcomes, relatively few patients are eligible to receive molecularly targeted agents. – The poor prognosis and low number of treatment options available for most patients highlight the need for further research to compare efficacious and tolerable new treatment approaches, and to maximise the benefits of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.

Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor acting mainly via its active metabolite, SN-38. Liposomal irinotecan (ONIVYDE, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal; historical names include nal-IRI, MM 398, or PEP02; Ipsen, Cambridge, MA, USA) is a liposomal formulation that encapsulates irinotecan in a lipid bilayer vesicle. Encapsulation allows irinotecan to remain in circulation for longer than unencapsulated (free) irinotecan before conversion to SN-38. Thus, at equivalent doses, liposomal irinotecan demonstrates higher and sustained intratumoural levels of irinotecan and SN-38 relative to free irinotecan. Data from a pilot study of liposomal irinotecan in patients (n = 13) with refractory advanced solid tumours reported five-fold higher levels of SN-38 in tumour biopsy samples than in plasma 72 h after dosing, suggesting local metabolic activation of irinotecan to SN-38.

### First-line chemotherapy regimens associated with survival in advanced pancreatic cancer: a Mexican single-center, real-world study… [^69eca09e]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 683 Background: Effectiveness of FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine – Nabpaclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy regimens in advanced pancreatic cancer has been demonstrated in phase III clinical trials. However, prospective studies directly comparing both interventions are lacking. Gemcitabine has proved effective when combined with other drugs such as Oxaliplatin. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients with stage IV Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma treated at Instituto Nacional de Cancerología from 2014 to 2021. Our aim was to compare Overall Survival in patients treated with GEMOX, FOLFIRINOX, Gemcitabine-Nabpaclitaxel, or Gemcitabine in the front-line setting. Progression Free Survival, Overall Response Rate and Adverse Effects were also assessed. Results: A total of 141 patients were analyzed, 72 were treated with GEMOX, 13 with FOLFIRINOX, 9 with Gemcitabine-Nabpaclitaxel and 47 with Gemcitabine.

ORR was 21. 6%,
20. 0%, 11. 1%,
4. 8% with GEMOX, FOLFIRINOX, Gemcitabine-Nabpaclitaxel and Gemcitabine, respectively. The percentage of patients who received a second line chemotherapy after progression was 43. 1%,
61. 5%, 55. 6% and
23. 4%. Conclusions: In patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with different chemotherapy regimens, median OS was similar in this real-world analysis. Though PFS was higher in the group of patients treated with GEMOX, a higher percentage of patients initially treated with FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine – Nabpaclitaxel reached 2nd line chemotherapy after progression. Percentage G3/4 Neutropenia, G1/2 Neuropathy and use of GCSF were significantly higher in patients treated with FOLFIRINOX.

### Phase I study of palbociclib with cisplatin or carboplatin in the management of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [^c283a70f]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

It is unknown if the combination of a selective CDK4/6 + RB pathway inhibitor (palbociclib) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) is safe and effective in patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). In this phase I nonrandomized clinical trial of 71 patients, the combination of palbociclib and platinum chemotherapy was safe, with minimal adverse events. Clinical responses were observed in patients with multiple treatment refractory advanced cancers, but there was no objective response in PDAC. Disease stabilization in 42% of mostly platinum–refractory metastatic PDAC patients suggest that the combination could be an attractive earlier line therapy.

### Regulator of calcineurin 1 gene isoform 4 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma regulates the progression of tumor cells [^5453ec91]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a serious malignancy whose prognosis is very poor. PDAC is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related death. The overall 5-year survival rate is as low as 6–8%. The major reasons for PDAC's lethality are late diagnosis, with most patients presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis, and resistance to chemotherapy. Systemic treatment of PDAC, including surgery and chemotherapy, are still available, such as two combination regimens, FOLFIRINOX (a combination of oxaliplatin, folinic acid, irinotecan, and fluorouracil) and albumin-bound paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine; however, their overall efficacy remains poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify more causative genes and their associated molecular pathways responsible for the progression and metastasis of PDAC.

### Adjuvant-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: results from a randomized, open-label, phase III trial [^c5b846bd]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

The trial did not meet the primary end point; nonetheless, the median OS results in the 5-year follow-up analysis (April 9, 2021; 41.8 v 37.7 months [nab -paclitaxel + gemcitabine v gemcitabine, respectively]) provide valuable data pertinent to outcomes with adjuvant therapy in resected PDAC. Secondary analyses suggest that this regimen may provide insight when defining end points for future studies. Collectively, the data reflect the challenges of independent radiologic review without additional pertinent clinical data in this setting, particularly in a patient population highly selected for early-stage disease. Furthermore, nab -paclitaxel + gemcitabine represents an available treatment option for patients who cannot or prefer not to receive modified FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine + capecitabine. Future analyses of the final OS, quality of life, and biomarker data may further inform management of patients with resected PDAC, particularly regarding the role of nab -paclitaxel + gemcitabine.

### Comparison of FOLFIRINOX vs gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^db53f3f6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common and aggressive cancer, with more than 56 000 new cases in the US annually. Although the 5-year survival rate has improved from approximately 5% in 2000 to approximately 11% in 2021, pancreatic cancer is still the deadliest among all common cancer types.

Gemcitabine was historically used as monotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). In 2011, FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and oxaliplatin) was shown to be superior to gemcitabine alone in a clinical trial (median survival of 11.1 and 6.8 months for FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine alone, respectively). However, it was suggested that FOLFIRINOX increases toxic effects and was therefore recommended as a treatment for patients with higher levels of function and capability of self-care. A second, roughly contemporaneous trialevaluated gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel compared with gemcitabine alone and found a survival benefit with the combined treatment (median survival of 8.7 and 6.6 months for gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine alone, respectively). As of today, most patients with mPC are administered FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy. However, a clinical trial directly comparing the effectiveness of FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel has not been performed. Furthermore, clinical trials often fail to reflect real-world situations and therefore cannot be generalized to support evidence-based decision-making for more diverse patient populations.

A systematic review identified phase II benchmarks predictive of meaningful phase III results: "50% improvement in OS, 9% increase in 1-year survival, or 80% to 100% increase in PFS". An "algorithm… has been developed to calculate historic benchmarks for OS and PFS for single-arm phase II trials based on gemcitabine".

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma management | JCO oncology practice… [^57ba9efe]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has evolved over the last two decades. Surgical resection remain the only potential cure for this cancer. Therefore, there is an emerging emphasis on neoadjuvant therapy to maximize the probability of resection, and identify failures early. The benefit of FOLFIRINOX in various clinical stages of PDAC have been practice changing. 29phase II clinical trial compared eight cycles of neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX with seven cycles of mFOLFIRINOX followed by radiation in patients with BRPC. It reported that neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX alone improved both R0 resection rate and mOS compared with the CRT group. The authors concluded that mFOLFIRINOX can serve as a reference regimen in BRPC and a backbone on which to add novel agents.

The ESPAC-5F trial 30is a four-arm, prospective, multicenter, international randomized phase II trial comparing immediate surgery versus neoadjuvant Gem + Cap or FOLFIRINOX or Cap-based CRT in patients with BRPC. Neoadjuvant therapy showed an improved 1-year OS of 77% versus 40% compared with upfront surgery. More detailed results are eagerly awaited. To achieve a higher resection rate, an adaptive approach with chemotherapy switch was proposed to maximize the effect of neoadjuvant treatment for patients who were not able to tolerate or progressed on first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A recent retrospective study 36that reviewed 468 patients with borderline resectable/LAPC who received first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapy or underwent CS showed that CS allowed more patients to undergo curative-intent surgery. Our ongoing phase II clinical trial will further test this concept in a prospective setting.

35a multicenter, randomized phase II trial, studied four cycles of Gem/nabP versus two cycles of Gem/nabP followed by four cycles of FOLFIRINOX as induction chemotherapy in 130 patients with LAPC. It showed a similar surgical conversion rate of 35. 9% versus
43. 9%, respectively, as the primary end point.

### Association of antibiotic receipt with survival among patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma receiving chemotherapy [^434e1de4]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the US and is projected to become the second leading cause by 2030. The poor 5-year survival rate of 11%is due to clinical presentation at an advanced stage and limited effectiveness of standard treatment regimens. Among patients with metastatic disease, gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel and fluorouracil plus leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin are the mainstays of first-line chemotherapy despite a median overall survival (OS) of less than 12 months with both treatments.

The rapid development of multifactorial resistance to chemotherapy is an important contributor to the dismal prognosis in PDAC. Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability of bacteria in the tumor microenvironment to mediate chemoresistance through mechanisms including metabolization, and altered immunosurveillance. Compared with normal pancreatic tissue, the PDAC microbiome is characterized by higher bacterial abundance and a dysbiotic bacterial profile, enriched with Gammaproteobacteria capable of metabolizing gemcitabine into its inactive form. Some preclinical studies have similarly discovered bacteria-mediated mechanisms of fluorouracil resistance, while others have identified bacteria-mediated mechanisms of fluorouracil activation. Small retrospective studies of patients with PDAC have found associations between antibiotic exposure and improved treatment outcomes, particularly among patients receiving gemcitabine.

Collectively, these studies suggest that antibiotics may affect outcomes in patients with PDAC. We hypothesized that antibiotics with pancreatic penetration and Gammaproteobacteria coverage received in the perichemotherapy period would improve OS among patients treated with gemcitabine, but not fluorouracil. In this study we analyzed the association of antibiotic exposure in the month before or after chemotherapy initiation with survival in a large, population-based cohort of patients with metastatic PDAC treated with first-line gemcitabine or fluorouracil regimens.
