## Question

Age adjust d-dimer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for suspected venous thromboembolism, including when to use them, how to calculate them, their safety and performance, special populations, and how to implement them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why age-adjusted cutoffs were developed. Then, I should verify the exact calculation and assay-specific nuances. Next, I will review the evidence base and quantify benefits and risks. After that, I need to check guideline positions and reconcile any discrepancies. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation details, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem. D-dimer levels rise with age, causing specificity to fall and false positives to accumulate, especially in patients over 50, which drives unnecessary imaging and resource use without improving diagnostic yield, so the goal is to raise the threshold in older adults while preserving sensitivity for ruling out VTE [^44023c2b] [^ccfe1f9d] [^782fcf70].

> I need to verify the exact calculation. The standard age-adjusted threshold is age multiplied by 10 μg/L (fibrinogen equivalent units) for patients older than 50 years, whereas patients 50 years or younger still use the conventional 500 μg/L cutoff. For assays reporting in D-dimer units, a multiplier of 5 is commonly used, reflecting the approximate 1:2 relationship between DDU and FEU, but I should double-check that this conversion is assay-consistent before applying it [^b6aa8722] [^03693125] [^f6db05a4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should review the highest-quality evidence. The ADJUST-PE prospective management study showed that using the age-adjusted cutoff in non-high probability patients resulted in a 3-month VTE failure rate of 0.3% (1/331) among those with D-dimer between 500 and the age-adjusted threshold, and it more than doubled the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded without imaging, particularly in those 75 years and older, without additional false negatives [^b6aa8722]. A meta-analysis of 13 cohorts confirmed that age-adjusted cutoffs improve specificity across age strata while maintaining sensitivity above 97% in non-high probability patients, supporting safety and utility [^44023c2b] [^915cffb3].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. In patients over 80, conventional D-dimer is negative in only about 12–14% versus roughly 30–35% with the age-adjusted threshold, and modeling suggests that for every 1000 patients over 80, about 175 additional patients avoid imaging at the cost of 2–4 additional missed cases, a trade-off that remains favorable given the low miss rate and the burden of imaging in this group [^bb307f96] [^35c27bcd]. I should also note that real-world implementation studies show modest but meaningful reductions in imaging use without increases in missed PE, reinforcing external validity [^8e24b7d4] [^95868bed].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. The American College of Physicians recommends using age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds in patients older than 50 years with non-high clinical probability, and the American College of Emergency Physicians supports age-adjusted strategies with FEU × 10 or DDU × 5 in patients over 50, while the American Society of Hematology similarly endorses age-adjusted cutoffs in outpatients over 50 to increase diagnostic yield safely [^95d3ff58] [^03693125] [^637363e7]. I should confirm that these recommendations apply to non-high probability patients and not to high-probability scenarios, where imaging is indicated regardless of D-dimer [^95d3ff58] [^637363e7].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population. In cancer, age-adjusted D-dimer still increases the proportion in whom PE can be excluded without imaging, with low failure rates in prospective cohorts, though baseline prevalence is higher and clinicians should remain cautious and integrate clinical judgment [^f74ef668] [^0ba47a64]. In pregnancy, D-dimer rises and age-adjusted strategies are not validated; guideline pathways typically use gestational-age–adapted thresholds or alternative strategies, so I should avoid extrapolating age-adjusted cutoffs to pregnancy [^notfound]. In hospitalized patients, D-dimer is frequently elevated and age-adjusted thresholds have not shown the same benefit; direct imaging is often preferred when suspicion is moderate to high [^637363e7] [^782fcf70].

> I will now examine implementation details because misapplication can negate benefits. Assay selection matters: high-sensitivity assays are required for safe rule-out, and laboratories should report age-adjusted reference intervals clearly, ideally automating the calculation to reduce errors. Clinicians must also remember the FEU versus DDU distinction and apply the correct multiplier to avoid dangerous misclassification [^03693125] [^487dbc58] [^f6db05a4]. I should double-check that the EHR displays both raw value and age-adjusted interpretation to support decision-making at the bedside [^8e24b7d4].

> Hold on, I should verify the balance of harms and benefits one more time. Across randomized and prospective data, the absolute increase in missed PE with age-adjusted thresholds is on the order of 0.1–0.3% and remains within accepted safety margins for rule-out strategies, while the reduction in imaging is clinically meaningful and cost-effective in systems-level analyses, supporting adoption when used correctly in non-high probability patients [^b6aa8722] [^df5f812b] [^fb90ec27].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, assess pretest probability with a validated tool such as Wells or revised Geneva. If high, proceed directly to imaging and do not order D-dimer. If low or intermediate, apply PERC when appropriate in low-risk patients to avoid D-dimer altogether. If PERC is not fully negative or the patient is intermediate risk, obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and interpret using the age-adjusted threshold in patients older than 50, considering DDU × 5 when applicable. A negative age-adjusted D-dimer rules out PE and no imaging is needed, whereas a positive result should prompt CTPA or V/Q scanning based on availability and contraindications [^95d3ff58] [^90e3f1f1] [^637363e7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the age-adjusted formula might be age × 10 for everyone, but I should correct that. The validated strategy uses the conventional 500 μg/L cutoff for patients 50 years or younger and age × 10 μg/L only for those older than 50, which preserves safety in younger patients where specificity is already reasonable and avoids excessive false positives in older adults [^b6aa8722] [^44023c2b].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up. I should record the pretest probability, the D-dimer value with the age-adjusted threshold applied, and the decision rationale. If using a DDU assay, I should explicitly note the conversion and the resulting threshold. And I should arrange appropriate return precautions and 3-month VTE surveillance when PE is excluded, consistent with management study protocols that established safety [^b6aa8722] [^03693125].

Age-adjusted D-dimer uses a **threshold of age × 10 μg/L** for patients older than 50 years, replacing the fixed 500 μg/L cutoff [^b6aa8722] [^95d3ff58]. This strategy **maintains sensitivity above 97%** while significantly improving specificity and reducing unnecessary imaging in older adults [^44023c2b] [^b6aa8722]. It is **recommended by major guidelines** for patients over 50 with non-high clinical probability of PE or DVT, and should not be used in high-probability patients or those under 50 [^95d3ff58] [^637363e7]. For D-dimer unit assays, use **age × 5 μg/L** [^03693125] [^f6db05a4].

---

## Rationale for age-adjusted D-dimer

D-dimer levels **rise with age**, reducing specificity and increasing false positives with the fixed 500 μg/L cutoff [^44023c2b] [^ccfe1f9d]. This leads to more imaging, costs, and patient burden, especially in older adults [^b6aa8722] [^df5f812b]. Age-adjusted thresholds aim to **preserve sensitivity while improving specificity** and reducing unnecessary imaging [^44023c2b] [^b6aa8722].

---

## Calculation of age-adjusted D-dimer threshold

The age-adjusted threshold is **age × 10 μg/L** for patients older than 50 years; patients 50 years or younger still use the 500 μg/L cutoff [^b6aa8722] [^95d3ff58]. For D-dimer unit assays, the threshold is **age × 5 μg/L** [^03693125] [^f6db05a4].

| **Patient age** | **Age-adjusted d-dimer threshold (feu)** | **Age-adjusted d-dimer threshold (ddu)** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 50 years | 500 μg/L | 250 μg/L |
| > 50 years | Age × 10 μg/L | Age × 5 μg/L |

## Clinical evidence supporting age-adjusted D-dimer

- **ADJUST-PE study**: Prospective multicenter trial showing age-adjusted D-dimer safely increased the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded without imaging, with a 3-month failure rate of 0.3% [^b6aa8722].
- **Meta-analysis**: 13 cohorts (12,497 patients) showed age-adjusted thresholds maintained sensitivity > 97% and improved specificity across age groups [^44023c2b] [^915cffb3].
- **Randomized trial**: YEARS plus age-adjusted D-dimer reduced imaging by 8.7% without increasing missed PEs [^f5f3feca] [^9b69c178].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACP**: Recommends age-adjusted D-dimer (age × 10 μg/L) in patients > 50 years with non-high probability of PE [^95d3ff58] [^8b20e475].
- **ASH**: Endorses age-adjusted D-dimer in outpatients > 50 years to safely increase diagnostic yield [^637363e7].
- **ACEP**: Supports age-adjusted thresholds (age × 10 μg/L FEU; age × 5 μg/L DDU) in patients > 50 years with low or intermediate risk [^03693125] [^36a4dd30].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **High clinical probability**: Do not use age-adjusted D-dimer; proceed directly to imaging [^95d3ff58] [^637363e7].
- **Assay variability**: Ensure the correct multiplier (× 10 for FEU, × 5 for DDU) is used [^03693125] [^f6db05a4].
- **Special populations**: Limited data in cancer, pregnancy, and inpatients; use caution and clinical judgment [^637363e7] [^782fcf70].

---

## Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness

Age-adjusted D-dimer **reduces imaging by ~8–20%** without increasing missed PEs, shortening ED length of stay and lowering costs [^b6aa8722] [^f5f3feca]. Cost-effectiveness analyses show modest cost savings and improved resource use [^df5f812b] [^fb90ec27].

---

## Practical implementation

- **Laboratory systems**: Automate age-adjusted reporting in patients > 50 years [^8e24b7d4].
- **Clinical workflows**: Integrate age-adjusted thresholds into order sets and decision support [^notfound].
- **Education**: Train clinicians on correct application and assay differences [^notfound].

---

Age-adjusted D-dimer is a **validated, guideline-supported strategy** that improves specificity and reduces imaging in patients over 50 with non-high probability of VTE, while maintaining high sensitivity and safety [^b6aa8722] [^44023c2b] [^95d3ff58].

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^44023c2b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (> 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

Design

Systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

Data Sources

We searched Medline and Embase for studies published before 21 June 2012 and we contacted the authors of primary studies.

Study Selection

Primary studies that enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing, using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age adjusted (age × 10 µg/L) cut-off values, and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2 × 2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

Results

13 cohorts including 12,497 patients with a non-high clinical probability were included in the meta-analysis. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7% in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

Conclusions

The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity without modifying sensitivity, thereby improving the clinical utility of D-dimer testing in patients aged 50 or more with a non-high clinical probability.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels to rule out pulmonary embolism: the ADJUST-PE study [^b6aa8722]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

D-dimer measurement is an important step in the diagnostic strategy of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but its clinical usefulness is limited in elderly patients.

Objective

To prospectively validate whether an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff, defined as age×10 in patients 50 years or older, is associated with an increased diagnostic yield of D-dimer in elderly patients with suspected PE.

Design, Settings, and Patients

A multicenter, multinational, prospective management outcome study in 19 centers in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland between January 1, 2010, and February 28, 2013.

Interventions

All consecutive outpatients who presented to the emergency department with clinically suspected PE were assessed by a sequential diagnostic strategy based on the clinical probability assessed using either the simplified, revised Geneva score or the 2-level Wells score for PE; highly sensitive D-dimer measurement; and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Patients with a D-dimer value between the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff did not undergo CTPA and were left untreated and formally followed-up for a 3-month period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the failure rate of the diagnostic strategy, defined as adjudicated thromboembolic events during the 3-month follow-up period among patients not treated with anticoagulants on the basis of a negative age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff result.

Results

Of the 3346 patients with suspected PE included, the prevalence of PE was 19%. Among the 2898 patients with a nonhigh or an unlikely clinical probability, 817 patients (28.2%) had a D-dimer level lower than 500 µg/L (95% CI, 26.6%-29.9%) and 337 patients (11.6%) had a D-dimer between 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff (95% CI, 10.5%-12.9%). The 3-month failure rate in patients with a D-dimer level higher than 500 µg/L but below the age-adjusted cutoff was 1 of 331 patients (0.3% [95% CI, 0.1%-1.7%]). Among the 766 patients 75 years or older, of whom 673 had a nonhigh clinical probability, using the age-adjusted cutoff instead of the 500 µg/L cutoff increased the proportion of patients in whom PE could be excluded on the basis of D-dimer from 43 of 673 patients (6.4% [95% CI, 4.8%-8.5%) to 200 of 673 patients (29.7% [95% CI, 26.4%-33.3%), without any additional false-negative findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with a fixed D-dimer cutoff of 500 µg/L, the combination of pretest clinical probability assessment with age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff was associated with a larger number of patients in whom PE could be considered ruled out with a low likelihood of subsequent clinical venous thromboembolism.

### Investigation of age-adjusted D-dimer using an uncommon assay [^90edffbe]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer for the evaluation of acute pulmonary embolus (PE) has been prospectively validated in the literature and has become a practice recommendation from major medical societies. Most research on this subject involves the most common D-dimer assays reporting in Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU) with a non-age-adjusted manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 500 ng/ml FEU. Limited research to date has evaluated age-adjustment in assays that report in D-Dimer Units (D-DU), which use a manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 230 ng/ml D-DU. Despite scant evidence, an age-adjusted formula using D-DU has been recently endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). This formula seems arbitrary in its derivation and unnecessarily deviates from existing thresholds, thus prompting the creation of our novel-age adjustment formula. The goal of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the test characteristics of our novel age-adjusted D-dimer formula using the D-DU assay in comparison to existing traditional and age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for the evaluation of acute PE in the ED.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review at an academic quaternary health system with three EDs and 195,000 combined annual ED visits. Only patients with D-dimer testing and CT PE protocol (CTPE) imaging were included. Admission and discharge diagnosis codes were used to identify acute PE. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of an unadjusted traditional threshold (230) compared with both novel and ACEP-endorsed age adjusted thresholds, (Age × 5) - 20 and Age × 5 if > 50, respectively. Estimates with their exact 95% threshold were performed.

Results

4846 adult patients were evaluated from January 2012 to July 2017. Group characteristics include a mean age of 52 and a frequency of acute PE diagnosis by CTPE of 8.25%. Traditional D-dimer cutoff demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.8% (95% CI 98.6–100), specificity of 16.7% (95% CI 15.6–17.8) and NPV of 99.9% (95% CI 99.3–100). Our novel age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds had a sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI 94.8–98.4), specificity of 27.9% (95% CI 26.6–29.2) and NPV of 99.0% (95% CI 98.3–99.5) with the ACEP-endorsed formula demonstrating similar test characteristics.

Conclusion

Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer on appropriately selected patients being evaluated for acute PE in the ED with a D-DU assay increases specificity while maintaining a high sensitivity and NPV. Both our novel formula and the ACEP-endorsed age-adjusted formula performed well, with our novel formula showing a trend towards improved testing characteristics.

### D-dimer thresholds for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism based on a single question: is it the most likely diagnosis? A prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-arm interventional study [^1ea9ad1f]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Validated diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism allow raising the D-dimer threshold to 1000 ng/mL in selected patients with a low probability of pulmonary embolism, but adherence to this strategy in routine practice remains poor. Retrospective studies suggest that these rules could be replaced by a single clinical question as to whether pulmonary embolism is the most likely diagnosis. We aimed to assess the safety of a simplified approach that applies a 1000 ng/mL threshold when pulmonary embolism is unlikely and an age-adjusted threshold otherwise, including patients at a high probability for pulmonary embolism.

Methods

In this prospective interventional study in 13 French hospital emergency departments, patients aged ≥ 18 years with a clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, who were not on full-dose anticoagulant therapy and had not had a thromboembolic event in the past 6 months, were included. The intervention consisted of ruling out pulmonary embolism without chest imaging in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was not considered the most likely diagnosis and had a D-dimer value < 1000 ng/mL. The age-adjusted D-dimer threshold (500 ng/mL if aged < 50 years or age×10 ng/mL if aged ≥ 50 years) was used for the other patients. The primary outcome was the diagnostic failure rate (ie, occurrence of a thromboembolic event at 3 months of follow-up) among patients for whom pulmonary embolism was initially ruled out. Safety was established if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the diagnostic failure rate was less than 1·85% in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out at initial testing and in a subgroup of patients for whom it was ruled out without chest imaging. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06190392) and is complete.

Findings

Between Jan 16 and Sept 5, 2024, 1365 patients were screened for eligibility and 1221 were included, of whom 80 (7%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism at initial testing. Pulmonary embolism was not considered the most likely diagnosis for 997 patients. The diagnostic failure rate was 0·00% (95% CI 0·00–0·34) and was 0·12% (0·01–0·55) after multiple imputation for 33 patients with no available follow-up, both within the safety threshold. In the prespecified subgroup of 796 patients for whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out without chest imaging, the diagnostic failure rate was 0·00% (0·00–0·46), also within the safety threshold. The strategy had a 32% chest imaging rate (384 of 1217 patients), an absolute reduction of 19% (16–21) compared with the fixed 500 ng/mL D-dimer threshold strategy (609 [50%] of 1215). There were 16 deaths during the 3-month follow-up.

Interpretation

A global simplified strategy using a D-dimer threshold of 1000 ng/mL in patients for whom pulmonary embolism was not the most likely diagnosis, and an age-adjusted threshold for other patients, safely excluded the diagnosis. These findings indicate that this simplified strategy could safely reduce the use of chest imaging in the emergency department.

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: making sense of international guideline recommendations [^487dbc58]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

### Clinical pre-test probability adjusted versus age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation strategy for DVT diagnosis: a diagnostic individual patient data meta-analysis [^ffc34c8b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To increase the clinical usefulness of the D-dimer test in diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), two strategies have been proposed: the age-adjusted, and the clinical pre-test probability (CPTP) adjusted interpretation. However, it is not known which of these strategies is superior.

Objective

To conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis that compares the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and utility (the proportion of all patients who have a negative D-dimer test) when the two strategies are used to interpret D-dimer results.

Methods

Using an established IPD database, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the two strategies. A bivariate random effects regression model was used to estimate and compare the pooled sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. The pooled NPV and utility of the two strategies was compared using a univariate random effects model.

Results

Four studies were eligible for this analysis, with a total of 2554 patients. Overall prevalence of DVT was 12% with substantial heterogeneity between studies (P value < .001). Both strategies have high pooled NPVs (99.8%) with a difference of 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1, 0.1). The difference between the pooled specificity of the CPTP-adjusted strategy (57.3%) and the age-adjusted strategy (54.7%) was 2.6% (95% CI: -7.7, 12.8). The CPTP-adjusted strategy (49.4%) has a marginally greater pooled utility compared with the age-adjusted approach (47.4%), with a pooled difference of 1.9% (95% CI: -0.1, 3.9).

Conclusions

Both D-dimer interpretation strategies were associated with a high and similar NPV, and similar utility.

### Rapid systematic review: age-adjusted D-dimer for ruling out pulmonary embolism [^bec91fc1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a disease diagnosed relatively frequently in emergency departments (EDs). Evidence suggests that improved decision making may decrease inappropriate testing, unnecessary radiation exposure, and non-beneficial treatment. Several studies have looked at the utility and safety of age-adjusting the D-dimer levels used to safely rule out PE.

Objective

This rapid systematic review sought to answer the question: Can an age-adjusted D-dimer be used to safely rule out PE in patients over 50 years old?

Methods

We performed a structured review of PubMed from January 2012 to January 2018 limited to reports involving human subjects and written in the English language and containing relevant keywords. The highest-quality studies were then reviewed in a structured format.

Results

One hundred and eleven papers were identified for further review. Eight articles were determined to be appropriate for inclusion in this summary. These studies all used patient age (in years over 50) × 10 μg/L (fibrinogen equivalent units) as their definition of an age-adjusted D-dimer.

Conclusions

Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff values, in combination with a non-high clinical probability, is safe and effective to essentially rule out PE in ED patients.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^81d5cb90]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1 Diagnostic investigations in patients with suspected venous thrombembolism. Adapted from Wells 2007, Le Gal et al 2006, and Wells et al 2001

Others have argued for increasing the D-dimer cut-off value in older patients to improve the specificity and thereby increase the number of patients in whom — based on a D-dimer level below the cut-off value — imaging could be avoided. An age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value that increases gradually with age especially showed a promising increase in specificity without substantial loss of safety. This age adjusted cut-off value was defined as age (years)×10 μg/L for patients aged over 50 years (for example, for a patient aged 78 years, the D-dimer concentration would be considered normal below 780 μg/L). The age adjusted cut-off value was derived from a cohort of secondary care patients with a non-high probability of pulmonary embolism. This cohort was subdivided into 10 year age groups and the optimal cut-off value was selected for each age group — that is, the cut-off value with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest accompanying specificity. This revealed an increase of the optimal cut-off value of approximately 100 μg/L per decade (10 μg/L per year). This age adjusted cut-off value was subsequently validated in secondary care patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, and in both primary and secondary care cohorts of patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis. However, higher cut-off values may also lead to an increased percentage of false negative cases (that is, missed cases of venous thromboembolism), which might make this strategy less safe. Since venous thromboembolism has a high short term mortality rate in older patients, doctors do not always get the chance to reconsider a missed diagnosis.

Controversy therefore remains on the utility of D-dimer testing (either using the conventional or higher cut-off values) to safely exclude venous thromboembolism in a substantial proportion of older patients. A formal systematic review increases the evidence base on this topic; a meta-analysis can provide more precise estimates of the accuracy of D-dimer testing among clinically relevant subgroups, whereby sources for interstudy heterogeneity can be considered. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing for excluding suspected venous thromboembolism in older patients, with a particular interest in whether increasing the threshold for test positivity using the proposed age adjusted manner is a safe and more efficient strategy than using the conventional cut-off value.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^915cffb3]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective To review the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients (> 50 years) with suspected venous thromboembolism, using conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

Design Systematic review and bivariate random effects meta-analysis.

Data sources We searched Medline and Embase for studies published before 21 June 2012 and we contacted the authors of primary studies.

Study selection Primary studies that enrolled older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism in whom D-dimer testing, using both conventional (500 µg/L) and age adjusted (age×10 µg/L) cut-off values, and reference testing were performed. For patients with a non-high clinical probability, 2×2 tables were reconstructed and stratified by age category and applied D-dimer cut-off level.

Results 13 cohorts including 12 497 patients with a non-high clinical probability were included in the meta-analysis. The specificity of the conventional cut-off value decreased with increasing age, from 57.6% (95% confidence interval 51.4% to 63.6%) in patients aged 51–60 years to 39.4% (33.5% to 45.6%) in those aged 61–70, 24.5% (20.0% to 29.7% in those aged 71–80, and 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in those aged > 80. Age adjusted cut-off values revealed higher specificities over all age categories: 62.3% (56.2% to 68.0%), 49.5% (43.2% to 55.8%), 44.2% (38.0% to 50.5%), and 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%), respectively. Sensitivities of the age adjusted cut-off remained above 97% in all age categories.

Conclusions The application of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer tests substantially increases specificity without modifying sensitivity, thereby improving the clinical utility of D-dimer testing in patients aged 50 or more with a non-high clinical probability.

Data extraction and quality assessment

We reviewed the included studies in duplicate and extracted the study design, setting, number of patients, prevalence of venous thromboembolism, personal characteristics of the study population, clinical decision rule used to classify patients in risk categories, and reference standard and D-dimer assay applied. Using extracted numbers of true and false positive and negative results according to the reference tests, we reconstructed 2×2 tables for the patients with a non-high clinical probability and stratified them by predefined age categories (≤ 50 years, 51–60 years, 61–70 years, 71–80 years, and > 80 years) and by the different D-dimer cut-off values (for the age category ≤ 50 years the conventional and age adjusted cut-off value are the same). If complete reconstruction of 2×2 tables using the desired age categories was not possible based on the data presented in the papers, we contacted the authors and requested to reanalyse their data, if needed, according to the predefined age class categories and to complete the cross tables for all age categories and for both the conventional and age adjusted D-dimer cut-off level.

We assessed risk of bias and applicability at study cohort level, using the revised tool for quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2). This is a validated tool for assessment of methodological quality and applicability of diagnostic accuracy studies. We appraised both the primary studies describing the included study cohorts and the publications included in this meta-analysis that were based on these cohorts.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^78161644]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Measurement of D-dimer concentration in the blood is a valuable tool in the diagnostic investigation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. A D-dimer concentration below the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l combined with a "low/intermediate" or "unlikely" clinical probability can safely rule out the diagnosis in about 30% of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. However, the D-dimer concentration increases with age and its specificity for embolism decreases, which makes the test less useful to exclude pulmonary embolism in older patients. Indeed, the test is able to rule out pulmonary embolism in 60% of patients aged < 40 years, but in only 5% of patients aged > 80.

If the D-dimer test is combined with an "unlikely" clinical probabilityto rule out pulmonary embolism, 10% of patients > 75 years old versus 32% of patients of all ages do not need further diagnostic testing; the number needed to test for one negative test result is 10.6 and 3.1, respectively. Raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 μg/l and 1000 μg/l increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety, with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability.

By constructing receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, we derived a new, age dependent D-dimer cut-off value and analysed its safety and clinical utility, in combination with clinical probability assessment, for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in two large prospective cohort studies of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. We then validated the outcome in two other large management studies.

Results

Derivation of the new cut-off value

Of the 1721 patients included in the derivation set, 416 (24.2%) had pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer test was not performed for nine patients from the second study with high clinical probability (all nine had pulmonary embolism diagnosed during initial investigation). Table 1shows the clinical characteristics of the patients in the derivation cohort.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of the derivation and validation cohorts of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism used to produce an age dependent cut-off value for the D-dimer test for pulmonary embolism. Values are numbers (percentages) of patients unless specified otherwise

The figureshows the increase in optimal D-dimer cut-off value by patient age group, obtained from the ROC curves for each group. The cut-off point increased from 512 μg/l in patients < 50 years old to 934 μg/l in patients > 80 years old. The regression coefficient was 112 (SE 12.03) μg/l increase per decade, or 11.2 μg/l increase per year (r 2 = 0.966). To be conservative and to facilitate clinical usefulness and practicality, we considered a 10 μg/l increase per patient year to be an appropriate new D-dimer coefficient. Starting from the conventional cut-off point of 500 μg/l until the age of 50, for older patients the patient age should be multiplied by 10 to calculate the age adjusted cut-off value.

Strengths and limitations of study

The calculation of the age adjusted cut-off value was facilitated by the large size of the study population, which is a major strength of this analysis. However, some aspects of our study warrant comment. Firstly, two different D-dimer assays were used in the validation cohorts. Although there was no significant difference between the two tests, and the new cut-off value performed equally well with both assays, the study may not have been sufficiently powered to detect a difference between the two. It is unknown how the new cut-off value will perform in other D-dimer assays. Secondly, although D-dimer tests and the (variables for the) clinical decision rule were collected prospectively, this study was a retrospective analysis. After derivation and independent validation in a completely distinct cohort of patients, the next step would be to validate this cut-off value prospectively in a formal outcome study with patient follow-up.

Conclusions

In conclusion, a cut-off value adjusted to age combined with clinical probability greatly increased the utility of the D-dimer test for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism among older patients without reducing safety. This new cut-off is therefore clinically relevant and has sustained external validation. The next step would be to validate this new D-dimer cut-off value prospectively before implementation in daily practice.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to rule out pulmonary embolism… [^9564efa0]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer Cut-off to Rule Out Pulmonary Embolism in the Emergency Department: A Real Life Impact Study ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview A multicentre multinational prospective management outcome study has recently proven the safety of a diagnostic strategy combining clinical probability assessment with an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off, defined as a value of in patients > 50 years, for ruling out PE in outpatients, with a very low likelihood of subsequent symptomatic VTE. Moreover, this study showed that such a strategy increased the diagnostic yield of D-dimers, as it allowed ruling out PE without further investigation in a significantly higher proportion of patients than when using standard cut-off, particularly so in patients 75 years or older.

Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off The question of a higher D-dimer cut-off in elderly patients was raised a decade ago, but studies confirming the potential security of such a strategy by retrospectively applying age-adjusted cut-offs to large prospective cohorts of consecutive patients with suspected VTE were published between 2010 and 2012 and confirmed the safety of using age-adjusted cut-offs on an overall population of several thousands of patients. A progressive age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off was retrospectively derived and validated in a sample of 1712 patients with suspected PE. The retrospective validation study showed that the age-adjusted cut-off could increase by around 20% the number of patients in whom the D-dimer test was considered negative, without increasing the proportion of false-negative results when compared to the standard cut-off.

The increase in the diagnostic yield of D-dimers was particularly pronounced in patients over 80 years, as the age-adjusted cut-off allowed an increase in the proportion of "negative" D-dimers from 9% to 21%, without any false negative result. Moreover, ruling out PE based on clinical probability and a simple blood test could contribute to reduce the time spent in the emergency department and the costs related to PE diagnostic work-up. Indeed, a previous study had shown that D-dimer measurement with conventional cut-off was highly cost-saving in patients less than 80 years, but not in patients over 80 years. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off dramatically increases the proportion of patients in whom PE can be ruled out and is thus highly likely to reduce the costs of PE diagnosis in the emergency department.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ae5a0918]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Other strategies to adjust the D-dimer cut-off value to exclude venous thromboembolism in older patients have been suggested — for example, a fixed cut-off of 750 µg/L in all patients aged over 60 or 70 years. Owing to the heterogeneity of the applied D-dimer assays, methodology, and categorization of age (for example, > 60 or > 70 years instead of 61–70 years, 71–80 years, and > 80 years), we were unable to provide pooled estimates of the studies that analysed alternative D-dimer cut-off levels. This hampered the comparison of the different adjusted D-dimer cut-off values.

We also found some heterogeneity in the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer tests among the studies, partly explained by the application of different assays. Our covariate analysis suggests that the application of age adjusted instead of conventional cut-off values was most favourable in the cohorts in which enzyme linked fluorescent assays were only applied, as the high sensitivity remained constant in these cohorts. These findings are consistent with previous studies: enzyme linked fluorescent assays turned out to have a higher sensitivity at the expense of a lower specificity compared with second generation latex assays. However, as a result of between study variation of covariates and their potential multicollinearity (linear relation between explaining variables), we are unable to draw firm conclusions on the differences between various D-dimer assays based on our current meta-analysis.

Conclusions and implications for further research

D-dimer testing has limited utility in older patients when the conventional cut-off value is applied. The application of the age adjusted cut-off value combined with a non-high clinical probability greatly increases the utility of a D-dimer test for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism in older patients, while hardly affecting the sensitivity. D-dimer levels below the age adjusted cut-off value correctly avoided imaging examinations in 30% to 54% of older patients with a non-high probability. This meta-analysis shows the robustness of our findings for patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, as well as for different age groups, D-dimer assays, and prevalence of venous thromboembolism.

Given that the age adjusted cut-off level could be easily implemented in routine laboratory practice it may have an immediate impact in clinical practice and serve the needs of older patients with a non-high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism by sparing a substantial proportion the burden of imaging investigations. Our results are not, however, applicable to patients with a high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism as additional imaging examination is warranted in these patients, irrespective of the D-dimer test results. Furthermore, since this strategy has only been confirmed in retrospective analyses, it could be argued that a formal cost effectiveness modeling studyor even a prospective impact studyis needed to further confirm the cost effectiveness and ease of use and acceptability of this diagnostic strategy in daily patient care before its implementation in clinical practice.

Acute pulmonary embolism — age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds: Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds should be used to determine whether imaging is warranted, with an age-adjusted threshold of age × 10 ng/mL (rather than a generic value of 500 ng/mL) resulting in maintenance of sensitivities greater than 97% in all age groups; specificities increased significantly in all age groups, from 5.7% to 32.3% in patients aged 51 to 60 years, 39.4% to 49.5% in patients aged 61 to 70 years, 24.5% to 44.2% in patients aged 71 to 80 years, and 14.7% to 35.2% in patients older than 80 years, and given these results, we recommend using age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds to determine D-dimer evaluation in patients older than 50 years.

### Missed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value [^86c041f8]. Age and Ageing (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially severe diagnosis with high short-term mortality. Recently, age-adjusted cut-off values (age × 10 μg/l) of D-dimer were introduced to improve the diagnostic workup in older patients. In clinical practice, PE is considered 'ruled out' in patients with a non-high clinical probability and a normal D-dimer. However, all diagnostic tests have a small false-negative rate. This small probability of misdiagnosis might be easily overlooked by clinicians when using simplified dichotomized flow charts. This case illustrates a normal D-dimer (age-adjusted) but with a PE. We recommend clinicians using the D-dimer test-either conventional or age-adjusted in a rule-out strategy to be aware of the-albeit small probability of a false-negative result.

### Questioning the use of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold to exclude venous thromboembolism: analysis of individual patient data from two diagnostic studies [^ba658819]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Essentials It is unclear if raising the D-dimer level to exclude venous thrombosis in older patients is valid. We compared this 'age-adjusted' strategy with other ways of interpreting D-dimer results. A non-age adjusted increase, and using higher thresholds in younger patients, was just as accurate. Age-adjustment of D-dimer thresholds does not appear to be appropriate. Click to hear Prof. le Gal's presentation on controversies in venous thromboembolism diagnosis SUMMARY: Background Using a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude venous thromboembolism (VTE) with increasing age has been proposed but is not well validated. Objective To determine whether it is appropriate to use a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude VTE with increasing age. Patients/methods We analyzed clinical data and blood samples from 1649 patients with a first suspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. We compared the negative predictive values (NPVs) for VTE, and the proportions of patients with a negative D-dimer result, by using three D-dimer interpretation strategies: a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with increasing age (age-adjusted strategy); the same higher D-dimer threshold in all patients (mean D-dimer strategy); and a progressively higher D-dimer threshold with decreasing age (inverse age-adjusted strategy). Results The NPV with the age-adjusted strategy (99.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 99.0–99.9%) was not different from that with the mean D-dimer strategy (99.7%; 95% CI 99.0–99.9%) or that with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (99.8%; 95% CI 99.1–99.9%). The proportion of patients with a negative result with the age-adjusted strategy (50.9%; 95% CI 48.5–53.4%) was not different from the proportion of patients with a negative result with the mean D-dimer strategy (51.7%; 95% CI 49.3–54.1%) or with the inverse age-adjusted strategy (49.5%; 95% CI 47.1–51.9%). Conclusions Our analysis does not support the use of a progressively higher D-dimer level to exclude VTE with increasing age.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff levels to rule out pulmonary embolism… [^ad6602d5]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Importance D-dimer measurement is an important step in the diagnostic strategy of clinically suspected acute pulmonary embolism, but its clinical usefulness is limited in elderly patients. Objective To prospectively validate whether an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff, defined as age × 10 in patients 50 years or older, is associated with an increased diagnostic yield of D-dimer in elderly patients with suspected PE. We retrospectively derived and validated the value of a progressive D-dimer cutoff adjusted to age in a wide sample of 1712 patients. The optimal age-adjusted cutoff was defined as patient's age multiplied by 10 in patients 50 years or older. 9 In the retrospective validation analysis, the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff would have increased by about 20% the number of patients in whom the D-dimer test was considered negative without increasing the false-negative rate when compared with the usual 500 µg/L cutoff.

The results were particularly appealing in patients older than 80 years — the age-adjusted cutoff allowed an increase in the proportion of patients with a negative D-dimer result from 9% to 21% without any false-negative test. 9 However, prospective validation of this age-adjusted cutoff was indicated before this strategy could be implemented in clinical practice. Hence, we assessed its failure rate and usefulness in a prospective management outcome study, in which consecutive outpatients with suspected PE were left untreated on the basis of a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test result, in combination with a clinical probability assessment. We also defined elderly patients as patients 75 years or older and we analyzed the additional diagnostic yield of the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in these patients. Moreover, the strength of the age-adjusted cutoff is that it was derived using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis in each age group and linear regression analysis.

Another strength is that the age-adjusted cutoff is easy to memorize and is tailored to each individual patient. Previous studies have shown that in all patients, irrespective of age, the number needed to test with a D-dimer test to rule out 1 PE is approximately 3, 4 but in elderly patients, this number could be as high as 20 after 80 years. 8 Thus, the use of the age-adjusted cutoff allows to "restore" the yield of the D-dimer test in elderly patients.

### Predicting the need for further thrombosis diagnostics in suspected DVT is increased by using age adjusted D-dimer values [^e1da43c0]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Negative D-dimer values combined with clinical decision rules by Wells can help in excluding the diagnosis deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, with increasing age D-dimer levels increase, possibly leading to false positive results.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study we compared the specificity and sensitivity of conventional D-dimer levels and age adjusted D-dimer levels in the diagnosis of DVT. We included 528 patients, all over 50years of age, of whom 117 had a DVT confirmed by duplex ultrasound.

Results and Conclusion

Age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values had higher specificity compared to conventional D-dimer values (24.6% vs. 8.5%) as well as a higher negative predictive value (91,8% vs. 89,7%). Therefore we conclude that age adjusted D-dimer levels could be used to exclude the diagnosis of DVT. Ultimately this could lead to the performance of less duplex ultrasounds reducing health care costs and discomfort for the patient.

### International, multicenter evaluation of a new D-dimer assay for the exclusion of venous thromboembolism using standard and age-adjusted cut-offs [^fbd4dba6]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

We sought to determine the test characteristics of an automated INNOVANCE D-dimer assay for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in emergency department (ED) patients using standard and age-adjusted cut-offs.

Methods

Cross-sectional, international, multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected DVT or PE in 24 centers (18 USA, 6 Europe). Evaluated patients had low or intermediate Wells PE or DVT scores. For the standard cut-off, a D-dimer result < 500 ng/ml was negative. For the age adjusted cut-off, we used the formula: Age (years) ∗ 10. The diagnostic standard was imaging demonstrating PE or DVT within 3 months. We calculated test characteristics using standard methods. We also explored modifications of the age adjustment multiplier.

Results

We included 3837 patients and excluded 251. The mean age of patients evaluated for PE (n = 1834) was 48 ± 16 years, with 676 (37%) male, and 1081 (59%) white. The mean age of evaluated for DVT (n = 1752) was 53 ± 16 years, with 710 (41%) male, and 1172 (67%) white. D-dimer test characteristics for PE were: sensitivity 98.0%, specificity 55.4%, negative predictive value (NPV) 99.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) 11.4%, and for DVT were: sensitivity 92.0%, specificity 44.8%, NPV 98.8%, PPV 10.3%. Age adjustment increased specificity (59.6% [PE], 51.1% [DVT]), but increasing the age-adjustment multiplier decreased sensitivity without increasing specificity.

Conclusions

INNOVANCE D-dimer is highly sensitive and can exclude PE and DVT in ED patients with low- and intermediate- pre-test probability. Age-adjustment increases specificity, without increasing false negatives.

### Age-adjusted versus clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism [^8b048099]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

A low D-dimer can exclude suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in cases with low or intermediate clinical probability of disease. Yet D-dimer is nonspecific, so many cases without PE require imaging. D-dimer's specificity is improved by increasing the threshold for a positive test with age (age × 10 ng/mL; age-adjusted D-dimer; AADD) or clinical probability of PE (1000 ng/mL if low and 500 ng/mL if intermediate clinical probability; clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer; CPADD). It is unclear which approach is preferable.

Objectives

We report the sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) of AADD compared to CPADD in suspected PE.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective cohort of 3500 consecutive cases imaged for suspected PE at two U.S. emergency departments was assembled. We analyzed cases with low or intermediate clinical probability of PE (Revised Geneva Score) who had a D-dimer. The outcome was acute PE on imaging at presentation.

Results

Of the 3500 cases, 1745 were eligible. 37% were low, and 63% were intermediate clinical probability of PE. PE was present in 145 (8.3%) cases. Sensitivity of CPADD was 87.5% vs. 96.6% for AADD (difference 9.1%; 95% CI 4.3% to 14.0%). NPV of CPADD was 97.1% vs. 99.0% for AADD (difference 1.9%; 95% CI, 0.7% to 3.1%). Specificity of CPADD was 37.5% vs. 30.2% for AADD (difference -7.3%; 95% CI -9.4% to -5.1%). D-dimer was negative in 35.4% of cases using CPADD vs. 28.0% using AADD.

Conclusions

CPADD modestly improved the specificity of D-dimer, but had a lower NPV than AADD. AADD appears preferable in this analysis.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^f5f3feca]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Uncontrolled studies suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) can be safely ruled out using the YEARS rule, a diagnostic strategy that uses varying D-dimer thresholds.

Objective

To prospectively validate the safety of a strategy that combines the YEARS rule with the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule and an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold.

Design, Settings, and Participants

A cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial in 18 emergency departments (EDs) in France and Spain. Patients (N = 1414) who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PERC rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE were included from October 2019 to June 2020, and followed up until October 2020.

Interventions

Each center was randomized for the sequence of intervention periods. In the intervention period (726 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging in patients with no YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than 1000 ng/mL and in patients with 1 or more YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than the age-adjusted threshold (500 ng/mL if age < 50 years or age in years × 10 in patients ≥ 50 years). In the control period (688 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging if the D-dimer level was less than the age-adjusted threshold.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months. The noninferiority margin was set at 1.35%. There were 8 secondary end points, including chest imaging, ED length of stay, hospital admission, nonindicated anticoagulation treatment, all-cause death, and all-cause readmission at 3 months.

Results

Of the 1414 included patients (mean age, 55 years; 58% female), 1217 (86%) were analyzed in the per-protocol analysis. PE was diagnosed in the ED in 100 patients (7.1%). At 3 months, VTE was diagnosed in 1 patient in the intervention group (0.15% [95% CI, 0.0% to 0.86%]) vs 5 patients in the control group (0.80% [95% CI, 0.26% to 1.86%]) (adjusted difference, -0.64% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 0.21%], within the noninferiority margin). Of the 6 analyzed secondary end points, only 2 showed a statistically significant difference in the intervention group compared with the control group: chest imaging (30.4% vs 40.0%; adjusted difference, -8.7% [95% CI, -13.8% to -3.5%]) and ED median length of stay (6 hours [IQR, 4 to 8 hours] vs 6 hours [IQR, 5 to 9 hours]; adjusted difference, -1.6 hours [95% CI, -2.3 to -0.9]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ED patients with suspected PE, the use of the YEARS rule combined with the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in PERC-positive patients, compared with a conventional diagnostic strategy, did not result in an inferior rate of thromboembolic events.

Hypothetical cohort

Based on hypothetical cohorts of 1000 patients for each age category, we calculated the numbers of extra patients in whom imaging examination would, correctly or wrongly, be avoided by using the age adjusted instead of the conventional D-dimer cut-off value (table 4). This would result in a correct exclusion of venous thromboembolism in 40 (95% confidence interval 38 to 41), 85 (81 to 86), 155 (141 to 164), and 175 (153 to 194) extra patients at the expense of 1 (0 to 4) extra missed cases for those aged 51–60 years, 2 (2 to 5) for those aged 61–70 years, 3 (2 to 4), for those aged 71–80 years, and 4 (2 to 6) for those aged more than 80 years. D-dimer testing would rule out venous thromboembolism in 124 per 1000 non-high risk patients aged more than 80 years if the conventional cut-off value would be applied, whereas the application of the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value results in exclusion of venous thromboembolism in 303 per 1000 of these patients. The positive predictive value was 21.2% (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 23.2%) in patients aged more than 80 years and 29.1% (25.3% to 33.1%) in patients aged 50 years or less. To examine the influence of the prevalence on this figure we also compared these numbers for the lowest and highest prevalence of venous thromboembolism of the non-high risk patients within each age category of the studies in this meta-analysis (fig 2). The relative merit of application of the age adjusted cut-off value instead of the conventional cut-off value was higher in the case of a low prevalence (44–194 correct v 0–2 falsely excluded cases) compared with a high prevalence (31–150 correctly v 2–7 falsely excluded cases) (see fig 2 and supplementary appendix 5).

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b47668ab]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

D-dimer concentrations are highly sensitive for thrombus formation. Hence D-dimer tests are often used to rule-out venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in suspected patients with a non-high clinical probability. Patients with a high clinical probability do not require a D-dimer test. In these patients imaging examination is warranted to confirm or refute the diagnosis, irrespective of the D-dimer results (fig 1). However, D-dimer concentrations increase with age, which leads to a high proportion of older patients with D-dimer concentrations higher than conventional cut-off values (500 µg/L). This in turn leads to a low specificity (that is, more false positive results) of D-dimer testing in older patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism; the specificity is 49% to 67% for patients aged less than 50 years but in older old patients (≥ 80 years) between 0% and 18%. As imaging is indicated in patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism with a D-dimer concentration above the cut-off value, a high proportion of older patients with a non-high clinical probability undergo unnecessary diagnostic investigations. This can be burdensome, especially in older patients, and the yield of this imaging is relatively low (typically 20% or less of patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism are actually affected). As a result of a low specificity of D-dimer testing in older patients, some authors dissuade doctors from D-dimer testing in very old patients. Yet this would actually imply referring all suspected older patients for imaging, which is even less desirable.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^35c27bcd]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Indeed we found a sharp decrease in the specificity of D-dimer testing to rule out venous thromboembolism in older patients with a non-high clinical probability using the conventional D-dimer cut-off value, although the sensitivities of D-dimer testing were high across all age categories. The proportion of patients with a non-high clinical probability in whom D-dimer testing could exclude venous thromboembolism was only 12.4% in those aged more than 80 years. This finding underlines the arguments of several authors that D-dimer testing in this conventional way is of limited value in the eldest patients. Yet the application of the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off valuewould result in the exclusion of venous thromboembolism in almost 1 out of 3 (30.3%) of the eldest patients (> 80 years), while the sensitivity stayed above 97% in all age categories. This would lead to one identified and treated patient for every five patients undergoing imaging examinations in the eldest patients, or in other words a positive predictive value of 21.1%. This positive predictive value of D-dimer testing in the eldest patients is almost comparable to the positive predictive value of 29.2% in the youngest patients (< 50 years, cut-off value of 500 µg/L). The small number of missed cases from applying the age adjusted cut-off value instead of the conventional cut-off (1 to 4 per 1000) is largely outnumbered by the large number of patients in whom imaging would be avoided (303 to 540 per 1000). Moreover, this number of missed cases from using the age adjusted cut-off value is comparable to the failure rate in the youngest age category (≤ 50 years) in whom 3 per 1000 patients would be missed if D-dimer testing using conventional cut-off levels was used. Even in case of a high prevalence of venous thromboembolism (when the relative merit of application of the age adjusted cut-off value is lowest) the additional number of patients missed (2 to 7 per 1000) would be outweighed by the number of avoided unnecessary imaging examinations (31 to 150 per 1000).

†Conventional cut-off value for D-dimer test = 500 μg/l, age adjusted cut-off value = (age×10) μg/l (if age > 50).

‡Number needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result

The age adjusted cut-off value resulted in an 11.2% (9.3% to 13.3%) increase in the number of patients with a negative D-dimer test result. The increase in the proportion of patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be ruled out (that is, unlikely clinical probability with a D-dimer level below the cut-off) from using the age adjusted cut-off value was most prominent among patients in the age groups > 70 years, with an absolute increase of 16% (table 3).

The data for validation set 1 came from a study in which two different D-dimer tests were used. We therefore performed separate analyses for the two D-dimer tests. There was no difference between the two tests in the false negative rate for the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value (table 4).

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^721ca9e0]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

For each age category and D-dimer cut-off level we constructed hypothetical classification tables including 1000 hypothetical patients per table. We calculated the total number of venous thromboembolism cases by multiplying 1000 with the estimated median prevalence of venous thromboembolism within the particular age category based on the studies included in this meta-analysis. We calculated the number of patients with true positive test results by multiplying the total number of hypothetical venous thromboembolism cases with the estimated sensitivity of the D-dimer test in the particular age category (or with the lower or upper 95% confidence interval border of the estimated sensitivity to extract a measure of uncertainty). To obtain the number of patients with true negative test results we multiplied the total number of hypothetical non-cases by the estimated specificity (or with the lower or upper limits of the 95% confidence interval of this estimate). To examine the influence of the prevalence on these numbers, we repeated these analyses using the minimum and maximum prevalence of venous thromboembolism within each age group based on this meta-analysis. These analyses were performed in Microsoft Office Excel version 2010.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^bf5d6d50]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing to exclude venous thromboembolism in older patients aged 50 or more years. Generally, in combination with a non-high clinical probability, D-dimer testing is used as a rule-out test in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. Using such a rule-out approach, unnecessary burdensome and more costly imaging can be avoided in about 1 in 3 patients. However, this proportion of patients in whom imaging can be safely withheld by using D-dimer testing seemed to be low (around 10%) in the eldest patients (> 80 years). This has led to controversy over the diagnostic value of D-dimer testing in older old patients (> 80 years) with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism. In particular old, fragile patients, who would benefit if an unnecessary referral to a radiology department could be safely avoided. In fact, this was the main reason for the development of age adjusted cut-off values for D-dimer testingand thereby the reason for this aggregated meta-analysis.

Age-adjusted D-dimer — clinical usefulness for increasing negative results and specificity shows consistent gains versus conventional cutoffs: the 3 Class II studies found a modest increase (ranging from 5% to 12%) in the proportion of non–high-risk patients with a negative D-dimer using age-adjusted versus conventional cutoffs, including a 12% increase from 28% to 40%, an increase from 28% to 33%, and from 28% to 37% with specificity improving from 36% to 47%. Class III studies also showed increases: from 46% to 51% and 34% to 40% in two validation sets; a 4% to 7% increase across clinical decision rules; from 54% to 63% with a yearly age-adjusted cutoff; specificity increases from 7% to 14% with a decadal formula and to 17% with yearly; and small increases from 2% to 6% (yearly) and from 2% to 13% using a 1,000 µg/L cutoff.

### Age-adjusted cutoff D-dimer level to rule out acute pulmonary embolism: a validation cohort study [^6bd71865]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the Emergency Room setting is challenging. Multiple patients have to undergo radiologic assessment with its inherent shortcomings. The D-dimer test with accepted cutoff level of 500 μg/L is associated with a high proportion of false-positive results. The present study aimed to validate the advantages of using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level, compared with 500-μg/L value in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.

Methods

This study evaluated patients admitted to the Rambam Emergency Room between 2011 and 2014 with a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Patient data, D-dimer plasma levels, and imaging results were collected. The study cohort was subdivided according to the D-dimer levels below and above 500 μg/L. The group with levels above 500 μg/L was further assessed using the newly suggested age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level, defined as age multiplied by 10.

Results

Files of 1241 patients were reviewed; 654 patients with low or intermediate risk for pulmonary embolism had a D-dimer level above 500 μg/L. Two hundred eight (208) patients had a D-dimer level above 500 μg/L but below the age-adjusted cutoff value; one of them was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (0.48% [95% confidence interval 0%-2.6%]). Four hundred forty-six (446) patients had a D-dimer level above the age-adjusted cutoff value, and 28 of them were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (6.28% [95% confidence interval 4.2%-8.9%]), representing a negative predictive value of 99.5% for the age-adjusted cutoff level.

Conclusions

An age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level may be safely used to exclude pulmonary embolism in patients with a low or intermediate probability for acute pulmonary embolism, alleviating the need to perform unnecessary imaging evaluations.

### Assessment of the safety and efficiency of using an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism [^c1043747]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

D-dimer levels increase with age, and research has suggested that using an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold may improve diagnostic efficiency without compromising safety. The objective of this study was to assess the safety of using an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in the workup of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

Methods

We report the outcomes of 923 patients aged > 50 years presenting to our ED with suspected PE, a calculated Revised Geneva Score (RGS), and a D-dimer test. All patients underwent CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We compared the false-negative rate for PE of a conventional D-dimer threshold with an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold and report the proportion of patients for whom an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold would obviate the need for CTPA.

Results

Among 104 patients with a negative conventional D-dimer test result and an RGS ≤ 10, no PE was observed within 90 days (false-negative rate, 0%; 95% CI, 0%-2.8%). Among 273 patients with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer result and an RGS ≤ 10, four PEs were observed within 90 days (false-negative rate, 1.5%; 95% CI, 0.4%-3.7%). We observed an 18.3% (95% CI, 15.9%-21.0%) absolute reduction in the proportion of patients aged > 50 years who would merit CTPA by using an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold compared with a conventional D-dimer threshold.

Conclusions

Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold reduces imaging among patients aged > 50 years with an RGS ≤ 10. Although the adoption of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold is probably safe, the CIs surrounding the additional 1.5% of PEs missed necessitate prospective study before this practice can be adopted into routine clinical care.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^782fcf70]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Physiological conditions

It has previously been pointed out that the detection of increased D-dimer does not necessarily imply the presence of an underlying disease because there are a number of physiological conditions that are accompanied by abnormal values (Table 1).D-dimer increases with age, thus leading to a greater proportion of older patients (> 50%) with values higher than the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L. The lower specificity of D-dimer for VTE in older compared to younger people implies that the former are unlikely to have negative D-dimer results even when VTE is absent, with a related high rate of unnecessary use of imaging tests. For this reason, an age-adjusted cutoff has been validated and recommended in the diagnostic workup of VTE. However, in patients > 80 years of age, the use of D-dimer measurement is not recommended for the exclusion of VTE, because high baseline levels lead to unacceptably high false positive results in cases with no VTE.

Figure 2.
Proposed algorithm for the diagnostic evaluation of venous thromboembolism. VTE: venous thromboembolism.

Similarly, D-dimer levels increase physiologically during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. D-dimer levels are also higher in women taking oral contraceptives than in non-users, perhaps reflecting their hypercoagulable state.

Exercise has effects on hemostasis that are dependent on the duration and intensity of the physical activity.D-dimer levels significantly increase following short-duration strenuous exercise, and exercise-induced fibrinolytic activity in healthy subjects is proportional to the amount of exercise taken. Changes in cardiac and hemostatic biomarkers (including D-dimer) after strenuous endurance exercise can mimic pulmonary embolism and myocardial injury in individuals who are not actually at risk.

‡Number needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result

External validation

The concept of using an increasing cut-off value for the D-dimer test according to age was validated in two independent cohorts of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The clinical characteristics of the patients in these cohorts were similar to those of the patients in the derivation set (table 1).

Validation set 1

Of the 3306 patients included in validation set 1, 674 (20.4%) had pulmonary embolism. In 41 of the 2206 patients with an unlikely clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, D-dimer test results were recorded only qualitatively and were therefore missing for this analysis. In another seven patients age was not documented, leaving 2158 patients. Among these, 983 patients had a negative D-dimer test result with the conventional cut-off value, of whom two (0.2%, 95% CI 0.1% to 0.7%) had pulmonary embolism during the diagnostic investigation or three month follow-up. With the age adjusted cut-off value, 1093 patients had a negative D-dimer test result, of whom seven (0.6%, 0.3% to 1.3%) had pulmonary embolism. Table 3shows the proportion of patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded based on the old and the new cut-off values.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on thromboembolic events in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: a randomized clinical trial [^7849129d]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study MODIGLIA-NI was published by Yonathan Freund and colleagues in 2021 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the trial question was: what is the effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in ED patients with suspected PE? In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the population was: 1414 patients (823 female, 591 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE. The key exclusion criteria were high or low clinical probability of PE; pregnancy; other obvious cause for chest pain, syncope or dyspnea; concurrent anticoagulation treatment. In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the interventions were: n = 648 modified diagnostic strategy (use of YEARS rule combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing) n = 623 a conventional diagnostic strategy (test with D-dimer using the age-adjusted threshold level). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in VTE at 3 months (0.15% vs. 0.8%; AD -0.64%, 97.5% CI -Infinity to 0.21). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in need of chest imaging (30.4% vs. 40%; AD -8.7%, 95% CI -13.8 to -3.5) Significant increase in ED median length of stay (6 hours vs. 6 hours; AD 1.6 hours, 95% CI -2.3 to -0.9). In the MODIGLIA-NI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PE rule-out criteria rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE, modified diagnostic strategy was noninferior to a conventional diagnostic strategy with respect to VTE at 3 months.

### Using an age-dependent D-dimer cut-off value increases the number of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely excluded [^0c7c4895]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

D-dimer testing to rule out deep vein thrombosis is less useful in older patients because of a lower specificity. An age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off value increased the proportion of older patients (> 50 years) in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded. We retrospectively validated the efficacy of this cut-off combined with clinical probability for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis.

Design and Methods

Five management study cohorts of 2818 consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis were used. Patients with non-high or unlikely probability of deep vein thrombosis were included in the analysis; four different D-dimer tests were used. The proportion of patients with a normal D-dimer test and the failure rates were calculated using the conventional (500 μg/L) and the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (patient's age x 10 μg/L in patients > 50 years).

Results

In 1672 patients with non-high probability, deep vein thrombosis could be excluded in 850 (51%) patients with the age-adjusted cut-off value versus 707 (42%) patients with the conventional cut-off value. The failure rates were 7 (0.8; 95% confidence interval 0.3–1.7%) for the age-adjusted cut-off value and 5 (0.7%, 0.2–1.6%) for the conventional cut-off value. The absolute increase in patients in whom deep vein thrombosis could be ruled out using the age-adjusted cut-off value was largest in patients > 70 years: 19% among patients with non-high probability.

Conclusions

The age-adjusted cut-off of the D-dimer combined with clinical probability greatly increases the proportion of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely excluded.

### Utility and limitations of patient-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels for diagnosis of venous thromboembolism – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^d404166d]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To systematically assess test performance of patient-adapted D-dimer cut-offs for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Methods

Systematic review and analysis of articles published in PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Library databases. Investigations assessing patient-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for the exclusion of VTE were included. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model was used to assess diagnostic accuracy. Risk of bias was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 score.

Results

A total of 68 studies involving 141,880 patients met the inclusion criteria. The standard cut-off revealed a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–0.99) and specificity of 0.23 (95% CI 0.16–0.31). Sensitivity was comparable to the standard cut-off for age-adjustment (0.97 [95% CI 0.96–0.98]) and YEARS algorithm (0.98 [95% CI 0.91–1.00]) but lower for pretest probability (PTP)-adjusted (0.95 [95% CI 0.89–0.98) and COVID-19-adapted thresholds (0.93 [95% CI 0.82–0.98]). Specificity was significantly higher across all adjustment strategies (age: 0.43 [95% CI 0.36–0.50]; PTP: 0.63 [95% CI 0.51–0.73]; YEARS algorithm: 0.65 [95% CI 0.39–0.84]; and COVID-19: 0.51 [95% CI 0.40–0.63]). The YEARS algorithm provided the best negative likelihood ratio (0.03 [95% CI 0.01–0.15]), followed by age-adjusted (both 0.07 [95% CI 0.05–0.09]), PTP (0.08 [95% CI 0.04–0.17), and COVID-19-adjusted thresholds (0.13 [95% CI 0.05–0.32]).

Conclusions

This study indicates that adjustment of D-dimer thresholds to patient-specific factors is safe and embodies considerable potential for reduction of imaging. However, robustness, safety, and efficiency vary considerably among different adjustment strategies with a high degree of heterogeneity.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer to rule out deep vein thrombosis: findings from the PALLADIO algorithm [^b9b80685]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials The accuracy of the age-adjusted D-dimer in suspected venous thromboembolism is still debated. We assessed the performance of age-adjusted D-dimer combined with the PALLADIO algorithm. The age-adjusted threshold can reduce the need for imaging tests compared to the fixed cut-off. The safety of this approach should be confirmed in large management studies.

Summary

Background Age-adjusted D-dimer has been proposed to increase specificity for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the accuracy of this threshold has been recently questioned. Objectives To assess the diagnostic performance of age-adjusted D-dimer combined with clinical pretest probability (PTP) in patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Methods PALLADIO (NCT01412242) was a multicenter management study that validated a new diagnostic algorithm, incorporating PTP, D-dimer (using the manufacturer's cut-off) and limited or extended compression ultrasonography (CUS) in outpatients with clinically suspected DVT. Patients with unlikely PTP and negative D-dimer had DVT ruled out without further testing (group 1); patients with likely PTP or positive D-dimer underwent limited CUS (group 2); patients with likely PTP and positive D-dimer underwent extended CUS (group 3). Patients with DVT ruled out at baseline had a 3-month follow-up. In this post-hoc analysis we evaluated age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (defined as age times 10 μg L -1, or age times 5 μg L -1 for D-dimers with a lower manufacturer's cut-off, in patients > 50 years). Results In total, 1162 patients were enrolled. At initial visit, DVT was detected in 4.0% of patients in group 2 and 53.0% in group 3. The age-adjusted D-dimer, compared with the fixed cut-off, resulted in 5.1% (95% CI, 4.0–6.5%) reduction of CUS. The incidence of symptomatic VTE during follow-up was: 0.24% (95% CI, 0.04–1.37) in group 1; 1.12% (95% CI, 0.44–2.85) in group 2; and 1.89% (95% CI, 0.64–5.40) in group 3. Conclusions The PALLADIO algorithm using age-adjusted D-dimer slightly decreased the number of required imaging tests, but this approach should be confirmed in large management studies.

### The original and simplified wells rules and age-adjusted D-dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^7653fcca]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Evidence for the simplified Wells rule in ruling out acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is scarce. This was a post-hoc analysis on data from 6 studies comprising 7268 patients with suspected PE. The simplified Wells rule combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing may safely rule out PE. Given its ease of use, the simplified Wells rule is to be preferred over the original Wells rule.

Summary

Background The Wells score and D-dimer testing can safely rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). A simplification of the Wells score has been proposed to improve clinical applicability, but evidence on its performance is scarce. Objectives To compare the performances of the original and simplified Wells scores alone and in combination with age-adjusted D-dimer testing. Methods Individual patient data from 7268 patients with suspected PE enrolled in six management studies were used to evaluate the discriminatory performances of the original and simplified Wells scores. The efficiency and failure rate of the dichotomized original and simplified scores combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing were compared by use of a one-stage random effects meta-analysis. Efficiency was defined as the proportion of patients in whom PE could be considered to be excluded on the basis of a 'PE unlikely' Wells score and a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test result. Failure rate was defined as the proportion of patients with symptomatic venous thromboembolism during a 3-month follow-up. Results The discriminatory performances of the original and simplified Wells scores were comparable (c-statistic 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.75] versus 0.72 [95% CI 0.70–0.73]). When combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing, the original and simplified Wells rules had comparable efficiency (3% [95% CI 25–42%] versus 30% [95% CI 21–40%]) and failure rates (0.9% [95% CI 0.6–1.5%] versus 0.8% [95% CI 0.5–1.3%]). Conclusion The original and simplified Wells rules combined with age-adjusted D-dimer testing have similar performances in ruling out PE. Given its ease of use in clinical practice, the simplified Wells rule is to be preferred.

### Comparison of the age-adjusted and clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in the ED [^945c2d47]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging because its signs and symptoms are non-specific.

Objective

We compared the efficacy and safety of using age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer interpretation and standard D-dimer approach to exclude PE in ED patients.

Design/Methods

We performed a health records review at two emergency departments over a two-year period. We reviewed all cases where patients had a D-dimer ordered to test for PE or underwent CT or VQ scanning for PE. PE was considered to be present during the emergency department visit if PE was diagnosed on CT or VQ (subsegmental level or above), or if the patient was subsequently found to have PE or deep vein thrombosis during the next 30 days. We applied the three D-dimer approaches to the low and moderate probability patients. The primary outcome was exclusion of PE with each rule. Secondary objective was to estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) for each rule.

Results

1163 emergency patients were tested for PE and 1075 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. PE was excluded in 70.4% (95% CI 67.6–73.0%), 80.3% (95% CI 77.9–82.6%) and 68.9%; (95% CI 65.7–71.3%) with the age-adjusted, clinical probability-adjusted and standard D-dimer approach. The NPVs were 99.7% (95% CI 99.0–99.9%), 99.1% (95% CI 98.3–99.5%) and 100% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%) respectively.

Conclusion

The clinical probability-adjusted rule appears to exclude PE in a greater proportion of patients, with a very small reduction in the negative predictive value.

### Evaluating outcomes of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism using an age-adjusted cutoff with a D-dimer unit-based assay [^9886bb01]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Studies have suggested that an age-adjusted D-dimer (AADD) could improve specificity while maintaining sensitivity for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Most laboratories and published data report D-dimer in fibrinogen equivalent units, but some laboratory assays report using D-dimer units (DDU). However, only two small studies have examined AADD with a DDU-based assay. Our study aims to assess the sensitivity and specificity of AADD cutoffs, compared to the conventional cutoffs, in a large cohort of patients who underwent D-dimer testing using a DDU-based assay, for suspected PE.

Methods

We included 1831 patients who presented to the emergency department and underwent a diagnostic workup that included a D-dimer test followed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTA). The laboratory utilized the HemosIL D-Dimer HS reagent, reporting D-dimer values in DDU (ng/mL). We retrospectively adjusted D-dimer levels for patients using the formula: age (years) x 5 ng/mL. This adjustment created a comparison group to evaluate the test characteristics of the AADD cutoff compared to the conventional cutoff.

Results

The conventional D-dimer cutoff of 230 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 97.4% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 95.3–99.4%), specificity of 7.3% (CI: 6.0–8.6%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 13% (CI: 11.4–14.6%), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.1% (CI: 91.3–98.9%). The AADD cutoff had a sensitivity of 96.1% (CI: 93.5–98.6%), specificity of 16.6% (CI: 14.8–18.4%), PPV of 14.1% (CI: 12.3–15.8%), and NPV of 96.7% (CI: 94.6–98.8%).

Conclusion

In this study using a DDU-based assay, the specificity of the AADD cutoff was greater while the sensitivity was similar to that of the unadjusted cutoff, with no statistically significant difference observed.

### An age-adjusted D-dimer threshold for emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolus: accuracy and clinical implications [^9c0722bd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine the accuracy of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold to detect pulmonary embolism in emergency department (ED) patients older than 50 years and describe current ED practices when evaluating possible pulmonary embolism.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of ED encounters for suspected pulmonary embolism from 2008 to 2013. We used structured data to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of different D-dimer thresholds. We describe the incidence of pulmonary embolism, the proportion of patients receiving imaging concordant with D-dimer levels, and the number of "missed" pulmonary embolisms. These findings were used to estimate patient outcomes based on different D-dimer thresholds.

Results

Among 31,094 encounters for suspected pulmonary embolism, there were 507 pulmonary embolism diagnoses. The age-adjusted D-dimer threshold was more specific (64% versus 54%) but less sensitive (93% versus 98%) than the standard threshold of 500 ng/dL; 11,999 imaging studies identified 507 pulmonary embolisms (4.2%); of these, 1,323 (10.6%) were performed with a D-dimer result below the standard threshold. Among patient encounters without imaging, 17.6% had D-dimer values above the threshold, including 5 missed pulmonary embolisms. Among patients who received imaging, 10.6% had a negative D-dimer result. Applying an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold to our sample would avert 2,924 low-value imaging tests while resulting in 26 additional cases of missed pulmonary embolism.

Conclusion

An age-adjusted D-dimer limit has the potential to reduce chest imaging among older ED patients and is more accurate than a standard threshold of 500 ng/dL. Our findings support the adoption of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in community EDs.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ccfe1f9d]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Prevalence of venous thromboembolism and effect of age on specificity and sensitivity of D-dimer testing with a conventional cut-off value

The median prevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients not at high risk ranged from 12.3% in patients aged less than 50 years, to 21.5% in patients aged 71–80 (table 2). The pooled specificity of D-dimer testing decreased substantially with increasing age from 66.8% (95% confidence interval 61.3% to 72.0%) in patients aged less than 50 years to 14.7% (11.3% to 18.6%) in patients aged more than 80 years when the conventional cut-off value was applied (table 2). The pooled sensitivity hardly differed between the age groups.

Table 2
Pooled estimates of diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism and non-high clinical probability per age category and cut-off value in 13 study cohorts

*Additional data of cohort 5 of Douma 2012 study (Tan et al, unpublished), were not provided for these age categories (89 patients aged < 50 years and 44 patients aged 51–60 years).

†Age adjusted cut-off value (age×50 µg/L) does not apply (NA) to patients aged ≤ 50 years.

Performance of age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values

The use of the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value (age×10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) still showed a decrease in specificity with increasing age, which was 35.2% (29.4% to 41.5%) in patients aged more than 80 years, but noticeably less pronounced compared with the application of the conventional cut-off value. The specificity of D-dimer testing by application of the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value instead of the conventional cut-off value was higher in all age categories and was more than doubled in patients aged more than 80 years (table 2).

The use of age adjusted cut-off values instead of the conventional cut-off value was at the expense of a decrease in sensitivity (albeit small and not statistically significant), which stayed above 97% for both cut-off levels in all age categories.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^5f1f62f9]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Derivation set outcome

With the conventional cut-off value, the VIDAS D-dimer test was normal (< 500 μg/l) in 512/1712 patients (29.9%), and none had pulmonary embolism during the initial investigation or the three month follow-up (0%, 95% CI 0% to 0.7%). The number of patients needed to test to find one normal D-dimer test result was 3.3. The Wells score could not be computed in 54 of the patients, mainly because information on the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis to that of pulmonary embolism was missing (n = 42).

Using the age adjusted cut-off value ((age (years)×10) μg/l), we found that D-dimer test results were negative in 615/1712 patients (46.2%, number needed to test 2.2). This resulted in a 20.1% (95% CI 16.9% to 23.8%) relative increase in the number of patients in whom D-dimer levels were considered normal. Of these 615 patients, five had pulmonary embolism during investigation or three month follow-up (0.8%, 0.4% to 1.9%).

Table 2shows the proportion of the 1331 patients with an unlikely clinical probability in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded based on the conventional and the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values. There was a 17.4% (95% CI 14.3% to 21.1%) increase in the number of patients with a negative D-dimer test result when the age adjusted cut-off value was used. The false negative rate was 0 (0%, 0% to 0.8%) for the conventional cut-off value compared with 1 (0.2%, 0% to 1.0%) for the age adjusted cut-off value. Table 2 also shows the increase in the proportion of patients with an unlikely clinical probability in whom D-dimer levels would be considered normal for specific age groups by using the age adjusted cut-off value: this increase was highest among the oldest patient groups (> 70 years), with an absolute increase of 14% compared with the conventional cut-off point.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^36a4dd30]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — nonhigh-risk adult patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) — are commonly based on the patient's age in years (age×10 μg/L) for patients older than 50 years, with most studies using high-sensitivity assays that generally use a conventional cutoff of FEU at 500 μg/L; one study using the HemosIL assay reported results in DDU and used age×5 μg/L. Nonhigh risk refers to a low or intermediate pretest probability or "PE unlikely" using a validated clinical prediction rule, and age-dependent increases in D-dimer reduce specificity with a fixed cutoff in the elderly, leading to unnecessary imaging.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^f32041c6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer for pulmonary embolism (PE) evaluation in older adults increases negative results with small changes in miss rates and preserved sensitivity in select subgroups. In PE-unlikely patients older than 75 years, negative D-dimer increased from 8% to 20% with a miss rate increase from 0% to 2.1% (95% CI 1% to 6%). For patients older than 70 years, negative D-dimer increased 6% to 21% (Wells), 5% to 17% (simplified Wells), and 3% to 12% (RGS/simplified RGS). In patients older than 80 years, sensitivity with age-adjusted D-dimer was maintained at 100% (95% CI 91% to 100%) with negatives increasing from 0% to 5%; in a separate > 80 years cohort, negatives rose from 9% to 21% and 15% to 29% with miss rates 2% (95% CI 0% to 11%) and 0% (95% CI 0% to 7%). Using a fixed cutoff of 1,000 µg/L for patients older than 70 years yielded sensitivity of 92% compared with 94% for a threshold of 500 µg/L, with specificity increased by only 6% (from 26% to 32%) and 9 of 10 missed PEs being subsegmental. Overall, "using a strategy of adjusting the D-dimer for age" may reduce advanced imaging in "approximately 5% to 10% of patients, without a significant increase in missed cases of PE".

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels to rule out venous thromboembolism in patients with non-high pre-test probability: clinical performance and cost-effectiveness analysis [^fb90ec27]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As aging was found to be associated with increased D-dimer levels, the question arose whether D-dimer measurement was useful in the diagnostic strategy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in elderly patients.

Aim Of The Study

To compare retrospectively the performance of six diagnostic strategies based on the three-level Wells scores and various cut-off levels for D-dimer, evaluated using the HemosIL D-Dimer HS 500 assay, in a derivation cohort of 644 outpatients with non-high pretest probability (PTP) of VTE. The clinical usefulness of the best-performing strategy was then confirmed in a multicenter validation study involving 1255 consecutive outpatients with non-high PTP.

Results

The diagnostic strategy based on the age-adjusted cut-off level calculated by multiplying the patient's age by 10 above 50 years was found to perform the best in the derivation study with a better sensitivity-to-specificity ratio than the conventional strategy based on the fixed cut-off level (500 ng/ml), a higher specificity and a negative predictive value (NPV) above 99%. Such an increase in test specificity was confirmed in the validation cohort, with the NPV remaining above 99%. Taking into account the local reimbursement rates of diagnostic tests, using this strategy led to a 6.9% reduction of diagnostic costs for pulmonary embolism and a 5.1% reduction for deep vein thrombosis, as imaging tests would be avoided in a higher percentage of patients.

Conclusion

The diagnostic strategy of VTE based on the age-adjusted cut-off level for D-dimer in patients over 50 years was found to be safe, with NPV above 99%, and cost-effective.

### Performance of age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to rule out pulmonary embolism [^867f918e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off has recently been proposed to increase D-dimer usefulness in older patients suspected of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Objective

We externally validated this age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off using different D-dimer assays in a multicenter sample of emergency department patients.

Methods

Secondary analysis of three prospectively collected databases (two European, one American) of patients suspected of having PE. D-dimer performance for ruling out PE was assessed by calculating negative likelihood ratio (nLR) for D-dimer with age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (< age × 10 in patients over 50 years) and with conventional cut-off (< 500 μg dL(-1)). Test efficiency was assessed by the number needed to test (NNT) to rule out PE in one patient.

Results

Among 4537 patients included, overall PE prevalence was 10.1%. In the overall population, nLR was 0.06 (95% confidence interval, 0.03–0.09) with conventional cut-off and 0.08 (0.05–0.12) with age-adjusted cut-off. Using age-adjusted cut-off, nLR was 0.08, 0.09 and 0.06 for Vidas(®), Liatest(®) and MDA(®) assays, respectively. Use of age-adjusted cut-off produced a favorable effect on NNT in the elderly; the greatest decrease was observed in patients > 75 years: NTT halved from 8.1 to 3.6. The proportion of patients over 75 years with normal D-dimer was doubled (27.9% vs. 12.3%).

Conclusions

Our study shows that age-adjusted D-dimer had low nLR, allowing its use as a rule-out PE strategy in non-high pretest clinical probability patients, as well as using Vidas(®), Liatest(®) or MDA(®) assays. This age-adjusted cut-off increased clinical usefulness of D-dimer in older patients. A large prospective study is required to confirm these results.

### Multi-center implementation of automated age-adjusted D-dimer results reduces unnecessary PE imaging [^8e24b7d4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Several previous studies have investigated the clinical utility of age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE).

Objectives

We performed a pre/post implementation study, using data from a mid-Atlantic healthcare system comprising 6 hospitals and 400,000 ED visits to determine whether implementing age adjusted D-dimer cutoffs reduced the number of imaging tests performed.

Methods

Retrospective study of all patients who had a D-dimer performed during ED visits between September 2015 to September 2018. On March 21, 2017, the D-dimer upper limit of normal system-wide was increased for patients over 50 to: Age (years) x 0.01μg/mL. D-dimer results were displayed as normal or high based on automated age adjustment. EHR Chart review was performed 1.5 years prior to implementation of age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs, as well as 1.5 years after to evaluate mortality and test accuracy characteristics such as false negative rates. Comparisons were made using chi-square testing.

Results

22,302 D-dimers were performed pre-implementation of which 10,837 (48.6%) were positive resulting in 7218 (32.3%) imaging studies. After implementation of age-adjusted d-dimer, 25,082 were performed of which 10,851 (43.2%) were positive resulting in 7017 (28.0%) imaging studies. (pre: 48.6%, post: 43.2%; p < 0.01). A significantly lower proportion of patients had a positive d-dimer (pre: 48.6%, post: 43.2%; p < 0.01) and underwent imaging post-implementation (pre: 32.3%, post: 28.0%; p < 0.05) a relative risk reduction of 13.3. This absolute risk reduction of 4.4% is associated with 1104 less scans in the post-implementation group while still increasing test accuracy from 53.7% to 59.2% (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Implementation of an automated age-adjusted D-dimer positive reference value reduced CT and V/Q imaging in this population by 4.4% while increasing test accuracy in a regional, heterogeneous six-hospital system.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^df5f812b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and a non-high pretest probability, the use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff (AADD, < 500 ng/mL up to 50 years, then < age × 10 ng/mL) was shown to further reduce the need for computed tomography pulmonary angiography while safely ruling out PE. Our objective was to evaluate its cost-effectiveness.

Methods

We created a decision tree to compare the use of the AADD with the standard D-dimer cutoff. The model included short-term venous thromboembolism-related events and long-term complications, their associated morbidity/mortality, and costs. Probabilities were derived from published literature and the ADJUST-PE study, and costs from US estimates. The time horizon was lifetime, with a health care system perspective.

Results

Using the AADD cutoff, compared with the standard cutoff, was associated with a loss of 0.0001 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and an average cost reduction of $33.4. The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was +$282 881/lost QALY (95% confidence interval from +$43 209/lost QALY to a dominant strategy). The probability that the use of the AADD cutoff was either dominant or gained > $200 000/lost QALY was 79.4%. In sensitivity analyses, the DCER became < +$200 000/lost QALY only if, among patients with D-dimer below the AADD cutoff, the mortality of an undiagnosed PE was > 6% or the prevalence of PE was > 0.6%.

Conclusions

The AADD cutoff results in a clinically nonsignificant decrease in QALY but important costs reductions. It is a decrementally cost-effective innovation, with a potential of cost savings of > $80 million per year for the United States health care system.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^7b3d7db9]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Data analysis

In the derivation set and validation set 1 the Wells clinical prediction rule for pulmonary embolism was calculated in all patients, and patients were classified according to the dichotomised Wells score as likely or unlikely to have pulmonary embolism. In validation set 2, the revised Geneva score was calculated in all patients and classified as a high or non-high (low or intermediate) score.

To derive a new D-dimer cut-off value, we divided patients aged > 50 in the derivation set into 10 year age groups. We constructed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of the D-dimer test for each age group to find the best cut-off value (with a sensitivity of 100% and the highest corresponding specificity). We plotted the D-dimer cut-off level against age group and performed linear regression analysis to obtain the regression coefficient, representing the increase in D-dimer cut-off value per decade. This coefficient was divided by 10 to find the coefficient per year. This coefficient was the multiplication factor for age in the new age-adjusted cut-off value.

We then calculated the proportion of patients with a negative D-dimer test result (as defined by the new cut-off point), the proportion in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded (based on an "unlikely" Wells score or "non-high" revised Geneva score plus the negative D-dimer test result), and the false negative rates (that is, those patients who had pulmonary embolism in the diagnostic investigation or during follow-up). The number of patients needed to test by D-dimer to rule out one pulmonary embolism was computed as 1 divided by the proportion of patients with a negative D-dimer test result in each age group.

In the validation sets, D-dimer test results were missing in a large proportion of patients with a "likely" Wells score or high revised Geneva score. Therefore, the age adjusted D-dimer cut-off point was validated only in patients with an "unlikely" or non-high clinical probability score in these two cohorts.

We calculated exact 95% confidence intervals using CIA software version 1.0 (Gardner et al. Confidence Interval Analysis (CIA), BMJ Books). All other analyses were performed with SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^4fadee0e]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Validation set 2

Of the 1812 patients included in the second validation set, 375 (20.7%) had pulmonary embolism. Among the 1643 patients who had a non-high revised Geneva score, 561 patients (34%, number needed to test 2.9) had a normal D-dimer test result according to the conventional cut-off value (table 5), and none (0%, 95% CI 0% to 0.7%) had pulmonary embolism during the initial investigation or three month follow-up. With the age adjusted cut-off value, 663/1643 patients had a negative D-dimer test result (40.4%, number needed to test 2.5) (table 5). This resulted in an 18.2% (15.0% to 21.4%) increase in the number of patients in whom the D-dimer test was negative. The false negative rate with the age adjusted cut-off value was 2 (0.3%, 0.1% to 1.1%). Again use of the age adjusted cut-off value had the greatest effect in the older age groups (table 5).

### No added value of the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to the YEARS algorithm in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism [^afb034b5]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials Imaging is warranted in the majority of patients to confirm or rule out pulmonary embolism (PE). The age-adjusted D-dimer (ADJUST) reduced the number of required imaging tests in patients ≥ 50 years. The YEARS algorithm was designed to improve the efficiency in patients with suspected PE. There was no added value of implementing ADJUST in the YEARS algorithm in our cohort.

Summary

Background The YEARS algorithm was designed to simplify the diagnostic work-up of pulmonary embolism (PE) and to reduce the number of necessary computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) scans. An alternative strategy to reduce the number of CTPAs is the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (ADJUST) in patients aged 50 years or older. We aimed to investigate whether a combination of both diagnostic strategies might save additional CTPAs. Methods The YEARS algorithm consists of three items (clinical signs of deep venous thrombosis, hemoptysis, 'PE most likely diagnosis') with simultaneous D-dimer testing using a pre-test dependent threshold. We performed a post hoc analysis in 3465 patients managed according to YEARS to compare the number of patients managed without CTPA scans and associated diagnostic failures in hypothetical scenarios with different YEARS-ADJUST combinations. Results Following the YEARS algorithm, 1651 patients (48%) were managed without CTPA; PE was diagnosed in 456 (13%) patients at baseline and 18 patients with initial normal testing suffered venous thromboembolism (VTE) during 3-month follow-up (failure rate 0.61%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.96). If ADJUST had been fully integrated in YEARS, 1627 patients (47%) would have been managed without CTPA (absolute decrease of 0.69%; 95% CI -1.7 to 3.0), at cost of four additional missed PE diagnoses at baseline, for a projected 3-month VTE failure rate of 0.75% (95% CI, 0.49–1.13). None of the other studied scenarios showed relevant improvements in efficiency as well, but all led to more missed diagnoses. Conclusion In our cohort, there was no added value of implementing ADJUST in the YEARS algorithm.

### Age adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for pulmonary embolism in a geriatric population utilizing a D-dimer unit assay [^3820a6ca]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Age adjusted serum d-dimer (AADD) with clinical decision rules have been utilized to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk patients; however, its use in the geriatric population has been questioned and the use of d-dimer unit (DDU) assay is uncommon.

Objective

The present study aims to compare the test characteristics of the AADD (age × 5) measured in DDU with the standard cutoff (DDU < 250) and study hospital laboratory's d-dimer cutoff (DDU < 600) in geriatric patients presenting with suspected PE.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled patients ≥ 65 years old with suspected PE and d-dimer performed between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 who presented to the emergency department (ED). Charts were reviewed for CTA chest and ventilation perfusion imaging results for PE. Diagnostic parameters for each cutoff were calculated for the primary outcome.

Results

510 patients were included, 20 with PE. There was no significant difference between the sensitivities of AADD (100%, 95% CI: 80–100), standard cutoff (100%, 95% CI: 80–100), and hospital cutoff (90%, 95% CI: 66.9–98.2). The hospital cutoff specificity (22.7%, 95% CI: 17.1–29.3) was significantly greater than the AADD (13.4%, 95% CI: 9.1–19.2) and standard cutoff (10.8%, 95% CI: 7.0–16.3) specificities.

Conclusions

In geriatric patients presenting to the ED with suspected PE, the AADD measured in DDUs maintained sensitivity with improved specificity compared to standard cutoff. In this population, the AADD would have safely reduced imaging by 19% without missing any PEs. AADD remains a valid tool with high sensitivity and negative predictive value in ruling out PE in geriatric patients.

### The performance of age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off in Chinese outpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism [^cb3e58c5]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

D-dimer testing has been widely used in the exclusion of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but its clinical usefulness is limited in older patients because of a lower specificity.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of STA-Liatest D-dimer assay and validate the age-adjusted cut-off value in Chinese outpatients with suspected VTE in a prospective non-interventional study.

Methods

Symptomatic patients suspected of having deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism were recruited from 2 participating centers. STA-Liatest D-dimer assay, clinical pretest probability assessment and diagnostic imaging test including complete compression ultrasonography or computed tomography pulmonary angiography were performed among all participants. The performance of D-dimer test was assessed with an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (age×0.01μg/ml in patients aged > 50years) and with conventional cut-off (0.5μg/ml at all ages).

Results

A total of 594 eligible outpatients were included in this study and VTE was diagnosed in 195 (32.8%) patients. In those patients with a low or moderate pretest probability (n = 373), the increase in the proportion of patients with a D-dimer below the age-adjusted cut-off value compared with the conventional cut-off value was 5.9% (95% confidence interval; 3.8%-8.7%). The sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value of STA-Liatest D-dimer test were 95.0% (83.5% - 98.6%), 84.1%(79.8%-87.6%) and 99.3%(97.5% - 99.8%), respectively, using the age-adapted diagnostic strategy.

Conclusions

The application of age-adjusted cut-off of D-dimer test combined with clinical probability greatly increases the proportion of Chinese older outpatients in whom VTE can be safely excluded.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^b0687cb6]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objectives In older patients, the the D-dimer test for pulmonary embolism has reduced specificity and is therefore less useful. In this study a new, age dependent cut-off value for the test was devised and its usefulness with older patients assessed.

Design Retrospective multicentre cohort study.

Setting General and teaching hospitals in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

Patients 5132 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.

Intervention Development of a new D-dimer cut-off point in patients aged > 50 years in a derivation set (data from two multicentre cohort studies), based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. This cut-off value was then validated with two independent validation datasets.

Main outcome measures The proportion of patients in the validation cohorts with a negative D-dimer test, the proportion in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded, and the false negative rates.

Results The new D-dimer cut-off value was defined as (patient's age×10) μg/l in patients aged > 50. In 1331 patients in the derivation set with an "unlikely" score from clinical probability assessment, pulmonary embolism could be excluded in 42% with the new cut-off value versus 36% with the old cut-off value (< 500 μg/l). In the two validation sets, the increase in the proportion of patients with a D-dimer below the new cut-off value compared with the old value was 5% and 6%. This absolute increase was largest among patients aged > 70 years, ranging from 13% to 16% in the three datasets. The failure rates (all ages) were 0.2% (95% CI 0% to 1.0%) in the derivation set and 0.6% (0.3% to 1.3%) and 0.3% (0.1% to 1.1%) in the two validation sets.

Conclusions The age adjusted D-dimer cut-off point, combined with clinical probability, greatly increased the proportion of older patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be safely excluded.

Guideline context — age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds — notes that several other societies have reviewed this issue; the American College of Physicians recommends using age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds in patients older than 50 years and not ordering imaging if the D-dimer is below the cutoff, whereas the 2014 European Society of Cardiology guidelines discussed but did not formally endorse their use; applicability to U.S. ED populations may be limited because many included studies were European with higher PE prevalence than most U.S. study populations.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^6054d81c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Safety of the age-adjusted D-dimer strategy — miss rate and outcomes — addresses that the primary concern is whether increasing the threshold increases the risk of missed PEs, with "miss rate" defined as the proportion of patients with a negative D-dimer result who ultimately received a diagnosis of PE; across 3 Class II studies, the miss rate and sensitivities were similar to a conventional cutoff. In a prospective multicenter study by Righini et al of 3,324 ED patients with a 19% PE prevalence, 87% were at nonhigh risk and those with negative results were discharged without additional testing or anticoagulation; the 3-month risk of missed (nonfatal) PE was 1 among 810 with a negative conventional result (0.1%), and with age-adjusted cutoffs there was 1 additional missed PE among 331 negatives, totaling 2 missed among 1,141 patients (0.2%).

Implementation considerations for age-adjusted D-dimer include potential benefits of reduced cost and ED time with less diagnostic testing, better use of health care resources, and improved patient satisfaction from more efficient evaluation, balanced against potential harms of a small increased incidence of missed PE and misapplication due to confusion with multiple D-dimer assay units.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off levels to rule out pulmonary embolism (ADJUST) [^c97005f9]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer Cut-off Levels to Rule Out Pulmonary Embolism ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Therefore, many investigators tried to increase the D-dimer thresholds in particular in elderly patients to increase the rate of patients in whom the diagnosis could be excluded by this easy and inexpensive test. Several studies have shown that D-dimer levels increase with age and which turns in a decreased specificity of the D-dimer test at the usual threshold in the elderly, and thus to a less useful test to exclude PE in older patients. Indeed, ELISA D-dimer is able to rule out PE in 60% of patients aged less than 40 years, but in only 5% of patients above the age of 80. 8 In this study, raising the cut-off value to various points between 600 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml increased specificity, but this came at the cost of safety with more false negative test results. In this analysis, however, no stratification was made for clinical probability and the sample was small.

Recently, the investigators retrospectively assessed the value of a progressive cut-off adjusted to age in a wide sample of 1712 patients. This "new" cut-off was defined for D-Dimer test positivity in each patient by multiplying patient's age by 10. All patients with a D-Dimer level below 500mg/ml, and all patients above 50 years whose D-Dimer levels were inferior to their age multiplied by 10 were considered as having a negative D-Dimer test. Of these 615 patients, 5 had PE during initial workup. These data suggest that adopting this progressive cut-off in patients above 50 years, could increase of about 20% the number of patients in whom PE could be excluded without further testing, with an acceptable safety profile as the three-month thromboembolic rate remained very low.

Therefore, the investigators plan a prospective outcome study in which this progressive or "new" cut-off in patients above 50 years will be used. In this multicentre study, clinical probability will be assessed by the simplified revised Geneva revised score and an ELISA D-dimer test will be performed.

### Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off leads to more efficient diagnosis of venous thromboembolism in the emergency department: a comparison of four assays [^427c0ed0]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs decrease the false positives in the elderly. Four D-dimer assays were compared in venous thromboembolism outpatients in an emergency ward. Age-adjusted cut-off resulted in improved specificity with maintained sensitivity for all assays. There was a substantial decrease in false positive results, especially in the older population.

Summary

Background The study compares different D-dimer assays and age-adjusted cut-offs in outpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The plasma concentration of this sensitive biomarker is increased by activated coagulation, but also by several conditions that are linked to an increased risk of VTE. One such condition is old age, which poses a common clinical problem where many prefer not to analyze D-dimer in elderly patients. Age-adjusted cut-offs have been validated for both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, aiming to increase specificity without notably decreasing sensitivity. Objectives We evaluated four common D-dimer assays in parallel, with and without applying age-adjusted cut offs for VTE. Patients/methods The prospective single-center study was conducted in 940 outpatients attending the emergency department with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism or DVT. Four automated D-dimer assays were compared (Siemens INNOVANCE ®, Roche Tina-quant, Medirox MRX and STA ® -Liatest ® D-Di PLUS). Results All assays performed with areas under the ROC curve (AUC) > 0.9 and maintained their sensitivities after implementation of age-adjusted cut-offs. Specificities increased by 6–7% and number needed to test decreased by < 0.3. The rate of false positive results decreased by 6% overall and by 10–20% for patients ≥ 70. Conclusions Age-adjusted cut-offs resulted in maintained high sensitivity and a modest improvement in specificity and number needed to test for all evaluated D-dimer assays. There was a significant reduction in false positive results, which reflects avoidable unnecessary imaging without any compromise of clinical safety. This suggests a potential to benefit the management of VTE in elderly patients, both clinically and economically.

### Diagnostic accuracy and financial implications of age-adjusted D-dimer strategies for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in the emergency department [^c1475f3d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple D-dimer cutoffs have been suggested for older patients to improve diagnostic specificity for venous thromboembolism. These approaches are better established for pulmonary embolism.

Objectives

We evaluated the diagnostic performance and compared the health system cost for previously suggested cutoffs and a new D-dimer cutoff for low-risk emergency department (ED) deep venous thrombosis (DVT) patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in two large EDs involving patients aged > 50 years who had low pretest probability for DVT and had a D-dimer performed. The outcome was a diagnosis of DVT at 30 days. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and estimated the difference in cost for cutoffs of 500 ng/mL and the age-adjusted (age × 10) rule. A derived cutoff of 1000 ng/mL was also assessed.

Results

Nine hundred and seventy-two patients were included (median age 66 years; 59.5% female); 63 (6.5%) patients were diagnosed with DVT. The conventional cutoff of < 500 ng/mL demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI] 94.3–100%) and a specificity of 35.6% (95% CI 32.5–38.8%). The age-adjusted approach increased specificity while maintaining high sensitivity. A new cutoff of 1000 ng/mL demonstrated improved performance: sensitivity 100% (95% CI 94.3–00%) and specificity 66.3% (95% CI 63.2–69.4%). Compared to the conventional approach, both the 1000 ng/mL cutoff and the age-adjusted cutoffs could save healthcare dollars. A cutoff of 1000 ng/mL could have saved 310 ED length of stay hours and $166,909 (Canadian dollars) in our cohort, or an average savings of 0.32 h and $172 per patient.

Conclusions

Among patients aged > 50 years with suspected DVT, the age-adjusted D-dimer and a cutoff of 1000 ng/mL improved specificity without compromising sensitivity, and lowered the health care system cost compared to that for the conventional approach.

### Role of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level in the diagnosis algorithm of lower limb deep venous thrombosis in outpatients [^9f230d34]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to analyze the utility of the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff value in patients with clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in an ambulatory care setting, including distal DVTs.

Methods

This was an observational cohort study of 606 outpatients older than 18 years presenting with low or moderate clinical suspicion of lower limb DVT (measured by Wells scale). D-dimer levels were obtained, and duplex ultrasound was performed (including femoropopliteal and below-knee veins). We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive D-dimer values and when to apply the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff value (D-dimer threshold = age × 10 μg/L). We split patients older than 50 years into 10-year age groups. We constructed receiver operating characteristic curves of the D-dimer test for each group to find the best threshold (defined as the value of D-dimer that gives more specificity, maintaining the maximum possible sensitivity).

Results

There were 249 men and 357 women with a mean age of 69.3 years; 41 patients were diagnosed with DVT. At a D-dimer threshold of 250 μg/L, sensitivity was 93%, specificity was 8%, positive predictive value was 7%, and negative predictive value was 94%. When the age-adjusted cutoff level was applied, global sensitivity was 76% and specificity 61%; positive predictive value was 12%, and negative predictive value was 97%. False-negative rate was 24%. We split patients older than 50 years into 10-year age groups: 50 to 60 years, 60 to 70 years, 70 to 80 years, and > 80 years. The optimum thresholds were, respectively, 526 μg/L, 442.5 μg/L, 475 μg/L, and 549. μg/L.

Conclusions

In our series, the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level is not useful in the diagnostic algorithm of DVT.

### Performance of the age-adjusted cut-off for D-dimer in patients with cancer and suspected pulmonary embolism [^f74ef668]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cancer patients frequently present with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The D-dimer (DD) test is less useful in excluding PE in cancer patients due to the lower specificity. In the general population, the age-adjusted cutoff for DD combined with a clinical decision rule (CDR) improved specificity in the diagnosis of PE.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the age-adjusted cutoff (defined as age∗10μg/L in patients > 50years) combined with a CDR for the exclusion of PE in cancer patients.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the age-adjusted cutoff in patients with suspected PE. Here we report a post-hoc analysis on the performance of the age-adjusted cutoff in patients with and without cancer. The primary outcome was the rate of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) during three-month follow-up.

Results

Of 3324 patients with suspected PE, 429 (12.9%) patients had cancer. The prevalence of PE was 25.2% in cancer patients and 18% in patients without cancer (p < 0.001). Among cancer patients with an unlikely CDR, 9.9% had a DD < 500μg/L as compared with 19.7% using the age-adjusted cutoff. In patients without cancer, these rates were 30.1% and 41.9%. The proportion of cancer patients in whom PE could be excluded by CDR and DD doubled from 6.3% to 12.6%. No VTE occurred during three-month follow-up (failure rate 0.0% (95% CI 0.0–6.9%)).

Conclusion

Compared with the conventional cutoff, the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff doubles the proportion of patients with cancer in whom PE can be safely excluded by CDR and DD without imaging.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^d4d86b88]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Another limitation might be that we included studies both with populations suspected of having pulmonary embolism and with populations suspected of having deep vein thrombosis, and primary as well as secondary care patients, which might have introduced some extra between study variation. Furthermore, there was a variation in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the included cohorts, ranging from 5.1% to 39%. However, although previous studies revealed an association between the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing, our covariate analysis did not show such an association. Moreover, there was a fair similarity of study design and patient selection over the included cohorts; in all studies only patients with a non-high clinical probability were selected. Therefore we assumed that the conditions for pooling were met.

Finally, the reference standards used to diagnose or exclude venous thromboembolism differed between the included studies. In all but one studydifferential verification was of concern; in these studies venous thromboembolism was excluded without confirmation by imaging in patients with a negative D-dimer test result and without recurrence of symptoms during follow-up. Hence the false negative cases from using the conventional cut-off value were patients presenting with worsening or recurrence of their symptoms within 45 days or three months, leading to further examinations and the detection of venous thromboembolism. Although this is common practice, this could have introduced small overestimations of the diagnostic accuracy of the D-dimer test, as small thrombi may have been missed in these patients.

### Assessing 2 D-dimer age-adjustment strategies to optimize computed tomographic use in ED evaluation of pulmonary embolism [^619c0376]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Validate the sensitivity and specificity of 2 age adjustment strategies for d-dimer values in identifying patients at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) compared with traditional D-dimer cutoff value (500 ng/mL) to decrease inappropriate computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) use.

Methods

This institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study included all adult emergency department patients evaluated for PE over a 32-month period (1/1/11–8/30/13). Only patients undergoing CTPA and D-dimer testing were included. We used a validated natural language processing algorithm to parse CTPA radiology reports and determine the presence of acute PE. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of 2 age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs compared with the traditional cutoff. We used χ2 tests with proportional analyses to assess differences in traditional and age-adjusted (age×10 ng/mL) D-dimer cutoffs, adjusting both by decade and by year.

Results

A total 3063 patients with suspected PE were evaluated by CTPA during the study period, and 1055 (34%) also received d-dimer testing. The specificity of age-adjusted D-dimer values was similar or higher for each age group studied compared with traditional cutoff, without significantly compromising sensitivity. Overall, had decade age-adjusted cutoffs been used, 37 CTPAs could have been avoided (19.6% of 189 patients aged > 60 years with Wells score ≤ 4); had yearly age-adjusted cutoffs been used, 52 CTPAs (18.2% of 286 patients aged > 50 years with Wells score ≤ 4) could have been avoided.

Conclusion

Each age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff strategy for the evaluation of PE was associated with increased specificity and statistically insignificant decreased sensitivity when compared with the traditional D-dimer cutoff value.

### Using an age and fibrinogen levels adjusted D-dimer cutoff significantly improves the specificity of two equivalent D-dimer assays for excluding pulmonary embolism [^edd391b7]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Our single-center prospective study compared two methods of D-dimer determination used in the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: bioMérieux method, VIDAS® D-Dimer Exclusion™ II, and Diagnostica Stago method, STA®-Liatest® D-Di Plus. For each of these two methods, we calculated optimized variable cutoffs based on fibrinogen and/or age to improve the specificity of the methods.

Patients - Methods

2530 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the Brest University Hospital for suspected pulmonary embolism were included in this study. The comparison of the two methods was performed by calculating their different characteristics: sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value for different cutoffs systems: fixed or age-adjusted according to Douma et al. An optimization of the variable cutoff according to age and fibrinogen was then performed.

Results

The two methods VIDAS and STAGO are approximately equivalent in terms of performance even if the STAGO method presents a better specificity (57.1%) at the fixed cutoff of 0.5 μg/mL. The adoption of age-adjusted, fibrinogen-adjusted or doubly-adjusted (age and fibrinogen) cutoffs, significantly improves the specificity of the tests without affecting their excellent sensitivity. These specificities peak respectively at 75.8% and 76% for the VIDAS and STAGO tests when using a doubly-adjusted, age and fibrinogen, cutoff, i.e. a gain in specificity of approximately 10% compared with the age-adjusted cutoff of Douma et al. and of approximately 20% compared with the fixed cutoff of 0.5 μg/mL.

Conclusion

Adopting an optimized variable cutoff based on fibrinogen and/or age significantly improves specificity of D-dimer methods for pulmonary embolism exclusion.

### Patient-level meta-analysis: effect of measurement timing, threshold, and patient age on ability of D-dimer testing to assess recurrence risk after unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^d50ee1b7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), an elevated d-dimer level after anticoagulation is stopped is a risk factor for recurrent VTE. However, questions remain about the utility of measuring d-dimer in clinical practice.

Purpose

To determine whether the timing of testing, patient age, and the cut point used to define a positive or negative result affect the ability of d-dimer testing to distinguish risk for recurrent disease.

Data Sources

Comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) until July 2010, supplemented by reviewing conference abstracts and contacting content experts.

Study Selection

7 prospective studies that investigated an association between d-dimer, measured after stopping anticoagulation, and disease recurrence in patients with a first unprovoked VTE (proximal deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both).

Data Extraction

Patient-level databases were obtained, transferred to a central database, checked, completed with further information provided by study investigators, and pooled into a single database.

Data Synthesis

1818 patients with a first unprovoked VTE were followed for a mean of 26.9 months (SD, 19.1). A study-stratified multivariate Cox regression model, which included patient age, sex, hormone therapy use at the time of the index event, body mass index, timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing, and inherited thrombophilia as possible confounders, indicated that the hazard ratio for d-dimer status (positive vs. negative) was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.90 to 3.52). Only male sex had a significant effect on risk for recurrent VTE independent of d-dimer status. The Cox regression model and the log-rank test confirmed that the risk for recurrent VTE was higher in patients with a positive d-dimer result than in those with a negative result, regardless of the timing of postanticoagulation d-dimer testing or patient age. No study- or assay-specific d-dimer effect was found, and reassessing the analysis after recoding data according to specific quantitative d-dimer cut points (500 µg/L and 250 µg/L) did not change the results.

Limitations

Unmeasured variables could have affected the risk for recurrent VTE. The study population was predominantly white.

Conclusion

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have their d-dimer level measured after stopping anticoagulation, the timing of d-dimer testing, patient age, and the assay cut point used do not affect the ability of d-dimer to distinguish patients with a higher or lower risk for recurrent VTE.

### Wells rule and D-dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and individual-patient data meta-analysis [^a9a52ba1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The performance of different diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism (PE) in patient subgroups is unclear.

Purpose

To evaluate and compare the efficiency and safety of the Wells rule with fixed or age-adjusted d-dimer testing overall and in inpatients and persons with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous venous thromboembolism, delayed presentation, and age 75 years or older.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1 January 1988 to 13 February 2016.

Study Selection

6 prospective studies in which the diagnostic management of PE was guided by the dichotomized Wells rule and quantitative d-dimer testing.

Data Extraction

Individual data of 7268 patients; risk of bias assessed by 2 investigators with the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2) tool.

Data Synthesis

The proportion of patients in whom imaging could be withheld based on a "PE-unlikely" Wells score and a negative d-dimer test result (efficiency) was estimated using fixed (≤ 500 µg/L) and age-adjusted (age × 10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) d-dimer thresholds; their 3-month incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (failure rate) was also estimated. Overall, efficiency increased from 28% to 33% when the age-adjusted (instead of the fixed) d-dimer threshold was applied. This increase was more prominent in elderly patients (12%) but less so in inpatients (2.6%). The failure rate of age-adjusted d-dimer testing was less than 3% in all examined subgroups.

Limitation

Post hoc analysis, between-study differences in patient characteristics, use of various d-dimer assays, and limited statistical power to assess failure rate.

Conclusion

Age-adjusted d-dimer testing is associated with a 5% absolute increase in the proportion of patients with suspected PE in whom imaging can be safely withheld compared with fixed d-dimer testing. This strategy seems safe across different high-risk subgroups, but its efficiency varies.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism-clinical practice guideline… [^4ee4740e]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The guideline on Diagnosis of Venous Thromboembolism was developed by the American Society of Hematology and was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Pulmonary Embolism For individuals with a low or intermediate pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out PE followed by VQ scan or CTPA in patients requiring additional testing. D-dimer testing alone should. not be used to rule in a PE. For individuals with a high pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should start with CTPA to diagnose PE. If CTPA is not available, a VQ scan be used with appropriate follow up testing. D-dimer testing alone should not be used to diagnose PE and should not be used as a subsequent test after CT scan in individuals with a high pretest probability/prevalence. For individuals who have a positive D-dimer or likely pretest probability, a CTPA should be performed.

D-dimer testing can be used to exclude recurrent PE in individuals with unlikely pretest probability. Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in outpatients older than 50 years is safe and improves diagnostic yield. Age-adjusted cutoff = Age x 10 µg/L. Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis For individuals with a low pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound in patients requiring additional testing. For individuals with low pretest probability or prevalence, positive D-dimer alone should. Upper Extremity DVT For individuals with low prevalence/unlikely pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be used to exclude upper extremity DVT, followed by duplex ultrasound if positive.

For individuals with high prevalence/likely pretest probability, either D-dimer testing followed by duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound, or duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound alone can be used for assessing patients suspected of having upper extremity DVT. A positive D-dimer alone should not be used to diagnose upper extremity DVT. See the full recommendation for more information.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^60a58e0b]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Several scores have been developed in order to assess the clinical probability of VTE. The most used are the Wells and Geneva scores. In addition, a simplified and validated version of the Geneva score has been developed to widen its adoption in clinical practice. The combination of negative D-dimer ELISA and low-intermediate pre-test clinical probability excludes DVT or pulmonary embolism in approximately 30% of the cases with suspected VTE with no need for imaging (i.e. venous ultrasonography for a suspected DVT and computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiogram for a suspected pulmonary embolism). Conversely, D-dimer is not recommended in patients with a high clinical probability, because a normal result does not exclude VTE, even when a highly sensitive assay is used; these cases should directly undergo imaging without D-dimer testing (Figure 2). Notably, as D-dimer levels increase with age, an age-adjusted (age x 10 µg/L in patients aged > 50 years) rather than a fixed cutoff (< 500 µg/L) is warranted to exclude VTE in patients with low or intermediate pre-test clinical probability. Although impaired renal function has been suggested to affect D-dimer levels in individuals suspected of having VTE, its influence seems to be less important than that of age.

D-dimer testing in combination with a clinical pre-test probability assessment (YEARS criteria or revised GENEVA score) has also been used for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women with the aim of avoiding unnecessary imaging. In addition, D-dimer testing provides important information not only for the diagnosis of VTE, but also for the anticoagulant management of VTE. Current evidence indicates that a positive D-dimer after completion of three months of anticoagulant therapy in patients with a first unprovoked VTE is associated with a 2-fold higher risk of VTE recurrence than a negative test. Thus, following the demonstration of the strong association between D-dimer and VTE recurrence, D-dimer testing is often included in the prediction models designed to guide decisions for stopping anticoagulant therapy. On the other hand, persistently high D-dimer after stopping a 3-month anticoagulant treatment argues in favor of therapy prolongation in cases with unprovoked VTE.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^637363e7]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Remarks — Clinical decision rules and test selection in low PTP note that for patients presenting to an emergency department with a low probability of PE, PERC may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is warranted, and that if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used, this recommendation corresponds to the "unlikely PE" category. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results with standard thresholds. Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in outpatients older than 50 years is as safe as the standard cutoff and increases diagnostic utility; the age-adjusted cutoff = age (years) × 10 μg/L (using D-dimer assays with a cutoff of 500 μg/L). VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure for patients likely to have a diagnostic scan.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^1274eedd]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Age-adjusted D-dimer — diagnostic accuracy and miss rates in suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in emergency department (ED) patients are summarized across meta-analytic and cohort data: a meta-analysis of 6 prospective studies including 7,268 patients with a 22% overall prevalence of PE reported that among "PE unlikely" patients with a negative conventional D-dimer, symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) during a 3-month follow-up was 0.7% with no fatal events; with the age-adjusted cutoff the miss rate was 0.9% with 1 fatal event and the sensitivity of both cutoffs was 99%. In a Spanish ED cohort of 362 patients (27% PE prevalence), among 331 non–high-risk patients there were 0 missed PEs with either cutoff, yielding 100% sensitivity for both. Retrospective cohorts showed miss rates of 0.3% and 0.6% for age-adjusted versus 0.0% and 0.2% for conventional cutoffs, and in non–high-risk patients age-adjusted miss rates ranged from 2.2% to 2.5% compared with 1.7% to 1.8% for conventional. In a U.S. ED cohort with low PE prevalence, miss rates were 0.1% (conventional), 0.2% (age-adjusted), and 0.3% using a 1,000 µg/L threshold. Another U.S. ED cohort (PE prevalence 7%) reported sensitivities of 97.4% (yearly) and 98.7% (decadal) for age-adjusted strategies versus 100% for conventional. In a higher-risk Italian ED cohort (PE prevalence 23%), sensitivity was 98% with the yearly age-adjusted formula and 96% with a cutoff of 1,000 µg/L, compared with 100% for conventional D-dimer.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^de0be47b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### Effect of a diagnostic strategy using an elevated and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold on VTEs in suspected PE… [^9b69c178]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

ED indicates emergency department. aOne of the patients who withdrew consent was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism on day 0 and, therefore, did not meet the primary end point. Question Among emergency department patients with suspicion of pulmonary embolism not ruled out by the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria rule, does use of a diagnostic strategy that combines the YEARS rule and age-adjusted D-dimer threshold safely exclude the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. Meaning Among emergency department patients with suspected PE who were PERC positive, the use of the YEARS rule combined with the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold did not lead to an inferior rate of thromboembolic events compared with a conventional diagnostic strategy. Importance Uncontrolled studies suggest that pulmonary embolism can be safely ruled out using the YEARS rule, a diagnostic strategy that uses varying D-dimer thresholds.

Conclusions and Relevance Among ED patients with suspected PE, the use of the YEARS rule combined with the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in PERC-positive patients, compared with a conventional diagnostic strategy, did not result in an inferior rate of thromboembolic events.

The objective of this cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial was to determine whether in emergency department patients with suspicion of PE that was not excluded by the PERC rule, a strategy that combines the YEARS rule and the age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff can safely rule out the diagnosis. Whether this strategy decreased the use of chest imaging was also determined.

Quiz Ref IDIn this multicenter, cluster-randomized, crossover trial of PERC-positive ED patients with suspicion of a PE, a strategy consisting of a combination of the YEARS rule with an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff resulted in a noninferior proportion of VTEs at 3 months compared with a conventional strategy. The intervention was associated with a statistically significant reduction in chest imaging use. The YEARS rule has been prospectively validated but not assessed in a randomized trial, nor used in combination with the PERC rule and an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff. 7 In this trial, using PERC, YEARS, and an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff was associated with lower use of chest imaging compared with a conventional strategy, with the absolute difference between the 2 groups being 10%.

### The impact of using different age-adjusted cutoffs of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism [^e4bd0896]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship of age-adjusted D-dimer value with different coefficients in diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in geriatric patients. Methods The emergency admissions of the patients aged 65 and over with suspected PE during 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic characteristics, laboratory tests and radiologic findings of computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) or single photon emission computed tomography ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy (V/Q) were recorded. The characteristics of the patients with PE were statistically compared with the patients without PE. The specificity and sensitivity for higher cut-off levels (age × 10–15) were presented. Results PE was detected in 39.2% (n = 246) of 628 patients aged 65 years and older included in the study. The multivariate analysis revealed that higher D-dimer level (OR = 1,00011; p < 0.001) and BUN level (OR = 1.025; p = 0.013) were independent risk factors for PE diagnosis in elderly patients. Diagnostic statistics for D-dimer cut-off levels selected from ROC analysis and calculated values as 10–15 times of age showed that if the D-dimer cut-off value used is chosen higher, lower sensitivity rates are obtained. Our results also indicated that the patients with malignancy, renal failure, central PE on CTPA and PE with high probability on SPECT VQ were presented with higher D-dimer values. Conclusion Our results do not support the use of higher D-dimer cut-off levels such as 15 times the age in geriatric population. The impact of the location of PE and comorbidities on the outcomes of these patients must be clarified for determining cut-offs with higher specificity.

### Potential of an age adjusted D-dimer cut-off value to improve the exclusion of pulmonary embolism in older patients: a retrospective analysis of three large cohorts [^69a0682c]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

In older patients, the the D-dimer test for pulmonary embolism has reduced specificity and is therefore less useful. In this study a new, age dependent cut-off value for the test was devised and its usefulness with older patients assessed.

Design

Retrospective multicentre cohort study.

Setting

General and teaching hospitals in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Patients 5132 consecutive patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism.

Intervention

Development of a new D-dimer cut-off point in patients aged > 50 years in a derivation set (data from two multicentre cohort studies), based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. This cut-off value was then validated with two independent validation datasets.

Main Outcome Measures

The proportion of patients in the validation cohorts with a negative D-dimer test, the proportion in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded, and the false negative rates.

Results

The new D-dimer cut-off value was defined as (patient's agex10) microg/l in patients aged > 50. In 1331 patients in the derivation set with an "unlikely" score from clinical probability assessment, pulmonary embolism could be excluded in 42% with the new cut-off value versus 36% with the old cut-off value (< 500 microg/l). In the two validation sets, the increase in the proportion of patients with a D-dimer below the new cut-off value compared with the old value was 5% and 6%. This absolute increase was largest among patients aged > 70 years, ranging from 13% to 16% in the three datasets. The failure rates (all ages) were 0.2% (95% CI 0% to 1.0%) in the derivation set and 0.6% (0.3% to 1.3%) and 0.3% (0.1% to 1.1%) in the two validation sets.

Conclusions

The age adjusted D-dimer cut-off point, combined with clinical probability, greatly increased the proportion of older patients in whom pulmonary embolism could be safely excluded.

### A tale of two D-dimers: comparison of two assay methods to evaluate deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [^c91c60b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

D-dimer testing rules out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in low-risk emergency department (ED) patients. Most research has measured fibrin-equivalent units (FEUs), however, many laboratories measure D-dimer units (DDUs).

Objective

Our aim was to determine whether either DDU measurements or FEU measurements can rule out DVT/PE using traditional or age-related cutoff values.

Methods

We performed a de-identified multicenter retrospective evaluation of D-dimer in nonpregnant adult ED patients to evaluate for DVT/PE. DDUs were multiplied by 2 to determine equivalent FEUs prior to analysis. Sensitivity measurements for D-dimer were calculated for FEUs, DDUs, combined FEU/DDUs, and multiple age-adjusted values.

Results

We identified 47,088 ED patients with a D-dimer laboratory value (27,307 FEUs/19,781 DDUs) and 1623 DVT/PEs. The median combined FEU/DDU D-dimer was 400 ng/mL FEUs (interquartile range [IQR] 300–900 ng/mL FEUs) for patients without a DVT/PE vs 2530 ng/mL FEU (IQR 1094–6000 ng/mL FEUs) with a DVT/PE (p < 0.001), overall sensitivity of 87.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 87.0–87.6%) and negative predictive value of 99.3% (95% CI 99.2–99.4%). Individually, FEUs performed better than DDUs, with sensitivities of 88.0% (95% CI 85.8–89.9%) and 86.1% (95% CI 83.1–88.7%), respectively; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Combined age-adjusted performance had a sensitivity of 90.3% (95% CI 88.3–92.0%); however, a new DDU-only age-adjusted criteria had the highest sensitivity of 91.1% (95% CI 87.9–93.6%).

Conclusions

Our undifferentiated D-dimer measurements had a slightly lower sensitivity to rule out DVT/PE than reported previously. Our data support using either DDU or FEU measurements for all ages or when using various age-adjusted criteria to rule out DVT/PE.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5e0cf46]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Covariates

The forest plot in supplementary appendix 4 depicts the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing stratified by cohort, age group, and D-dimer cut-off level. We analysed the effect of covariates (the venous thromboembolism prevalence in each total cohort, applied D-dimer assays, and whether the patients were initially suspected of having pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) on the D-dimer sensitivity and specificity (table 3). We found no association between the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing and the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the study populations or whether patients were suspected of having either pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.

Table 3
Overall and covariate analysis for D-dimer testing stratified by use of conventional and age adjusted cut-off levels in patients with a non-high clinical probability of venous thromboembolism (all age categories except < 50 years)

ELFA = enzyme linked fluorescent assay; NA = not applicable.

*Covariate analysis for setting was not possible as only one study was performed in primary care.

†This stratum contains studies wherein quantitative latex agglutination assays were used, or latex agglutination assays indifferently with ELFA assays.

D-dimer testing revealed a higher sensitivity and a trend towards lower specificity in the three cohorts in which only enzyme linked fluorescent assays were applied, compared with the cohorts in which quantitative latex assays were also used. Besides, the enzyme linked fluorescent assays showed less decrease in sensitivity by application of the age adjusted cut-off value instead of the conventional cut-off.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and Management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute venous thromboembolic disease [^f6db05a4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Assays using D-dimer units (DDU) and fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU) with alternate cutoffs show feasibility of age-adjusted strategies. A Class III study using the HemosIL-HS assay reported a manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 230 ng/mL and noted that numeric values are convertible (1 FEU = 2×DDU). The study compared a standard cutoff of 250 ng/mL with an age-adjusted formula of age×5 ng/mL for patients older than 50 years, included patients with high pretest probability for DVT and PE, and found specificity improved from 68% to 78% with no additional missed PEs.

### An age-adapted approach for the use of D-dimers in the exclusion of deep venous thrombosis [^5ec50776]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

A normal D-dimer (DD) concentration for the exclusion of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has a low specificity in older patients and compression ultrasonography is often required. Three D-dimer assays, STA Liatest, Tina-quant, and Innovance, are evaluated in symptomatic outpatients suspected for DVT with emphasis on its performance in older patients by using different cut-off levels. This study includes 466 outpatients suspected for having DVT. The diagnostic accuracy, measured as sensitivity and area under the curve of the receiver operation characteristic curve is good for all DD assays. The specificity of the DD assays combined with a low pretest probability varies from 42.6 to 51.5%. The specificity of the three DD assays in patients ≥ 60 years varies, however, between 24.6 and 40.9%. Several cut-off values in different age-subgroups are studied. For patients < 60 years, the most accurate cut-off value is 500 microg/L for all DD assays. For patients ≥ 60 years, a threshold of 750 microg/L has the best results with NPV of 100% for all assays and specificity of 48.5% (STA Liatest), 60.6% (Tina-quant), and 49.2% (Innovance), respectively. For the three assays, the number needed to test (NNT) decreases in both subgroups of patients compared to the standard algorithm. A cut-off level of 750 microg/L for patients ≥ 60 years improves the clinical performance of DD assays in combination with the PTP score without the loss of NPV. The NNT improves substantially with an age-adapted algorithm.

### Using age-adjusted D-dimer vs traditional D-dimer to rule out acute aortic syndromes [^319d05f0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute aortic syndromes (AS), including aortic dissection, ulceration, and intramural hematoma, are rare and life-threatening diagnoses. Early diagnosis is critical as mortality increases by 1–2% per hour after symptom onset. D-dimer (DD) < 500 ng/dL, with or without utilization of Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS), is a proposed method to rule-out AS in low-risk patients but is not specific. Age-adjusted D-dimer (AADD) has been validated for pulmonary embolism, but has not been studied extensively in AS.

Objective

In this study, we investigate the utility of AADD to DD when used to rule-out AS, with and without ADD-RS.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of patients presenting the emergency department (ED) from 2012 to 2021 who received a DD and underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) for Dissection, Coronary Study, or Triple Rule-Out. Sensitivity and specificity for AS was calculated for both DD < 500 ng/dL and AADD. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, had prior thoracic aortic dissection or repair, presented altered, or younger than 18 years-old.

Results

In total, 5818 unique cases met inclusion criteria. In the DD < 500 ng/dL group sensitivity was 0.979 (0.939–1.000) with a specificity of 0.727 (0.716–0.739). In the AADD group, sensitivity was 0.938 (0.869–1.000, p = 0.16) with a specificity of 0.781 (0.770–0.792, p < 0.05).

S Conclusions

AADD appears to have comparable sensitivity, although with a diminished confidence interval, to DD when ruling out AS. Utilization of ADD-RS may help determine which patients are appropriate for screening. Future steps would include a prospective trial on patients presenting to the ED.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^a09ac913]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism — diagnostic test performance and thresholds: CT angiography has a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 95% to 100% in patients with low or intermediate pretest probability and a sensitivity of 85% to 95% in patients with high pretest probability. The sensitivity of V/Q scan for PE is 50% to 98%, and specificity is 20% to 60%. Pulmonary angiography is an invasive test that should only be reserved in patients where the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT angiography or V/Q scan. Age-adjusted (age × 10 ng/mL) d-dimer cutoffs can be used to exclude PE in non–high clinical probability patients who are > 50 years of age, with a sensitivity of > 97% and higher specificities than the conventional cutoff of 500 ng/mL.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^b8e31177]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

### Age-versus clinical pretest probability-adjusted D-dimer to rule out lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis in ambulatory patients with active cancer [^cb589db3]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT), D-dimer thresholds adjusted to age or clinical pretest probability (CPTP) increase the proportion of patients in whom DVT can be safely excluded compared to a standard approach using a fixed D-dimer threshold. Performance of these diagnostic strategies among cancer patients is uncertain.

Aim

To compare the performance of age- and CPTP-adjusted D-dimer approaches among cancer outpatients with clinically suspected DVT, and derive a cancer-specific CPTP rule.

Patients and Methods

Consecutive ambulatory patients with active cancer and clinically suspected DVT of the lower extremity underwent CPTP assessment using the Wells rule, D-dimer testing, and whole-leg compression ultrasonography. Patients with normal ultrasonography were followed-up for 3 months for the occurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism.

Results

Upon referral, DVT was diagnosed in 48 of 239 (20.1%) patients. The age-adjusted approach showed higher specificity and efficiency than the standard approach. Compared to the standard and age-adjusted strategies, the CPTP-adjusted approach had 35% and 21% higher specificity, and 34% and 21% higher efficiency, respectively. Failure rate, sensitivity, and predictive values were similar across strategies. A simplified CPTP score derived from the Wells rule reduced unnecessary imaging with similar accuracy and efficiency, but higher failure rate.

Conclusions

In this prospective cohort of ambulatory cancer patients with clinically suspected DVT, the CPTP-adjusted D-dimer approach held the highest specificity and efficiency, potentially safely reducing unnecessary ultrasonography examinations compared to other approaches. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the use of a simplified clinical prediction rule in this setting.

### PO-07-excluding pulmonary embolism in cancer patients using the wells rule and age-adjusted D-dimer testing: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^0ba47a64]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Among patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), imaging and anticoagulant treatment can be safely withheld in approximately one-third of patients based on the combination of a "PE unlikely" Wells score and a D-dimer below the age-adjusted threshold. The clinical utility of this diagnostic approach in cancer patients is less clear.

Aim

To evaluate the efficiency and failure rate of the original and simplified Wells rules in combination with age-adjusted D-dimer testing in patients with active cancer.

Materials and Methods

Individual patient data were used from 6 large prospective studies in which the diagnostic management of PE was guided by the original Wells rule and D-dimer testing. Study physicians classified patients as having active cancer if they had new, recurrent, or progressive cancer (excluding basal-cell or squamous-cell skin carcinoma), or cancer requiring treatment in the last 6 months. We evaluated the dichotomous Wells rule and its simplified version (Table). The efficiency of the algorithm was defined as the proportion of patients with a "PE unlikely" Wells score and a negative age-adjusted D-dimer, defined by a D-dimer below the threshold of a patient's age times 10 μg/L in patients aged ≥ 51 years. A diagnostic failure was defined as a patient with a "PE unlikely" Wells score and negative age-adjusted D-dimer who had symptomatic venous thromboembolism during 3 months follow-up. A one-stage random effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the efficiency and failure.

Results

The dataset comprised 938 patients with active cancer with a mean age of 63 years. The most frequent cancer types were breast (13%), gastrointestinal tract (11%), and lung (8%). The type of cancer was not specified in 42%. The pooled PE prevalence was 29% (95% CI 25–32). PE could be excluded in 122 patients based on a "PE unlikely" Wells score and a negative age-adjusted D-dimer (efficiency 13%; 95% CI 11–15). Two of 122 patients were diagnosed with non-fatal symptomatic venous thromboembolism during follow-up (failure rate 1.5%; 95% CI 0.13–14.8). The simplified Wells score in combination with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer had an efficiency of 3.9% (95% CI 2.0–7.6) and a failure rate of 2.4% (95% CI 0.3–15).

Conclusions

Among cancer patients with clinically suspected PE, imaging and anticoagulant treatment can be withheld in 1 out of every 8 patients by the original Wells rule and age-adjusted D-dimer testing. The simplified Wells rule was neither efficient nor safe in this population.

### Development and validation of a simplified probability assessment score integrated with age-adjusted D-dimer for diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes [^5575e5dc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

‐dimer (DD), a plasma fibrin degradation product, is widely used as a rule‐out biomarker of PE. DD levels almost invariably increase in AASs. Using a cutoff of 500 ng/mL (DD 500), DD has a sensitivity of 95% to 98% and low to moderate specificity for AASs. 11 Accordingly, low probability plus a negative DD can be used to safely avoid CTA in 15% to 50% of patients. 12 As the specificity of DD diminishes with aging, an age‐adjusted DD cutoff (DD age‐adj) is suggested for PE rule‐out as an alternative to DD 500, providing similar sensitivity but higher specificity. 13 Use of a single DD cutoff optimizing specificity to rule out both PEs and AASs may be practical and efficient. However, only few studies have evaluated DD age‐adj for AASs so far. 12, 14, 15

Herein, we developed a simplified clinical probability assessment tool amenable to dichotomic rule‐out of AASs in combination with DD age‐adj. External validation was pursued in 2 independent patient cohorts, by comparison with current standard (ADD score and DD 500).

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^90e3f1f1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC performance and D-dimer cutoffs: The PERC are not a screening tool for all patients and should be applied only to very low–risk patients in whom PE is genuinely suspected, and when used in this manner the PERC should decrease the use of d-dimer testing only in patients who would have otherwise been tested. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found the overall proportion of missed PEs by using PERC was 0.3% (46 of 14 844 total cases), the pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), and the pooled specificity was 22%, indicating that 22% of d-dimer tests could have been safely avoided had the PERC been universally applied. To date, most recommendations have considered any value above 499 ng/mL as elevated, and a meta-analysis of 13 studies and 12 497 patients without high pretest probability found that using age-adjusted D-dimer cutoffs for patients older than 50 years (age × 10 ng/mL) maintained a sensitivity for PE above 97% while significantly increasing specificity.

### PO-29-age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level increases the number of cancer patients in who pulmonary embolism can be safely excluded without CT-PA imaging: the ADJUST-PE cancer substudy [^6699d756]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with cancer frequently present with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The D-dimer test is less useful to rule out PE in cancer patients due to a lower specificity, whereas the safety of the combination of a clinical decision rule (CDR) and D-dimer test to rule out PE in these patients is unclear. In the general population, use of an age-adjusted cutoff for D-dimer in combination with a CDR has been shown to improve specificity in the diagnosis of PE.

Aim

We prospectively analysed the safety and efficacy of the age-adjusted D-dimer (defined as age×10 in patients > 50 years) combined with CDR for the exclusion of PE in patients with cancer.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a multicenter multinational prospective management outcome study in 19 centers in Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Switzerland, the ADJUST-PE study, to validate an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off in patients with suspected PE. The performance of the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off and CDR was compared between patients with and without cancer. The primary outcome was the rate of adjudicated thromboembolic events during three-month follow-up.

Results

Of the 3,324 patients with suspected PE, 429 (12.9%) patients had cancer. Cancer patients were older and more often had surgery or immobilisation. The prevalence of PE was 108/429 (25.2%) in cancer patients and 522/2894 (18%) in patients without cancer, p < 0.001. Among cancer patients with an unlikely CDR, 27/274 (9.9%) had a D-Dimer < 500 μg/L as compared with 19.7% using the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off; in patients without cancer, these rates were 30.1% and 41.9%, respectively. The percentage of cancer patients in whom PE could be excluded based on CDR and age-adjusted D-dimer doubled from 6.3% to 12.6%. None of these cancer patients had a venous thromboembolic event during three-month follow-up, thus the failure rate was 0.0% (95% CI 0.0–6.9%).

Conclusions

Compared with the usual cut-off, the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off doubles the proportion of patients with cancer in whom PE can be safely excluded by CDR and D-dimer without need for CTPA imaging.

### Effect of using an age-adjusted D-dimer to assess for pulmonary embolism in community emergency departments [^95868bed]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of changing the laboratory-reported D-dimer reference intervals to age-adjusted reference intervals on the use of advanced chest imaging and 30-day adverse events among emergency department (ED) encounters.

Methods

A retrospective interrupted time-series analysis of ED encounters for patients > 50 years evaluated for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) from April 2014 to April 2016. The primary outcome was use of advanced diagnostic imaging, and the secondary outcome was 30-day mortality or PE diagnosis. Secondary analyses also quantified delayed PE diagnoses pre- and postintervention. A generalized estimating equation segmented logistic regression model, adjusting for patient and facility characteristics, was used to determine changes in odds of diagnostic imaging and 30-day mortality or PE diagnoses.

Results

A total of 10,534 (5,153 pre- and 5,381 postimplementation) ED encounters were included. Advanced imaging was obtained in 35.9% of pre- versus 33% of postimplementation encounters. Age-adjusted D-dimer (AADD) showed a small and nonsignificant decrease in month-to-month trends of advanced chest imaging postimplementation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96 to 1.00). Use of advanced imaging in patients with D-dimer values lower than 500 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units (FEU) was similar in the preintervention (5.8%) and postintervention (6.8%) periods. However, imaging was obtained in 30% of patients postintervention with a D-dimer result less than AADD reference interval, but more than the historical 500 ng/mL FEU reference interval. Implementing an AADD threshold demonstrated no change in the rate of 30-day adverse events (missed PE or mortality).

Conclusion

Changing the laboratory-reported D-dimer reference intervals for evaluation of PE was not associated with reduction in advanced chest imaging and did not increase 30-day adverse events. However, there was substantial noncompliance with the age-adjusted reference intervals in the postintervention period likely blunting the impact of this intervention.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^c908c51d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians best practice advice — evaluation of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE): Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered. Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should use age adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted. Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff. Clinicians should obtain imaging with CTPA in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve V/Q scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.
