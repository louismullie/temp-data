## Question

Amoxicillin dose for cap

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about amoxicillin dosing for community-acquired pneumonia, including recommendations for adults and children, duration of therapy, adjustments based on severity, and stewardship considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how CAP differs by age, setting, and severity. Then, I should verify adult outpatient dosing and duration, followed by adult inpatient strategies. Next, I will examine pediatric outpatient dosing and duration, including high- versus low-dose debates. After that, I should review pediatric inpatient and special populations, and finally synthesize stewardship-aligned principles and a concise clinical recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because dosing hinges on age, care setting, and severity. CAP in adults is typically stratified by comorbidities and severity, with outpatient versus inpatient management guiding empiric therapy, whereas in children CAP is often categorized as non-severe versus severe, with outpatient care favored when stable and inpatient care for hypoxia, dehydration, or toxicity. I need to ensure I anchor dosing to these categories to avoid overgeneralization [^116R7qqa] [^115h6tNF].

> Now, for adult outpatients without comorbidities, I should confirm the first-line amoxicillin regimen. The ATS/IDSA guideline recommends amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily as a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, with doxycycline or a macrolide as alternatives when appropriate, noting macrolide monotherapy should be reserved for settings with low pneumococcal macrolide resistance. Wait, let me verify the duration before I commit to a number; the same guideline advises a minimum of 5 days, with therapy continued until clinical stability is achieved, which typically occurs within 48–72 hours, so most patients complete 5 days total. I should double-check that this aligns with the FDA label, which also supports 1 g TID for at least 5 days and until clinical stability, confirming consistency across sources [^116R7qqa] [^11422hz5].

> Hold on, I should verify macrolide caveats because resistance matters. The guideline cautions against routine macrolide monotherapy where pneumococcal macrolide resistance exceeds about 25–30%, so macrolide use should be localized to low-resistance settings or paired with a beta-lactam when comorbidities are present. This reinforces amoxicillin as a preferred narrow-spectrum option in uncomplicated adult CAP when local resistance patterns permit [^116R7qqa] [^115Q2y7p].

> Next, I will examine adult outpatients with comorbidities, because the regimen changes. For adults with chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia, the guideline recommends combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Let me think about the beta-lactam choices: amoxicillin/clavulanate is commonly used, with cefpodoxime or cefuroxime as alternatives, paired with azithromycin, clarithromycin, or doxycycline. I should confirm that this broader coverage is justified by the expanded pathogen risk in comorbid patients, which the guideline explicitly notes [^117JT7za] [^111GyoZg].

> I will now review adult inpatient therapy, starting with non-severe CAP. The ATS/IDSA guideline recommends either a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, with a beta-lactam plus doxycycline as an option when macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated. Wait, I initially thought beta-lactam monotherapy might be acceptable in non-severe inpatients, but I should correct that; the panel advises against routine beta-lactam monotherapy for inpatients, favoring combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy to ensure adequate atypical coverage and mitigate failure risk [^117DLH1Y] [^116LD2BE].

> For severe CAP in adults, I need to ensure I get the combination right. The guideline strongly recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and it advises against fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline in this severe setting. Let me reconsider the rationale: macrolide-containing regimens have observational mortality benefits in severe disease, likely reflecting immunomodulatory effects, which supports the combination approach despite concerns about macrolide adverse effects [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE].

> Turning to children, I should confirm first-line outpatient therapy. For previously healthy, appropriately immunized children with suspected bacterial CAP, amoxicillin is recommended as first-line therapy by IDSA/PIDS and AAFP, with dosing commonly in the 40–90 mg/kg/day range divided twice daily and a typical maximum of 4 g/day. But wait, let me verify the dose debate; the CAP-IT randomized trial demonstrated that lower-dose amoxicillin, 35–50 mg/kg/day, was noninferior to higher-dose, 70–90 mg/kg/day, for clinical failure requiring retreatment, supporting the use of lower-dose regimens in many settings, particularly where pneumococcal resistance is low. I should also note that BTS guidance supports amoxicillin as first-line oral therapy across pediatric ages, aligning with this approach [^115h6tNF] [^114DFwpz] [^115fvY6X] [^116nrWc4].

> Next, I should review pediatric duration, because stewardship strongly favors shorter courses. The CAP-IT trial showed that 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for retreatment, and the SAFER trial found 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin comparable to 10 days for clinical cure. Let me double-check the nuance: while 3 days is noninferior overall, some clinicians prefer 5 days for chest-indrawing or more severe presentations, and a small study suggested 3 days might underperform in radiographically confirmed alveolar pneumonia, prompting a shift to 5 days in that arm. Thus, 3–5 days is reasonable for non-severe pediatric CAP, with 5 days often favored for chest-indrawing disease or when adherence is uncertain [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt] [^116KCNsK] [^1155v2xQ].

> For pediatric inpatient care, I need to check severity-based pathways. In severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, IV ampicillin or penicillin G is standard, with ceftriaxone as an alternative when parenteral therapy is indicated. Hold on, I should verify whether high-dose oral amoxicillin can substitute for parenteral therapy in select cases; a large equivalency trial in Pakistan showed high-dose oral amoxicillin was equivalent to inpatient parenteral ampicillin for severe pneumonia without complications, supporting ambulatory oral therapy when reliable follow-up is assured. For very severe disease, WHO-informed regimens often use penicillin or ampicillin plus gentamicin, with local adaptation based on resistance and resources [^115h6tNF] [^11167Rep] [^112AyywP].

> Special populations require tailored dosing, so I should confirm HIV and other immunocompromised scenarios. For HIV-exposed or infected children with mild-to-moderate CAP and stable immune status, oral amoxicillin can be used following pediatric dosing principles, with higher-dose amoxicillin or ampicillin for severe disease and consideration of macrolide addition for atypical coverage in hospitalized patients. I need to ensure I align with pediatric HIV OI guidance that supports amoxicillin 45–90 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with adjustments for severity and local resistance patterns [^111PRidh] [^114FoWbA].

> Let me synthesize stewardship principles that cut across ages. Shorter effective courses reduce resistance selection and adverse events without compromising outcomes, and narrower-spectrum agents like amoxicillin should be preferred when clinically appropriate. I should double-check that real-world data show excessive durations persist; indeed, pediatric studies document that durations beyond 5–7 days drive much of the "effective but unnecessary" category, reinforcing targets of 3–5 days in children and 5 days in most adults once clinically stable. Trials in adults also support stopping after 3 days if stability is achieved, further underscoring the safety of shorter courses when patients improve promptly [^113mKYmj] [^113yRnEL] [^112XfVPf] [^11422hz5].

> But wait, what about macrolides and atypicals in children. I should confirm that routine macrolide use is not recommended for all pediatric CAP; macrolides are reserved for suspected or confirmed atypical pathogens, more common in older children, or when there is clinical suspicion after failure of appropriate beta-lactam therapy. This avoids unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure and aligns with pediatric CAP stewardship principles [^115h6tNF] [^114DFwpz].

> Final clinical recommendations, after verifying the above: for adults without comorbidities, amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily for a minimum of 5 days and until clinical stability is achieved is first-line outpatient therapy, with doxycycline or macrolide alternatives guided by local resistance and patient factors. For adults with comorbidities, use amoxicillin/clavulanate or a cephalosporin plus a macrolide or doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone as monotherapy. For children with non-severe CAP, amoxicillin 35–50 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for 3–5 days is supported, with 5 days reasonable for chest-indrawing disease; for severe disease requiring hospitalization, IV ampicillin or penicillin G is standard, with ceftriaxone as an alternative, and high-dose oral amoxicillin can be equivalent to parenteral therapy in carefully selected ambulatory contexts with close follow-up. I should emphasize that all durations should be reassessed at 48–72 hours and shortened to the minimum effective course once stability is clear [^116R7qqa] [^117JT7za] [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt] [^11167Rep] [^11422hz5].

Amoxicillin is first-line for **pediatric CAP** at 40–90 mg/kg/day divided every 8–12 hours (max 4 g/day) for 5–7 days [^115h6tNF]; **shorter 3–5 day courses** are supported by CAP-IT and SAFER for non-severe disease [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt]. For **adults without comorbidities**, use 1 g PO TID for at least 5 days and until clinical stability [^116R7qqa] [^117GrKZi]; with comorbidities, combine with a macrolide or use amoxicillin/clavulanate [^117JT7za]. Adjust dosing for renal impairment and local resistance patterns [^111GyoZg].

## Pediatric dosing recommendations

### Standard dosing

- **Dose**: 40–90 mg/kg/day divided every 8–12 hours (max 4 g/day) [^113mw8Q2].
- **Duration**: 5–7 days [^113mw8Q2]; shorter courses (3–5 days) are effective in non-severe cases [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt].
- **High-dose use**: 70–90 mg/kg/day in areas with high pneumococcal resistance or severe disease [^11167Rep].

---

### Evidence supporting shorter courses

The **CAP-IT trial** showed that 3 days of amoxicillin was noninferior to 7 days for re-treatment [^115fvY6X], and the **SAFER trial** found 5 days was comparable to 10 days for clinical cure [^1119rqQt].

---

## Adult dosing recommendations

### Outpatient therapy

- **Standard dosing**: 1 g PO TID for at least 5 days and until clinical stability [^116R7qqa] [^117GrKZi].
- **Alternative**: doxycycline 100 mg PO BID or macrolide if local resistance is low [^116R7qqa] [^115Q2y7p].
- **With comorbidities**: amoxicillin/clavulanate or combination therapy (beta-lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline) [^117JT7za] [^111GyoZg].

---

### Inpatient therapy

For **non-severe cases**, use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^117DLH1Y]; for **severe cases**, use a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a beta-lactam plus respiratory fluoroquinolone [^111VxjWa].

---

## Special considerations

### Renal impairment

In renal impairment, **adjust the dose** based on creatinine clearance to avoid accumulation and toxicity.

---

### Antibiotic resistance

Local resistance patterns should guide **agent selection and dosing**; use high-dose regimens in areas of high pneumococcal resistance [^1122RpZY].

## Amoxicillin dosing for CAP

| **Patient population** | **Dose** | **Duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pediatric (standard) | 40–90 mg/kg/day divided every 8–12 hours | 5–7 days | Max 4 g/day |
| Pediatric (short course) | 40–90 mg/kg/day divided every 8–12 hours | 3–5 days | Non-severe cases [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt] |

| Adult (standard) | 1 g PO TID | ≥ 5 days and until stability | First-line [^116R7qqa] [^113g1GAS] |
| Adult (comorbidities) | Amoxicillin/clavulanate or combination therapy | ≥ 5 days and until stability | Per guidelines [^117JT7za] |

---

Amoxicillin remains **first-line for pediatric CAP**, with 40–90 mg/kg/day for 5–7 days; shorter courses are effective in non-severe disease [^115fvY6X] [^1119rqQt]. For adults, use 1 g PO TID for at least 5 days and until stability; adjust for comorbidities and local resistance [^116R7qqa] [^111GyoZg].

### Optimal therapy for severe pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia [^117EcLkC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for two-thirds of ICU admissions due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is the leading cause of CAP-related death. Early death is principally due to cardiovascular collapse, whereas late death is associated with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Outcome depends on interactions between non-modifiable factors of predisposition (age, comorbidities, host defences, genetic predisposition) or infection (toxins, virulence, bacterial burden) and modifiable factors (organ-failure support, surgical drainage for empyema, adjuvant therapies and antibiotics). Excess mortality has been reported when initial therapy is discordant, but more than 95% of isolates have minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < 4 microg/ml. Therefore, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and high doses of amoxicillin remain successful for non-meningeal infections. Recent studies suggest that initial combination therapy improves survival in the subset of bacteremic episodes with highest severity, conceivably due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. Prospective, randomized clinical trials of pneumonia patients with a pneumonia severity index score above 90 are warranted to define optimal antibiotic regimens.

### Short-course antibiotic treatment for community-acquired alveolar pneumonia in ambulatory children: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^116KCNsK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Studies on short-course treatment of childhood pneumonia in the developed world are lacking. We compared clinical and laboratory outcomes of a 3-day or a 5-day to a 10-day treatment in young children with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia.

Methods

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 2 stages: (1) 3 days versus 10 days and (2) 5 days versus 10 days. Amoxicillin (80 mg/kg/d; divided into 3 daily doses) was used for all arms. Case definition was: age 6–59 months; radiologically confirmed community-acquired alveolar pneumonia; temperature ≥ 38.5°C; peripheral white blood cell count ≥ 15,000/mm³; status permitting outpatient treatment. Scheduled visits were on days 4–5 and 10–14 with daily telephone interviews for 30 days. Treatment failure was defined by the need for a rescue treatment or hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were: duration of fever and symptoms and white blood cell and C-reactive protein responses.

Results

During Stage 1, 4/10 (40%) and 0/12 (0%) evaluable patients failed in the 3-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P = 0.16). Therefore, the 3-day arm was replaced by a 5-day arm (Stage 2). No failures occurred in the 5-day (n = 56) and 10-day (n = 59) arms. Overall, 4/10 (0%), 0/56 and 0/42 (0%) children failed in the 3-day, 5-day and 10-day arms, respectively (P < 0.001, 3-day versus 5-day or 10-day). Secondary outcomes were similar in the 5-day and 10-day arms.

Conclusion

In 6- to 59-month-old outpatients with community-acquired alveolar pneumonia, a 5-day course with high-dose oral amoxicillin was not inferior to a 10-day course. The 3-day regimen may be associated with an unacceptable failure rate.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition? (2) In the adult emergency department patient with community-acquired pneumonia, what biomarkers can be used to direct initial antimicrobial therapy? (3) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, does a single dose of parenteral antibiotics in the emergency department followed by oral treatment versus oral treatment alone improve outcomes? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mKYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics remain the primary treatment for community acquired pneumonia (CAP), however rising rates of antimicrobial resistance may jeopardize their future efficacy. With higher rates of disease reported in the youngest populations, effective treatment courses for pediatric pneumonia are of paramount importance. This study is the first to examine the quality of pediatric antibiotic use by agent, dose and duration.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study included all outpatient/primary care physician visits for pediatric CAP (aged < 19 years) between January 1 2014 to December 31 2018. Relevant practice guidelines were identified, and treatment recommendations extracted. Amoxicillin was the primary first-line agent for pediatric CAP. Categories of prescribing included: guideline adherent, effective but unnecessary (excess dose and/or duration), under treatment (insufficient dose and/or duration), and not recommended. Proportions of attributable-antibiotic use were examined by prescribing category, and then stratified by age and sex.

Result(s)

A total of 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP were identified. Of those, 31,347 (76%) resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Amoxicillin accounted for 51% of all prescriptions. Overall, 27% of prescribing was fully guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, 10% under treatment, and 44% not recommended by agent. Excessive duration was the hallmark of effective but unnecessary prescribing (97%) Macrolides accounted for the majority on non-first line agent use, with only 32% of not recommended prescribing preceded by a previous course of antibiotics.

Conclusion(s)

This study is the first in Canada to examine prescribing quality for pediatric CAP by agent, dose and duration. Utilizing first-line agents, and shorter-course treatments are targets for stewardship.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^114DEUwS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without severe sepsis in the emergency department — antibiotic timing: Patient Management Recommendations state "Level A recommendations. None specified", "Level B recommendations. There is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in mortality or morbidity from antibiotics administered in less than 4, 6, or 8 hours from ED arrival", and "Level C recommendations. Administer antibiotics as soon as feasible once the diagnosis of CAP is established; there is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in morbidity or mortality from antibiotics administered within any specific time course". National guidance notes "for patients admitted through the ED, the first antibiotic dose should be administered while [the patient is] still in the ED". Evidence cited includes a retrospective multicenter Class III study of "13,771 Medicare patients" "older than 65 years", where antibiotics "administered within 4 hours" were associated with "a decreased 30-day mortality, with an OR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.95)". However, "Other cutoff times from 3 to 8 hours were associated with similar 30-day mortality", "adjusted ORs of the 4- and 8-hour cutoffs were identical", and "patients who received antibiotics between 0 and 2 hours did not have any significant mortality reduction". A prospective Class II study "confirmed the aforementioned association between time to first antibiotic dose less than 4 hours and mortality" in "patients older than 18 years".

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: the SAFER randomized clinical trial [^1119rqQt]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common occurrence in childhood; consequently, evidence-based recommendations for its treatment are required.

Objective

To determine whether 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin for CAP was associated with noninferior rates of clinical cure compared with 10 days of high-dose amoxicillin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The SAFER (Short-Course Antimicrobial Therapy for Pediatric Respiratory Infections) study was a 2-center, parallel-group, noninferiority randomized clinical trial consisting of a single-center pilot study from December 1, 2012, to March 31, 2014, and the follow-up main study from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019 at the emergency departments of McMaster Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. Research staff, participants, and outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Eligible children were aged 6 months to 10 years and had fever within 48 hours, respiratory symptoms, chest radiography findings consistent with pneumonia as per the emergency department physician, and a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. Children were excluded if they required hospitalization, had comorbidities that would predispose them to severe disease and/or pneumonia of unusual origin, or had previous β-lactam antibiotic therapy. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 8, 2020.

Interventions

Five days of high-dose amoxicillin therapy followed by 5 days of placebo (intervention group) vs 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin followed by a different formulation of 5 days of high-dose amoxicillin (control group).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days.

Results

Among the 281 participants, the median age was 2.6 (interquartile range, 1.6–4.9) years (160 boys [57.7%] of 279 with sex listed). Clinical cure was observed in 101 of 114 children (88.6%) in the intervention group and in 99 of 109 (90.8%) in the control group in per-protocol analysis (risk difference, -0.016; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.087). Clinical cure at 14 to 21 days was observed in 108 of 126 (85.7%) in the intervention group and in 106 of 126 (84.1%) in the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (risk difference, 0.023; 97.5% confidence limit, -0.061).

Conclusions and Relevance

Short-course antibiotic therapy appeared to be comparable to standard care for the treatment of previously healthy children with CAP not requiring hospitalization. Clinical practice guidelines should consider recommending 5 days of amoxicillin for pediatric pneumonia management in accordance with antimicrobial stewardship principles.

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

Antibiotics received

At baseline ([−12,+24 h] of admission), 2841 (29.3%) patients received amoxicillin but not co-amoxiclav, with a median (IQR) duration of all antibiotic treatment, including switching agents/route, of 5.4 (5.0–7.3) days (5.0 (4.7–6.5) days on amoxicillin). 1628 (57.3%) received oral, 664 (23.4%) intravenous, and 546 (19.2%) both oral and intravenous amoxicillin (3 through other routes). 5358 (55.3%) patients received baseline co-amoxiclav, with a median 6.8 (5.1–10.0) total days of antibiotics (5.9 (4.7–7.9) days co-amoxiclav). 575 (10.7%), 3568 (66.6%), and 1212 (22.6%) received oral, intravenous, and both oral and intravenous co-amoxiclav, respectively (3 through other routes). 1486 (15.3%) received both amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav at baseline with a median 6.2 (5.2–8.8) total days of antibiotics. Among those receiving amoxicillin initially, 469 (16.5%) later switched to or received additional co-amoxiclav after the baseline period, after a median (IQR) 4.1 (1.7–5.3) days. Conversely, among those receiving co-amoxiclav initially, 499 (9.3%) later de-escalated to amoxicillin, after a median (IQR) 2.4 (1.3–5.2) days. At baseline, 2919 (30.1%) received additional macrolide antibiotics, 1881 (19.4%) additional doxycycline, and 901 (9.3%) additional gentamicin (Table 1).

### Evidence of poor utility of current sepsis screening tools in an at-risk population of children with community-acquired pneumonia [^115dzyP9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Children (6–24kg) with lower respiratory tract infections were prospectively recruited in emergency departments to high or low doses of oral amoxicillin. We identified children who met the criteria for medium and high risks of sepsis, as per the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Of those able to be discharged with oral antibiotics; 54% (318/591) had high-risk sepsis criteria. NICE sepsis guidance is poorly specific, with implications for antimicrobial resistance and iatrogenic patient harm.

### Hidden epidemic of macrolide-resistant pneumococci [^1122RpZY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Macrolide Resistance and Treatment Guidelines

In the United States, guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired RTIs have been established by a number of groups, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. The clinical relevance of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae has been addressed in updates to these groups' guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and in a report published by the Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group convened by CDC. The consensus among these guidelines is that empiric therapy should be stratified based on likely cause, treatment setting (inpatient versus outpatient), and the risk for pneumococcal antimicrobial resistance. In general, all 3 guidelines recommend that monotherapy with macrolides should be restricted to specific patient subgroups (i.e. those with no coexisting cardiopulmonary disease and no risk factors for infection with drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [e.g. recent antimicrobial drug use]). For outpatients with risk factors for drug-resistant S. pneumoniae, current recommended treatment options include combination therapy with a β-lactam (such as high-dose amoxicillin or high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate) plus a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone. The increased use of fluoroquinolones has been associated with the emergence and spread of resistance to these agents, and local clonal dissemination of S. pneumoniae strains with very high-level resistance to penicillin has been reported in the United States. Although the prevalence of these resistant isolates remains low, such findings emphasize the necessity for local resistance patterns to be considered when prescribing empiric antimicrobial drug therapy for patients with community-acquired RTIs.

The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership guidelines for the treatment of acute microbial rhinosinusitis also highlight the need to consider the increasing prevalence of pneumococcal resistance when making treatment choices, with patients divided into categories dependent on their recent exposure to antimicrobial drugs. Similarly, a recent American Thoracic Society statement on the management of acute microbial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphasizes the need to consider local resistance patterns when prescribing antimicrobial drugs.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (inpatient setting, nonsevere CAP), ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy with a β-lactam (ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) in adult inpatients with non-severe CAP and no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Systematic review on antibiotic therapy for pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age [^113cecd2]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a force to reckon with, as it accounts for 1.1 million of all deaths in children less than 5 years of age globally, with disproportionately higher mortality occurring in the low and middle income-countries (LMICs) of Southeast Asia and Africa. Existing strategies to curb pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality have not effectively translated into meaningful control of pneumonia-related burden. In the present systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of trials conducted in LMICs to determine the most suitable antibiotic therapy for treating pneumonia (very severe, severe and non-severe). While previous reviews, including the most recent review by Lodha et al, have focused either on single modality of antibiotic therapy (such as choice of antibiotic) or children under the age of 16 years, the current review updates evidence on the choice of drug, duration, route and combination of antibiotics in children specifically between 2 and 59 months of age. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the route, dose, combination and duration of antibiotics in the management of WHO-defined very severe/severe/non-severe CAP. Study participants included children between 2 and 59 months of age with CAP. All available titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by two review authors independently. All data was entered and analysed using Review Manager 5 software. The review identified 8122 studies on initial search, of which 22 studies which enrolled 20,593 children were included in meta-analyses. Evidence from these trials showed a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin to be effective for managing very severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age, and oral amoxicillin to be equally efficacious, as other parenteral antibiotics for managing severe pneumonia in children of this particular age group. Oral amoxicillin was also found to be effective in non-severe pneumonia as well. The review further found a short 3 day course of antibiotics to be equally beneficial as 5 day course for managing non-severe pneumonia in children between 2 and 59 months of age. This review updates evidence on the general spectrum of antibiotic recommendation for CAP in children between 2 and 59 months of age, which is an age group that warrants special focus owing to its high disease and mortality burden. Evidence derived from the review found oral amoxicillin to be equally effective as parenteral antibiotics for severe pneumonia in the 2–59 month age group, which holds important implications for LMICs where parenteral drug administration is an issue. Also, the review's finding that 3 day course of antibiotic is equally effective as 5 day course for non-severe pneumonia for 2–59 months of age is again beneficial for LMICs, as a shorter therapy will be associated with a lower cost. The review addresses some research gaps in antibiotic treatment for CAP as well, and this crucial information is presented with the aim of providing a targeted cure for the middle and low income setting.

### Compliance with the current recommendations for prescribing antibiotics for paediatric community-acquired pneumonia is improving: data from a prospective study in a French network [^115GGRc4]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In paediatrics, pneumonia frequently leads to medical consultations, antibiotic prescriptions, and hospitalization. In 2005, the French health authorities published guidelines for prescribing antibiotics, especially for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In these recommendations, amoxicillin is the first-line treatment recommended for suspected pneumococcal infections. Treatment with macrolides is recommended only in cases of subacute clinical presentation in older children. However, merely publishing recommendations is not a guarantee for compliance with them. Moreover, it has been shown that antibiotic resistance is closely linked to inadequate and improper antibiotic intake, highlighting the need for better ways to control antibiotic usage.

With growing concern about the widespread problems associated with antibiotic resistance, improved stewardship of paediatric antibiotics usage is being promoted in France through a national network (GPIP: Groupe de Pathologie Infectieuse Pédiatrique), in which most members have a particular interest in emergency care. In a study published 2012, Angoulvant et al. evaluated the impact of the antibiotic guidelines for acute respiratory-tract infection on antibiotic prescribing practice in a paediatric emergency department. They found a significant decrease of the antibiotic prescriptions from 32 to 21% (p < 0.001, Cochran-Armitage test). Limiting the use of antibiotics is an effective way to reduce selection pressure, but when an antibiotic is indicated, in the case of pneumonia, for example, it is also important to prescribe the antibiotic appropriately with the optimal dosage and the narrowest spectrum that is likely to be effective. Indeed, guidelines for the management of upper respiratory tract infections, published in 2011, recommended a narrowing of the spectrum of antibiotics used. We hypothesized that these guidelines could have had an impact on the antibiotic prescription for CAP.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent and temporal course of non-compliance with current antibiotic prescription recommendations for paediatric CAP in paediatric emergency department (PED). We examined clinical practice in ten French PED, five years after the guidelines were published. The secondary objectives were to describe the cause of any medical non-compliance with these recommendations and to study the determinants of suboptimal prescribing practice by the doctor.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qgUpP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111PRidh]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial pneumonia treatment — first-choice options for S. pneumoniae (occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) include amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management, ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL), or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternative parenteral options are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate; for children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day), and add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae).

Antibiotic treatments

A systematic treatment with antibiotics was observed in our population, regardless of the prognostic factors. In fact, 69% of patients were younger than 65 years, 46% had no former medical history, and 62% of patients with data available obtained a null CRB-65 score. The median dose and duration of the most prescribed antibiotic (amoxicillin, 1 g three times daily for 10 days) were higher and longer than those recommended by the UK Guidelines(amoxicillin, 500 mg three times daily for 7 days). Most GPs were probably convinced to treat patients with CAP and strictly met the French Guidelines, which emphasise the importance of initiating high-dose amoxicillin within 4 h after diagnosis. However, this strategy, which is not recommended in several European countries, remains questionable as long-term treatment could be linked to the emergence and selection of resistant bacteriaand this dosage is associated with a higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea.

Disease progression

Most patients had mild disease with uncomplicated progression during the follow-up period, regardless of their management with X-rays. We can assume that patients presenting with severe disease could have consulted at the emergency departments. However, our proportions of hospitalisation and death were consistent with those reported in a previous population-based study. In addition, our results confirm the importance of identifying patients at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease, or with high CRB-65 scoreas these patients were more often hospitalised in our population.

Results

Our study period included a total of 28,307 patients, with 54% male and a mean age of 6.5 years (Table 1). Overall, there were 42,452 episodes of pediatric CAP in BC, between 2014 and 2018. Of those, 32,469 episodes resulted in a prescription, with a proportion of 76% total CAP episodes prescribed (Table 1). The age distribution of patients by sex shows that 72% of antibiotics were dispensed to children aged 1–6 years (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Table 1
Cohort Characteristics

1 Population Data BC determines neighborhood income quintile (i.e. household size-adjusted measure of household income) using a postal code-based algorithm standardized by Statistics Canada; 2 Rural status represents local population of 1000 to 29 999; urban status represents local population ≥ 30 000; 3 acute episodes (< 30 days) of pediatric CAP regardless of associated-antibiotic prescription; 4 acute episodes (< 30 days) that received an antibiotic prescription within 5 days of episode end date; 5 proportion prescribed as: [# episodes prescribed / # total episodes]

Amoxicillin comprised 51% of all prescriptions in the five study years. The majority (53%) of amoxicillin prescriptions were categorized as fully guideline adherent. Alternative first-line treatments for CAP included: amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin and penicillin, which accounted for an additional 5% of prescribing, for a total of 56% first-line agent use. Overall, 44% of prescriptions were classified as not recommended, followed by 27% guideline adherent, 19% effective but unnecessary, and 10% under treatment (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Percentage of outpatient antibiotic use for pediatric CAP by category of prescription quality by year

When compared to 2014, guideline adherent prescribing significantly increased by the final study year [RR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6–1.8] (Table 2). Effective but unnecessary use also demonstrated an increase, while under treatment and not recommended prescribing decreased (Table 2). Durations exceeding 5–7 days were the primary characteristic of inappropriate prescribing, accounting for 97% of all effective but unnecessary antibiotic use (Supplementary Table 2). Sub therapeutic dosing was responsible for 50% of under treatment antibiotic use, while the remainder could be attributed to both sub therapeutic dosing and excess duration.

Clinical guidelines, dose and duration

Clinical practice guidelines and treatment recommendations were extracted from Bugs & Drugs, a provincial reference, as well as: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAPS), Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the British Thoracic Society (BTS). Guidelines were reviewed and first-line agent(s), dosing and duration extracted. Treatment recommendations for β-lactam allergies were excluded as medication allergies are recorded but remain unavailable in PharmaNet data.

Amoxicillin [40–90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/day; x 5–7 days] was the primary treatment for outpatient pediatric CAP. Alternative first-line treatments included: Penicillin [25–50 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; Ampicillin [50–100 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; and Amoxicillin-clavulanate [90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/Kg/day; x 5–7 days]. Average daily dose was stratified by patient age, and calculated utilizing WHO growth charts for Canada. For each age, a daily dosing range was calculated. The 3rd and 97th percentile weights at the mid-point (i.e. 6.5 years for a 6-year-old) were determined for each sex. Per age and sex, the lowest 3rd percentile weight was multiplied by the lowest dose (e.g. 40 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the minimum daily dose. The highest 97th percentile was multiplied by the highest dose (e.g. 90 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the maximum; up to the maximum daily dose stated in guidelines (e.g. 4 g for amoxicillin).

Published in 2012, provincial guidelines state that 5–7 days is the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment. Other guidelines put forth by the AAPS and IDSA, during our study period, do include longer durations (7–10 days), however given the scope of our study is limited to BC, regionally-specific recommendations were prioritized.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1162j6MX]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this EHR study using causal inference methods to estimate the effects of initial antibiotic choices from observational data, we found no evidence of a difference in 30-day all-cause mortality between patients hospitalised with CAP initially treated with co-amoxiclav vs. amoxicillin. We tested several different approaches, and consistently found no evidence of a difference in mortality. We also found no evidence of an association between mortality and receiving additional gentamicin, macrolide, or doxycycline at baseline.

Point estimates comparing the impact of initial co-amoxiclav to amoxicillin on 30-day mortality ranged between 0.92 to 1.11; the estimated confidence intervals for the main PS matched analysis (95%CI 0.73–1.23) indicate that we can exclude amoxicillin being associated with increased mortality by more than 27% with reasonable confidence, and similarly that co-amoxiclav is not associated with increased mortality by more than 23%, albeit with the most likely range of values closer to the point estimate (0.95).

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112hi12x]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: A multidisciplinary panel conducted pragmatic systematic reviews of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. Results: The panel addressed 16 specific areas for recommendations spanning questions of diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, the availability of results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. Conclusions: The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Effect of amoxicillin dose and treatment duration on the need for antibiotic Re-treatment in children with community-acquired pneumonia: the CAP-IT randomized clinical trial [^115fvY6X]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.

Objective

To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, randomized, 2×2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.

Interventions

Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35–50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70–90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.

Results

Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6–2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; p = 0.03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.

### Antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of COPD: patient outcomes with amoxicillin vs. amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-data from 43, 636 outpatients [^113ZAecG]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations (AECOPD) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to high morbidity and mortality. Key symptoms are breathlessness, increased sputum volume and purulence. The treatment involves the use of bronchodilators, oxygen treatment, systemic corticosteroids and often antibiotics. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, shorten the course of the disease, prevent further deterioration of lung function, and prolong the period between exacerbations. A quick recovery and longer interval between hospitalizations are important, as both the patient's life and healthcare costs are influenced by the severity and the number of AECOPD. The largest and most recent meta-analysis on treatment of AECOPD concludes in line with earlier meta-analyses, that for serious exacerbations (requiring hospital admission) there is moderate evidence that antibiotic treatment improves outcomes compared to placebo. For mild to moderate cases (outpatients), the conclusion is less clear, although it is observed, that the risk of treatment failure, defined as no resolution or deterioration of symptoms, is higher among patients who do not receive antibiotics. No effect was found regarding all-cause mortality or re-exacerbations within 2 to 6 weeks. The conclusion was based on pooled data from studies with different antibiotics, and where various doses were used. When using antibiotics, GOLD recommends that the choice is based on local resistance patterns. Today amoxicillin (AMX) 750 mg three times daily (TID) is recommended as first choice empirical treatment of AECOPD in Denmark in mild to moderate cases, however many clinicians prefer amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125 mg TID, as recommended in the previous guideline, referring to the fact that AMC is effective against Moraxella catarrhalis. A bacterial pathogen is believed to be accountable for around half of the deteriorations, where Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly found, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. AMX has a narrow spectrum of activity compared to AMC. Apart from Staphylococcus aureus and M. catarrhalis, most pathogens that cause community acquired pneumonia and AECOPD that are sensitive to AMC are also sensitive to AMX. The use of AMX instead of AMC in exacerbations in patients with severe COPD has not yet been investigated in a sufficiently large patient population and with clinically important endpoints like pneumonia hospitalization and death. The aim of this study was to determine which of these regimens is associated with better outcomes. On one hand, AMC has a broader spectrum of activity, and on the other hand, AMX is most often administered at a higher dose of amoxicillin (750 mg vs. 500 mg), which may increase the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for many pathogenic bacteria. Additionally, side effects may be more frequent when using AMC. The main analysis compares the risk of death or hospitalization due to pneumonia or AECOPD in the 30 days following a first AMX/AMC prescription.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^115iRYAH]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings are consistent with several earlier studies. A recent multi-centre randomised trial in the Netherlands showed narrow-spectrum treatment for moderately-severe CAP outside of the ICU was non-inferior to broad-spectrum treatment in terms of 90-day mortality. Although some previous studies using similar PS approaches reported increased mortality associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for CAP and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), these studies acknowledge this may arise from unmeasured confounders unavailable in their administrative databases, a limitation which we address by potentially adjusting more completely for confounding with our more detailed data.

Our study suggests wider use of narrow-spectrum agents may potentially be safe for the treatment of CAP requiring hospital admission. Across several thousand patients, within the assumptions made, there was no evidence that using amoxicillin rather than co-amoxiclav was harmful; while other data suggest this could reduce AMRand antibiotic-related adverse events. Empirical treatment based on clinical syndromes is by definition population-based, even if some stratification by disease severity is recommended, as in CAP guidelines (although, we did not find any evidence that our findings depended on pneumonia severity scores). However, clinicians and patients may be rightly concerned that they do not want to see individual patients deprived of potentially lifesaving treatment. This is common to all empirical antibiotic use, which balances such risks against AMR, rather than simply offering everyone the broadest possible, most likely to be active, treatment. Although our findings suggest that amoxicillin can probably be used to successfully treat more CAP than at present, better diagnostics to identify the causative organisms in CAP more often would also be useful, alongside other demographic and healthcare data, as a basis for generating personalised treatment recommendations, to ensure antibiotic resistant or atypical infections are appropriately treated.

### Recommendations for treatment of childhood non-severe pneumonia [^117Go1ag]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

WHO recommendations for early antimicrobial treatment of childhood pneumonia have been effective in reducing childhood mortality, but the last major revision was over 10 years ago. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, new pneumonia pathogens, and new drugs have prompted WHO to assemble an international panel to review the literature on childhood pneumonia and to develop evidence-based recommendations for the empirical treatment of non-severe pneumonia among children managed by first-level health providers. Treatment should target the bacterial causes most likely to lead to severe disease, including Streptoccocus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The best first-line agent is amoxicillin, given twice daily for 3–5 days, although co-trimoxazole may be an alternative in some settings. Treatment failure should be defined in a child who develops signs warranting immediate referral or who does not have a decrease in respiratory rate after 48–72 h of therapy. If failure occurs, and no indication for immediate referral exists, possible explanations for failure should be systematically determined, including non-adherence to therapy and alternative diagnoses. If failure of the first-line agent remains a possible explanation, suitable second-line agents include high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with or without an affordable macrolide for children over 3 years of age.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Nd7cJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) affects 0.3%–1.5% of children yearly in Western countries. The current standard treatment strategy in international guidelines for CAP is 7–10 days of oral amoxicillin, regardless of etiology. In children < 5 years of age, viruses alone or in mixed infections with bacteria are the most common cause of CAP. Evidence shows that Mycoplasma pneumoniae is involved in more than half of the cases after 10 years of age, but the usefulness of antibiotics remains obscure. At all ages the most important bacterial pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Complications are rare, but when they are present, they usually follow pneumococcal CAP.

The optimal treatment duration for CAP in high-income countries has been controversial. A systematic review published in 2014, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), addressed the efficacy of the shorter treatment duration for CAP. Only 1 of the 8 RCTs was from a high-income country and most of the RCTs did not compare shorter antibiotic treatment with the current treatment recommendation. The most recent systematic review without meta-analysis included 11 trials (of which 8 were from developing countries) and concluded that more studies from high-income countries were needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of shorter antibiotic treatment in children.

Shorter antibiotic treatments for pediatric CAP cases have, at least in theory, several potential benefits over current treatment strategies. Shorter courses may prevent development of antibiotic resistance by minimizing exposure of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic microbes of normal flora to antibiotics, which diminishes the selection pressure for emergence of resistant strains. In addition, unnecessary long courses increase the risk of adverse events, such as diarrhea, which is common in young children treated with antibiotics.

This meta-analysis comprising RCTs focused on antibiotic treatment duration of CAP in children treated as outpatients in high-income countries. Our primary aim was to determine whether a short antibiotic treatment duration of 3–5 days was as effective and safe as the longer treatment duration of 7–10 days. In addition, we evaluated antibiotic-related adverse events as a secondary objective of the study.

### Identifying the best initial oral antibiotics for adults with community-acquired pneumonia: a network meta-analysis [^111o69Rj]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare rates of clinical response and mortality for empiric oral antibiotic regimens in adults with mild-moderate community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and the reference lists of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. We included randomized trials of adults with radiologically confirmed mild to moderate CAP initially treated orally and reporting clinical cure or mortality. Abstracts and studies were reviewed in parallel for inclusion in the analysis and for data abstraction. We performed separate analyses by antibiotic medications and antibiotic classes and present the results through network diagrams and forest plots sorted by p-scores. We assessed the quality of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias framework, as well as global and local inconsistency.

Results

We identified 24 studies with 9361 patients: six at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk, and 12 at high risk. Nemonoxacin, levofloxacin, and telithromycin were most likely to achieve clinical response (p-score 0.79, 0.71, and 0.69 respectively), while penicillin and amoxicillin were least likely to achieve clinical response. Levofloxacin, nemonoxacin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (p-score 0.85, 0.75, 0.74, and 0.68 respectively). By antibiotic class, quinolones and macrolides were most effective for clinical response (0.71 and 0.70 respectively), with amoxicillin-clavulanate plus macrolides and beta-lactams being less effective (p-score 0.11 and 0.22). Quinolones were most likely to be associated with lower mortality (0.63). All confidence intervals were broad and partially overlapping.

Conclusion

We observed trends toward a better clinical response and lower mortality for quinolones as empiric antibiotics for CAP, but found no conclusive evidence of any antibiotic being clearly more effective than another. More trials are needed to inform guideline recommendations on the most effective antibiotic regimens for outpatients with mild to moderate CAP.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

Outcomes & sensitivity analyses

Baseline characteristics were examined by age, sex, income quintile and rurality. Primary outcomes included: the proportion of total CAP episodes prescribed; the proportion of antibiotic use by category; and changes in trends over time. Categories were further examined to identify proportions attributable to deviations in dose and/or duration. Primary outcomes included amoxicillin as a first-line agent. Secondary outcomes also included penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate, alongside amoxicillin. Results were then stratified by age and sex.

A sensitivity analysis was determined a priori to examine weight-based dosing. As average daily dose was calculated using growth charts, a secondary analysis was completed using the 25th and 75th markers to narrow the range for guideline adherence and examine more conservative dosing.

Two post hoc analyses were also completed. The first examined the prevalence of prior antibiotic utilization for non-first line prescriptions dispensed for CAP, and categorized as Not Recommended. Using a 90-day lookback window, prescriptions were reviewed overall, and by drug class. Given the impact of prior β-lactam use upon patient susceptibility — the majority of "not recommended" use was hypothesized to have a preceding antibiotic. Second, we examined appropriate use in two pediatric subgroups: (1) ≤ 5 years; and (2) 12–18 years, to compare prescribing quality in the context of varying prevalence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

### Antibiotic treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient children in high-income countries – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QhzrR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

High-dose amoxicillin (80–100 mg/kg/d) was the prescribed antibiotic in 3 of the 4 studies, and in the fourth study 5% received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. A study from England compared short and long amoxicillin courses with low (35–50 mg/kg/d) and high amoxicillin doses separately. It found that short courses were not inferior to long courses with either dose, and low doses were not inferior to high doses.

High doses of amoxicillin have been needed in areas where penicillin or multiple antibiotic resistance is common in pneumococcal strains, but a double amoxicillin dose equates to double antibiotic exposure. Therefore, countries with low resistance rates have used low-dose amoxicillin as the first choice for children's CAP, and the efficacy of low-dose in shorter duration should be confirmed in further studies.

The original purpose of the study was to compare clinical cures between short-course and long-course arms, but the clinical parameters expressing cure were heterogenous between the included studies and could not be pooled to produce any summary estimates. Instead, the retreatments and hospitalizations within 1 month were constantly reported in all studies, and these failures were combined and used as the primary outcome in the analyses. Furthermore, owing to the low failure rates in the included studies, we decided to use RDs in the analyses instead of risk ratios. Three of the included studies were noninferiority-designed RCTs, but the pooling of these with a cenventional parallel superiority-designed RCT is feasible, and we aimed to seek differences between groups in our conventional meta-analysis instead of using a prespecified noninferiority margin in the analyses.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite pneumonia being a common and deadly illness, optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pediatric pneumonia has not yet been established. In this population in Malawi, 3-day was non-inferior to 5-day amoxicillin treatment among HIVuninfected children with chest-indrawing pneumonia. In considering policy changes regarding duration of amoxicillin treatment for chest-indrawing pneumonia, further research may be needed to see if these results can be replicated in other low-resource regions and pediatric populations.

### Impact of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment on the long-term prognosis of community acquired pneumonia [^115vKX89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is not well established: discrepancies exist between the different guidelines published to date. In 2007, IDSA / ATS included a minimum treatment of 5 days, provided the patient remains free of fever for 48–72 h and without more than one criterion of clinical instability. Recently published updated guidelines keep the same recommendation.

The negative impact of the overuse of antibiotics is well known. In this regard, an increase in nasopharyngeal carriers of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae has been observed with the use of low-dose beta-lactams for more than 5 days in children. The unnecessarily prolonged use of antibiotics has been associated with a greater incidence of resistance, a higher number of adverse effects, worse adherence to treatment, and a higher cost.

Several studies have been published with the aim of evaluating the safety of reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. In a recent meta-analysis involving five clinical trials involving adults with mild-to-moderate CAP comparing the same types of antibiotic, short 3 to 7 day regimens of antibiotics were compared to 7 to 10 day regimens. The authors did not observe significant differences in terms of cure rate, mortality and adverse effects. Surprisingly, a new meta-analysis comparing ≤ 6 day versus ≥ 7 day regimens, observed a lower mortality rate in the shorter compared to the long regimen group (RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33–0.82), with similar cure and relapse rates in both groups. When evaluating only the most severe patients, mortality was 2.2% in the group with a shorter regimen compared to 4.7% in the long regimen group.

Summary

Objectives

Current guidelines recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics for high-severity community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), potentially contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We aim to compare outcomes in CAP patients treated with amoxicillin (narrow-spectrum) versus co-amoxiclav (broad-spectrum), to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be used more widely.

Methods

We analysed electronic health records from adults (≥ 16 y) admitted to hospital with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia between 01-January-2016 and 30-September-2023 in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Patients receiving baseline ([−12 h,+24 h] from admission) amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav were included. The association between 30-day all-cause mortality and baseline antibiotic was examined using propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) to address confounding by baseline characteristics and disease severity. Subgroup analyses by disease severity and sensitivity analyses with missing covariates imputed were also conducted.

Results

Among 16,072 admissions with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia, 9685 received either baseline amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav. There was no evidence of a difference in 30-day mortality between patients receiving initial co-amoxiclav vs. amoxicillin (PS matching: marginal odds ratio 0.97 [0.76–1.27], p = 0.61; IPTW: 1.02 [0.78–1.33], p = 0.87). Results remained similar across stratified analyses of mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia. Results were also similar with missing data imputed. There was also no evidence of an association between 30-day mortality and use of additional macrolides or additional doxycycline.

Conclusions

There was no evidence of co-amoxiclav being advantageous over amoxicillin for treatment of CAP in 30-day mortality at a population-level, regardless of disease severity. Wider use of narrow-spectrum empirical treatment of moderate/severe CAP should be considered to curb potential for AMR.

### Randomized trial of amoxicillin for pneumonia in Pakistan [^117Xctgi]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths of the study include the high adherence, directly observed treatment, low attrition, assiduous reporting and investigation of adverse events and per protocol analyses that are necessary for internal validity of non-inferiority studies.

Important limitations of the trial include those for generalizability because of the strict exclusion criteria and close follow-up beyond the normal for this population. The study area has high rates of health utilization for respiratory infections and thus results may not be generalizable to settings where presentation is delayed and upon worsening of signs and symptoms, however this would be offset if such children would have been triaged to a higher level of care in that setting. Absence of radiology was a limitation, but this was a deliberate part of the design in order that the study replicated a 'real life' situation. Amoxicillin was prescribed using standard WHO recommended weight bands, which resulted in some children getting lower and some higher doses of amoxicillin. However none of the children received a dose less than 50mg/kg/day, the lower limit of high dose amoxicillin.

In conclusion we did not reject the null hypothesis of inferiority of placebo against amoxicillin in urban preschool Pakistani children with WHO-defined fast breathing pneumonia. Given that there is a low event rate with high number of self-resolving cases, there are implications for re-addressing respiratory rate cutoffs and identifying those at risk of treatment failure. A concerted effort by World Health Organization and partners is underway to use RETAPP and other such datasets to identify sub-populations who are at greater risk of failing treatment when not receiving antibiotics, in order to better specify children who would benefit most with antibiotics. Given that the margin of non-inferiority was small, adequately powered future trials may be required to further refine definition and classification of and treatment algorithms for fast breathing pneumonia.

### Interpretation of antibiotic trials in pediatric pneumonia [^114d6QBH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Recent randomized clinical trials have compared antibiotic regimens of varying intensity for the treatment of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). These trials identified no advantage to high-dose vs low-dose amoxicillinor a longer vs shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, with respect to rates or timing of clinical improvement. However, most of these trials enrolled children based solely on clinical criteria or clinician judgment. Given the challenges of diagnosing pediatric pneumonia clinically, it is likely that most children included in studies with clinically suspected CAP did not have radiographic pneumonia and thus would have improved regardless of antibiotic therapy.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to duration of antibiotic therapy, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to decide on the duration of antibiotic therapy based on validated measures of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and ability to tolerate oral intake) Continue antibiotics until the patient achieves stability and for at least 5 days in patients with CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Antibiotic therapy for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia: do we know when, what and for how long to treat? [^1135VCBy]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity among children in developed countries and accounts for an incidence of 10–40 cases per 1000 children in the first 5 years of life. Given the clinical, social and economic importance of CAP, there is general agreement that prompt and adequate therapy is essential to reduce the impact of the disease. The aim of this discussion paper is to consider critically the available data concerning the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric CAP and to consider when, how and for how long it should be treated. This review has identified the various reasons that make it difficult to establish a rational approach to the treatment of pediatric CAP, including the definition of CAP, the absence of a pediatric CAP severity score, the difficulty of identifying the etiology, limited pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, the high resistance of the most frequent respiratory pathogens to the most widely used anti-infectious agents and the lack of information concerning the changes in CAP epidemiology following the introduction of new vaccines against respiratory pathogens. More research is clearly required in various areas, such as the etiology of CAP and the reasons for its complications, the better definition of first- and second-line antibiotic therapies (including the doses and duration of parenteral and oral antibiotic treatment), the role of antiviral treatment and on how to follow-up patients with CAP. Finally, further efforts are needed to increase vaccination coverage against respiratory pathogens and to conduct prospective studies of their impact.

### Childhood community-acquired pneumonia: a review of etiology-and antimicrobial treatment studies [^115CpSnP]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of childhood morbidity worldwide. Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^112qqAZ7]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical methods

In contrast to randomised treatment assignment in a trial, in observational/EHR studies multiple factors influence treatment choice, e.g. patient comorbidities or CAP severity, leading to treatments given for more severe diseases potentially being associated with worse outcomes. Therefore, to estimate the effect of baseline amoxicillin vs. co-amoxiclav on 30-day all-cause mortality following CAP, we used two causal methods designed to account for this. Provided all factors influencing treatment assignment are modelled, they can produce estimates of treatment effects comparable to estimates from experimental trials. We assessed consistency between the two methods, and also compared with a standard multivariable logistic regression model (Supplementary Methods). To emulate a target trial, i.e. to provide a causal estimate of the effect of initiating antibiotics with co-amoxiclav (treatment) vs. amoxicillin (control), we used propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW), to estimate the average treatment effect in the population, i.e. the average effect at the population level if all patients received co-amoxiclav vs. all received amoxicillin. Propensity scores were calculated using multivariable logistic regression with baseline antibiotic as the outcome, including all baseline covariates and allowing non-linear and interaction terms (Supplementary Methods). PS model covariates were based on subject-matter knowledge of likely associations with 30-day mortality.

For PS matching, we used optimal full matching, matching patients in either treatment or control groups to ≥ 1 patient in the alternative group based on PSto minimise overall differences between groups without discarding any patients. IPTW used sampling weights to create a quasi-randomised synthetic sample, truncating extreme weights to optimise covariate balance targeting standardised mean differences (SMD) < 0.1. Following matching or weighting, treatment effects on 30-day mortality were estimated using logistic regression with cluster-robust standard errors, calculating marginal odds ratios through G-computation. Sensitivity analyses used PS stratification (by quintiles) and doubly-robust estimation, which increases robustness to model mis-specification and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects even when only one of the PS or outcome models is correctly specified. Subgroup analyses stratified by baseline CURB-65 pneumonia severity score (see Supplementary Methods), classifying scores 0–1 as mild, 2 as moderate, and 3–5 as moderate/severe.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in children [^112AyywP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pneumonia caused by bacterial pathogens is the leading cause of mortality in children in low-income countries. Early administration of antibiotics improves outcomes.

Objectives

To identify effective antibiotic drug therapies for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) of varying severity in children by comparing various antibiotics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 10; MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012); EMBASE (1990 to November 2012); CINAHL (2009 to November 2012); Web of Science (2009 to November 2012) and LILACS (2009 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children of either sex, comparing at least two antibiotics for CAP within hospital or ambulatory (outpatient) settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the full articles of selected studies.

Main Results

We included 29 trials, which enrolled 14,188 children, comparing multiple antibiotics. None compared antibiotics with placebo. Assessment of quality of study revealed that 5 out of 29 studies were double-blind and allocation concealment was adequate. Another 12 studies were unblinded but had adequate allocation concealment, classifying them as good quality studies. There was more than one study comparing co-trimoxazole with amoxycillin, oral amoxycillin with injectable penicillin/ampicillin and chloramphenicol with ampicillin/penicillin and studies were of good quality, suggesting the evidence for these comparisons was of high quality compared to other comparisons. In ambulatory settings, for treatment of World Health Organization (WHO) defined non-severe CAP, amoxycillin compared with co-trimoxazole had similar failure rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.51) and cure rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.89). Three studies involved 3952 children. In children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia, oral antibiotics (amoxycillin/co-trimoxazole) compared with injectable penicillin had similar failure rates (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.24), hospitalisation rates (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.34) and relapse rates (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.82). Six studies involved 4331 children below 18 years of age. In very severe CAP, death rates were higher in children receiving chloramphenicol compared to those receiving penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamicin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). One study involved 1116 children.

Authors' Conclusions

For treatment of patients with CAP in ambulatory settings, amoxycillin is an alternative to co-trimoxazole. With limited data on other antibiotics, co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefpodoxime may be alternative second-line drugs. Children with severe pneumonia without hypoxaemia can be treated with oral amoxycillin in an ambulatory setting. For children hospitalised with severe and very severe CAP, penicillin/ampicillin plus gentamycin is superior to chloramphenicol. The other alternative drugs for such patients are co-amoxyclavulanic acid and cefuroxime. Until more studies are available, these can be used as second-line therapies. There is a need for more studies with radiographically confirmed pneumonia in larger patient populations and similar methodologies to compare newer antibiotics. Recommendations in this review are applicable to countries with high case fatalities due to pneumonia in children without underlying morbidities and where point of care tests for identification of aetiological agents for pneumonia are not available.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, outpatient setting, patients with comorbidities, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy of a β-lactam (amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime, or cefuroxime) and doxycycline 100 mg PO BID as another option.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Ambulatory short-course high-dose oral amoxicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia in children: a randomised equivalency trial [^11167Rep]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

WHO case management guidelines for severe pneumonia involve referral to hospital for treatment with parenteral antibiotics. If equally as effective as parenteral treatment, home-based oral antibiotic treatment could reduce referral, admission, and treatment costs. Our aim was to determine whether home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin and inpatient treatment with parenteral ampicillin were equivalent for the treatment of severe pneumonia in children.

Methods

This randomised, open-label equivalency trial was done at seven study sites in Pakistan. 2037 children aged 3–59 months with severe pneumonia were randomly allocated to either initial hospitalisation and parenteral ampicillin (100 mg/kg per day in four doses) for 48 h, followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day; n = 1012) or to home-based treatment for 5 days with oral amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg per day in two doses; n = 1025). Follow-up assessments were done at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days after enrollment. The primary outcome was treatment failure (clinical deterioration) by day 6. Analyses were done per protocol and by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN95821329.

Findings

In the per-protocol population, 36 individuals were excluded from the hospitalised group and 37 from the ambulatory group, mainly because of protocol violations or loss to follow-up. There were 87 (8.6%) treatment failures in the hospitalised group and 77 (7.5%) in the ambulatory group (risk difference 1.1%; 95% CI -1.3 to 3.5) by day 6. Five (0.2%) children died within 14 days of enrollment, one in the ambulatory group and four in the hospitalised group. In each case, treatment failure was declared before death and the antibiotic had been changed. None of the deaths were considered to be associated with treatment allocation; there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial.

Interpretation

Home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to currently recommended hospitalisation and parenteral ampicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia without underlying complications, suggesting that WHO recommendations for treatment of severe pneumonia need to be revised.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^115RN9BE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

The NICE Guideline contains 27 recommendations, of which 3 relate to hospital acquired pneumonia, one to lower respiratory tract infections including CAP and 23 specifically to CAP. The BTS Guideline contains 137 recommendations, all relating specifically to CAP. Of these 137 recommendations, 36 overlapped with NICE Guideline recommendations. Major differences with the NICE Guideline were considered to exist for only five BTS recommendations (see table 1).

Table 1
BTS Guideline recommendations that overlap with NICE Guideline recommendations where major differences exist

In particular, no major differences were noted in the recommendations pertaining to the key aspects of the management of CAP: severity assessment, antibiotic choice and timeliness of treatment. Both guidelines recommend the use of:
clinical judgement in conjunction with the CURB-65 score (CRB65 score for primary care) to assess illness severity,
a single antibiotic as initial empirical therapy in patients with low severity CAP,
dual combination antibiotics comprising amoxicillin and a macrolide for patients with moderate severity CAP, and
dual combination antibiotics comprising a β-lactamase stable β-lactam (such as co-amoxiclav) and a macrolide for patients with high severity CAP.

In addition, both guidelines recommend that processes are be put in place to allow the radiological diagnosis and treatment of patients with CAP within 4 h of presentation to hospital.

### Variability in antibiotic prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia [^112kmpL7]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Published guidelines recommend amoxicillin for most children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), yet macrolides and broad-spectrum antibiotics are more commonly prescribed. We aimed to determine the patient and clinician characteristics associated with the prescription of amoxicillin versus macrolide or broad-spectrum antibiotics for CAP.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study in an outpatient pediatric primary care network from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2013. Patients prescribed amoxicillin, macrolides, or a broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalosporin, or fluoroquinolone) for CAP were included. Multivariable logistic regression models were implemented to identify predictors of antibiotic choice for CAP based on patient- and clinician-level characteristics, controlling for practice.

Results

Of 10414 children, 4239 (40.7%) received amoxicillin, 4430 (42.5%) received macrolides and 1745 (16.8%) received broad-spectrum antibiotics. The factors associated with an increased odds of receipt of macrolides compared with amoxicillin included patient age ≥ 5 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.53–6.91), previous antibiotic receipt (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.56–2.04), and private insurance (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.28–1.70). The predicted probability of a child being prescribed a macrolide ranged significantly between 0.22 and 0.83 across clinics. The nonclinical characteristics associated with an increased odds of receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics compared with amoxicillin included suburban practice (aOR: 7.50; 95% CI: 4.16–13.55) and private insurance (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.18–1.71).

Conclusions

Antibiotic choice for CAP varied widely across practices. Factors unlikely related to the microbiologic etiology of CAP were significant drivers of antibiotic choice. Understanding drivers of off-guideline prescribing can inform targeted antimicrobial stewardship initiatives.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Compliance with the current recommendations for prescribing antibiotics for paediatric community-acquired pneumonia is improving: data from a prospective study in a French network [^112s8NTb]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Second period

During the second period, 300 patients were included from three participating centres (centres 2, 3, and 7). We excluded six children with empyema and one child for whom data about their antibiotic prescription(s) were missing. Among the 293 children that were included, the median age was 3.6 years old and 26.7% were hospitalized. Two children died (Table 1). Amoxicillin was prescribed in 71.0% of the cases (Table 2). The antibiotics were prescribed for 10 days for 73.4% of the children, with a median prescribed duration of 10 days (ranging from 2 to 15 days).

Compliance with recommendations

First period

Non-compliance with the current recommendations for antibiotic prescriptions occurred in 48.5% of the cases included in the 10 centres. The most frequent reasons for non-compliance, in order of frequency, were as follows: the use of an antibiotic that was too broad-spectrum for the disease (amoxicillin-clavulanate or third generation cephalosporin) in 69.8% of the non-compliant cases; unjustified intravenous (IV) administration in 37.2%; unjustified concomitant administration of two or more antibiotics in 13.2%; prescription of a macrolide despite amoxicillin being the preferred treatment in 4.8%; and no antibiotics prescribed in 8.6%. Among 126 children who did not receive antibiotics, 68 were described as ill-appearing or having respiratory distress signs and/or having risk factors for pneumococcal infection.

Second period

Non-compliance with the current recommendations for antibiotic prescriptions was seen in 18.8% of the cases. The most frequent reasons for non-compliance, in order of frequency, were as follows: the use of unjustified concomitant administration of two or more antibiotics in 38.2% of non-compliant cases; treatment that was too broad-spectrum for the disease (amoxicillin-clavulanate or third generation cephalosporin) in 36.4%; prescription of a macrolide or pristinamycin despite amoxicillin being the preferred treatment in 9.1%; the use of a macrolide not approved by the French medical agency for CAP indications in 9.1%; unjustified IV administration in 3.6% and insufficient dosage in 3.6%;

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### No evidence of difference in mortality with amoxicillin versus co-amoxiclav for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113LDrEf]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. The causal estimates produced depend on several assumptions, including that all determinants of treatment choice are included in the models. However despite using comprehensive EHR data, unmeasured confounding likely still exists: there may be unwritten/unrecorded factors that lead clinicians to use broad-spectrum antibiotics in more unwell patients, even when all measured factors are the same (potentially undermining model assumptions). Hence, our study provides clear support for a future randomised trial that could be used to address this concern more completely; however, investment in such a trial would need to be balanced against how likely unmeasured confounding sufficient to change study findings was, and how generalisable findings might be over time and to different locations.

Other limitations include using diagnostic codes to identify CAP, which may be imperfect, although findings were similar in the subset of patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia. Additionally, we did not account for the causative organism, since, in common with most CAP, most patients (94%) lacked positive microbiology. This also precluded subgroup analyses by causative pathogens. In the subset of patients with positive blood cultures (3.1%), S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae accounted for 76/298 (26%) of infections, which would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin. However, as most patients did not have positive microbiology it is possible that beta-lactamase producing bacteria made up a smaller proportion of cases overall, which would be in keeping with our main findings suggesting amoxicillin was active in most cases. In settings with different bacterial species or resistance prevalence our findings may not generalise. As above, better diagnostics to reliably diagnose more of the infections that would not respond to amoxicillin, might help support wider use of narrow spectrum agents.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174pxsj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^112jBvbp]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Appropriate duration of therapy was identified as 5–7 days, based on clinical guidelines available during the study period. More recently, the SAFER, SCOUT-CAP, and CAP-IT trial results have become available, which offer robust clinical evidence in favour of short course treatments (3–5 days). These randomized, multicenter, trials enrolled children (N = 1485) with non-severe CAP. The SAFER trial was a blinded non-inferiority study completed in Canadian emergency departments, concluding that 5-day high-dose amoxicillin therapy was comparable to 10-day. In the United States, the SCOUT-CAP trial examined outpatient, urgent care, as well as emergency settings, and corroborate SAFER results. Moreover, SCOUT-CAP offered the first evidence of reduced antibiotic selective pressure resulting from shorter-courses, by examining antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in a post-hoc microbiome analysis. The trial concluded that 5-day treatment reported significantly lower levels of ARGs when compared to longer durations. The CAP-IT non-inferiority trial concluded that 3-day treatment was non-inferior to 7 days of amoxicillin. With results published in 2021/22, all three trials provide irrefutable clinical evidence that short-course should be standard-of-care for non-severe pediatric CAP infection. Across multiple outcomes of interest including: treatment failure, hospitalization, adverse events, short-course (3–5 days) treatments have been identified as equally safe and effective when compared to longer durations (7–10 days). Moreover, shorter durations of therapy increased year-on-year, while 10-day dispensations decreased, indicating an existing trend towards short-course treatment within BC prior to trial result dissemination. The Do Bugs Need Drugs stewardship campaign has been operating at the provincial-level within BC since 2005. These study results offer discrete targets for intervention:(1) encouraging the use of β-lactam antibiotics in lieu of empiric macrolide use, and (2) continued emphasis on 5–7 days of therapy to reduce the risk of bacterial resistance.

### Effectiveness of discontinuing antibiotic treatment after three days versus eight days in mild to moderate-severe community acquired pneumonia: randomised, double blind study [^112XfVPf]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of discontinuing treatment with amoxicillin after three days or eight days in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate-severe community acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial three days' treatment.

Design

Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled non-inferiority trial.

Setting

Nine secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands.

Participants

Adults with mild to moderate-severe community acquired pneumonia (pneumonia severity index score ≤ 110).

Interventions

Patients who had substantially improved after three days' treatment with intravenous amoxicillin were randomly assigned to oral amoxicillin (n = 63) or placebo (n = 56) three times daily for five days.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the clinical success rate at day 10. Secondary outcome measures were the clinical success rate at day 28, symptom resolution, radiological success rates at days 10 and 28, and adverse events.

Results

Baseline characteristics were comparable, with the exception of symptom severity, which was worse in the three day treatment group. In the three day and eight day treatment groups the clinical success rate at day 10 was 93% for both (difference 0.1%, 95% confidence interval — 9% to 10%) and at day 28 was 90% compared with 88% (difference 2.0%, — 9% to 15%). Both groups had similar resolution of symptoms. Radiological success rates were 86% compared with 83% at day 10 (difference 3%, — 10% to 16%) and 86% compared with 79% at day 28 (difference 6%, — 7% to 20%). Six patients (11%) in the placebo group and 13 patients (21%) in the active treatment group reported adverse events (P = 0.1).

Conclusions

Discontinuing amoxicillin treatment after three days is not inferior to discontinuing it after eight days in adults admitted to hospital with mild to moderate-severe community acquired pneumonia who substantially improved after an initial three days' treatment.

### Amoxicillin for children with CAP: low-dose for three days… [^116oSAS1]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What is the optimal dosage of amoxicillin for managing community-acquired pneumonia in children. Bottom Line In children with CAP who are discharged from an emergency department or inpatient setting within 48 hours, a lower dose of oral amoxicillin is noninferior to a higher dose, and three days of treatment is noninferior to seven days in reducing the need for antibiotic re-treatment. Synopsis Although amoxicillin is widely recommended and used for the treatment of CAP in children, the optimal dose and treatment duration are uncertain. The investigators identified children six months and older with clinically diagnosed CAP who were being discharged from the emergency department or inpatient ward within 48 hours of admission.

Patients randomly received one of four amoxicillin regimens: 35 to 50 mg per kg per day for three days; 35 to 50 mg per kg per day for seven days; 70 to 90 mg per kg per day for three days; or 70 to 90 mg per kg per day for seven days. Masking occurred by using matched active or placebo suspension for days 4 through 7. Individuals masked to treatment group assignment assessed the primary outcome of clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory tract infection within 28 days of randomization. The noninferiority margin was predetermined to be a conservative 8% difference in outcome rates. Complete follow-up data were available for 97% of participants at 28 days. Using intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 12. 6% of children in the lower-dose groups vs.
12. 4% in the higher-dose groups, and in 12. 5% in the three-day treatment groups vs.
12. 5% in the seven-day treatment groups.

Both groups demonstrated noninferiority between dose and duration. In the subgroup of children with severe CAP, all groups demonstrated noninferiority. This POEM aligns with Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations. The Choosing Wisely Canada Cold Standard toolkit provides tools for reducing unnecessary antibiotics. Study design: Randomized controlled trial Funding source: Government Allocation: Concealed Setting: Emergency department.

### Experience developing national evidence-based clinical guidelines for childhood pneumonia in a low-income setting – making the GRADE? [^112KRtDs]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Moving from evidence to recommendations

The GRADE approach indicates that contextual factors including cost, local values and preferences, feasibility, undesired effects and benefits should be taken into account in making a recommendation based on evidence. There is no explicitly defined preferred method for taking these factors into account. Our pragmatic approach was to engage a national guideline development forum attended by a panel of 70 people from academic and policy backgrounds and routine clinical settings. After presenting and discussing the evidence we invited discussion on these contextual considerations (Figure 2) amongst panelists to inform development of recommendations rather than relying on research data alone. However, this forum did not include patient representatives as is recommended in GRADE, instead professional health workers were asked to consider this perspective. Such an approach is pragmatic but has clear limitations. However, gaining patients' perspectives, particularly when they are children, is a poorly developed area of practice and research in both low and high income settings alike. How this forum and deliberative process proceeded will be described in detail elsewhere, however here we illustrate how the evidence met with contrasting fates in the process of making recommendations.

Most notable was a strong recommendation against the proposal to adopt oral amoxicillin in place of or even as an alternative to benzyl penicillin/ampicillin for severe pneumonia. This was despite evidence from three large trials suggesting equivalence between the treatments and several additional factors apparently favoring oral amoxicillin including lower cost, more convenient twice daily dosing and reduction in the use of injections in children. In this case the panel essentially discounted moderate quality evidence and felt that such a change in policy should only be informed by locally-generated data. Such an absolute rejection of evidence gathered from trials involving almost 5000 children, something of a surprise to those summarizing it, was also observed for other guideline topics. In this particular case one could speculate that the absence of patient views, children who might receive either multiple injections or oral therapy, might have been an important omission.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly affecting older and medically vulnerable people. In the United Kingdom (UK), annual CAP incidence ranges between 22–80/10,000 persons. A broad range of pathogens cause CAP, including bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2.

Antibiotics and supportive care are the main treatments for bacterial CAP; most clinically treated cases do not have the causative pathogen identified, so most treatment is empirical. In the UK and Northern Europe, where most S. pneumoniae remain penicillin susceptible, narrow-spectrum beta-lactam treatment principally targeting S. pneumoniae, e.g. oral penicillin or ampicillin/amoxicillin, is often effective. However, concerns about other pathogens such as K. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase producing H. influenzae and S. aureus, which may not respond to such treatment, can lead to use of broader-spectrum beta-lactams, with macrolides/doxycycline also added to cover 'atypical' infections such as Mycoplasma.

Current guidelines recommend amoxicillin for low/moderate-severity CAP, ± a macrolide if atypical infection is suspected in moderate-severity cases, and co-amoxiclav + a macrolide for high-severity CAP. Broader-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for severe disease, to ensure less common, but more resistant, pathogens are treated, given the greater potential for adverse outcomes. However, concern about resistance and prior community treatment with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, can lead to use of co-amoxiclav and other broad-spectrum beta-lactams in non-severe CAP presenting to hospital. Use and over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), more side effects, and increased Clostridioides difficile infections. Understanding when narrower-spectrum antibiotics can safely be used could help mitigate AMR development.

While population-based studies and clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for CAP, none have directly compared the treatment outcomes between amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav, the two most commonly used antibiotics for CAP in the UK. We used electronic healthcare records (EHR) from a large UK teaching hospital group to investigate clinical outcomes in patients with CAP treated with either amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, to understand if narrow-spectrum antibiotics could be safely used more widely.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.
