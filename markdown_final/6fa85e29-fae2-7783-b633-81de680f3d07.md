## Question

which lab is appropriate to rule out HSV

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory test is appropriate to rule out herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context because the right test depends on whether there are active lesions, suspected CNS disease, or asymptomatic screening. Then, I should verify the performance characteristics of available modalities, including NAAT/PCR, culture, serology, and ancillary tests like Tzanck or DFA. Next, I will align choices with guideline-backed standards of care and explicitly state what does not rule out HSV. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, context-specific recommendation and note special populations and pitfalls, including false positives and the need for confirmatory testing when appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that change the test of choice: active mucocutaneous lesions (oral, genital, or other), suspected CNS disease (encephalitis or meningitis), asymptomatic screening or partner exposure, and special populations such as pregnancy, neonates, and people with HIV; I need to ensure I tailor the test to each scenario because no single assay reliably "rules out" HSV in all settings [^cdb5de6e] [^7b921762].

> For active mucocutaneous lesions, I should confirm that NAAT/PCR from the lesion is the preferred diagnostic method due to superior sensitivity and the ability to type HSV-1 versus HSV-2; culture is less sensitive, especially in recurrent disease, and declines as lesions heal, so a negative culture does not exclude infection, and I need to remember to unroof vesicles and swab the base vigorously to maximize yield [^cdb5de6e] [^7b921762] [^1d32627c].

> Wait, let me verify the role of serology here; I initially thought serology might help rule out HSV in this setting, but hold on, that's not correct — serology cannot distinguish current from past infection and should not be used to diagnose acute lesions, so a negative serology does not rule out active HSV when lesions are present, and I should avoid relying on it for this purpose [^cdb5de6e] [^7b921762].

> For suspected CNS HSV (encephalitis or meningitis), I need to check that CSF PCR is the gold standard with high sensitivity and specificity, and if the initial PCR is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, I should repeat CSF PCR in 3–7 days because early testing can be falsely negative; I should also consider serum HSV PCR only if disseminated disease is suspected, not to diagnose localized mucocutaneous disease [^7839748d] [^854b17ae] [^9c98acb9].

> For asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical symptoms and no active lesions, I should double-check that type-specific HSV-2 serology can be considered in selected higher-risk scenarios (e.g., partner with genital herpes, recurrent or atypical genital symptoms with negative lesion PCR/culture, or HIV), but I must counsel that false positives are common, especially at low index values, and confirmatory testing (e.g. Biokit or Western blot) is recommended when results are discordant or pretest probability is low; importantly, routine population screening is not recommended due to low positive predictive value and potential psychosocial harms [^8dbe3ab7] [^883f8ce5] [^f011e718] [^b1111357].

> Hold on, I should verify the performance caveats for serology; pooled estimates show high sensitivity but only moderate specificity for some HSV-2 EIAs, leading to a high false-positive rate in low-prevalence settings, and newer automated assays vary in performance, with some showing improved specificity but still requiring careful interpretation and, at times, confirmation; this reinforces why serology is not a screening tool for the general population [^15d92696] [^d273545e] [^f011e718].

> I need to ensure I explicitly state what does not rule out HSV: a negative Tzanck smear, a negative DFA, a negative culture (especially from older lesions), a negative lesion NAAT/PCR if sampling was inadequate or lesions are healed, and a negative serology in the window period or in the wrong clinical context; none of these reliably excludes HSV, so clinical judgment and, when appropriate, repeat or alternative testing are essential [^cdb5de6e] [^7b921762] [^9c98acb9].

> Let me consider special populations; in pregnancy, lesion-based virologic testing is preferred for diagnosis, and type-specific serology may be used selectively in late gestation to characterize first-episode disease, but routine serologic screening is not recommended; in neonates, I should confirm that blood and CSF PCR are indicated when HSV is suspected, given the high stakes and the limitations of clinical signs; in people with HIV, PCR from lesions is preferred and serology can be considered selectively with awareness of false positives and the need for confirmatory strategies [^20bc3202] [^f011e718] [^83ee1bad] [^c4a7ec60] [^a5b1e3a2].

> Next, I should review practical specimen and testing details; for lesion NAAT, use a swab in universal transport medium and vigorously sample the base of unroofed vesicles or ulcers, and coordinate with the lab for assay availability and typing; for CSF PCR, collect and send promptly, and if negative with high suspicion, repeat in 3–7 days; for serology, request only type-specific glycoprotein G–based assays and avoid IgM, which is not type-specific and not recommended for diagnosis [^7b921762] [^1d32627c] [^883f8ce5].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: there is no single laboratory test that universally rules out HSV in all contexts; the most appropriate test is context-dependent, with lesion NAAT/PCR as the preferred method when lesions are present, CSF PCR for CNS disease with repeat testing if negative and suspicion persists, and type-specific HSV-2 serology reserved for selected scenarios with careful interpretation and confirmatory testing when indicated; a negative result must be interpreted in light of timing, sampling quality, and pretest probability, and repeating or using an alternative modality is often necessary when clinical suspicion remains high [^cdb5de6e] [^7b921762] [^7839748d] [^f011e718].

---

The most appropriate lab test to rule out HSV depends on the clinical context: **PCR from lesions** is the preferred test for active mucocutaneous disease [^1d32627c], while **type-specific serology** is used when lesions are absent or PCR is negative but suspicion remains [^8dbe3ab7]. PCR is highly sensitive and specific [^9c98acb9], but a negative result does not exclude HSV if sampling is poor or lesions are healed [^9c98acb9]. Serology can detect past infection but cannot distinguish site or timing, and false positives occur, especially at low index values [^883f8ce5]; confirmatory testing is recommended in discordant cases [^883f8ce5]. Routine screening is not advised due to low predictive value and potential harms [^f011e718] [^b1111357].

## Laboratory tests for HSV detection

Several laboratory tests are available for HSV detection, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Test method** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PCR (polymerase chain reaction) | Detects HSV DNA from lesion swabs; highly sensitive and specific [^9c98acb9] | Preferred for active lesions; distinguishes HSV-1 from HSV-2 [^1d32627c] | False negatives if sampling is poor or lesions are healed [^9c98acb9] |
| Viral culture | Isolates HSV from lesion samples | Useful when PCR is unavailable; allows typing [^cdb5de6e] | Lower sensitivity, especially in recurrent or healing lesions [^9c98acb9] |
| Type-specific serology (IgG) | Detects HSV-1/2 antibodies; distinguishes type | Useful when lesions are absent or PCR is negative; indicates past exposure [^8dbe3ab7] | Cannot distinguish site or timing; false positives occur [^883f8ce5] |
| IgM serology | Detects acute infection | Limited utility; not recommended due to poor specificity and cross-reactivity [^883f8ce5] | Not type-specific; false positives common [^883f8ce5] |

---

## Appropriate laboratory test based on clinical scenario

### Active mucocutaneous lesions (oral or genital)

For active lesions, **PCR is the preferred test** because of its high sensitivity and specificity [^1d32627c] and its ability to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 [^1d32627c]. Viral culture is an alternative when PCR is unavailable, but its lower sensitivity limits its utility, particularly in recurrent or healing lesions [^9c98acb9].

---

### No active lesions or atypical presentation

In the absence of active lesions, **type-specific serology (IgG)** can help determine prior exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 [^8dbe3ab7]. However, it cannot distinguish between oral and genital infection or determine the timing of infection [^a73378f5]. False-positive results are common, especially at low index values, and confirmatory testing (e.g. Western blot) is recommended in discordant cases [^883f8ce5].

---

### Central nervous system (CNS) involvement (encephalitis, meningitis)

For CNS disease, **CSF PCR is the gold standard** [^7839748d], with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95% [^7839748d]. If the initial PCR is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat testing within 3–7 days is recommended [^854b17ae].

---

### Neonatal HSV infection

In neonates, **PCR testing of blood, CSF, and lesion swabs** is essential for diagnosis [^notfound]. Empiric antiviral therapy should be initiated promptly while awaiting results due to the high risk of morbidity and mortality [^35cfdbac].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **False negatives**: PCR or culture may be negative if lesions are healed or sampling is inadequate [^9c98acb9].
- **False positives**: Serology may yield false positives, particularly at low index values; confirmatory testing is advised [^883f8ce5].
- **Screening**: Routine serologic screening is not recommended due to low predictive value and potential psychosocial harms [^f011e718] [^b1111357].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended test** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Active lesions | PCR (preferred) or viral culture | PCR is more sensitive [^9c98acb9] |
| No active lesions | Type-specific serology (IgG) | Confirmatory testing if positive [^883f8ce5] |
| CNS involvement | CSF PCR | Repeat if initial test is negative [^854b17ae] |
| Neonatal infection | PCR (blood, CSF, lesions) | Empiric treatment while awaiting results [^35cfdbac] |

---

PCR from active lesions is the **preferred test** to rule out HSV, but a negative result does not exclude infection if sampling is poor or lesions are healed [^9c98acb9]. Serology is useful when lesions are absent, but results must be interpreted cautiously due to false positives and inability to distinguish site or timing [^883f8ce5].

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^9ff6943a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation. A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology is paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy. In this article we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common and often benign infection in humans; although it less commonly affects newborns, infection in this age group can be devastating. Newborns often present with nonspecific clinical findings, making timely and accurate diagnosis of infection critical. A wide variety of tests are available for detecting herpes simplex virus infection, but only a subset are useful and validated in the newborn population. The current review summarizes available diagnostic testing for neonatal disease, including discussing limitations, unmet needs, and emerging data on molecular testing methods.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^a1f09710]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

Methods

By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

Results

The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

Conclusions

The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Using the evidence base on genital herpes: optimising the use of diagnostic tests and information provision [^2fdcc64b]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

There have been several important advances in the range of available diagnostic tests for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in recent years; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is emerging in routine clinical use and the potential role of type specific serological tests is currently under debate. Several large trials of prophylactic vaccines, subsequently proved to be ineffective, have expanded knowledge of the transmission and epidemiology of HSV infection. This article discusses optimal application of recent research evidence to clinical care, structured around the key issues for patients and their partners. These include acquisition and transmission of genital HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, the natural history of genital herpes, and the role of partner notification.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and ~48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and ~12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and for potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

Importance

Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection. Vertical transmission of HSV can lead to fetal morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To assess the evidence on serologic screening and preventive interventions for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents to support the US Preventive Services Task Force for an updated recommendation statement.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through March 31, 2016. Surveillance for new evidence in targeted publications was conducted through October 31, 2016.

Study Selection

English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing screening with no screening in persons without past or current symptoms of genital herpes; studies evaluating accuracy and harms of serologic screening tests for HSV-2; RCTs assessing preventive interventions in asymptomatic persons seropositive for HSV-2.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality; pooled sensitivities and specificities of screening tests using a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis when at least 3 similar studies were available.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Accuracy of screening tests, benefits of screening, harms of screening, reduction in genital herpes outbreaks.

Results

A total of 17 studies (n = 9736 participants; range, 24–3290) in 19 publications were included. No RCTs compared screening with no screening. Most studies of the accuracy of screening tests were from populations with high HSV-2 prevalence (greater than 40% based on Western blot). Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the most commonly used test at the manufacturer's cutpoint were 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and 81% (95% CI, 68%-90%), respectively (10 studies; n = 6537). At higher cutpoints, pooled estimates were 95% (95% CI, 91%-97%) and 89% (95% CI, 82%-93%), respectively (7 studies; n = 5516). Use of this test at the manufacturer's cutpoint in a population of 100 000 with a prevalence of HSV-2 of 16% (the seroprevalence in US adults with unknown symptom status) would result in 15 840 true-positive results and 15 960 false-positive results (positive predictive value, 50%). Serologic screening for genital herpes was associated with psychosocial harms, including distress and anxiety related to positive test results. Four RCTs compared preventive medications with placebo, 2 in nonpregnant asymptomatic adults who were HSV-2 seropositive and 2 in HSV-2-serodiscordant couples. Results in both populations were heterogeneous and inconsistent.

Conclusions and Relevance

Serologic screening for genital herpes is associated with a high rate of false-positive test results and potential psychosocial harms. Evidence from RCTs does not establish whether preventive antiviral medication for asymptomatic HSV-2 infection has benefit.

### Herpes simplex virus keratitis: a treatment guideline-2014 [^497d84a5]. AAO (2014). Medium credibility.

Serology — diagnostic role in herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis: Serology has a limited role in diagnosis in most cases, and HSV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels may fluctuate such that a negative result does not absolutely rule out infection; immunoglobulin M (IgM) is found in primary HSV infection and seroconversion with IgG typically occurs 2–4 weeks after infection. Serology may be useful in children and young adults when testing shows HSV-specific IgM indicating primary infection or no antibodies (making HSV less likely), and may be useful in atypical disease. When ordering HSV serology, request both IgG and IgM for HSV-1 and HSV-2, and serial titers tested one month apart can be informative. Pros include "ease, widely available", whereas cons include "low specificity, low utility".

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^f011e718]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) serologic screening for genital herpes infection — For asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, do not routinely screen for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (Grade: D). This applies to routine screening of adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection; "asymptomatic" refers to persons without known past or current history of genital herpes and includes persons who may have unrecognized infection, and persons who are known to have genital herpes and are between outbreak occurrences are not considered to be asymptomatic for this recommendation. The recommendation does not apply to persons who present to clinicians requesting testing due to a history, signs, or symptoms suggestive of genital herpes or persons with HIV infection or other immunosuppressive disorders, and it is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation. Rationale notes that routine serologic screening is limited by the low predictive value of the widely available serologic screening tests and the expected high rate of false-positive results likely to occur with routine screening of asymptomatic persons in the US; antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons but in asymptomatic persons with serologic evidence of HSV, the rationale for antiviral treatment is unclear. Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI); infection is lifelong with currently no cure for HSV infection, and neonatal herpes infection is uncommon but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^cdb5de6e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Virologic tests — lesion testing and assay performance: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) assays are the most sensitive tests for detecting HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous lesions, and multiple FDA-cleared assays vary in sensitivity from 90.9% to 100% but are considered highly specific. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the test of choice for diagnosing HSV infection affecting the central nervous system and systemic infections, yet HSV PCR of the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital herpes infection except when concern exists for disseminated infection. In settings where viral culture is used, its sensitivity is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases rapidly as lesions heal; isolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine whether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to detect HSV by NAAT or culture, particularly with older or absent lesions, does not indicate absence of infection because shedding is intermittent, and random or blind genital swabs in the absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital HSV infection. Cytologic detection by Tzanck preparation should not be relied on, and direct immunofluorescence lacks sensitivity and is not recommended for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^8dbe3ab7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Genital herpes — type-specific herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) serology indications and screening guidance: Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays are useful for recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture result, for a clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and when a patient's partner has genital herpes; HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended, and patients at higher risk (e.g., those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) testing — method selection and lesion sampling: "Serology should not be used as a primary diagnostic test but may assist in determining a patient's exposure status to HSV-1/2". For antibody dynamics, "A 4-fold increase in anti-HSV IgG levels may suggest recent exposure", while "anti-HSV IgM reactivity is often absent at the time of lesion development, with IgM seroconversion occurring 1–2 weeks after infection", and commercial IgM assays "are not able to reliably distinguish between infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 and may be falsely positive". For active lesions, "NAAT is the most sensitive, specific, and rapid test… and can detect and distinguish HSV-1/-2", with collection guidance that "a viral culture transport swab should be vigorously rubbed over the base…; the vesicle should be unroofed", noting "Older, dried, and scabbed lesions are less likely to yield positive results". "Culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing are less sensitive than NAATs", and "HSV NAATs are now considered the gold standard to diagnose HSV central nervous system disease", while "CSF should not be cultured due to poor sensitivity".

HSV keratitis — diagnostic test indications — In cases of typical HSV epithelial keratitis (dendritic), clinical diagnosis by slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination is reliable and laboratory tests are usually not needed. Laboratory testing is also not useful in HSV stromal keratitis because a virus usually cannot be cultured. In atypical cases of HSV keratitis, however, laboratory tests may be indicated.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^c97eeff8]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF genital herpes — risk assessment and test scope notes that the USPSTF found no evidence of externally validated, reliable risk stratification tools to identify individuals more or less likely to have genital herpes; no studies have examined the screening accuracy of HSV-2 serologic tests in pregnant persons; confirmatory testing with the highly specific Western blot is not widely available, complicating population-wide screening; and because many new genital herpes cases may be caused by HSV-1, which is highly prevalent (~48%), and serologic tests cannot determine infection site in asymptomatic persons, serologic tests are not useful for routine screening for asymptomatic genital herpes from HSV-1 infection.

### Management of genital herpes in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletinacog practice bulletin, number 220 [^20bc3202]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in pregnancy — testing approach and performance: suspected genital herpes virus infections should be confirmed with type-specific laboratory testing, and retesting is not warranted in pregnant women with a history of laboratory-confirmed genital HSV; tests are divided into viral detection techniques and antibody detection techniques. Virologic tests are preferred for patients who present with genital vesicles, ulcers, or other mucocutaneous lesions; when collecting for HSV culture, vesicles should be unroofed and vesicular fluid collected; the sensitivity of viral culture is low, with primary lesions more likely than recurrent lesions to yield positive cultures (80% versus 40% of patients, respectively); a negative culture does not exclude infection, whereas a positive genital culture provides conclusive evidence; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detects viral DNA at low concentrations and, in one large study, PCR results were three to five times more likely to be positive than cultures. For patients with suggestive history but no active lesions or negative culture/PCR, type-specific serologic assays that distinguish HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies may be helpful; laboratory-based and point-of-care serologic tests detect antibodies to HSV-1 or HSV-2; antibodies develop during the first weeks after infection and persist indefinitely, so if suspicion is high and recent infection is suspected, repeat serologic testing may be indicated; detection of HSV-2 antibodies is virtually diagnostic of genital HSV, whereas detection of HSV-1 antibodies alone may represent orolabial infection or may indicate genital infection.

Central nervous system viral encephalitis — herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the virus most commonly identified with 90% HSV-1; for HSV encephalitis, the sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are > 95% while HSV is cultured from CSF in < 5% of cases, and rates of false negative HSV NAAT are the basis of recommendations to collect another CSF specimen 3–7 days later for repeat testing if HSV encephalitis continues to be suspected.

### HSV-2 tests for genital herpes can produce false… [^66e560b0]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

December 27, 2023 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is reminding health care providers and clinical laboratory staff about the potential for false reactive results in herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests for genital herpes. Recommendations The FDA recommends that health care providers and clinical laboratory staff do the following:

- Review the CDC guidelines before ordering HSV-2 serological testing to reduce the risk of false reactive results.
- Be aware that false reactive results can occur.
- Counsel patients about the limitations of available testing before obtaining HSV-2 serologic tests.
- Perform confirmatory testing for reactive results as provided in the test's labeling and in accordance with professional guidelines, such as Biokit or Western blot tests. Background According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be challenging.

When using the current HSV tests, the chance of a false result increases if a person:

- gets a blood test too soon after infection
- has a low risk of infection
- receives test results that are near the cutoff. FDA Actions We are providing this information to help educate health care providers and clinical laboratory staff and reduce the risk of false results. The FDA will continue to keep health care providers and clinical laboratory staff informed if new or additional information becomes available. Reporting Problems to the FDA The FDA encourages users to report false reactive results with HSV-2 serological tests.
- You can submit voluntary reports through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^75207c55]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale for serologic screening for genital herpes — The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found adequate evidence that currently available, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved serologic screening tests for HSV-2 have low specificity and a high false-positive rate for population-based screening, and there is also a lack of widely available confirmatory testing. Although serologic tests can detect the presence of HSV-1, seropositivity for HSV-1 does not indicate the site of infection, limiting usefulness of serologic testing to identify asymptomatic genital herpes. The USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the potential benefits of serologic screening for genital herpes in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, as no greater than small, and found adequate evidence to bound the potential harms as at least moderate. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits for population-based screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — diagnosis and serologic testing: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture are preferred methods for diagnosing mucocutaneous lesions potentially caused by HSV, with PCR the most sensitive method; HSV detected in genital lesions should be typed as HSV-1 or HSV-2, and recurrences are more frequent with HSV-2 than HSV-1. Type-specific serologic assays are commercially available and can be used to diagnose HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 for persons with HIV infection can be considered, but false positive enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.5), for which confirmatory testing with a second serologic test is recommended in the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Treatment Guidelines. A diagnosis of HSV-2 should be accompanied by counseling that includes discussion of transmission risk to sex partners, and screening for HSV-1 infection is not recommended.

### Herpes simplex virus encephalitis update [^ad926b46]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

HSV is the most frequently identified cause of infectious encephalitis, in Western countries. This article is an update on the topic based on a review of recent studies from 2017 to 2018.

Recent Findings

Acyclovir is still the first line treatment, and no new drugs are currently available for clinical use. The major considerations for HSV encephalitis are as follows: point one, clinical evaluation remains the most important factor, as though CSF HSV PCR has a good sensitivity, in a small proportion of patients the initial testing might be negative. MRI brain is the first line imaging test, and mesial temporal lobe involvement and other typical findings are important for diagnosis; point 2, there should be emphasis on sequela, short-term, and long-term outcomes, and not just case fatality rated in future studies and clinical management. Auto-immune encephalitis can be triggered by HSV, and should be considered in patients who are not responding to treatment; point 3, future studies should be on better management of sequela, and better treatment regimens including those targeting the immune response.

Summary

Autoimmune encephalitis is a clearly identified complication of HSV encephalitis. Inflammatory mechanisms are linked to the clinical presentation as well as severity and poor outcome. Initial corticosteroid therapy has to be evaluated in order to prevent complications.

### Is HSV serology useful for the management of first episode genital herpes? [^235e315a]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Background

First episode genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can be classified into three groups, primary genital herpes (no previous exposure to HSV), non-primary first episode (IgG antibody to HSV of the non-presenting type), and first episode with pre-existing IgG HSV antibodies. The use of IgM to classify first episode genital herpes has not been evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM antibodies for the diagnosis of first episode genital herpes, when compared with clinical diagnosis.

Methods

Patients with a first clinical episode of genital herpes were recruited. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies to HSV-2 using an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Equivocal results were resolved by western blot. HSV-1 IgG and IgM and HSV-2 IgM antibodies were detected using western blot.

Results

157 patients were recruited. 31 were excluded (missing data or no detectable antibodies and negative viral isolation). Therefore, 126 patients were included in the analysis. 23 (18.3%) had primary genital herpes, 34 (27.0%) non-primary first episode, and 69 (54.8%) had pre-existing genital herpes. The specificity and PPV of HSV IgM was 100%; the sensitivity was 79% and the NPV 85%.

Conclusion

IgM HSV serology may be useful in the management of some patients with first episode genital herpes and provide an indication of the source of infection. Drawbacks include the low sensitivity and NPV, lack of availability, IgM antibodies may occasionally be produced in response to recurrent infection and, finally, IgM antibodies may take up to 10 days to develop and last 7–10 days.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^15d92696]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF genital herpes — accuracy of serologic screening tests reports that serologic tests can detect antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV) typically 6 weeks to 3 months after infection, and that accuracy estimates for HSV-2 tests derived largely from higher-prevalence populations limit applicability to general primary care; in 10 studies (n = 6537) using a cutpoint of 1.1, HerpeSelect showed pooled sensitivity 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%) and pooled specificity 81% (95% CI, 68%-90%), while in 4 studies (n = 1512) Biokit showed pooled sensitivity 84% (95% CI, 73%-91%) and pooled specificity 95% (95% CI, 93%-97%); in the US population the positive predictive value may be as low as 75% for Biokit and as low as 50% for HerpeSelect, and estimated declines in HSV-2 seroprevalence since 2016 likely further limit predictive value.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^bc13d0c6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF genital herpes — harms of serologic screening indicates that using the widely available HSV-2 serologic test, nearly 1 out of every 2 diagnoses in the general US primary care population could be false; a previous USPSTF review estimated that in a population of 10 000 persons with a HSV-2 prevalence of 15%, screening could yield approximately 1585 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results, and at the current US estimated prevalence of 12%, true positives would likely further decrease while false positives would likely further increase; the USPSTF concluded there may be potential social and emotional harms and harms of unnecessary preventive antiviral treatment associated with false-positive diagnoses.

### Diagnosis and management of neonatal herpes simplex infection in the emergency department [^35cfdbac]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) is rare in neonates, with an estimated global incidence of 10 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal HSV is challenging to diagnose due to often vague signs and symptoms. Untreated, the mortality of some HSV subtypes exceeds 80%. Overtesting and overtreatment can result in prolonged hospitalizations and expose neonates to medication toxicity. In contrast, prompt evaluation and use of empiric antiviral therapy before the results of definitive testing can improve outcomes for infants with HSV. A wide degree of practice variation exists with respect to testing and treatment for neonatal HSV, and more research is required to safely risk-stratify this population. This review presents the epidemiology, risk factors, presenting features, and emergency department management of neonatal HSV infection.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^58ee24ca]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral culture is considered the gold standard for identifying HSV. When compared to viral culture, clinical diagnosis is only 55%–65% accurate. Unfortunately, culturing HSV is time-consuming and can take a week or longer when few infectious viruses are in the sample, and typically underestimates the number of patients whose disease is due to HSV. IFA has also been used to diagnose HSV and detects 33.3% more positive cases than viral culture. It also had sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 71.4%, positive predictive value of 63.6%, and negative predictive value of 81.8%. In other studies, the sensitivity of IFA in diagnosing HSV ranged from 77% to 86%. However, sample size and false-positive and false-negative results can unfavorably influence IFA.

HSK is a leading cause of corneal blindness. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is necessary to start the proper treatment and prevent further complications. Variation in different subtypes has posed a challenge to accurately diagnose HSK. This has also prevented a unified or specific test from properly diagnosing all of the different subtypes in a quick and effective manner.

Genital lesions — pediatric and pregnancy considerations for VZV and mpox are noted as follows: In children presenting with genital lesions, providers should not assume HSV as the only etiology and should consider potential atypical presentations of herpes zoster virus (VZV) or even mpox depending on clinical and family history or exposure. FDA-cleared VZV NAATs are limited, but several reference laboratories offer these tests or LDT NAATs. Pregnant patients with a history of genital herpes should be assessed for active lesions at the time of delivery but screening with molecular assays is not appropriate.

Diagnostic considerations — genital herpes evaluation: Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult, and if genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific virologic testing from the lesion by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or culture; type-specific serologic tests can aid diagnosis in the absence of genital lesions, and both test types should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1d32627c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Genital lesions — herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnostics and typing are described as follows: For suspected cases of HSV genital lesions, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the standard of care (SOC), and NAATs are the preferred diagnostic method because they provide typing to specify HSV type 1 or 2 and are the most sensitive; although direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) can assess specimen adequacy and is more specific than a Tzanck preparation, it is labor-intensive and less sensitive than NAAT. All specimens if positive should be typed to determine if they are HSV-1 or -2 because 12-month recurrence rates are more common with HSV-2 (90%) than HSV-1 (55%). Serology cannot distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 unless a type-specific glycoprotein G (gG)–based assay is performed, and point-of-care tests for HSV-2 may yield false positive results in low-likelihood populations and in pregnant patients testing is not recommended. Most laboratories performing NAATs usually offer HSV-1 and -2 as well as VZV from the same specimen; typically, a generic lesion swab in universal transport medium (UTM) that can be transported at room temperature is acceptable, and consultation with the laboratory before specimen collection is appropriate.

In recent proficiency testing of herpes simplex virus type-specific serologic evidence by the College of American Pathologists, commercially available herpes simplex virus antibody assays that were not glycoprotein-G based demonstrated high false-positive rates (14%-88%) for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies in sera that were positive for herpes simplex virus type-1 antibodies but negative for herpes simplex virus type-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus serologic testing should be performed with only glycoprotein-G-based tests.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are often life-threatening. Although sometimes difficult to diagnose, most infections can be treatable when found early. Infection with HSV should be kept high on the differential diagnosis of a febrile newborn younger than 1 month old, and treatment should be strongly considered for infants with certain risk factors, even before definitive culture or polymerase chain reaction results are available. The case presented here exemplifies the benefits of maintaining a high suspicion of and empirically treating for HSV in a 10-day-old febrile infant.

### Real-time polymerase chain reaction detection of herpes simplex virus in cerebrospinal fluid and cost savings from earlier hospital discharge [^d618bf17]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2005). Low credibility.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) can be a devastating illness and may be difficult to diagnose in those cases without a typical skin rash. As a result, physicians often rely on HSV polymerase chain reaction of cerebrospinal fluid to rule out HSV encephalitis. We developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for HSV using the SmartCycler II (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). End point dilution studies showed sensitivity comparable to that of two national reference laboratories that use LightCycler. In-house turnaround time was approximately 1.5 days versus approximately 5.2 days for sending the test to a reference laboratory. We hypothesized that the rapid availability of a negative test result would allow physicians to discharge appropriate patients earlier. Six months after implementation, clinical case analysis identified 12 pediatric patients who were discharged earlier based on more rapid test results, with a projected savings of approximately 55.2 hospital days throughout the first year. Actual length of stay for patients tested in-house was significantly less than that of historical controls and was projected to save approximately 70.2 hospital days in the first year. Including projected annual laboratory cost/test savings of approximately $11,000, a total savings of $38,000 to $43,000 was estimated for the first year of implementation, more than offsetting startup instrument and development cost.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^c2e2e811]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort, but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy. In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

Diagnosis of mucocutaneous and central nervous system (CNS) HSV in people with HIV — because clinical examination alone is insufficient, a laboratory diagnosis of all suspected HSV mucocutaneous infections should be pursued; HSV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred method for mucocutaneous lesions and is the most sensitive method of diagnosis, with viral culture sensitivity decreasing as lesions heal; testing for other sexually transmitted infections and infectious causes of ulcerative disease is also advised based on local endemicity and patient risk factors; for suspected CNS infection, PCR can be run directly on cerebral spinal fluid specimens and differentiation between CNS infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 should be pursued; HSV PCR of the blood should not be used to diagnose mucosal HSV unless there is concern for disseminated disease; and HSV detected in genital and oral lesions should be tested for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 for counseling on recurrence and transmission.

### Genital herpes complicating pregnancy [^44deca96]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, and 2% of women will acquire HSV during pregnancy. Remarkably, up to 90% of these women are undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms attributed to other vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis of genital herpes relies on laboratory confirmation with culture or polymerase chain reaction assay of genital lesions and type-specific glycoprotein G-based serologic testing. Neonatal herpes is the most severe complication of genital HSV infection and is caused by contact with infected genital secretions at the time of labor. Maternal acquisition of HSV in the third trimester of pregnancy carries the highest risk of neonatal transmission. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes, little change in the incidence or serious sequelae from this infection has occurred. As such, prevention of the initial neonatal infection is critically important. Obstetricians are in a unique position to prevent vertical HSV transmission by identifying women with genital lesions at the time of labor for cesarean delivery, prescribing antiviral suppressive therapy as appropriate, and avoiding unnecessary invasive intrapartum procedures in women with genital herpes. Enhanced prevention strategies include identification of women at risk for HSV acquisition during pregnancy by testing women and possibly their partners for HSV antibodies and providing counseling to prevent transmission to women in late pregnancy.

### Herpes simplex virus infections of the newborn [^7b413a84]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are fortunately quite rare in the neonatal population. Nevertheless, due to their life-threatening nature and the tremendous damage that surviving infants can incur, neonatal HSV is actually considered in a differential diagnosis relatively commonly. The availability of safe and effective antiviral therapy for the management of neonatal HSV also can accelerate a clinician's decision to consider HSV as the cause of a neonate's disease presentation, and then to obtain appropriate diagnostic studies and empirically institute antiviral treatment. Decisions on whether to continue antiviral therapy for a full course are predicated on the appropriate interpretation of these diagnostic studies as they subsequently are reported to the treating physician. For HSV-infected neonates, the duration of parenteral acyclovir therapy ranges from 14 to 21 days, depending on the extent of disease. Use of subsequent oral suppressive antiviral therapy is under investigation in randomized controlled trials, and at this time cannot be routinely recommended. This article will summarize the current state of neonatal HSV disease presentation, diagnosis, and management.

### Cost-effectiveness study of criteria for screening cerebrospinal fluid to determine the need for herpes simplex virus PCR testing [^27a3cfae]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

The absence of markers of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) commonly predicts the absence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) central nervous system (CNS) infection. Consequently, multiple authors have proposed and validated criteria for deferring HSV PCR testing of CSF in immunocompetent hosts with normal CSF white blood cell and protein levels (≤ 5 cells/mm³ and ≤ 50 mg/dl, respectively). Hosts are considered immunocompetent if they are ≥ 2 years old and have not had HIV or an organ transplant. Adoption of the criteria may erroneously exclude HSV-infected persons from a necessary diagnostic test or, alternatively, reduce the costs associated with HSV tests with minimal to no effect on patient care. Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach. A decision analysis model was developed to evaluate the adoption of criteria for screening HSV tests of CSF. Estimates of input parameter values combined available literature with a multiyear multisite review at two of the largest health care systems in the United States. Adoption of criteria to screen for HSV test need proved cost-effective when less than 1 in 200 patients deferred from testing truly had an HSV CNS infection. Similar to prior studies, none of the deferred cases had HSV encephalitis (n = 3120). Adoption of these criteria in the United States would save an estimated $127 million ($95 million to $158 million [± 25%]) annually. The model calculations remained robust to variation in test cost, prevalence of HSV infection, and random variation to study assumptions. The adoption of criteria to screen HSV PCR tests in CSF represents a cost-effective approach.

Recognized factors, such as mode of delivery, were not associated with HSV testing. The factors currently used by physicians in the decision to order this test do not best reflect the likelihood of HSV infection.

Virologic Tests

HSV NAAT assays are the most sensitive tests because they detect HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous lesions; these tests are increasingly available. Although multiple FDA-cleared assays exist for HSV detection, these tests vary in sensitivity from 90.9% to 100%; however, they are considered highly specific. PCR is also the test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and systemic infections (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). HSV PCR of the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital herpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for disseminated infection (e.g. hepatitis). In certain settings, viral culture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral culture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases rapidly as lesions begin to heal. Viral culture isolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine whether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to detect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence of older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not indicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding is intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in the absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital HSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result does not exclude the presence of HSV infection.

Cytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV infection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing genital lesions (i.e. Tzanck preparation) and therefore should not be relied on. Although a direct immunofluorescence assay using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is also available for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens, this assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended.

### Viral encephalitis [^f79685f3]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute viral encephalitis may be caused by a wide range of viruses but the most important is herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) because of its severity, especially if untreated, and its good response to specific treatment with acyclovir. The outcome of any CNS viral infection is dependent on both the immune status of the host and the virulence of the infecting virus. In evaluating a patient with suspected viral encephalitis there are 3 essential steps, namely the identification of a true parenchymal virus infection of the brain rather than a non-infective encephalopathy, the distinction of an infectious viral encephalitis from an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and then the determination, where possible, of the specific virus involved. In practice, the precise viral cause of the encephalitis may never be established. Analysis of the CSF for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been a significant advance in the diagnosis of HSE as this test has a very high sensitivity and specificity especially with appropriate sample timing. It is essential to commence early treatment with intravenous acyclovir in patients suspected of having HSE because of the remarkable safety and efficacy of this drug and the dangers of delaying potentially effective treatment of life threatening disease. This review outlines the general management approach in patients suspected of having viral encephalitis.

Diagnostic Considerations

Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited, recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation. If genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type-specific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture. Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes. Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which HSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests for HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV.

### Validation of laboratory screening criteria for herpes simplex virus testing of cerebrospinal fluid [^507c87c7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Most patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) central nervous system (CNS) infection have abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indices. Therefore, we implemented screening criteria based on CSF values and host immune status to guide testing. All CSF samples submitted for HSV PCR analysis from January 1999 through December 2004 were included in the study. Specimens from patients with human immunodeficiency virus, a history of transplants, an age of < 2 years, a CSF white blood cell count of > 5 cells/mm³, or a protein level of > 50 mg/dl were tested upon request. All other samples were rejected and frozen. To validate our screening criteria, rejected specimens were pooled and tested retrospectively. Electronic medical records were also reviewed. A total of 1,659 HSV PCR requests from 1,458 patients were screened. Of the 1,296 specimens (78.1%) accepted for testing, 1,213 were negative, 7 were positive for HSV type 1 (HSV-1), 26 were positive for HSV-2, and 50 had unavailable results. Sixteen requests were rejected because an alternative microbiologic diagnosis had been established. Of the 347 samples rejected based on criteria, 222 (64.0%) remained available for pooled testing. No HSV-1-positive samples were identified in the rejected specimens. Two rejected specimens tested positive for HSV-2 DNA, but both met acceptance criteria which had not been communicated to the laboratory. Few patients (7.8%) with rejected specimens were treated with acyclovir, which suggests a low clinical concern for HSV encephalitis. Acceptance criteria based on CSF parameters and host immune status saved time and cost and did not miss patients with HSV CNS infection. Communication between the clinician and the laboratory is imperative for a successful screening program.

### Sorting out the new HSV type specific antibody tests [^f0fa5598]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2001). Low credibility.

This review will delineate performance characteristics and limitations, as far as they are known, of the new glycoprotein G based, type specific HSV serologies. Several of these tests have been FDA approved in the United States for use in adults. With the departure of Gull/Meridian from the HSV serology market, it is important for clinicians to understand the sources and claims of the remaining type specific tests. Moreover, inaccurate tests using crude antigen preparations remain on the market. These tests are identified based on product insert information provided by company representatives.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) diagnosis in cutaneous and mucosal lesions — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performance and alternatives: Speed and sensitivity of diagnosis are maximized with the shell vial method after 24 hours and detection of HSV DNA by PCR is very sensitive and specific and is the gold-standard method; DNA PCR may be especially useful when assessing recurrent or late-presenting skin lesions because HSV DNA remains in healing lesions and scabs even though HSV can no longer be cultured; in neonatal HSV disease, PCR of mucosal and cutaneous sites has not been evaluated systematically and culture remains the standard of care; direct immunofluorescence can be performed on scraped cells but the sensitivity of this method may be less than 75%, with results usually available the same day.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^d273545e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are one of the most common and stigmatized infections of humankind, affecting more than 4 billion people around the world and more than 100 million Americans. Yet, most people do not know their infection status, and antibody testing is not recommended, partly due to poor test performance. Here, we compared the test performance of the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays with the gold-standard HSV western blot in 1,994 persons, including 1,017 persons with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection. Across all samples, the Bio-Rad and Roche assays had similar performance metrics with low sensitivity (< 85%) but high specificity (> 97%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and both high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. The DiaSorin assay had a higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and comparatively poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. The DiaSorin assay performed poorly at low-positive index values with 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielding false positive results. Based on an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin, meaning nearly one of every three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive. Further development in HSV antibody diagnostics is needed to provide appropriate patient care. IMPORTANCESerological screening for HSV infections is currently not recommended in part due to the poor performance metrics of widely used commercial HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays. Here, we compare three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays to the gold-standard western blot across nearly 2,000 samples. We find that not all commercially available HSV assays are created equal, with comparably low sensitivities for HSV-1 IgG across platforms and high false positivity rates for DiaSorin on HSV-2 IgG. This study is the first large-scale comparison of performance metrics for the Bio-Rad and Roche assays in over 10 years. Our study confirms that there remains room for improvement in HSV serological diagnostic testing-especially in regard to low sensitivities for HSV-1 IgG detection-and highlights that some previously less-studied assays may have better performance metrics than previously considered typical of commercially available HSV-2 IgG assays.

General serum screening in people with HIV — routine testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) IgG, cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG, and inflammatory biomarkers is not recommended; CMV IgG screening is generally not useful but may be considered if transfusion is contemplated in a person at low risk for CMV exposure; there are no data supporting inflammatory biomarkers for comorbidity risk assessment.

### Optimizing PCR positivity criterion for detection of herpes simplex virus DNA on skin and mucosa [^3b8f44cd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

In 1997, we developed a PCR assay for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA. Recently, we determined an optimal positivity criterion based on research specimens and a dilution study. We found that a cutoff of 50 HSV DNA copies/ml of swab specimen, a level 10-fold lower than our previous cutoff, minimizes misclassification.

### Type-specific identification of anogenital herpes simplex virus infections by use of a commercially available nucleic acid amplification test [^f6f2b4f2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes infections are among the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI), but diagnostic methods for genital herpes have not kept pace with the movement toward molecular testing. Here, we describe an FDA-approved molecular assay that identifies and types herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections for use in routine clinical settings. Paired samples from anogenital lesions were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV Q(x) (HSVQ(x)) system, HSV culture and, a laboratory-developed PCR assay. Family planning, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States served as recruitment sites. Sensitivity and specificity estimates, head-to-head comparisons, measures of agreement, and latent-class analyses were performed to provide robust estimates of performance. A total of 508 participants (174 men and 334 women) with anogenital lesions were included; 260 HSV-2 and 73 HSV-1 infections were identified. No differences in test performance based on gender, clinic type, location of the lesion, or type of lesion were observed. The sensitivity of HSV-2 detection ranged from 98.4 to 100% depending on the analytical approach, while the specificity ranged from 80.6%, compared to the less sensitive culture method, to 97.0%, compared to PCR. For HSV-1, the sensitivity and specificity ranges were 96.7 to 100% and 95.1 to 99.4%, respectively. This assay may improve our ability to accurately diagnose anogenital lesions due to herpes infection.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^dfef7a4c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2 that allows blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic. These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Herpes-STI treatment guidelines… [^8b061fa9]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

HSV PCR of the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital herpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for disseminated infection. In certain settings, viral culture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral culture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases rapidly as lesions begin to heal. Viral culture isolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine whether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to detect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence of older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not indicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding is intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in the absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital HSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result does not exclude the presence of HSV infection.

Type-Specific Serologic Tests Both type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV develop during the first weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. The majority of available, accurate type-specific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G2 and glycoprotein G1. Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific serologic assays should be requested. Therefore, in cases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat type-specific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time of acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay, often is falsely positive at low index values. Immunoglobulin M testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful because IgM tests are not type specific and might be positive during recurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes.

Therefore, HSV IgM testing is not recommended. Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^37e0c6aa]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster — diagnosis and laboratory testing — notes that zoster diagnosis might not be possible in the absence of rash and that in its classical manifestation the signs and symptoms are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash has appeared; more frequently, zoster is confused with the rash of herpes simplex virus (HSV), and the accuracy of diagnosis is lower for children and younger adults. Tzanck smears detect multinucleated giant cells but do not distinguish between infections with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and HSV; culture can take several days with false negative results, direct fluorescent antibody staining is rapid and is sensitive, and polymerase chain reaction can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively though not available in all settings, with modifications able to distinguish wild-type VZV from the Oka/Merck vaccine strain. In immunocompromised persons, distinguishing chickenpox from disseminated zoster might not be possible by examination or serology, and history of VZV exposure, a dermatomal rash onset, and results of VZV antibody testing at or before rash onset might help guide the diagnosis.

### Guidance on management of asymptomatic neonates born to women with active genital herpes lesions [^f52e864f]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the neonate is uncommon, but genital herpes infections in adults are very common. Thus, although treating an infant with neonatal herpes is a relatively rare occurrence, managing infants potentially exposed to HSV at the time of delivery occurs more frequently. The risk of transmitting HSV to an infant during delivery is determined in part by the mother's previous immunity to HSV. Women with primary genital HSV infections who are shedding HSV at delivery are 10 to 30 times more likely to transmit the virus to their newborn infants than are women with recurrent HSV infection who are shedding virus at delivery. With the availability of commercial serological tests that reliably can distinguish type-specific HSV antibodies, it is now possible to determine the type of maternal infection and, thus, further refine management of infants delivered to women who have active genital HSV lesions. The management algorithm presented herein uses both serological and virological studies to determine the risk of HSV transmission to the neonate who is delivered to a mother with active herpetic genital lesions and tailors management accordingly. The algorithm does not address the approach to asymptomatic neonates delivered to women with a history of genital herpes but no active lesions at delivery.

Pharyngitis — viral etiologies and targeted testing: Respiratory viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in both adult and pediatric populations, and it is unnecessary to define a specific etiology in viral pharyngitis because there is no pathogen‑directed therapy for these agents. However, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Epstein‑Barr virus (EBV) may also cause pharyngitis, and because of their epidemiologic and clinical implications, it is important to attempt to determine if an individual patient's infection is caused by one of these 3 agents.

Areas for consideration for further research

HSV-2 epidemiology

While most HSV-2 epidemiology research priorities identified in the workshop were addressed, some gaps remain as follows:

Some geographical areas have been neglected (eg, North Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe and Western Asia).
Causes of the high HSV-2 incidence among younger persons and some at-risk groups (eg,) especially in the African region.
Understanding the contribution of HSV-2 to GUD in LMICS.

HSV-2 diagnostics

All the research priorities for HSV-2 diagnostics in LMICs identified in the workshop were addressed. However, the research priority that emphasises the need to establish the optimal genital sampling techniques for direct diagnostic methods was only partly addressed since only six studies were published over the 20 years period, showing little repeatability and no definite conclusion. Furthermore, although four studies evaluated the performance of two different point-of-care assays for HSV-2 they reported poor accuracy.

Herpesvirus management and adjunct diagnostic testing — Intravenous acyclovir should be added to the patient's antimicrobial regimen for suspected or confirmed cutaneous or disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections; the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test is low particularly in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood for HSV and VZV might be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of disseminated infection in patients with unexplained skin lesions.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics of disseminated herpes simplex virus infection in neonates [^b2b30eab]. Hospital Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is the most fulminant type of neonatal HSV infection and has the highest mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for patient survival. We describe the clinical presentation, laboratory characteristics, and outcomes of neonates with disseminated HSV infection at our institution.

Methods

A retrospective review of electronic medical records from 2006 to 2013 was performed. Only neonates with disseminated HSV infection, confirmed by using polymerase chain reaction or viral culture results, were included.

Results

Twenty-two cases were identified; the age range was 1 to 14 days. The majority of patients did not have a maternal history of HSV or a history of maternal fever at delivery. Eleven of the patients were delivered by cesarean delivery, and 3 of these patients did not have prolonged rupture of membranes. Neonatal fever, the most common historical characteristic, was present in only one-half of the patients. Pneumonia and respiratory distress were present in one-half of the patients. Serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated in most, but not all, patients. The blood HSV polymerase chain reaction was positive in all patients tested. Of the 22 study patients, 16 survived and 6 died. The majority of the patients who died had respiratory disease and a delay in the initiation of acyclovir therapy.

Conclusions

Disseminated HSV infection in neonates can be challenging to diagnose and is associated with high mortality. Clinicians must strongly consider this diagnosis, test the blood for HSV polymerase chain reaction, and initiate early treatment in the appropriate clinical scenarios.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^ff6e02f4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The decreased Ct value observed in serum versus WB is likely partially due to the 1:1 dilution performed for the WB specimens before testing in order to mitigate assay inhibition. Of note, serum has the additional benefits of not requiring dilution or any pre-analytical steps prior to using the sample in the modified Simplexa assay as well as being a more commonly collected specimen type. After establishing that serum was the optimal specimen type in the blood compartments tested, we carried out both a LOD analysis and a clinical comparison and determined that the assay performance in serum was comparable to that of WB, which we had previously established.

This study used previous HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 lesion positivity as eligibility criteria for enrollment of residual specimens, hypothesizing that specimens from these patients should have a higher positivity rate for detection of the virus than that found in random serum specimens. Interestingly, this was the finding in this study, which showed an overall HSV positivity rate of 10.5% (6.1% for HSV-1 and 4.4% for HSV-2). This rate is much higher than the expected HSV positivity rate in the general population, which has been shown to be under 1% for molecular detection when randomly enrolled for various specimen sources. Due to this selection criteria, we can also deduce that disseminated HSV may be more common in patients presenting with lesions than previously considered since most patients in this cohort did not have HSV testing ordered for a blood specimen.

Does a negative LP rule-out HSE?

Aciclovir should not be stopped if the CSF is negative on PCR for HSV when other features are consistent with HSE, particularly CSF cell count, MRI findings or EEG. Note that HSV PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test (94 and 96%, respectively), except during the first 24 h of the disease, when as many as 10% of HSE CSF samples can be falsely negative. If suspicion of HSE remains after an initial negative CSF PCR, a second LP and HSV PCR should be performed before day 4 of treatment. In addition, if aciclovir treatment is started some days before CSF is obtained for analysis, the PCR result may be falsely negative; HSV PCR results are unlikely to be affected by < 48 h of aciclovir therapy and may still be informative up to a week after therapy is started.

### Evaluation of a new point-of-care serologic assay for herpes simplex virus type 2 infection [^3c615f13]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Because presentation is often atypical or subclinical, serologic testing is necessary for diagnosis, treatment, and counseling. In an urban clinic that specializes in the treatment of sexually transmitted disease, a new point-of-care rapid serologic test was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot for the detection of herpes simplex virus type 2. With use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay index cutoff value of 1.1, the rapid test was found to have a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 92%, and a negative predictive value of 99%. Increasing the cutoff index value to 3.5 increased the test sensitivity to 100%.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^a5b1e3a2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Serologic testing and counseling in people with HIV — type-specific serum and point-of-care immunoglobulin G (IgG) serologic assays can be used to diagnose HSV-2 in asymptomatic individuals or those with atypical lesions, and type-specific serologic screening for HSV-2 can be considered for people with HIV with specific risk histories; early infection can yield false negative results, so repeat testing 12 weeks following suspected exposure is warranted; false positive HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay results occur particularly at low index values (1.1–3.0), and in such situations confirmatory testing with a second serologic test using a different antigen is recommended; serologic screening for HSV-1 is not useful due to high prevalence, and HSV-1 or HSV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) is not useful because IgM testing is not type-specific; a diagnosis of genital herpes should be accompanied by counseling that discusses risk of transmission to sex partners.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 and heterosexual spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection in developing countries: hypotheses and research priorities [^c5461ce4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection is almost always sexually transmitted, and causes genital ulceration. Significant progress in our understanding of HSV infection has occurred over the last decade, in part related to the development of accurate and sensitive laboratory tests to study HSV-2. The application of PCR and type-specific serology to individual cases and in population-based studies has enabled the identification of a potentially important role for HSV-2 infection as a cofactor in the sexual transmission of HIV. This is a particular issue in developing countries. This review describes the epidemiology of HSV-2 infection in the HIV era, the hypotheses regarding HSV-HIV interactions, and research priorities for the developing world.

### Screening for genital herpes | Guidelines-JAMA network… [^b4f11651]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Jin J. Screening for Genital Herpes. JAMA. 2023; 329:

520. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.0454 The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently published recommendations on screening for genital herpes infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents, including pregnant individuals. Antiviral medications can be used to treat or prevent painful outbreaks of genital herpes, but there is no cure for the infection. Because herpes simplex virus remains in the body for life after initial infection, outbreaks can recur without new exposure to the virus, and sometimes can be triggered by illness or stress. Screening for genital herpes can be done using a blood test that identifies antibodies against the virus. These antibodies are made by the immune system in response to infection and remain in the bloodstream even when there is no active outbreak.

This USPSTF recommendation applies to adults and adolescents, including pregnant individuals, who do not have symptoms of genital herpes, a known history of genital herpes infection or HIV infection, or other immune system problems. Potential benefits of screening for genital herpes infection are small. Unlike some other infections, earlier detection and treatment of genital herpes does not change the long-term course of the infection. The benefit of treatment with antiviral medications when individuals have no symptoms is unclear. The potential harms of screening for genital herpes are related to a high chance of false-positive results. Up to 1 in 2 positive results may be wrong, which may result in unnecessary treatment, anxiety, and disruption of relationships. Given current evidence, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of screening for genital herpes in asymptomatic adults and adolescents outweigh the potential benefits.

This recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^63cd6bcc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are one of the most common and stigmatized infections of humankind, affecting more than 4 billion people around the world and more than 100 million Americans. Yet, most people do not know their infection status, and antibody testing is not recommended, partly due to poor test performance. Here, we compared the test performance of the Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays with the gold-standard HSV western blot in 1,994 persons, including 1,017 persons with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection. Across all samples, the Bio-Rad and Roche assays had similar performance metrics with low sensitivity (< 85%) but high specificity (> 97%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and both high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. The DiaSorin assay had a higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for detecting HSV-1 IgG and comparatively poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for detecting HSV-2 IgG. The DiaSorin assay performed poorly at low-positive index values with 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielding false positive results. Based on an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin, meaning nearly one of every three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive. Further development in HSV antibody diagnostics is needed to provide appropriate patient care.

IMPORTANCE

Serological screening for HSV infections is currently not recommended in part due to the poor performance metrics of widely used commercial HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays. Here, we compare three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG assays to the gold-standard western blot across nearly 2,000 samples. We find that not all commercially available HSV assays are created equal, with comparably low sensitivities for HSV-1 IgG across platforms and high false positivity rates for DiaSorin on HSV-2 IgG. This study is the first large-scale comparison of performance metrics for the Bio-Rad and Roche assays in over 10 years. Our study confirms that there remains room for improvement in HSV serological diagnostic testing — especially in regard to low sensitivities for HSV-1 IgG detection — and highlights that some previously less-studied assays may have better performance metrics than previously considered typical of commercially available HSV-2 IgG assays.

### National survey of diagnostic services for genital herpes [^ccd6bc47]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the provision of diagnostic services for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in the United Kingdom.

Methods

National survey of laboratories providing diagnostic services for genital herpes.

Results

Completed questionnaires were returned from 25/32 (78%) laboratories participating in the Clinical Virology Network, including seven in London, 12 in the rest of England, one in Wales, four in Scotland, and one in Northern Ireland. Virus culture was the diagnostic method of choice in 20/25 (80%) laboratories; 5/25 (20%) routinely used HSV DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HSV PCR for DNA detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was available in 17/25 (68%) laboratories. Typing of isolates (HSV-1 or HSV-2) was performed routinely in 22/25 (88%) laboratories. Only 2/25 (8%) laboratories offered HSV type specific serology, although an additional 12/25 (48%) referred requests elsewhere. Consistent with this finding, the number of HSV type specific antibody tests referred to the Health Protection Agency increased by nearly fivefold between 1997 and 2003.

Conclusions

Virus culture remains the preferred diagnostic method for genital herpes, despite evidence indicating that its sensitivity is suboptimal compared to PCR. As HSV PCR is widely available for testing of CSF, it is recommended that clinicians and virologists discuss ways to implement PCR testing of genital swabs, thus enabling greater diagnostic accuracy. A call is made for studies to assess the use of HSV type specific serology in genitourinary medicine (GUM) settings, now that rapid and validated assays have become available and guidelines have been issues to provide recommendations on their use.

Asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes — when counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection; episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection; for patients with serologic evidence of HSV-2 without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences; among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied; and because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

### Herpes simplex virus type 2 serological testing and psychosocial harm: a systematic review [^84e60794]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 in persons without a history of genital herpes is not recommended, partly because of concerns that an HSV-2 diagnosis would lead to negative psychosocial sequelae. This review aimed to examine the evidence regarding the psychosocial effects of HSV-2 serological testing.

Methods

Eight electronic databases were searched for empirical studies indexed before March 2010. Abstracts from relevant conferences were reviewed and senior authors contacted to find unpublished materials. Eligible studies examined participants without a history of genital herpes who underwent HSV-2 serological testing and reported data from at least one quantitative or qualitative psychosocial assessment conducted after receiving HSV results.

Results

Of nine studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, seven reported that HSV-2 diagnosis by serological test did not have a persistent negative impact on 309 participants' mental health or sexual attitude and satisfaction. Two studies reported a negative impact of testing; one found that five HSV-2-seropositive college students had increased distress 3 months post-testing compared with HSV-2-negative individuals, and the other found self-reports of sexual undesirability up to 1 year after diagnosis in some people. The perceived severity of a genital herpes diagnosis was moderately severe for participants before testing; however, post-testing, the reported severity of a herpes diagnosis was lower among those testing HSV-2 positive.

Conclusions

HSV-2 diagnosis by type-specific serological testing did not result in long-term psychosocial harm in most persons without an identified history of genital herpes. Concerns about sustained emotional impact should not deter clinicians from offering HSV-2 serological testing to appropriate patients.

### Guidelines for laboratory monitoring of treatment of persistent virus infections [^66947d0e]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

A growing number of antiviral agents are available for treatment of persistent viral infections. This has increased the requirement for virology laboratories to undertake sophisticated assays for monitoring the efficacy of treatment and identifying drug failure at an early stage. The consensus guidelines within this article address the laboratory requirements for monitoring treatment of the herpes viruses, HIV-1, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.

Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody. However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic. Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g. those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with ≥ 10 lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^883f8ce5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Type-specific serologic tests — accuracy, confirmation, and interpretation: Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific serologic assays should be requested. The sensitivity of glycoprotein G type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from 80% to 98%, and in suspected recent acquisition, repeat type-specific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time of acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is falsely positive at low index values (1.1–3.0); one study reported an overall specificity of 57.4%, with a specificity of 39.8% for index values of 1.1–2.9. Because of the poor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, particularly when index values are < 3.0, a confirmatory test (Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be performed before test interpretation, and the HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for confirmation. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be counseled about the limitations of available testing and that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin M testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful; therefore, HSV IgM testing is not recommended. Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection, whereas HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection; in this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided.

### Diagnostic accuracy of rapid one-step PCR assays for detection of herpes simplex virus-1 and-2 in cerebrospinal fluid: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bb930db2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and -2 (HSV1/2) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is important for patient management.

Objectives

Summarize the diagnostic accuracy of commercial rapid sample-to-answer PCR assays (results in < 90 minutes, without a separate nucleic acid extraction step) for HSV1/2 detection in CSF.

Data Sources

Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL) and five conference abstract datasets from January 2012 to March 2022.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Eligible diagnostic accuracy studies provided sufficient data for the construction of a standard diagnostic accuracy two-by-two table.

Participants

Patients with suspected meningitis and/or encephalitis.

Tests

FilmArray Meningitis-Encephalitis Panel and Simplexa HSV 1&2 Direct Kit PCR.

Reference Standard

Real-time PCR assay.

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Two investigators independently extracted data, rated risk of bias, and assessed quality using QUADAS-2. METHODS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Accuracy estimates were pooled using Bayesian random effects models.

Results

Thirty-one studies were included (27 FilmArray; 4 Simplexa), comprising 9924 samples, with 95 HSV-1 and 247 HSV-2 infections. Pooled FilmArray sensitivities were 84.3% (95% credible interval, 72.3–93.0) and 92.9% (95% credible interval (CrI), 82.0–98.5) for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively; specificities were 99.8% (95% CrI, 99.6–99.9) and 99.9% (95% CrI, 99.9–100). Pooled Simplexa sensitivities were 97.1% (95% CrI, 88.1–99.6) and 97.9% (95% CrI, 89.6–99.9), respectively; specificities were 98.9% (95% CrI, 96.8–99.7) and 98.9% (95% CrI, 97.1–99.7). Pooled FilmArray sensitivities favoured industry-sponsored studies by 10.0 and 13.0 percentage points for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Incomplete reporting frequently led to unclear risk of bias. Several FilmArray studies did not fully report true negative data leading to their exclusion.

Conclusions

Our results suggest Simplexa is accurate for HSV1/2 detection in CSF. Moderate FilmArray sensitivity for HSV-1 suggests additional testing and/or repeat CSF sampling is required for suspected HSV encephalitis when the HSV-1 result is negative. Low prevalence of HSV-1 infections limited summary estimates' precision. Underreporting of covariates limited exploration of heterogeneity.

### An evidence based approach to testing for antibody to herpes simplex virus type 2 [^947d278c]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish whether a simple risk scoring system, based on limited information, can reflect the variation in HSV-2 prevalence in a population, and whether a common system can be used across settings. To establish whether knowledge of a patient's score can aid the interpretation of the result from one of the commercial type specific assays.

Methods

Four previous cross sectional studies are considered, with HSV-2 antibody results by western blot or type specific ELISA tests. The clinical settings were a blood donor centre (1359 participants) and STD clinic (808 participants), London, United Kingdom, an antenatal clinic, Sydney, Australia (2317 participants), and a family medical centre, Seattle, United States (478 participants). We determined the factors associated with HSV-2 prevalence, the similarity of associations across settings, and the variation in HSV-2 prevalence by risk score.

Results

A simple scoring captured much variation in HSV-2 prevalence in each population-for example, for London blood donors, scoring based on sex, age, and number of lifetime partners, prevalence varied from 0.7% (95% CI 0.1 to 2.0) to 47.3% (37.9 to 56.6) across five risk groups. For number of lifetime partners, and sex, the association with HSV-2 varied significantly across studies.

Conclusions

A scoring system can aid test interpretation-for example, in London blood donors the post-test probability of infection following a positive result varies from around 25% to 98% across risk groups for a typical type specific assay. Further work could address whether this theoretical benefit can be realised in practice. A common risk scoring probably could not be used across settings.

Asymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

HSV-1 Genital Herpes

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:

Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.

For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

Management of Sex Partners

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^fa344db0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Managing treatment failure in mucocutaneous HSV disease in people with HIV: Treatment failure due to acyclovir resistance should be suspected if herpes-related lesions do not begin to resolve within 7 to 10 days after initiation of anti-HSV therapy, with risk factors including prolonged use of acyclovir, suboptimal acyclovir dosing, immunosuppression, and ongoing HSV replication. In people with suspected acyclovir-resistant HSV, viral culture of the lesion should be performed, and if virus is isolated, susceptibility testing should then be conducted to confirm drug resistance (AIII). Phenotypic testing of viral isolates has been the gold-standard method for assessing HSV resistance; genotypic testing is not widely available but may be available at the University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology.
