## Question

What is management of sodium level of 124 in end stage renal dialysis patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of a serum sodium of 124 mEq/L in an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient on dialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification by symptoms and chronicity. Then, I should verify the safest dialysis modality and how to modify the prescription to avoid rapid sodium shifts. Next, I will consider whether hypertonic saline is ever indicated and, if so, how to mitigate overcorrection. After that, I need to check for reversible contributors and outline monitoring cadence. Finally, I will integrate prognosis and long-term strategies, including dialysate sodium individualization and dietary counseling, and I will double-check special scenarios like peritoneal dialysis and CRRT adjustments.

> Let me first confirm the risk framework. A sodium of 124 mEq/L is severe hyponatremia, and in ESRD the key risks are twofold: under-treatment can allow cerebral edema if acute, while overcorrection can precipitate osmotic demyelination if chronic, so I need to ask about symptom severity and time course before deciding on tempo of correction [^90dd948b] [^1438df03]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even mild chronic hyponatremia correlates with cognitive impairment and falls, so I should still treat thoughtfully even if the patient seems "stable" [^90dd948b].

> Next, I should review symptoms and chronicity. Severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise warrant emergent therapy, whereas mild symptoms like nausea, headache, or confusion in a chronic context call for controlled correction; if the onset is unclear, I should assume chronic to avoid ODS risk and plan a slower correction cadence [^90dd948b] [^7cdd2350]. Wait, let me verify the correction limits: for high-risk patients, keep total rise ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours; for low-risk patients, ≤ 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours, with even tighter goals in the first few hours when using hypertonic therapy [^939d0f17] [^7cdd2350].

> I will now examine the dialysis modality. Conventional hemodialysis can correct sodium too quickly via diffusive equilibration with dialysate, risking ODS; therefore, I should preferentially use continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or carefully modified intermittent HD to control the rate of sodium rise, especially in chronic severe hyponatremia [^a80b7772] [^908c4563]. Let me think about the practical levers: for CRRT, I can lower the sodium concentration of replacement fluid and/or dialysate and reduce the effective dose to cap the hourly sodium increase; for intermittent HD, I can use a lower dialysate sodium (for example, 130–135 mEq/L), reduce blood flow, shorten session time, and avoid sodium profiling to blunt rapid shifts [^a80b7772] [^be6f0b63].

> Hold on, I should verify the quantitative targets. A reasonable CRRT approach is to aim for a net sodium rise around 2–4 mEq/L per session initially, with frequent checks and stepwise adjustments; for intermittent HD, limiting the intradialytic rise to about 2–3 mEq/L per session with close monitoring is prudent in chronic severe hyponatremia, recognizing that kinetics depend on dialysate sodium, blood flow, time, and ultrafiltration volume [^a80b7772] [^be6f0b63]. I need to ensure I am not overpromising a fixed rate; these are pragmatic guardrails rather than universal constants, so serial sodium measurements are essential to avoid overshoot [^a80b7772].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly symptomatic with seizures or coma? In that scenario, I should not withhold hypertonic saline solely due to ESRD; instead, I can give small, carefully titrated 3% saline boluses (for example, 100 mL over 10 minutes, repeatable once or twice) while planning immediate transition to CRRT or modified HD to cap further rises and prevent overcorrection, with a goal of 4–6 mEq/L early rise to reverse encephalopathy [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21]. I should double-check that I am prepared to relower sodium if the trajectory exceeds safe limits using desmopressin and hypotonic fluid as rescue strategies [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3].

> Next, I should review reversible contributors and stop harmful inputs. I need to check for sources of free water excess (polydipsia, hypotonic fluids), hyperglycemia causing translocational hyponatremia, and medications that impair free water excretion or provoke SIADH; concurrently, I should discontinue nonessential fluids and offending drugs while confirming the sodium assay and sample integrity to avoid pseudohyponatremia or lab error [^cd7b65ae] [^a01b2788]. Let me reconsider: in ESRD, impaired free water clearance is common, so even modest water intake can worsen hyponatremia; counseling on fluid restriction is reasonable, though adherence is challenging and must be individualized [^f9318441].

> I need to ensure a tight monitoring plan. During active correction, sodium should be checked every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable; urine output and overall fluid balance should be tracked, and any sudden increase in urine output should trigger a sodium check because aquaresis can drive abrupt overcorrection even when the prescribed therapy seems modest [^5f4beb21]. Hold on, I should verify that I have a low threshold to intervene: if the rise exceeds 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours, I should administer desmopressin and consider electrolyte-free water to safely relower sodium and mitigate ODS risk [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3].

> Let me consider long-term strategies once the acute phase passes. Individualizing dialysate sodium to the patient's "sodium setpoint" may reduce intradialytic sodium loading and interdialytic weight gain, though evidence is mixed and must be balanced against hypotension risk; in patients prone to hyponatremia, a slightly lower dialysate sodium may be reasonable with careful hemodynamic monitoring [^e7a71602] [^64617f4c]. I should confirm that dietary sodium counseling remains important for blood pressure and volume control, but in sodium-wasting states I must avoid overly aggressive restriction; in those cases, a more permissive sodium intake with adjusted dialysis removal may be safer [^a44601f1] [^ac7ff099].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In peritoneal dialysis, hyponatremia is less common but can occur with excessive water intake or potassium depletion; ultra-low sodium PD solutions exist and may help with fluid overload without provoking hyponatremia, but I should confirm that any sodium changes are gradual and that we address solute intake and potassium balance [^3f21b1bb]. For CRRT, I should double-check replacement fluid composition and consider custom mixing or commercial low-sodium solutions to precisely control the correction rate, using bedside calculations to avoid errors [^908c4563].

> Next, I should review prognosis to contextualize urgency. Lower predialysis sodium correlates with higher all-cause mortality in hemodialysis cohorts, and hyponatremia is also linked to infection-related hospitalizations; however, observational data cannot prove causality, so I should treat the patient, not just the number, while acknowledging that persistent hyponatremia signals high risk and merits diligent evaluation and follow-up [^5b50182c] [^a2ba015e] [^7b54faa1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that correcting sodium alone improves survival; I should correct that: while correction is necessary for acute safety, mortality associations likely reflect underlying disease burden, so comprehensive care remains essential [^5b50182c] [^7b54faa1].

> Putting this together, my prioritized plan is as follows: assess symptoms and chronicity immediately; if severely symptomatic, give small 3% saline boluses with rapid transition to CRRT or modified HD to cap correction; if moderately symptomatic or chronic, favor CRRT or carefully adjusted intermittent HD targeting ≤ 8 mEq/L rise in 24 hours; identify and stop reversible drivers; monitor sodium every 2–4 hours early on; and individualize dialysate sodium and counsel on fluids long term, with a written rescue protocol for overcorrection using desmopressin and hypotonic fluid as needed [^90dd948b] [^a80b7772] [^7cdd2350] [^d71ddf22]. Hold on, I should verify that the team agrees on stop criteria and that nursing has clear triggers to call for urgent sodium checks; this is where errors happen, so explicit thresholds and a rehearsed rescue plan are critical to safety [^5f4beb21].

For a dialysis patient with sodium 124 mEq/L, **individualize dialysate sodium** to 135–138 mEq/L and avoid rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination [^e7a71602] [^be6f0b63]. Use **CRRT or modified HD** (lower dialysate sodium, reduced blood flow, shorter sessions) to limit sodium rise to ≤ 8 mEq/L per 24 hours, and monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially [^a80b7772] [^939d0f17]. Reserve **hypertonic saline** for severe neurologic symptoms only, and treat underlying causes such as hyperglycemia, SIADH, or medication effects [^90dd948b]. If overcorrection occurs, use desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3].

## Clinical significance of hyponatremia in dialysis patients

Hyponatremia is common in dialysis patients and is associated with **increased mortality**, cardiovascular events, and neurologic complications [^7b54faa1] [^5b50182c]. Even mild hyponatremia correlates with higher risks of infection, falls, and cognitive impairment, underscoring the need for careful management [^a2ba015e] [^90dd948b].

---

## Risks associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia (> 8 mEq/L in 24 hours) can cause **osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)** — a potentially irreversible neurologic injury — so correction must be slow and controlled [^7cdd2350] [^90dd948b].

---

## Recommended management strategies

### Dialysis prescription modifications

- **Individualize dialysate sodium**: Tailor dialysate sodium to the patient's baseline sodium to avoid rapid shifts; typical targets are 135–138 mEq/L, adjusted to the patient's sodium setpoint [^e7a71602] [^64617f4c].

- **Reduce blood flow and session time**: Lower blood flow (e.g. 50 mL/min) and shorten sessions to limit sodium correction to ≤ 2 mEq/L per session [^6829dc6e].

- **Avoid sodium profiling**: Do not use sodium profiling, which can cause rapid early sodium shifts [^be6f0b63].

---

### Use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)

CRRT allows precise control of sodium correction via replacement fluid composition and flow rates; it is **preferred for severe hyponatremia** or when rapid correction must be avoided [^a80b7772] [^908c4563].

---

### Monitoring and safety measures

- **Frequent sodium monitoring**: Check serum sodium every 2–4 hours during active correction, then daily once stable.

- **Neurologic assessment**: Monitor for seizures, confusion, or focal deficits suggesting ODS [^notfound].

- **Rescue strategies**: If overcorrection occurs, use desmopressin and hypotonic fluids to safely relower sodium [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3].

---

## Role of hypertonic saline

Hypertonic saline is **generally avoided** in dialysis patients due to the risk of rapid overcorrection; reserve it for severe neurologic symptoms (e.g. seizures, coma) and use small boluses (e.g. 100 mL of 3% saline) with close monitoring [^9b935b38] [^5f4beb21].

---

## Addressing underlying causes

Identify and treat contributors such as **hyperglycemia**, **SIADH**, or medications (e.g. thiazides, SSRIs) to prevent recurrence [^90dd948b] [^9c2d486a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Intervention** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Dialysate sodium | Individualize to 135–138 mEq/L |
| Blood flow and session time | Reduce to limit correction to ≤ 2 mEq/L/session |
| CRRT | Preferred for severe or high-risk cases |
| Hypertonic saline | Reserve for severe neurologic symptoms |
| Monitoring | Every 2–4 hours during correction |
| Rescue for overcorrection | Desmopressin and hypotonic fluids |
| Underlying causes | Identify and treat |

---

Managing hyponatremia in dialysis patients requires **slow, controlled correction** with individualized dialysate sodium, CRRT when appropriate, and vigilant monitoring to avoid ODS; hypertonic saline is reserved for emergencies, and underlying causes must be addressed to prevent recurrence.

### A proposed approach to the dialysis prescription in severely hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease [^6829dc6e]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with renal failure and severe hyponatremia present a therapeutic dilemma. Conventional hemodialysis is necessary to correct blood chemistries and volume overload, yet it may raise serum sodium (Na) too quickly, potentially resulting in osmotic demyelination syndrome. We present the case of a patient who presented with renal failure requiring dialysis and also with a serum Na of 112 mEq/l. Using a dialysate Na concentration of 130 mEq/l and by limiting the blood flow to 50 ml/minute, we were able to raise her serum Na by only 2 mEq/l/hour during her hemodialysis treatment and thus control both the rate and total change in the patient's serum Na.

### Management of dysnatremias with continuous renal replacement therapy [^a80b7772]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Disorders of serum sodium concentration are common in critically ill patients who may have concomitant acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage kidney disease. Many of these patients may require customized serum sodium level management with dialysis which, if not strictly controlled, can lead to significant complications. Thus, controlled correction of the serum sodium level is necessary to avoid the development of osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and dialysis disequilibrium syndrome in hypernatremic patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy offers unique benefits through the ability to slowly and safely correct dysnatremias that can be tailored to specific patient needs and should be considered in select patients.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Effects of altered dietary salt intake in patients with chronic kidney… [^a44601f1]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question In patients with chronic kidney disease, does altering dietary salt intake affect risk factors or delay cardiovascular or renal complications. Evidence-Based Answer Reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure and reduces proteinuria in patients with CKD, but there is no evidence to determine whether lowering salt consumption leads to clinically significant reductions in end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, or all-cause mortality.

1. Practice Pointers CKD is a progressive condition often encountered by family physicians; it is both a complication of commonly encountered disease 2 and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 3 Patients with end-stage renal disease incur dramatically higher costs of care 4 and have markedly increased mortality.

5 Reliable interventions that may delay or prevent progression of CKD have not been fully elucidated. Restriction of dietary sodium intake is often recommended in these patients. This review sought to evaluate the benefits and harms of this intervention in patients with CKD. The authors identified eight randomized controlled trials of parallel or crossover design that compared salt-restricted to higher-salt diets in 258 participants. The two studies conducted in patients with more advanced kidney disease showed similar results. Other biomarkers were assessed as secondary outcomes; only proteinuria showed consistent improvement with salt restriction, with relative risk reductions ranging from 21% to 49% across studies. 6 This review is consistent with the current state of knowledge that salt restriction has a positive effect on disease-oriented markers such as blood pressure and proteinuria.

Long-term effects of sustained dietary salt restriction are unknown. The general lack of data is reflected in the heterogeneity of dietary recommendations. The National Kidney Foundation recommends that dietary sodium intake be limited to less than 2, 400 mg per day in patients with CKD and hypertension. 7 A more recent clinical practice guideline issued by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes recommends lowering sodium intake to less than 2, 000 mg per day in patients with CKD. 8 Future work should be directed at clarifying the long-term effects of reduced salt intake and its desired effect on delaying progression of CKD to end-stage renal disease.

### Dysnatremias in patients with kidney disease [^f9318441]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias are among the most common electrolyte disorders in clinical medicine. Recent studies have shown that individuals with chronic kidney disease also are afflicted by these electrolyte disorders. Furthermore, their presence imparts an increased risk of mortality. In this review, we discuss studies in experimental animals and in humans that have attempted to establish the mechanisms responsible for limiting urinary dilution and urinary concentration in progressive kidney disease. The clinical implications of these disorders in water excretion are discussed in the setting of optimal water intake as kidney disease progresses. This review emphasizes the management of patients with chronic kidney disease who have marked abnormalities in serum sodium concentrations and gives specific recommendations for modifications in renal replacement therapy prescription in hyponatremic patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^46986f8c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/l, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution- and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

### Hyponatremia and hypokalemia in patients on peritoneal dialysis [^3f21b1bb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia occurs in up to 60% of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for end-stage renal disease. It can be associated with poor clinical outcomes, including malnutrition and death. New evidence points to a link between hypokalemia and the risk of peritonitis. The serum Na(+) concentration is determined by the ratio of exchangeable Na(+) and K(+) to total body water. Hyponatremia may be caused by excessive thirst, a particular problem in patients on PD. Consistent with the relationship among the serum sodium concentration, total body cation content, and total body water, hyponatremia may also be caused by total body potassium depletion. Ultra-low sodium dialysis fluid may prove to have an important role in management of fluid overload and hypertension in patients on PD. Surprisingly, it is not associated with significant hyponatremia, for reasons that remain to be elucidated.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^cc2b8ddc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Dialysate sodium: choosing the optimal hemodialysis bath [^e7a71602]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Fluid overload in patients undergoing hemodialysis contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and is a major cause of hospitalizations. It is often addressed by reinforcing the importance of a low-salt diet with patients and challenging estimated dry weights. More recently, interest has shifted toward the dialysate sodium prescription as a strategy to improve fluid overload and its adverse sequelae. The availability of high-flux high-efficiency dialysis in conjunction with the need to ensure its tolerability for patients has resulted in an increase in dialysate sodium prescriptions from 120 to ≥ 140 mEq/L. However, we are now tackling the unforeseen consequences associated with high dialysate sodium prescriptions. High dialysate sodium concentration is associated with high interdialytic weight gain, a commonly used surrogate for hypervolemia contributing to hypertension. The association between mortality and high dialysate sodium concentration remains controversial with conflicting data. It is clear that fluid management in the diverse end-stage renal disease population is extremely complex and more clinical trials are needed. In the meantime, while patients require treatments and clinical decisions need to be made, this review article attempts to summarize the current evidence for individualized dialysate sodium prescriptions based on patients' volume status, comorbid conditions, plasma sodium level, and hemodynamic response to dialysis therapy.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^957d6d78]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^f430c9d4]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^e1611723]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f84ee988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Hyponatremia and mortality in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^7b54faa1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the relationship between hyponatremia and worse outcomes in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases were used to search for relevant articles. The target population was patients on maintenance hemodialysis (those undergoing hemodialysis for ≥ 60days). The defined outcomes were death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and falls. Meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model of pairwise comparisons of normonatremia and hyponatremia defined for each study, 1-mmol/L increment of sodium analysis, and dose-response analysis using the sodium concentration defined for each study. This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018087667).

Results

Thirteen articles were included. The pairwise analysis revealed that the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.61). The analysis of 1-mmol/L increment of sodium included six studies with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) for each 1-mmol/L increase in the serum sodium concentration. In the dose-response analysis, assuming a linear relationship, a sodium increment of 1 mmol/L revealed a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.96–0.98). Other outcomes could not be integrated.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia is associated with all-cause mortality in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Healthcare providers should pay special attention to even the slightest indication of hyponatremia.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^7eb9cd53]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Associations of abnormal fluid status, plasma sodium disorders, and low dialysate sodium with mortality in patients on hemodialysis [^b16d84fd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Abnormal fluid and plasma sodium concentrations are established prognostic factors for patients on hemodialysis. However, the cumulative effects of abnormal salt and water and potential effect modifications and the effect of dialysate sodium remain incompletely understood.

Methods

The study followed 68,196 patients on incident hemodialysis from 875 dialysis clinics in 25 countries over 10 years (2010–2020) investigating dose-response patterns between cumulative exposure time of fluid overload/depletion (measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy using the Fresenius Body Composition Monitor), abnormal plasma sodium levels, low dialysate sodium, and all-cause mortality. We calculated time-varying cumulative exposure (in months) of relative fluid overload (any degree; > 7% or severe; > 13 or > 15% in women or men, respectively) and fluid depletion (< −7%), hypo- or hypernatremia (sodium < 135 or > 145 mmol/L, respectively), low dialysate sodium (≤ 138 mmol/L), and estimated hazard ratios for all-cause mortality using a multivariable Cox model.

Results

Of 2,123,957 patient-months, 61% were spent in any degree of fluid overload, 4% in fluid depletion, 11% in hyponatremia, and 1% in hypernatremia. Any degree of fluid overload was associated with higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio peak at 3.42 [95% confidence intervals, 3.12 to 3.75] relative to no exposure), and this association with all-cause mortality seemed to be stronger with severe fluid overload. The risk pattern associated with hyponatremia was approximately linear in the first four patient-months and then plateaued after the fourth patient-month. We did not observe effect modification between fluid overload and hyponatremia.

Conclusions

Even mild fluid overload was associated with higher mortality in patients on hemodialysis. Whether more stringent fluid management results in clinical improvement requires further investigation.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^9c2bc8f2]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients. With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Are dialysate sodium levels too high? [^d453421a]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Universal lower dialysate [Na+] is often advocated as a means of improving the dire cardiovascular plight of our dialysis patients. However, there is evidence associating lower dialysate [Na+] and increased morbidity and mortality especially in frailer patients, probably as a result of more frequent intra-dialytic hypotension. In this editorial, we summarize arguments for and against lower dialysate [Na+], and provide recommendations around selecting the most appropriate dialysate [Na+] for specific clinical subsets that may benefit from manipulation of salt and water balance. The lack of overall clarity on relative benefits and risks of lower dialysate [Na+] does not support the case for empirical "across the board" change, and experimental testing in clinical trials is required to determine safe and effective use.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^45ce3032]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

The ability to manipulate sodium concentration in the dialysate or replacement solutions is limited. Compounding dialysate or replacement fluids to alter sodium concentration could result in errors. Rapid correction of hyponatremia or hypernatremia due to equilibrium with dialysate or replacement solutions could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome or cerebral edema respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy is the preferred dialysis modality in patients with severe dysnatremias. In this article, we present simple formulas to determine the rate of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions needed to mitigate rapid correction of dysnatremias. These formulas can be used readily by the clinician at bedside.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^a94f3f50]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Both hyponatremia and hypernatremia are important risk factors for high morbidity and mortality in several clinical settings. However, reports have conflicted about the dependent and independent relationships of sodium with mortality. A relationship is plausible because both hyponatremia and hypernatremia have adverse consequences via their effects on the brain, heart, and other organs. However, dysnatremia might be only a marker of comorbidities, with deaths attributable mainly to the severity of the diseases and not to dysnatremia itself. A recent review of hyponatremia cases concluded that deaths were associated with the underlying illness, rather than with the severity of hyponatremia. Given the nature of this issue, it is unclear whether the correction of sodium can reduce the mortality risk. Most randomized controlled trials of drugs for sodium correction have not demonstrated a survival advantage. Although these results have not excluded the need for sodium correction, it is necessary to address whether sodium correction alone can reduce mortality. A well-designed observational study could be helpful because randomized controlled trials for this issue are not feasible.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is increasingly used in severe acute kidney injury (AKI), because it can easily control biochemical imbalances due to AKI. The presence of AKI or comorbidities hinders the effectiveness of conventional fluid or drug management, but CRRT can overcome these difficulties and achieve normonatremia. Here, we first addressed how sodium levels predict mortality in a prospective cohort of patients receiving CRRT, in whom the control of dysnatremia was extremely difficult with conventional treatment alone. Whether sodium correction is independently associated with reduced mortality in comorbid conditions was also addressed.

### End-stage renal disease: medical management | AAFP… [^2072cbc2]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Alone, GFR does not determine when dialysis is initiated; instead, guidelines advise starting dialysis when irreversible signs or symptoms of ESRD manifest. 3, 14, 16 Common indications for dialysis include persistent volume overload; refractory metabolic disorders such as metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia; cognitive impairment; and worsening nutritional status. 3 Table 2 lists indications for initiation of dialysis. 3, 14. |Uncontrolled hypertension| Most patients with ESRD will be treated with hemodialysis, and arteriovenous access is usually preferred. Early referral allows for evaluation and creation of vascular access before dialysis is needed. For patients with stage III to V chronic kidney disease, strategies to preserve peripheral venous access are important. These include avoiding excessive venipuncture, peripherally inserted central venous catheters, and subclavian venous catheters. HYPERTENSION Most patients receiving dialysis have hypertension.

Because blood pressure control is closely associated with volume status, modifying dialysis sessions to maintain normovolemia can improve blood pressure control. 30, 31 Likewise, sodium restriction can reduce blood pressure by limiting fluid retention, but patient compliance is usually poor.
32. 35 Hyperglycemia may resolve when patients start dialysis. 36 The optimal A1C goal for patients with ESRD has not been established; however, maintaining an A1C between 6% and 9% may reduce mortality. 35, 36 The accuracy and precision of A1C measurements are reduced in patients with ESRD, particularly when undergoing dialysis. Therefore, continuous glucose monitoring is a reasonable alternative, especially when there is substantial discordance between fasting glucose measurements and A1C measurements.
35.

Chronic metabolic acidosis is typically resolved with dialysis, but because the condition is associated with increased mortality and other adverse outcomes, those with persistently low bicarbonate concentrations may require oral bicarbonate supplementation. 3 Potassium excretion by the kidneys is decreased in patients with ESRD, putting them at high risk of hyperkalemia and its complications. 40 Secondary hyperparathyroidism is also common; therefore, serum calcium and phosphate levels should be measured every one to three months, parathyroid hormone levels every three to six months, and alkaline phosphatase levels at least every 12 months. 41 Patients with ESRD should also be assessed for vitamin D deficiency. 41.

### Mortality associated with low serum sodium concentration in maintenance hemodialysis [^5b50182c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

low serum sodium concentrations are associated with an increased risk of death in the general population, but causality is uncertain due to confounding from clinical conditions such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, in which hyponatremia results from elevated levels of arginine vasopressin.

Methods

to examine the association between predialysis serum sodium concentration and mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease, a condition in which arginine vasopressin does not affect water excretion and osmoregulation, we studied 1549 oligoanuric participants in the HEMO study, a randomized controlled trial of hemodialysis patients examining the effect of hemodialysis dose and flux. We used proportional hazards models to compare the risk of death according to predialysis serum sodium concentration.

Results

considered as a continuous variable, each 4-mEq/L increment in baseline predialysis serum sodium concentration was associated with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78–0.90). Multivariable adjustment for demographic, clinical, laboratory, and dialysis-specific covariates, including ultrafiltration volume, did not appreciably change the results (hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96). the results also were consistent in time-updated analyses using repeated measures of serum sodium and other relevant covariates.

Conclusion

Lower predialysis serum sodium concentration is associated with an increased risk of death. Considering the unique physiology in the dialysis population, these findings raise the possibility that hyponatremia itself may be a causal determinant of mortality in the broader population.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^be6f0b63]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dialysate sodium concentration (CPG 5.3) — High concentrations of sodium in dialysate reduce sodium removal during dialysis and ultrafiltration; historically, treatments lasting 6 hours used 135 mmol/L, but with shorter schedules (3 times per week for ≤ 4 hours per treatment) dialysate sodium was increased to the region of ≥ 140 mmol/L, which can aggravate thirst, fluid gain, and hypertension. Sodium profiling increases dialysate sodium early (eg, 145 to 155 mmol/L) with a progressive decrease to 135 to 140 mmol/L at the end of dialysis; reviews show sodium profiling is of uncertain benefit. The patient's postdialysis serum sodium concentration is a function of the time-averaged dialysate level, not the terminal level of sodium in dialysate. Some investigators had satisfactory experiences with a dialysate sodium concentration of 138 mmol/L, and during these studies the dosage of antihypertensive medications often had to be decreased or discontinued.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^4c8cd27c]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

Effect of urine composition ([Na] U +[K] U) and flow rate on serum sodium concentration [Na] after infusion of 1.75 L of 0.154 mol/L saline in a patient with initial body water of 26 L and [Na] of 111 mEq/L calculated from formula 9 (Table 3) if all the other influences depicted in this formula except urinary losses result in an [Na] of 116.0 mEq/L (Table 5). At [Na] U +[K] U = 116 mEq/L, urinary losses have no effect on [Na]. [Na] decreases if [Na] U +[K] U > 116 mEq/L and increases if [Na] U +[K] U < 116 mEq/L.

Modest hypotonic urine production can cause large underestimates of the increase in [Na] during treatment of hyponatremia with saline. External losses, primarily though the urine during treatment of hypovolemic hyponatremia, represent the major pitfall of formulas 2 to 7.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^758a0619]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f4beb21]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^ad0c0167]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although dysnatremia has been reported to be correlated with mortality risk, this issue remains unresolved in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Furthermore, it has not been determined whether change in or correction of sodium is related to mortality risk in this subset.

Methods

A total of 569 patients were prospectively enrolled at the start of CRRT between May 2010 and September 2013. The patients were divided into 5 groups: normonatremia (135–145 mmol/L), mild hyponatremia (131.1–134.9 mmol/L), moderate to severe hyponatremia (115.4–131.0 mmol/L), mild hypernatremia (145.1–148.4 mmol/L), and moderate to severe hypernatremia (148.5–166.0 mmol/L). The non-linear relationship between sodium and mortality was initially explored. Subsequently, the odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day mortality were calculated after adjustment of multiple covariates.

Results

The relationship between baseline sodium and mortality was U-shaped. The mild hyponatremia, moderate to severe hyponatremia, and moderate to severe hypernatremia groups had greater ORs for mortality (1.65, 1.91, and 2.32, respectively) than the normonatremia group (all P values < 0.05). However, later sodium levels (24 and 72 h after CRRT) did not predict 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the changes in sodium over 24 or 72 h, including the appropriate correction of dysnatremia, did not show any relationships with mortality, irrespective of baseline sodium level.

Conclusions

Sodium level at the start of CRRT was a strong predictor of mortality. However, changes in sodium level and the degree of sodium correction were not associated with the mortality risk in the patients with CRRT.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^9c2d486a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population. The median age was 78 years; 48.2% were male. Most patients (94.6%) were symptomatic and 3 (5.4%) had severe symptoms. Among the 3 patients with severe symptoms, only one received a bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline, because the other 2 patients' symptoms had resolved by the time the nephrologists evaluated them. In contrast, 16 patients received 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate (Table 3). There were multiple causes for hyponatremia; 36 (64.3%) patients were diagnosed to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and 21 (37.5%) with hyponatremia secondary to poor solute intake (Table 1). Table 2 shows the patients' laboratory data at presentation. The initial median SNa was 115 mEq/L (quartile, 111–119 mEq/L). Table 3 shows the treatments and outcomes after the nephrology consultation. Hydration with 0.9% saline for volume repletion was performed in 36 (64.3%) patients, maintenance fluid infusion with 0.9% saline was performed in 32 (57.1%) patients, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered in 17 (30.4%) patients. Loop diuretics (i.v.) were administered in 4 (7.1%) patients and tolvaptan per os (p.o.) in 4 (7.1%) patients. Prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for overcorrection included the use of D5W in 18 (32.1%) patients, free water intake in 2 (3.6%) patients, and DDAVP in 11 (19.6%) patients. The mean initial time of DDAVP administration was 8 h (range, 7–12 h) after the presentation. A total of 11 (19.6%) patients met the criteria for overcorrection: 9 (16.0%) patients in 24 h, 6 (10.7%) in 48 h, and 4 (7.1%) in both 24 and 48 h. Fortunately, none of the patients developed ODS during or after hyponatremia treatment in this study. Figure 2 shows the time course of SNa levels during the first 48 h after the treatment.

Sodium correction and mortality

We further analyzed the risk of mortality according to the change in sodium over 24 or 72 h. The number of 30-day death cases for each group is shown in Additional file 2. First, the non-linear relationships between adjusted ORs for mortality and changes in sodium levels were explored (Fig. 4). In the groups with baseline normonatremia or hyponatremia, the change in sodium over 24 or 72 h did not show an association with the risk of mortality (Fig. 4a to d). In the group with baseline hypernatremia (Fig. 4e and f), a greater decrease in sodium seemed to incur a reduced risk of mortality. However, this trend was shown only in the change over 24 h and not over 72 h. In particular, comparison of mortality rates within three sodium groups, i.e. normonatremia to normonatremia, hyponatremia to hyponatremia, and hypernatremia to hypernatremia, showed no significant difference (Additional file 3). Moreover, when adjusted for the sodium level at baseline, the change in sodium levels did not have any significance with mortality (all P s > 0.05). These results indicated that sodium change and correction of dysnatremia did not change the mortality risk.

Sodium Concentration and Volume of Infused Saline

Table 1 shows the symbols for volumes and concentrations used in this report. Sodium concentration in commercial saline solutions represents 2 hypertonic (0.855 and 0.513 mol/L), 1 "isotonic" (0.154 mol/L), and 3 "hypotonic" (0.130, 0.077, and 0.034 mol/L) values. Sodium concentration in the infusate is usually 0.513 mol/L for hyponatremia with pronounced symptomsand 0.154 mol/L for volume replacement in patients with symptomatic hypovolemia.

Table 1.
Symbols and Interpretations

The sodium concentration in the infusate should not be limited by the strength of the commercial saline solutions. Mixing of saline and dextrose in water can produce any desired sodium concentration by the use of formula 1 (Table 2), which can be of help in hypovolemic hyponatremia with minimal hyponatremic symptomatology, when a large volume of infusate must be reconciled with the need to produce only a modest rise in [Na]. A suitable sodium concentration of the infusate in this instance could be the target [Na] at 24 hours. For example, the target [Na] at 24 hours would be 117 mEq/L in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia and initial [Na] of 111 mEq/L. By formula 1, the addition of 0.316 L of dextrose in water to 1 L of 0.154 mol/L saline produces a sodium concentration of 117 mEq/L in the infusate.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia in patients with kidney failure: role of continuous venovenous hemofiltration with low-sodium replacement fluid [^b46b07ed]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia and kidney failure pose a special therapeutic challenge. Hemodialysis to correct volume overload, azotemia, and abnormal electrolyte levels will result in rapid correction of serum sodium concentration and place the patient at risk for osmotic demyelination syndrome. We present a patient with acute kidney injury and severe hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia (serum sodium < 100 mEq/L) who was treated successfully with continuous venovenous hemofiltration. This teaching case illustrates the limitations of hemodialysis and demonstrates how to regulate the sodium correction rate by single-pool sodium kinetic modeling during continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Two methods to adjust the replacement fluid to achieve the desired sodium concentration are outlined.

The baseline characteristics of the patients are shown and compared between groups with respect to serum sodium level in Table 1. For the 569 subjects, the mean age was 63 years. Except for one Caucasian subject, all other patients were Asian. Approximately half received CRRT because of sepsis. The ranges of sodium levels in dysnatremia groups were as follows: mild hyponatremia, 131.1–134.9 mmol/L; moderate to severe hyponatremia, 115.4–131.0 mmol/L; mild hypernatremia, 145.1–148.4 mmol/L; and moderate to severe hypernatremia, 148.5–166.0 mmol/L. The subjects were followed for a median of 19 days (4 to 193 days).

The AKI causes differed among sodium groups. Hyponatremia groups had higher scores for the Charlson Comorbidity Index than the normonatremia group. The moderate to severe hypernatremia group had higher APACHE II scores than the normonatremia group. The serum creatinine and albumin levels were similar among the sodium groups, except for a higher creatinine level in the mild hyponatremia group. Treatment with hypertonic saline was used in 8 patients, of whom 7 had moderate to severe hyponatremia and 1 had mild hyponatremia. Hypotonic saline was used in 13 patients with mild hypernatremia and 16 patients with moderate to severe hypernatremia.

### Dysnatremia, its correction, and mortality in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy: a prospective observational study [^d7dcfe42]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to the correlation issue between dysnatremia and mortality, it remains unresolved whether the correction of sodium could reduce mortality, particularly in the presence of several comorbidities. A study of this issue is difficult to conduct. Thus, the present study might be helpful, despite its observational design, in understanding the correlation. In contrast to the baseline level, subsequent sodium levels did not predict mortality irrespective of timeframe (24 and 72 h), possibly because of case-mix results, such as the group with baseline dysnatremia later having normonatremia. Furthermore, the change in sodium level, including the appropriate correction of dysnatremia, was not correlated with mortality. These results suggested that sodium level itself might accurately predict mortality in association with comorbidities or other related factors; however, the correction of sodium alone did not contribute to a survival benefit, particularly under the strong influence of comorbidities.

The association with mortality may differ for hyponatremia and hypernatremia. In the present cohort, mild hypernatremia was not associated with mortality in contrast to the results of mild hyponatremia. The discrepancy between the effects of hypo- and hypernatremia has been reported in other observational studies. Each association with mortality could be sensitive to the disease state of study. However, although the baseline characteristics differ across studies, hyponatremia and hypernatremia should be considered separately in research, as well as in clinical practice.

Although the present results are informative, this study has some limitations. First, the observational study design limits the drawing of conclusions, because of causality. However, randomized trials of dysnatremia treatment to determine survival benefit are not feasible, particularly in the presence of comorbidities; thus, the present results might be helpful in raising awareness of the correlation between sodium correction and outcomes. Second, the present cohort of patients who underwent CRRT is a particular subgroup, thus hindering the applicability of the conclusions to other populations. Furthermore, a single therapeutic intervention (i.e. sodium correction) might not show a survival benefit under conditions of high comorbidity rates of CRRT patients. Third, sodium levels corrected for glucose may not be accurate, because the correction factor may be altered by patient characteristics or high glucose states. Lastly, we did not retrieve important variables (e.g. correction rate of dysnatremia and neurologic outcomes), which could affect the overall outcome.

### It is time to individualize the dialysate sodium prescription [^64617f4c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium mass balance in hemodialysis patients is primarily dependent on dietary salt intake and sodium removal during dialysis. One of the most important goals of dialysis therapy is to fully remove the mass of sodium that has accumulated in the interdialytic period. It is currently the practice in dialysis centers all over the world to use a standardized dialysate sodium concentration (Na(+) D) for all patients. The aim of the present article was to summarize the current evidence for an individualized Na(+) D prescription. Three main points are discussed: (i) Na(+) D prescription, which must necessarily take into account the sodium setpoint and the sodium gradient; (ii) clinical experience with an individualized Na(+) D prescription, and (iii) guidelines for individualizing the Na(+) D prescription. To summarize, recent data suggest that tailoring Na(+) D to an individual's sodium setpoint has the potential for short- and long-term benefits for patients. Prospective interventional studies are warranted to further understand its effects, stratified for patients with low or high serum sodium levels.

### Lower serum sodium level predicts higher risk of infection-related hospitalization in maintenance hemodialysis patients: an observational cohort study [^a2ba015e]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality in chronic kidney disease with and without end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Increasing evidence suggests that hyponatremia is not only a marker of severe underlying disease, but also a direct contributor to mortality. However, specific pathogenesis or diseases contributing to mortality in the hyponatremic population are unknown. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between serum sodium level (sNa) and infection risk in ESRD patients.

Methods

This observational cohort study included 332 patients on maintenance hemodialysis in our dialysis unit in May 2009. The mean of 3 monthly measurements of glucose-corrected sNa before each dialysis session in May, June, and July 2009 was applied as baseline sNa. The primary endpoint was first infection-related hospitalization (IRH), and the secondary endpoint was death of any cause. Data were analyzed using Cox hazards modeling, adjusted for baseline demographics and characteristics, or laboratory data. Patients were followed until transfer, kidney transplantation, death, or study end on January 31, 2013.

Results

Mean sNa was 138.9 mEq/L (1st tertile: < 138.0, n = 104; 2nd tertile: 138.0–140.0, n = 116; 3rd tertile: > 140.0, n = 112). During 39.5 months' mean follow-up, 57 patients experienced IRH (56.4/1,000 patient-years overall; 89.7/1,000 in 1st tertile; 57.9/1,000 in 2nd tertile; 28.0/1,000 in 3rd tertile), and 68 patients died. The hazard ratio (HR) for IRH was higher for the 1st and 2nd tertiles than the 3rd tertile (unadjusted HR, 3.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54–6.64; p = 0.002; adjusted HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.10–5.04; p = 0.027; and unadjusted HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.98–4.40; p = 0.058; adjusted HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.99–4.51; p = 0.054 respectively). In a continuous model, higher sNa was associated with lower risk of IRH (adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–0.99; p = 0.040), and lower all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–1.00; p = 0.049).

Conclusions

Lower sNa is an independent predictor of higher risk for infection-related hospitalization in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Infectious disease may partially account for the increased mortality observed in the hyponatremic population with ESRD.
