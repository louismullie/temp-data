## Question

Does OSA-induced hypoxia contribute to dyspnea on exertion during the day?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced hypoxia contributes to daytime exertional dyspnea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of OSA and how intermittent hypoxia translates into daytime physiology. Then, I should verify the mechanistic links between nocturnal hypoxemia and exertional breathlessness, including chemoreceptor drive, pulmonary vascular effects, and ventilatory inefficiency. Next, I will examine direct and indirect clinical evidence, including CPAP and oxygen interventions, and consider confounders like obesity and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline practical implications for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology. OSA produces repetitive apneas and hypopneas with oxygen desaturation and arousals, creating intermittent hypoxemia–reoxygenation cycles that activate chemoreceptors, increase sympathetic activity, and can acutely raise pulmonary artery pressures. These effects are well described and mechanistically plausible for downstream daytime consequences [^1171XUBD] [^114d17Ab].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic bridge to exertional dyspnea. Intermittent hypoxia increases hypoxic chemosensitivity and can destabilize ventilatory control, contributing to high loop gain and unstable breathing; in turn, this can magnify ventilatory demand–capacity mismatches during exercise and amplify dyspnea, especially when pulmonary vascular tone and dead space are altered [^112tpwdY] [^1178jBRW]. I should also confirm that pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities and increased dead space during exercise have been documented in untreated OSA, correlating with higher dyspnea intensity, which supports a direct physiologic link to exertional symptoms [^11256VVN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the clinical evidence base. A meta-analysis using individual patient data found no significant reduction in VO2peak in moderate-to-severe OSA versus controls, suggesting preserved exercise capacity in many patients, whereas aggregate analyses without IPD suggested lower VO2peak. This heterogeneity implies that population, comorbidity burden, and hypoxic burden metrics matter greatly when interpreting exercise outcomes in OSA [^111YsV4b]. Let me reconsider: this does not negate a hypoxia–dyspnea link, but it does mean the effect is not universal and may be obscured by fitness, age, and comorbidities [^111YsV4b].

> Next, I should review interventional signals. CPAP improves exercise tolerance and reduces exertional dyspnea in obese patients with OSA, with gains in constant-load exercise time and reductions in isotime dyspnea after 1–3 months, despite no change in static pulmonary function, which argues that reversing nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation improves exertional symptoms in at least some patients [^113cqWSi]. But wait, what if oxygen alone helps? In COPD overlap cohorts, nocturnal oxygen reduced nocturnal hypoxemia and adverse events at altitude yet did not consistently improve next-day exercise capacity or gas exchange, reminding me that oxygen's effects are context dependent and may not fully recapitulate CPAP's multimodal benefits [^1117pTqm] [^112Qc2Sd].

> I should double-check the role of comorbidities and phenotype. Large observational clusters show that older patients with OSA plus COPD or chronic respiratory failure exhibit more severe nocturnal desaturation, daytime hypoxemia, and exercise limitation, indicating that comorbid lung disease and gas exchange abnormalities amplify the impact of OSA-related hypoxia on exertional dyspnea [^notfound]. Let me verify: in military cohorts with moderate-to-severe OSA, exercise capacity was not reduced, likely reflecting younger age, higher fitness, and fewer comorbidities, reinforcing that the hypoxia–dyspnea relationship is modulated by baseline cardiopulmonary reserve and phenotype [^112csEMS].

> Let me synthesize. Yes, OSA-induced hypoxia can contribute to daytime exertional dyspnea, primarily via chemoreceptor-mediated increases in ventilatory drive, pulmonary vascular changes that raise right ventricular afterload and dead space, and neuroplastic alterations that heighten dyspneic sensitivity. However, the magnitude of this contribution varies with hypoxic burden, comorbid cardiopulmonary disease, obesity, and fitness, and is not universally demonstrable across all populations [^1171XUBD] [^11256VVN] [^111YsV4b]. I should confirm that this aligns with guideline perspectives emphasizing multifactorial dyspnea mechanisms and the need to target treatable contributors, including hypoxemia, when present [^113nXVcu].

> Clinically, I need to ensure we do not conflate correlation with causation. In patients with exertional dyspnea and suspected or confirmed OSA, I should assess for overlapping contributors such as obesity, COPD, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, anemia, and deconditioning, and quantify nocturnal hypoxic burden and daytime gas exchange. CPAP remains first-line therapy for OSA and can improve symptoms in appropriately selected patients, while oxygen may be reserved for documented hypoxemia or as adjuncts, not as primary OSA therapy [^114TqjPq] [^111HT8Xh] [^112uwU7q]. Hold on, I should verify that cardiopulmonary exercise testing can help distinguish cardiac, pulmonary, and ventilatory control contributions when the etiology remains unclear, which is consistent with ATS guidance on dyspnea evaluation [^1117km6e].

OSA-related hypoxia contributes to exertional dyspnea through **intermittent hypoxemia** that increases chemoreceptor drive, pulmonary vascular resistance, and respiratory muscle fatigue, while also causing **autonomic dysregulation** and systemic inflammation that impair cardiovascular responses to exercise [^112tpwdY] [^116oK1Do]. These effects are amplified by comorbidities such as obesity, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension, and are supported by evidence that CPAP improves exercise tolerance and reduces dyspnea in OSA [^113cqWSi] [^1155LFM1]. The severity of nocturnal hypoxemia correlates with the degree of exertional dyspnea, and addressing OSA with CPAP or supplemental oxygen can mitigate symptoms [^111HA594] [^113cqWSi].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking OSA-related hypoxia to exertional dyspnea

Several **interconnected mechanisms** explain how OSA-related hypoxia leads to exertional dyspnea:

---

### Intermittent hypoxemia and chemoreceptor stimulation

- **Chemoreceptor activation**: Repetitive apneas cause intermittent hypoxemia, stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors and increasing ventilatory drive, which heightens dyspnea during exertion [^112tpwdY].

- **Ventilatory demand-supply mismatch**: Increased chemoreceptor drive raises ventilatory demand; if ventilatory capacity is limited (e.g. obesity, COPD), dyspnea intensifies [^1178jBRW].

---

### Pulmonary vascular changes and right ventricular dysfunction

- **Pulmonary vasoconstriction**: Intermittent hypoxia induces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, increasing pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular afterload, which limits cardiac output during exercise and causes dyspnea [^114d17Ab].

- **Right ventricular dysfunction**: Chronic hypoxia can cause right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, further limiting exercise capacity and increasing dyspnea [^114d17Ab].

---

### Autonomic dysregulation and cardiovascular responses

- **Sympathetic overactivity**: Intermittent hypoxia increases sympathetic tone, causing vasoconstriction, elevated heart rate, and arrhythmias, which reduce exercise tolerance and increase dyspnea [^116oK1Do].

- **Blunted cardiovascular responses**: OSA is associated with blunted heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise, contributing to exertional intolerance and dyspnea [^111oqw8o].

---

### Respiratory muscle fatigue and ventilatory inefficiency

- **Respiratory muscle fatigue**: Repeated apneas and hypoxemia increase respiratory muscle workload, causing fatigue and dyspnea during exertion [^notfound].

- **Increased dead space ventilation**: OSA patients exhibit increased dead space ventilation during exercise, reducing ventilatory efficiency and increasing dyspnea [^11256VVN].

---

### Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress

Intermittent hypoxia promotes **systemic inflammation** and oxidative stress, which impair vascular function, reduce exercise capacity, and contribute to dyspnea [^116oK1Do].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the relationship

Multiple studies and reviews support the link between OSA-related hypoxia and exertional dyspnea:

- **Exercise intolerance**: Patients with untreated OSA demonstrate reduced exercise capacity, increased dyspnea, and abnormal cardiovascular responses during exercise [^11256VVN].

- **CPAP benefits**: CPAP therapy improves exercise tolerance, reduces exertional dyspnea, and enhances quality of life in OSA patients, likely by reversing hypoxemia and its physiological consequences [^113cqWSi] [^1155LFM1].

- **Correlation with hypoxemia severity**: The severity of nocturnal hypoxemia (e.g. time spent with SpO2 < 90%) correlates with the degree of exertional dyspnea and exercise limitation [^111HA594].

---

## Influence of comorbidities

Comorbid conditions common in OSA — obesity, COPD, and pulmonary hypertension — **amplify** exertional dyspnea by increasing ventilatory demand, impairing gas exchange, and adding cardiovascular strain [^111HA594] [^111u9CxH].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing the contribution of OSA-related hypoxia to exertional dyspnea has important **clinical implications**:

- **Screening and diagnosis**: Patients with unexplained exertional dyspnea should be screened for OSA using polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing [^1114GHWB] [^113C58wa].

- **CPAP therapy**: CPAP is first-line therapy for OSA and can significantly improve exertional dyspnea and exercise capacity [^114TqjPq] [^113cqWSi].

- **Supplemental oxygen**: In selected patients with significant nocturnal hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen may be considered adjunctive therapy to alleviate exertional dyspnea [^111HT8Xh].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, exercise training, and management of comorbidities are essential to reduce dyspnea and improve exercise tolerance [^112tv78Q].

---

OSA-related hypoxia contributes to exertional dyspnea through multiple mechanisms, including chemoreceptor stimulation, pulmonary vascular changes, autonomic dysregulation, respiratory muscle fatigue, and systemic inflammation. Addressing OSA with CPAP and targeted therapies can **significantly improve exertional symptoms** and quality of life.

Fig. 3
Currently hypoxemia is accepted as a clinical feature in the end-stage of some patients' disease course, requiring long-term oxygen therapy. By contrast, it is well known that patients with overlap syndrome, i.e. concurrent COPD and obstructive sleep apnea, develop a more rapid decline in lung function, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and systemic co-morbidity. The PROSA Study was designed to test the hypothesis that COPD patients who experience intermittent, exertional hypoxemia also have a more rapid decline in lung function than those without exertional desaturation. If this hypothesis will be proven, exercise testing may be introduced as a prognostic functional test in early-stage COPD. PROSA will also include biomarker analyses and additional functional studies to highlight potential signalling pathways that may link exertional hypoxemia to lung function decline, pulmonary artery pressure, and systemic cardiovascular dysfunction, and thereby aim to shed light on possible pathomechanisms and potential novel targets for therapy

Background

Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) has diverse molecular pathomechanisms and clinical courses which, however, are not fully mirrored by current therapy. Intermittent hypoxemia is a driver of lung function decline and poor outcome, e.g. in patients with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea. Transient hypoxemia during physical exercise has been suggested to act in a similar manner. The PROSA study is designed to prospectively assess whether the clinical course of COPD patients with or without exertional desaturation differs, and to address potential pathophysiological mechanisms and biomarkers.

Methods

148 COPD patients (GOLD stage 2–3, groups B or C) will undergo exercise testing with continuous pulse oximetry. They will be followed for 36 months by spirometry, echocardiography, endothelial function testing, and biomarker analyses. Exercise testing will be performed by comparing the 6-min walk test (6MWT), bicycle ergometry, and a 15-sec breath-hold test. Exertional desaturation will be defined as SpO 2 < 90% or delta-SpO 2 ≥ 4% during the 6MWT. The primary endpoint will be the rate of decline of FEV1(LLN) between COPD patients with and without exertional desaturation.

Discussion

The PROSA Study is an investigator-initiated prospective study that was designed to prove or dismiss the hypothesis that COPD patients with exertional desaturation have a significantly more rapid rate of decline of lung function as compared to non-desaturators. A 20% difference in the primary endpoint was considered clinically significant; it can be detected with a power of 90%. If the primary endpoint will be met, exercise testing with continuous pulse oximetry can be used as a ubiquitously available, easy screening tool to prospectively assess the risk of rapid lung function decline in COPD patients at an early disease stage. This will allow to introduce personalized, risk-adapted therapy to improve COPD outcome in the long run. PROSA is exclusively funded by public funds provided by the European Research Council through an ERC Advanced Grant. Patient recruitment is ongoing; the PROSA results are expected to be available in 2028.

Fig. 2
Intermittent hypoxemia, as caused by co-morbid obstructive sleep apnea, has been shown to act as a driver of rapid lung function decline, systemic cardiovascular co-morbidity, and excess mortality. Exercise is another well-known trigger of intermittent, exertional hypoxemia. Previous research has revealed that hypoxia causes dysregulation of the endothelial L-arginine – dimethylarginine – nitric oxide pathway, causing excess hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. We hypothesize that dysregulation of this important pulmonary vascular signalling pathway also affects the rate of decline of lung function and, by spillover of dimethylarginines from the pulmonary into the systemic circulation, triggers systemic co-morbidities, and thereby contributes to poor prognosis

The PROSA study sets out to investigate, by three different means, the prevalence of exertional desaturation in COPD patients at a relatively early stage. The 15-sec breath-hold test has been described to unveil sensitivity of COPD patients to intermittent hypoxemia; it is an easily feasible and versatile test in clinical practice. The six-minute walk test certainly is the most often used exercise test in chronic diseases; it has been reported to generate a reliable diagnostic yield for exertional desaturation when continuous recording of SpO 2 is performed; therefore, it was selected as the primary determinant for stratification of COPD patients with or without exertional hypoxemia in the PROSA Study. Step tests on a bicycle ergometer cause the most effort in terms of personnel and equipment; however, this procedure can be expected to generate the best reproducibility of results; ergometer step tests have been shown to allow detection of exertional desaturation with continuous SpO 2 recording in COPD patients. In PROSA, all three approaches will be compared for their diagnostic sensitivities and specificities.

### CPAP increases exercise tolerance in obese subjects with obstructive sleep apnea [^113cqWSi]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Obese subjects commonly suffer from exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Preliminary evidence suggests that treatment with nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) may improve dyspnea in obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but the effect on exercise tolerance is unknown. This study sought to investigate whether nCPAP improves exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea in obese patients with OSA. Obese patients prescribed nCPAP for moderate/severe OSA and without cardiopulmonary disease were recruited. Patients completed a constant-load exercise test and Baseline and Transitional Dyspnea Index questionnaires (BDI/TDI) at baseline and after one and three months of nCPAP. Primary outcome was change in constant-load exercise time from baseline to one and three months. Secondary outcomes included changes in isotime dyspnea, isotime leg fatigue and BDI/TDI score at one and three months. Fifteen subjects (body mass index = 43 kg m(-2), apnea-hypopnea index = 49(.)hr(-1)) were studied. Constant-load exercise time increased by 2.0 min (40%, p = 0.02) at one month and 1.8 min (36%, p = 0.04) at three months. At one and three months, isotime dyspnea decreased by 1.4 (p = 0.17) and 2 units (p = 0.04), and leg fatigue decreased by 1.2 (p = 0.18) and 2 units (p = 0.02), respectively. BDI/TDI scores were 2.7 (p = 0.001) and 4.5 points (p < 0.001) at one and three months. Peak oxygen consumption and static pulmonary function were unchanged. Nocturnal CPAP improves exercise tolerance and dyspnea in obese patients with OSA. Effects on exercise time and chronic dyspnea were seen after one and three months of nCPAP, while exertional dyspnea was only improved at three months.

Definitions and severity classification — Apnea is total airflow obstruction for more than 10 seconds and hypopnea is a partial airway obstruction with at least a 3% reduction in blood oxygen saturation or sleep arousals; obstructive sleep apnea is defined as more than 5 apnea, hypoxic, or sleep arousal events per hour, and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is used to define severity as mild 5 to 15 events per hour, moderate 16 to 30 events per hour, and severe more than 30 events per hour.

### Effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy on nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep apnea among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease traveling to 2048 meters: a randomized clinical trial [^1117pTqm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The reduction of the AHI by NOT was quite pronounced, with even lower values at 2048 m than at 490 m (Table 2). It was associated with an overcorrection of nocturnal SpO 2 by NOT, greater than values recorded at 490 m (mean [SD], 96% [2%] vs 92% [2%]). Thus, a combined, stabilizing effect of oxygen and of acclimatization on control of breathing might have very effectively reduced the AHI, particularly on the second night at high altitude.

Improvements in sleep structure with NOT were reflected by a higher sleep efficiency, a lower arousal index, a lower percentage of superficial non–rapid eye movement sleep stages 1 and 2, and more rapid eye movement sleep (Table 2). The improvements may have been the result of improved oxygenation and reduced AHI in patients with COPD who received NOT. Subjective sleep quality improved by 9 percentage points after the first night with NOT at 2048 m, similar to the difference of 10 percentage points found to be clinically important in patients with insomnia. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the end of the 6-minute walk test were improved the day after NOT, possibly related to less nocturnal sympathetic activity, as indicated by a lower nocturnal heart rate and a reduced incidence of ventricular extra-beats.

Despite improvements in sleep structure and breathing and better subjective sleep quality with NOT at 2048 m, similar exercise capacity, cognitive performance, and arterial blood gases were observed as with placebo (Table 3). These findings suggest no persistent, measurable effect of NOT on these outcomes.

In addition to the directly measurable effect of NOT on hypoxemia, we speculate that it prevented the hypoxia-induced activation of systemic inflammatory pathways, excessive hyperventilation, and sympathetic overexcitation. This might explain favorable effects of NOT on ARAHE other than just hypoxemia including AMS, COPD exacerbations, and intolerable dyspnea.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^113nXVcu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea evaluation and management principles — assessment "continues to be dependent on a thorough history and physical examination", and no single test universally tracks dyspnea because "no diagnostic test or biomarker correlates closely with changes in dyspnea across all conditions or settings", though "specific tests (e.g., spirometry or peak flow, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], arterial blood gases) have diagnostic utility in specific clinical settings or circumstances". Initial treatment prioritizes the underlying cause as "the first priority", after which "the clinician should direct attention to persistent physiological derangements amenable to intervention (e.g., hypoxemia, acidemia)". For chronic exertional dyspnea, "the contribution of cardiovascular deconditioning… should be investigated and pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise training considered for patients with long-standing dyspnea and reduced functional capacity". Measurement is emphasized, as "dyspnea can and should be measured", and instruments "should be classified as addressing domains of sensory-perceptual experience, affective distress, or symptom/disease impact or burden", with a call that "clinicians and investigators should be more explicit about the domains being measured". Finally, adjunct approaches "targeted at altering afferent sensory information… or central processing… demand further investigation".

### Obstructive sleep apnoea of mild severity: should it be treated? [^115jm3V6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide guidance in the management of mild obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in the context of a very high prevalence, poor correlation with symptom profile, and lack of evidence that mild OSAS significantly contributes to comorbidity or early mortality.

Recent Findings

Mild obstructive sleep apnoea defined by hourly frequency of apnoeas or hypopnoeas (AHI) between 5 and 15 affects up to 35% of the general adult population but is much less prevalent when associated daytime symptoms are included. The poor correlation between symptoms and AHI complicates diagnosis and reports that mild OSAS is not significantly associated with comorbidity casts doubt on clinical significance. The diagnosis is complicated by night-to-night variability and by underestimation of AHI in ambulatory sleep studies that do not include sleep assessment. Active management of mild OSAS can be symptom-driven and offers a broad range of options. Lifestyle measures may be sufficient in many cases and mandibular advancement devices or positional therapy may be more effective in mild OSAS. Sleepy patients with low AHI may warrant a trial of continuous positive airway pressure therapy to establish the relationship between sleep disordered breathing and symptoms.

Summary

Management of mild OSAS can focus on symptom relief to the individual patient.

INTRODUCTION

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder that is estimated to affect over a billion people worldwide and when left untreated, OSA is associated with adverse consequences such as daytime sleepiness, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurocognitive impairment. OSA is characterized by repetitive events of either complete (apneas) or partial upper airway collapse (hypopneas). Immediate consequences of these repetitive events include oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep. Regardless of the underlying mechanisms, be it anatomic or nonanatomic, that cause upper airway collapse, the immediate consequences of oxygen desaturation and arousal from sleep are commonly observed in almost all OSA patients. It is thus not surprising that the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) which considers the frequency of respiratory events associated with either oxygen desaturation or arousals from sleep has become the prevailing measure of both the presence and the severity of OSA as a disease. However, AHI is inconsistently related to adverse consequences of OSA. While epidemiological studies suggest that OSA, determined by AHI, is associated with CVD mortality and morbidity, baseline AHI or changes in AHI with treatment of OSA fail to predict adverse outcomes. Further, pretreatment AHI poorly predicts the degree of clinical improvement that is obtained with treatment of OSA. As such, it is not unexpected that randomized control trials that have hypothesized that treatment of OSA would lead to lower incidence of CVD, have not yet been successful.

### Effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy on nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep apnea among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease traveling to 2048 meters: a randomized clinical trial [^114Fz99D]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation related to airway inflammation associated with airway narrowing and destruction of the lung parenchyma. Given that COPD is highly prevalent and the fourth leading cause of death, it is a major health problem worldwide. Although COPD is a progressive condition, medical treatment may improve symptoms in many patients. Today, millions of tourists travel to high altitude for leisure or work activities, and many patients with COPD are among them. Studies have found that acute ascent to altitude above 2500 m causes hypoxemia, periodic breathing, disturbed sleep, and exercise intolerance in healthy travelers, whereas short-term altitude exposures between 2000 m and 2500 m (equivalent to pressurized airplane cabins during long-distance flights) seem to be unproblematic for healthy individuals. However, patients with preexisting lung diseases, such as COPD, may experience severe hypoxemia at high altitude because of disease-related ventilatory limitations and impaired gas exchange. Thus, in a randomized clinical trial among patients with moderate to severe COPD (ie, forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV 1] between 30% and 80% predicted) who were exposed for 2 days at 2590 m, we observed an incidence of 24% of altitude-related adverse health effects (ARAHEs) requiring medical intervention. Moreover, endurance of submaximal exercise at this altitude was reduced by more than half compared with near sea level, and the patients with COPD experienced nocturnal hypoxemia, frequent sleep apnea, and autonomic dysregulation. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial among 118 lowlanders with COPD, preventive dexamethasone treatment improved nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep apnea during a stay at 3100 m; however, dexamethasone did not reduce the incidence of ARAHEs and induced hyperglycemia. Supplemental oxygen therapy may improve oxygenation and exercise capacity in patients with COPD who are acutely exposed to high altitude. While daytime oxygen administration during mountain outdoor activities is inconvenient or may be unpractical, nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) could be a feasible way to prevent severe hypoxemia, breathing disturbances, and ARAHEs in patients with COPD during altitude sojourns. Therefore, the purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate the hypothesis that NOT would improve nocturnal oxygen saturation and breathing instability as well as reduce the incidence of ARAHEs in lowlanders with COPD staying at high altitude.

### Nocturnal desaturation in patients with non-operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension [^113mMuH7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Oxygenation in CTEPH

Several studies have reported impaired oxygenation in patients with CTEPH. Godinas et al. reported that gas exchange was more impaired in distal CTEPH than in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which could be explained by a more pronounced blood flow redistribution in CTEPH due to nonuniform vascular obstruction. Hypoxia persisted even after a successful BPA, and oxygenation slightly improved after interventional treatment with BPA or PEA; however, it did not normalize despite nearly normalized hemodynamics in studies of a multicenter registry. Moreover, it has also been reported that exertional desaturation remains unchanged and sustained exertional desaturation could be one of the causes of exertional dyspnea or residual symptoms after successful BPA. Nocturnal hypoxia in patients with PH is occasionally reported in clinical settings. Murta et al. reported that three-quarters of patients had sleep-disordered breathing, and almost half of the patients had nocturnal hypoxia defined by an average SpO2 < 90% in a study of 36 patients with PAH or CTEPH. The most common sleep-disordered breathing condition is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this study, only mean PAP was associated with nocturnal desaturation; however, other hemodynamic parameters and the respiratory disturbance index were not. Hildenbrand et al. reported that the mean nocturnal SpO2 was 89% whereas the resting SpO2 was 95% during the daytime in a study of 44 patients with PAH and 19 patients with CTEPH. In this study, more than half of the patients spent > 50% of their time in bed with SpO2 < 90% (sustained desaturation), and nocturnal SpO2 was negatively correlated with the tricuspid pressure gradient. Another study by Minai et al. demonstrated that almost 70% of patients spent > 10% of their time in bed with SpO2 < 90%, and severe hemodynamics, including lower cardiac index, higher mean PAP, and higher PVR, were predictors of nocturnal desaturation in a study of 43 patients with PAH. Nocturnal hypoxia could be common in patients with PAH or CTEPH despite often normal SpO2 in the daytime and severer hemodynamics were associated with nocturnal hypoxia in those studies. Moreover, patients with PAH or CTEPH are at risk of developing sleep-related breathing disorders. However, the precise mechanisms underlying nocturnal hypoxia in patients with PH remain unclear.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^1178jBRW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration — mechanism and induction — reflects a perception of not getting enough air that can be induced experimentally by increasing inspiratory drive (for example with exercise, hypercapnia, or hypoxia), particularly when the capacity to satisfy ventilatory demand is limited; as ventilatory demand exceeds capacity, an imbalance develops between motor drive to breathe (corollary discharge) and afferent feedback from mechanoreceptors, which becomes increasingly unpleasant and distressing, and multiple labels have been used for this imbalance without fully capturing the neurophysiological interplay.

### Hypoxia and sleep-disordered breathing: friend or foe? [^116PvYxG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The study protocol involved a randomized parallel-arm design in which people with OSA were studied at the onset of their CPAP treatment. Participants were allocated to an adjunct intervention of intermittent hypoxia (n = 10 completed) or sham (n = 6 completed) in addition to their nightly CPAP therapy. The intervention involved administration of 2 minutes of 8% inspired oxygen (leading to reductions in Sp O 2 of ∼85–88%) with mild hypercapnia, every 2 minutes for 40 minutes during wakefulness, applied each weekday for 3 weeks. As acknowledged by the investigators, some of the study limitations include the small sample size, yet larger samples, given the intensive interventions, would be challenging; the absence of women and the racial background of the study participants, which may impact generalizability; and a relatively large proportion of dropouts (36%), although a secondary intention-to-treat analysis confirmed the reported per-protocol effects. Although largely focused on physiology mechanisms, this study (NCT03736382) also serves as a reminder of the need to clearly articulate study outcomes a priori when registering our randomized trials online.

### Hypoxia and sleep-disordered breathing: friend or foe? [^114pb9x3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoxia is a hallmark feature of respiratory disease and has multiple effects on the central nervous system. For example, experimentally induced acute sustained isocapnic hypoxia (oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Sp O 2], 80–85%) blunts respiratory sensation and symptom perception in asthma and suppresses cough reflex sensitivity and arousal responses to airway closure during sleep in healthy individuals. The effects of repetitive intermittent hypoxia, as occurs nightly in sleep-disordered breathing, are generally considered deleterious for the cardiovascular system. For instance, 2–4 weeks of nightly intermittent hypoxia increases daytime blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity in healthy individuals, potentially via renin-angiotensin mechanisms. In addition, the overnight sleep apnea–related hypoxic burden metric, which includes both hypoxemia frequency and magnitude components, predicts cardiovascular mortality.

However, as highlighted in this issue of the Journal in the current proof-of-concept physiology study conducted in a group of hypertensive men with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by Panza and colleagues (pp.) and by others, not all aspects of hypoxemia are necessarily deleterious. The rationale for the current study was based largely on the authors' prior work that investigated specific hypercapnic intermittent hypoxia regimes and the subsequent facilitatory effects on respiratory and upper airway neurons and the work of others that indicates that mild intermittent hypoxia during wakefulness can reduce blood pressure via nitric oxide mechanisms in untreated hypertensive patients in whom OSA status is unknown. The three key study findings were that intermittent hypoxia led to 1) improved upper airway stability during sleep assessed via critical collapsing pressure measurements; 2) greater continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence; and 3) an ∼10 mm Hg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during quiet wakefulness and sleep per 24-hour blood pressure measurements.

ARAHEs

During altitude sojourns or within the first 24 hours after descent, 8 of 31 patients (26%) using placebo and 1 of 28 patients (4%) using NOT experienced ARAHEs (odds ratio of NOT vs placebo, 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.88; P = 0.04). Among the 8 patients who received placebo and experienced ARAHEs, 4 (50%) had severe nocturnal hypoxemia (ie, SpO 2 < 75% for > 30 minutes), 1 (13%) had a panic attack, 1 (13%) had nocturnal urinary incontinence, 1 (13%) had intolerable dyspnea sensation, 1 (13%) had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise, and 1 (13%) had a COPD exacerbation. In 3 patients (38%), these ARAHEs were accompanied or followed by clinically relevant AMS. The 1 patient (13%) experiencing an ARAHE while using NOT had a COPD exacerbation on the day of descent from 2048 m.

Daytime Evaluations

Daytime outcomes are presented in Table 3. After the first night at 2048 m, patients with placebo had higher AMS scores compared with 490 m (mean [SD], 0.2 [0.5] vs 0.1 [0.1]; P = 0.01), increased daytime sleepiness scores (mean [SD], 3.6 [1.9] vs 2.8 [1.4]; P = 0.03), and rated their subjective sleep quality worse (mean [SD], 51% [23%] vs 64% [20%]; P = 0.002) (Table 3). With NOT, patients rated their sleep quality better compared with placebo (difference after the first night, 9 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 17 percentage points) (Table 3).

### Effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy on nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep apnea among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease traveling to 2048 meters: a randomized clinical trial [^116Exz7G]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Nocturnal hypoxemia and AHI in the current patients with COPD at 2048 m (mean [SD] SpO 2, 86% [3%]; AHI, 36.1/h [27.9/h] with placebo) were worse compared with corresponding values in 51 healthy volunteers at 2590 m (median [interquartile range {IQR}] SpO 2, 90% [89%-91%]; median [IQR] AHI, 13.1/h [6.7/h-32.1/h]). Compared with patients with obstructive sleep apnea at 2590 m (median [IQR], SpO 2, 85% [83%-88%]; median [IQR] AHI, 86.2/h [67.2/h-103.1/h]), patients with COPD had lower AHI but similar hypoxemia at 2048 m, probably because of airflow obstruction, ventilation or perfusion mismatch, and diffusion limitation causing mild hypoxemia already at 490 m. In terms of ventilatory control theory, it is interesting to note that the degree of altitude-induced deterioration of breathing stability reflected in the AHI in patients with COPD fell between the modest AHI increase in healthy individuals and the major increase in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in the cited studies. Presumably, mechanical ventilatory constraints and ventilatory inefficiency that reduces the plant gain of respiratory control in patients with COPD prevented an excessive increase in the AHI to the degree observed in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Conversely, a relatively enhanced neural respiratory drive in patients with COPDin the presence of hypoxia-induced chemoreceptor stimulation and altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension promoted greater ventilatory instability compared with healthy individuals. Exploratory analysis revealed that low altitude baseline AHI and nocturnal SpO 2 were independently associated with high altitude sleep-disordered breathing and nocturnal hypoxemia (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2), suggesting that overnight oximetry at low altitude might serve as a screening tool to identify patients susceptible to sleep disturbed breathing at high altitude.

### Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in military personnel is not associated with decreased exercise capacity [^112csEMS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Studies of older and less active patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have reported decreased exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). We looked to determine whether VO 2 max was decreased in younger patients with OSA who regularly exercise as would be encountered in the military.

Methods

We evaluated military personnel who had undergone pulmonary function testing (PFT), CPET, and polysomnography (PSG) as part of the larger STAMPEDE III study for comprehensive evaluation of exertional dyspnea. For analysis, patients were classified into two groups, the OSA group with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15 events/h and a control group with an AHI < 15 events/h.

Results

Mean AHI was 32.7 in the OSA group (n = 40) versus 5.8 in the control group (n = 58) with no significant difference in age (40.7 years versus 39.4 years) or body mass index (30.4 kg/m 2 versus 29.9 kg/m 2). PFT was normal in both groups including diffusing capacity (100.7% versus 96.5%) and FEV 1 (89.2% versus 86.2%). VO 2 max was not significantly different in the OSA group compared to the control group (101.3% versus 102.8%; P = 0.60) with both groups having normal exercise capacity. Exercise blood pressure response was normal and peak heart rate trended toward a blunted response in the OSA group (166.0 bpm versus 171.6 bpm, P = 0.09).

Conclusions

Younger military personnel with moderate to severe OSA do not have decreased exercise capacity. The effect of OSA on exercise tolerance may be influenced by additional factors and is likely too small to be noted in this population.

### Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and asthma: what are the links? [^117NxVu9]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Recent data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is an independent risk factor for asthma exacerbations. Neuromechanical reflex bronchoconstriction, gastroesophageal reflux, inflammation (local and systemic), and the indirect effect on dyspnea of OSAS-induced cardiac dysfunction have been suggested as mechanisms that lead to worsening asthma control in patients with concomitant OSAS. Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced airway angiogenesis, leptin-related airway changes, and OSAS-induced weight gain also may play a common mechanistic role linking both disorders. Several studies have confirmed that asthmatic patients are more prone to develop OSAS symptoms than are members of the general population. The common asthmatic features that promote OSAS symptoms are nasal obstruction, a decrease in pharyngeal cross sectional area, and an increase in upper airway collapsibility. Clarifying the nature of the relationship between OSAS and asthma is a critical area with important therapeutic implications.

### Research priorities for translating endophenotyping of adult obstructive sleep apnea to the clinic: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112ULbbV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) endophenotyping — trial-stage efficacy targets and example randomized study — emphasizes that at the derivation/discovery stage, demonstrating successful mechanism targeting, relief of physiologic impact such as reduced AHI or hypoxic burden, or both may provide a physiologic rationale for a therapy; a randomized, crossover trial investigated response to drug therapy where AHI was the primary outcome and hypoxic burden and arousal index were secondary, and these drugs may be considered "rational" in that they have been shown to alter the OSA disease process. It also notes that accumulating evidence indicates that reduction of the AHI does not necessarily translate to improvement in patient-centered outcomes and that a truly effective treatment should alter the OSA disease process and symptom burden, improve quality of life, and/or reduce the risk of long-term sequelae.

### Mechanisms of apnea [^115V9aZb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

This paper focuses on the underlying mechanisms contributing to sleep-disordered breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is characterized by repetitive narrowing or collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. Conversely, central sleep apnea (CSA), highly prevalent in congestive heart failure, is distinguished by a lack of drive to breathe during sleep, resulting in repetitive periods of insufficient ventilation. Both lead to compromised gas exchange, impaired sleep continuity, and catecholamine surges and are associated with major comorbidities including excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although OSA and CSA exist on a spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing, the 2 entities may overlap in their underlying pathophysiologies. This brief review summarizes the etiology and current understanding of OSA and CSA pathophysiology and the role that the cardiovascular system may play in contributing to disease pathology and highlights the likely substantial overlap that exists between the various forms of sleep-disordered breathing.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^111unFmW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dyspnea is a common, distressing symptom of cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular diseases. Since the ATS published a consensus statement on dyspnea in 1999, there has been enormous growth in knowledge about the neurophysiology of dyspnea and increasing interest in dyspnea as a patient-reported outcome.

Purpose

The purpose of this document is to update the 1999 ATS Consensus Statement on dyspnea.

Methods

An interdisciplinary committee of experts representing ATS assemblies on Nursing, Clinical Problems, Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology, Pulmonary Rehabilitation, and Behavioral Science determined the overall scope of this update through group consensus. Focused literature reviews in key topic areas were conducted by committee members with relevant expertise. The final content of this statement was agreed upon by all members.

Results

Progress has been made in clarifying mechanisms underlying several qualitatively and mechanistically distinct breathing sensations. Brain imaging studies have consistently shown dyspnea stimuli to be correlated with activation of cortico-limbic areas involved with interoception and nociception. Endogenous and exogenous opioids may modulate perception of dyspnea. Instruments for measuring dyspnea are often poorly characterized; a framework is proposed for more consistent identification of measurement domains.

Conclusions

Progress in treatment of dyspnea has not matched progress in elucidating underlying mechanisms. There is a critical need for interdisciplinary translational research to connect dyspnea mechanisms with clinical treatment and to validate dyspnea measures as patient-reported outcomes for clinical trials.

Excessive dynamic airway collapse is a relatively new diagnosis separate from tracheobronchomalacia that is manifested by functional collapse of the large airways. Most commonly described in patients with underlying obstructive lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, it may contribute to increased dyspnea, cough, or exacerbations. There are few data published on the role of excessive dynamic airway collapse as related specifically to exercise. It was recently described as the cause for exertional dyspnea in individuals without underlying lung disease.

### Exercise capacity and comorbidities in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^111HA594]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

There are few studies evaluating (1) exercise capacity as assessed by the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) test in large populations with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); and (2) correlations with patients' comorbidities.

Methods

This study presents a cluster analysis performed on the data of 1,228 patients. Severity of exercise limitation was defined on the basis of 6MWD.

Results

Sixty-one percent showed exercise limitation (29.2% and 31.9% mild and severe exercise limitation, respectively). About 60% and 40% of patients were included in cluster 1 (CL1) and 2 (CL2), respectively. CL1 included younger patients with high prevalence of apneas, desaturations, and hypertension with better exercise tolerance. CL2 included older patients, all with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), high prevalence of chronic respiratory failure (CRF), fewer apneas but severe mean desaturation, daytime hypoxemia, more severe exercise limitation, and exercise-induced desaturations. Only CRF and COPD significantly (P < .001) correlated with 6MWD < 85% of predicted value. 6MWD correlated positively with apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, nocturnal pulse oxygen saturation (SpO₂), resting arterial oxygen tension, mean SpO₂ on exercise, and negatively with age, body mass index, time spent during night with SpO₂ < 90%, mean nocturnal desaturation, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and number of comorbidities. Patients without severe comorbidities had higher exercise capacity than those with severe comorbidities, (P < .001). Exercise limitation was significantly worse in OSA severity class I when compared to other classes (P < .001).

Conclusions

A large number of patients with OSA experience exercise limitation. Older age, comorbidities such as COPD and CRF, OSA severity class I, severe mean nocturnal desaturation, and daytime hypoxemia are associated with worse exercise tolerance.

### Does obstructive sleep apnea affect exercise capacity and the hemodynamic response to exercise? An individual patient data and aggregate meta-analysis [^111YsV4b]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to altered cardiovascular response to exercise. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis were conducted to assess whether OSA patients present reduced exercise capacity. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched until September 2018. Studies which performed sleep recording in both OSA patients and controls and measured maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2peak) via a maximal exercise test were included. IPD were provided for five trials upon the 18 eligible (N = 289) and a two-stage IPD meta-analysis model was used, allowing to standardize the apnea cutoff and adjust for confounders. IPD meta-analysis demonstrated that moderate to severe OSA patients had similar VO 2peak (mean difference: -1.03 mL·kg -1 min -1; 95% CI: -3.82 to 1.76; p = 0.47) and cardiovascular response to exercise compared to mild or non-OSA patients. By contrast, aggregate data (AD) meta-analysis including the 13 trials for which IPD were unavailable (N = 605) revealed that VO 2peak was reduced in OSA patients compared to controls (mean difference: -2.30 mL·kg -1 min -1; 95% CI: -3.96 to -0.63; p < 0.001) with high heterogeneity. In conclusion, IPD meta-analysis suggests that VO 2peak and the cardiovascular response to exercise are preserved in moderate to severe OSA patients while AD meta-analysis suggests lower VO 2peak in severe OSA.

### Hypoxia and sleep-disordered breathing: friend or foe? [^113e8D7k]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding, the current findings of increased upper airway stability during sleep and increased CPAP compliance after targeted intermittent hypoxia are consistent with earlier respiratory stimulatory findings. Also, in accordance with the current findings, ischemic preconditioning mechanisms may provide cardiovascular benefit in certain settings, including potentially in certain people with OSA. Indeed, further highlighting the potential benefit of intermittent hypoxia, recent post hoc analyses of randomized trials of CPAP to treat OSA have raised the possibility that amelioration of OSA in certain patient subgroups (i.e. moderately severe OSA in the SAVE [Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints] trial, low heart rate responses in the RICCADSA [Randomized Intervention with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Coronary Artery Disease and OSA] trial) might even be deleterious for cardiovascular health.

Although the findings from the current technically challenging detailed human physiology experiments, for which the authors are to be commended, are intriguing and add to the knowledge on this interesting topic, many important unresolved questions remain. First, how can the current decreased blood pressure findings be reconciled with previous contrasting experimentally induced intermittent hypoxia data in humans that used similar hypoxia magnitudes? Oxygen desaturation by ∼10% every 4 minutes would provide an equivalent "hypoxic burden" of ∼150% min/h for the 40-minute intervention period. If the equivalent intensity of hypoxemia occurred nightly during sleep, this intervention would place patients in the highest risk category for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality based on analysis of Azarbarzin and colleagues. Perhaps the "mild" nature of the intermittent hypoxia in the current study is related more to the relatively short duration of cumulative exposure (40 min/d vs. 6 h or overnight in prior studies) and, thus, an equivalent hypoxic burden of just 12.5% min/h if the remaining 8 hours were hypoxia free (i.e. very low risk category per Azarbarzin and colleagues). To date, however, a U-shaped curve that describes the potential benefit of hypoxia at the mild end and harm at the other is yet to be demonstrated. Indeed, observational data have linked even milder intermittent hypoxia (in OSA) with cardiovascular morbidity and hypertension, and interventional data have also not shown elevated blood pressure with amelioration of OSA-induced hypoxemia. Time-of-day effects (i.e. daytime vs. nighttime exposure) may also be important. Thus, it remains unknown whether the observed benefits are contingent on daytime administration and the absence of sleep disruption.

### Effect of dexamethasone on nocturnal oxygenation in lowlanders with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease traveling to 3100 meters: a randomized clinical trial [^115cUcHB]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, millions of persons live in or travel to mountain areas. Even though moderate hypobaric hypoxia at altitudes of 1500 to 3500 m is generally well tolerated by healthy individuals, nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing, disturbances of sleep structure, and impairment of subjective sleep quality are commonly noticed. Patients with preexisting respiratory conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndromeor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seem to be particularly susceptible to altitude-related hypoxemia, sleep, and breathing disturbances. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, continuous positive airway pressure therapy combined with acetazolamide was effective in preventing exacerbation of sleep apnea and improving hypoxemia during altitude sojourns. In patients with COPD, mechanical ventilatory constraints combined with the stimulation of ventilation by acetazolamide and hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes may promote dyspnea, but to our knowledge, this has not been investigated.

The use of supplemental oxygen is hampered for logistical reasons and because its use is cumbersome and difficult for travelers with COPD. Therefore, other means to prevent altitude-related adverse health effects in patients with COPD are warranted. In healthy mountaineers, dexamethasone, a drug with potent glucocorticoid action, has been shown to prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS), reduce pulmonary artery pressure, and stimulate ventilation in individuals susceptible to high-altitude pulmonary edema. In patients with COPD, glucocorticoids are used to treat exacerbations. The present randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed in lowlanders in Central Asia with mild to moderate COPD to evaluate the hypothesis that preventive dexamethasone treatment would mitigate nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing, and impairments of sleep quality during a stay at high altitude.

### Activity-related dyspnea and exercise intolerance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: recent insights [^1123aMoX]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance remain key patient-related outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Improvement in treatment strategies is pendant further understand of their underpinnings across the spectrum of disease severity.

Recent Findings

Emerging literature has been reviewed based on a conceptual framework that relates ventilatory demand to capacity under the modulating influence of sub-cortical and cortical centers (symptom perception and affective interpretation). Evidence supporting these fundamental tenets is critically appraised, focusing on mechanistic and interventional studies that shed novel light on the sources of heightened and/or mechanically constrained ventilation. Mechanistic studies using proxies of the inspiratory neural drive (e.g., diaphragm electromyography) were particularly informative, as well as interventional trials aimed at decreasing afferent stimulation and/or symptom perception via pharmacological (e.g., low-dose opiates in selected patients, high flow oxygen, oral nitrate) and nonpharmacological (e.g., novel exercise training paradigms, inspiratory muscle training, breathing techniques) interventions.

Summary

Therapeutic and rehabilitative strategies to lessen dyspnea's devastating impact on quality of life should minimize demand in the setting of reduced capacity and increased sensation awareness in COPD. The most successful attempts so far have amalgamated pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches tailored to the main underlying mechanisms on an individual basis.

### Cheyne-Stokes respiration: friend or foe? [^113LqqNC]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea are common entities regularly confronting thoracic physicians, particularly those with an interest in sleep medicine or non-invasive ventilatory support. One major cause is heart failure (HF), usually associated with abnormal lung function tests, and either obstructive or central sleep apnoea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR). Whereas obstructive apnoea is considered injurious to the cardiovascular system, the effects of CSA-CSR are less clear and may be a compensatory response to severe HF.

Aim

To determine whether there are compensatory or possibly beneficial aspects caused by CSA-CSR in HF.

Methods

Literature review.

Results

CSA-CSR can be detrimental in terms of intermittent hypoxaemia, arousals and autonomic dysregulation. However, it is also associated with the beneficial effects of hyperventilation-related increases in end-expiratory lung volume, intrinsic positive airway pressure, assistance to stroke volume, attenuation of excessive sympathetic nervous activity, avoidance of hypercapnic acidosis and finally the provision of periodic rest to fatigue-prone respiratory pump muscles.

Conclusions

CSA-CSR has physiological features more likely to be compensatory and beneficial than injurious in HF. Some aspects of CSA-CSR are similar to those seen with positive airway pressure.

### The role of high loop gain induced by intermittent hypoxia in the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnoea [^112tpwdY]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Intermittent hypoxia and unstable breathing are key features of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the most common pathological problem of breathing in sleep. Unstable ventilatory control is characterised by high loop gain (LG), and likely contributes to cyclical airway obstruction by promoting airway collapse during periods of low ventilatory drive. Potential new strategies to treat OSA include manipulations designed to lower LG. However, the contribution of inherent versus induced LG abnormalities in OSA remains unclear. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms causing high LG in OSA is needed to guide the design of LG based treatments. OSA patients exhibit abnormal chemoreflex control which contributes to increased LG. These abnormalities have been shown to normalise after continuous positive airway pressure treatment, suggesting induced rather than inherent trait abnormalities. Experimental intermittent hypoxia, mimicking OSA, increases hypoxic chemosensitivity and induces long term facilitation; a sustained increase in ventilatory neural output which outlasts the original stimulus. These neuroplastic changes induce the same abnormalities in chemoreflex control as seen in OSA patients. This review outlines the evidence to support that a key component of high LG in OSA is induced by intermittent hypoxia, and is reversed by simply preventing this inducing stimulus.

### Exertional dyspnea in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: mechanisms and treatment approaches [^1135VrVo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to identify new advances in our understanding of dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Specifically, we highlight new scientific discoveries concerning the language of dyspnea, its underlying mechanisms and its clinical management.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have confirmed that dyspnea is multidimensional and that sensory intensity and quality dimensions of the symptom are readily distinguishable by the individual. When respiratory discomfort is sufficiently unpleasant in COPD, an emotive response is evoked which encompasses feelings of fear and anxiety. Such descriptors appear to be unique to the disease state and are rarely reported in health. Recent brain imaging studies have proposed a central role of the limbic and paralimbic systems in the genesis of perceived dyspnea or its affective component. There is new indirect evidence that the elaboration of endogenous opioids may modulate dyspnea intensity during exercise in COPD. New physiological studies in COPD have provided novel insights into mechanisms of dyspnea both in early disease and in the setting of coexistent obesity.

Summary

The effective management of dyspnea in COPD remains a significant challenge for caregivers but recent treatment innovations such as helium-oxygen, inhaled furosemide and breathing feedback techniques have yielded early positive results.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic respiratory condition characterized by repetitive upper airway collapse during sleep. There is considerable interindividual variation in the mechanisms that drive repetitive upper airway collapse in OSA. These mechanisms include an anatomic predisposition to airway obstruction and "nonanatomic" contributors such as unstable ventilatory control, poor pharyngeal dilator muscle function, and a low respiratory arousal threshold (i.e. waking up too easily to minor airway obstruction). Whether driven by one or a combination of these mechanisms, repetitive airway collapse can produce physiologic consequences that contribute to downstream adverse health and safety impacts that can differ markedly among patients. For example, significant hypoxemia accompanies respiratory events in some but not all patients. Left untreated, airway obstruction and the accompanying physiologic disturbances contribute to adverse health and safety consequences, which also vary markedly among patients. Indeed, some patients are sleepy and at higher risk of attention and vigilance failure; others are not. Some appear to be at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease; others may not be. Heterogeneity is thus observed in all three domains: pathogenic mechanisms, physiologic impacts, and disease expression. Figure 1 provides a conceptual schema.

Figure 1.
Examples of the contributions of mechanistic endotypes (in the upper panel schematic, tan shading indicates an impaired endotype, and blue shading indicates a favorable endotype) and OSA phenotypes to repetitive upper airway collapse during sleep. Midsagittal magnetic resonance imaging slices compare a patient with apnea with impaired pharyngeal anatomy (crowded upper airway) versus a patient without apnea: the patient with apnea demonstrates greater tongue volume, a larger and longer soft palate, narrower airway caliber, a retrognathic mandible, and a lower hyoid position.

### Lessons about low-dose morphine at the intersection of sleep and breathlessness [^1128PEUA]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although providing reassuring safety data and suggesting promising benefits for breathlessness and sleep in some individuals, Altree and colleagues' work also underscores the modest improvements observed on a group level for those receiving low-dose morphine, suggesting that although some patients derived meaningful benefits, others did not. This necessitates improved characterization and identification of those patients most likely to benefit from this approach, including the need for targeted prospective experimental work to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observations made in this trial. This should include the impact of dose and dose timing, opioid type, and detailed patient phenotyping. This is particularly important in comorbid obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with variable alterations in respiratory control and loop gain during sleep.

The novel findings of this trial also raise the possibility that sleep may be mediating the perception of breathlessness, which parallels the well-established bidirectional relationships between sleep deficiency and pain perception as well as affect. Dyspnea results from the complex coming together of physiologic stimuli, ranging from chemical to sensory-mechanical changes linked to COPD disease progression. Poor or inadequate sleep has been shown to attenuate positive affective states and increase perception of painful or exertive stimuli and may alter respiratory muscle endurance. Thus, it is reasonable to consider whether poor sleep influences dyspnea and whether therapies targeted at dyspnea management might be more or less effective depending on sleep quality. Such associations between sleep and daytime breathlessness have been explored in population samples, such as a study of 2,900 Australians in which those with reported poor sleep in the past were more likely to be breathless at present, and chronic breathlessness was associated with 1.9 times higher odds of poor sleep.

Altree and colleagues' findings raise the interesting question of whether actively screening for poor sleepers among patients with COPD could help identify individuals most likely to benefit in their dyspnea control in response to low-dose morphine. This aligns with a growing appreciation for the diversity and heterogeneity of patients in conditions like COPD. Might poor sleepers be so because of respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea) impairing their sleep, such that treating their refractory breathlessness would indirectly improve sleep? Or might low-dose morphine somehow improve sleep, thus indirectly ameliorating the affective experience of dyspnea? Moreover, if certain individuals are more prone to benefit from low-dose morphine, might individuals at greater potential risk of harm be similarly characterized? For example, would a similar safety signal be observed among patients with COPD who are prone to nocturnal hypoventilation or having concomitant obstructive sleep apnea?

Mild OSA is defined as 5 to < 15 events/h, with moderate and severe OSA defined as 15 to < 30 events/h and ≥ 30 events/h, and this research statement identifies mild OSA when severity indices are at least 5/h and less than 15/h. In general population studies, OSA syndrome defined as AHI greater than or equal to 5/h with daytime sleepiness ranges from 3 to 7.5% in adult men and from 2 to 3% in adult women, while using AHI greater than or equal to 5/h alone yields higher prevalence ranging from 8 to 28% in adult men and 3 to 26% in adult women, with a two- to threefold greater risk for men than women.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112J4Mu5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

Methods

The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements", that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Recommendations

The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a STRONG recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A WEAK recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources. Good Practice Statements: Diagnostic testing for OSA should be performed in conjunction with a comprehensive sleep evaluation and adequate follow-up. Polysomnography is the standard diagnostic test for the diagnosis of OSA in adult patients in whom there is a concern for OSA based on a comprehensive sleep evaluation. Recommendations: We recommend that clinical tools, questionnaires and prediction algorithms not be used to diagnose OSA in adults, in the absence of polysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, or home sleep apnea testing with a technically adequate device, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in uncomplicated adult patients presenting with signs and symptoms that indicate an increased risk of moderate to severe OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that if a single home sleep apnea test is negative, inconclusive, or technically inadequate, polysomnography be performed for the diagnosis of OSA. (STRONG). We recommend that polysomnography, rather than home sleep apnea testing, be used for the diagnosis of OSA in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease, potential respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular condition, awake hypoventilation or suspicion of sleep related hypoventilation, chronic opioid medication use, history of stroke or severe insomnia. (STRONG). We suggest that, if clinically appropriate, a split-night diagnostic protocol, rather than a full-night diagnostic protocol for polysomnography be used for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK). We suggest that when the initial polysomnogram is negative and clinical suspicion for OSA remains, a second polysomnogram be considered for the diagnosis of OSA. (WEAK).

Work/effort sensation in dyspnea — experimental determinants and disease impact — can be produced by external resistive or elastic loads, by volitional hyperpnea, or by weakening the respiratory muscles via operating length changes, fatigue, or partial neuromuscular blockade, and with weakened respiratory muscles the motor command requirement increases and the perception of inspiratory effort and work is substantially magnified even without increased ventilation; breathing discomfort is much greater in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and frequently limits exercise.

### Hypoxia and aging [^116oK1Do]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

OSA-induced intermittent hypoxia and aging

OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repeated episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypoapnea) obstruction of the upper airway. OSA causes cyclical hypoxemia-reoxygenation and stimulates chemoreceptors, resulting in over-activation of SNA, bursts in systemic blood and arterial pulmonary pressures, and concomitant cellular chronic intermittent hypoxia. Long-term consequences of OSA or chronic intermittent hypoxia include molecular and cellular impairments that contribute to the accelerated progression and severity of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological disorders, cancer and aging. The pathophysiological consequences and clinical manifestations of OSA or chronic intermittent hypoxia are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3
The pathophysiological consequences and clinical manifestations associated with obstructive sleep apnea or chronic intermittent hypoxia

Previously, hypoxia was shown to potentially contribute to cellular aging and the functional decline during the aging process. OSA-associated intermittent hypoxia may also accelerate cellular aging and age-related diseases by prompting the induction of nine hallmarks of aging: genomic instability, telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered cellular communication (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
The hypothetical impact of OSA-induced intermittent hypoxia on aging and aging-related diseases.

OSA-associated intermittent hypoxia may promote the induction of the nine hallmarks of aging: genomic instability, telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. These changes accelerate aging and aging-related diseases, such as cancer

Because aging is one of the risk factors for cancers and most hallmarks of aging have been shown to accelerate tumorigenesis, resulting in cancers, OSA is also postulated influence tumorigenesis and carcinogenesis. Tumor physiology, animal and epidemiological human studies reveal a strong relationship between OSA and cancer. However, because current data relating OSA to neoplastic diseases remain scarce, more research on the impact of OSA on cancer-related aspects are needed.

### Sleep apnea [^115LjDhu]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disorder characterized by repetitive collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. The disorder results primarily from an anatomically small upper airway in conjunction with pharyngeal dilator muscles that can compensate for the anatomic deficiency awake, but not asleep. Ventilatory control instability and a low arousal threshold may contribute to the disorder as well. The consequences of sleep apnea fall into two domains: (1) neurocognitive dysfunction (sleepiness and decreased quality of life) resulting from sleep fragmentation and (2) cardiovascular disease (hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) likely resulting from the intermittent hypoxia. The disorder is generally diagnosed in the sleep laboratory over the course of a night, although alternative approaches in the home are also utilized. A number of treatment options are available. Continuous positive airway pressure remains the most consistently effective approach, although oral appliances (generally mandibular-advancing devices) and a number of surgical procedures have some demonstrated efficacy. Thus, therapy must be individualized to the patient's desires and the severity of the apnea.

Overview of Sleep Apnea

Definition

Sleep apnea is characterized by repetitive episodes of apnea occurring during sleep. An apnea is defined as a cessation of inspiratory airflow lasting 10 seconds or more, while the term hypopnea refers to a reduction in inspiratory airflow (by at least 30%) lasting 10 seconds or more with an associated drop in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep. 7 The steps required for a successful inspiratory cycle include activation of a signal from the regulatory brainstem center, transmission of the signal via peripheral nerves, activation of respiratory muscles to produce negative intrathoracic pressure, and a patent airway. The mechanism for apneas or hypopneas can be either obstructive, in which airflow cessation results despite inspiratory effort because of blockage within the upper airways, or central, in which both airflow and inspiratory efforts are absent. The term sleep‐disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses OSA, central (CSA), and mixed apnea, the latter of which shows absent respiratory effort initially and clear effort with obstruction and the end of mixed apnea.

Important risk factors for OSA include obesity, craniofacial or oropharyngeal anatomic abnormalities, male sex, and smoking. 8 During sleep, there is a reduction in tone of the dilator muscles involved in maintaining airway patency. In particular, relaxation of the genioglossus muscle allows the tongue to fall posteriorly within the pharynx, facilitating obstruction in susceptible individuals. 9 Anatomic factors including obesity that result in relative narrowing of the airway lumen increase the likelihood of obstruction. The observation that OSA also affects nonobese patients without identifiable anatomic abnormalities indicates that nonanatomic mechanisms are important as well. Examples of these include ventilatory control instability 10 and reduced sleep arousal threshold. 11 The relative contribution from these processes varies between individual patients, with potential therapeutic implications. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying OSA could facilitate more personalized therapeutic strategies in the future.

CSA results from transient failure of respiratory control centers in the medulla to trigger inspiration. The primary mechanism is thought to be abnormal regulation of the apneic threshold, the partial pressure of CO 2 below which respiration is suppressed, although depending on the underlying cause CSA patients can be either hypercapnic, eucapnic, or hypocapnic. 9 HF is one of the leading causes of CSA, associated in particular with Cheyne‐Stokes breathing, which is characterized by cyclic crescendo‐decrescendo respiratory efforts and hypocapnia. 12

### Nocturnal CPAP improves walking capacity in COPD patients with obstructive sleep apnoea [^1155LFM1]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mortality due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing, and COPD is a serious health burden worldwide. The characteristic physiological impairments are airflow limitation, air-trapping, hyper-inflation, dyspnoea, and exercise limitation. Patients with COPD and exercise limitation will adopt a more sedentary lifestyle and give up the more strenuous physical activities, which eventually leads to de-conditioning and ultimately further exercise limitation. Moreover, exercise limitation is associated with morbidity and mortality. As such, finding ways to break this vicious cycle of exercise limitation is an important issue in COPD. Exercise limitation is influenced by age, body weight, dyspnoea sensation, pulmonary function, skeletal muscles, hypoxemia, cardio-vascular function, autonomic dysfunction, and emotion. Nocturnal intermittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation have also been shown to be associated with impaired walking performance in older men. In COPD patients, it has been suggested that hypoxemia during exercise limits walking performance, but that this is improved by oxygen supply during exercise. However, whether nocturnal intermittent hypoxemia affects walking performance remains unclear.

Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent pharyngeal collapse with intermittent hypoxemia during sleep and subsequent repetitive arousal to maintain ventilation. Concomitant COPD and OSA, termed the overlap syndrome, is not rare and affects at least 1% of the general population. Nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a pneumatic splint is effective in maintaining upper airway patency, and is standard treatment for OSA. In addition, it can reverse sleep fragmentation, nocturnal intermittent hypoxemia and autonomic dysfunction. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that reversing intermittent hypoxemia, sleep fragmentation and autonomic dysfunction will improve walking performance in overlap syndrome patients. The aim of this study was to clarify whether walking performance significantly increases in COPD patients with OSA after nocturnal CPAP treatment.

### Lessons about low-dose morphine at the intersection of sleep and breathlessness [^111je74Z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a complex, multifactorial symptom and a common complaint among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and supplemental O 2 form the mainstays of therapy and symptom management in COPD, low-dose morphine is specified in multiple guidelines (e.g. Referencesand) as an option for the management of refractory breathlessness or dyspnea. Evidence for the effectiveness of low-dose morphine is variable, with small, earlier trials suggesting benefits and later, larger trials providing more equivocal results (see Referencefor a recent review).

These equivocal findings are coupled with persistent concerns about the safety of low-dose morphine, which contributes to variable prescribing practices in refractory dyspnea management. Poor sleep quality is also routinely reported by patients with COPD and may be partly linked to nocturnal respiratory symptoms or impaired sleeping respiratory function in COPD. Poor sleep is associated with daytime sleepiness and impaired daytime function, raising interesting questions about how low-dose morphine might impact sleep quality. A deeper and more nuanced understanding of the effects of low-dose morphine is thus necessary to balance potential benefits with risk management and help identify those for whom it would be most beneficial.

To examine the effects of low-dose morphine on self-reported sleep and daytime functioning in patients with COPD and refractory breathlessness, Altree and colleagues, in this issue of the Journal (pp.), report on a secondary analysis of the BEAMS (Breathlessness, Exertion, And Morphine Sulfate) trial (original study, Reference). This investigation followed the primary BEAMS study, which found variable effectiveness of low-dose morphine in reducing the burden of breathlessness in contrast with earlier studies, which found more broadly favorable responses to morphine therapy for refractory breathlessness. In their 2024 follow-up, Altree and colleagues investigated 1) whether treatment with low-dose morphine bore any risk for worsening sleep or daytime functioning; and 2) potential relationships between the impact of low-dose morphine on both sleep and breathlessness. This follow-up is critical, given the variable responses within the original trial, underscoring the need to identify individuals most or least likely to benefit from low-dose morphine therapy.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common disease that is now more widely recognised because of the rise in prevalence and the increasingly compelling data that shows major neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. At the same time, the clinical practice of sleep medicine is changing rapidly, with novel diagnostics and treatments that have established a home-based (rather than laboratory-based) management approach. We review the most recent insights and discoveries in obstructive sleep apnoea, with a focus on diagnostics and therapeutics. As will be discussed, management of obstructive sleep apnoea could soon transition from a so-called one size fits all approach to an individualised approach.

The discussion notes that OSA presents itself with a multitude of symptoms but that the basis for the diagnosis and decision about therapy relies on defining pathophysiology, explaining that repetitive narrowing or complete closure of the upper airways during sleep results in reduction or complete cessation of airflow, hypoxia, and sleep fragmentation; it further states that this impaired flow is measured objectively through monitoring of airflow using various validated technology, that consequences are measured and quantified by measuring oxygenation and sleep stages, and that with objective sleep testing different indices of respiratory compromise are generated that will rate the severity of OSA.

### Obstructive sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension [^114d17Ab]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with repetitive nocturnal arterial oxygen desaturation and hypercapnia, large intrathoracic negative pressure swings, and acute increases in pulmonary artery pressure. Rodents when exposed to brief, intermittent hypoxia for several hours per day to mimic OSA developed pulmonary vascular remodeling and sustained pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy within a few weeks. Until recently, however, it was unclear whether episodic nocturnal hypoxemia associated with OSA was sufficient to cause similar changes in humans. This controversy appears to have been resolved by several recent studies that have shown (a) pulmonary hypertension in 20% to 40% of patients with OSA in the absence of other known cardiopulmonary disorders and (b) reductions in pulmonary artery pressure in patients with OSA after nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. The pulmonary hypertension associated with OSA appears to be mild and may be due to a combination of precapillary and postcapillary factors including pulmonary arteriolar remodeling and hyperreactivity to hypoxia and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement. Although measurable changes in the structure and function of the right ventricle have been reported in association with OSA, the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. Right ventricular failure in OSA appears to be uncommon and is more likely if there is coexisting left-sided heart disease or chronic hypoxic respiratory disease.

Dyspnea was initially only present during high-intensity physical activity, but was now present while walking rapidly on a flat surface. Symptoms were accentuated while supine and when bending forward. He reported respiratory difficulties when submerged in water and a recent onset of slight symmetric lower limb weakness that was only apparent during strenuous physical activity. He also had OSA, which was adequately controlled with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Neurologic and rheumatologic histories were otherwise unremarkable. He denied any impact accidents or trauma to the cervical spine and prior neck or thoracic surgeries.

### Exercise intolerance in untreated OSA: role of pulmonary gas exchange and systemic vascular abnormalities [^11256VVN]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Reduced exercise capacity has been reported previously in patients with OSA hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), although the underlying mechanisms are unclear.

Research Question

What are the underlying mechanisms of reduced exercise capacity in untreated patients with OSAHS? Is there a role for systemic or pulmonary vascular abnormalities?

Study Design and Methods

This was a cross-sectional observational study in which 14 patients with moderate to severe OSAHS and 10 control participants (matched for age, BMI, smoking history, and FEV 1) underwent spirometry, incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with arterial line, resting echocardiography, and assessment of arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [AIx]).

Results

Patients (age, 50 ± 11 years; BMI, 30.5 ± 2.7 kg/m 2; smoking history, 2.4 ± 4.0 pack-years; FEV 1 to FVC ratio, 0.78 ± 0.04; FEV 1, 85 ± 14% predicted, mean ± SD for all) had mean ± SD apnea hypopnea index of 43 ± 19/h. At rest, PWV, AIx, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) were higher in patients vs control participants (P < .05). During CPET, patients showed lower peak work rate (WR) and oxygen uptake and greater dyspnea ratings compared with control participants (P < .05 for all). Minute ventilation (V· E), ventilatory equivalent for CO 2 output (V· E /V·CO 2), and dead space volume (V D) to tidal volume (V T) ratio were greater in patients vs control participants during exercise (P < .05 for all). Reduction in V D to V T ratio from rest to peak exercise was greater in control participants compared with patients (0.24 ± 0.08 vs 0.04 ± 0.14, respectively; P = 0.001). Dyspnea intensity at the highest equivalent WR correlated with corresponding values of V· E /V·CO 2 (r = 0.65; P = 0.002), and dead space ventilation (r = 0.70; P = 0.001). Age, PWV, and mean PAP explained approximately 70% of the variance in peak WR, whereas predictors of dyspnea during CPET were rest-to-peak change in V D to V T ratio and PWV (R 2 = 0.50; P < .001).

Interpretation

Patients with OSAHS showed evidence of pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities during exercise (in the form of increased dead space) and resting systemic vascular dysfunction that may explain reduced exercise capacity and increased exertional dyspnea intensity.

### European Respiratory Society guideline on non-CPAP therapies for obstructive sleep apnoea [^114mYWBp]. European Respiratory Review (2021). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to positional therapy, ERS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering either positional therapy using vibratory devices or CPAP in adult patients with mild or moderate position-dependent OSA as defined by a supine apnea-hypopnea index at least twice as high as the nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index and no relevant nonsupine apnea-hypopnea index (< 15 events/hour).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^112uwU7q]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and oxygen therapy — The Work Group categorized this topic as Weak Against, Not reviewed, Amended and decided on a Weak against recommendation, noting that The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low and The potential harms of oxygen therapy as treatment for OSA slightly outweighed the benefits. Although oxygen can improve oxygen saturation in patients with OSA, it may also increase the duration of apnea-hypopnea events. Evidence summarized includes that in the largest study comparing oxygen therapy with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), CPAP but not nocturnal oxygen resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, while smaller studies demonstrated benefit in nocturnal hypoxemia with oxygen therapy in patients with OSA but no reduction in AHI or improvement in daytime functioning. The Work Group also considered patient values and preferences, and resource use, and highlighted safety and feasibility issues, including that the use of home oxygen carries the small risk of adverse events, including combustion/explosion and fire, and there is some evidence it may prolong respiratory events during sleep, and that it may be difficult to obtain this treatment without evidence of nocturnal hypoxemia. Importantly, oxygen therapy may be used in the treatment of other respiratory conditions, and this recommendation should not be interpreted as recommending against oxygen therapy in those situations or if oxygen is added to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy to alleviate residual hypoxia with PAP use.

### Identification of exertional hypoxia and its implications in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^114Pfo8D]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Dear Sir,

We read with great interest the recently published article entitled Feasibility, Reproducibility, and Clinical Validity of a Quantitative Chest X-Ray Assessment for COVID-19. In this perspective, Orsi et al.write about the importance of using cheap and readily available tools like the chest X-ray in the evaluation and management of COVID-19 pneumonia. One of the facts highlighted by the authors is that the use of a widely available tool that has rapid execution at the patient's bedside may have a significantly broader impact on patient management than more sophisticated tools. Resource-limited settings may benefit even more from the use of such tools. We concur with the authors about the use and ensuing impact of readily available, inexpensive, objective bedside tools, for example, transcutaneous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SPO 2), especially in COVID-19 patients.

Hypoxia is the hallmark of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The spotlight of COVID-19–associated hypoxia has been on the resting hypoxia associated with the acute phase of illness. As clinical experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia increases, there is growing anecdotal evidence that a small but important group of patients with significant lung damage suffers from hypoxia at the point of hospital discharge. A generally accepted discharge criterion is a transcutaneous SPO 2 of 94% or more in patients who have been off oxygen for 48 hours or more. However, there is variation in deciding discharge criteria concerning oxygen use. In our clinical experience, some of the patients who fulfilled the aforementioned criteria with no dyspnea at rest still complained of breathlessness on minimal exertion.

Exertional hypoxia (EH) is defined as a drop in SPO 2 to ≤ 88% on a 6-minute walk test. Exertional hypoxia is associated with a reduced quality of life and is a marker for poor prognosis in interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive airway disease. It may progress to chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure. – Dyspnea associated with EH is a predictor of reduced exercise capacity. The mechanism of dyspnea caused by EH is not fully understood. An increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and altered ventilatory and circulatory mechanics may play roles. There is a dearth of literature on the long-term impact of EH. Thus far, there are no national or international guidelines dictating assessment for the presence of EH and the need for ambulatory or long-term home oxygen in patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. –

### OSA and cardiorespiratory fitness: a review [^111oqw8o]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The effects of untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cardiopulmonary function remain unclear. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), commonly reflected by VO 2 max measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing, has gained popularity in evaluating numerous cardiopulmonary conditions and may provide a novel means of identifying OSA patients with the most clinically significant disease. This emerging testing modality provides simultaneous assessment of respiratory and cardiovascular function with results helping uncover evidence of evolving pathology in either organ system. In this review, we highlight the current state of the literature in regard to OSA and CRF with a specific focus on changes in cardiovascular function that have been previously noted. While OSA does not appear to limit respiratory function during exercise, studies seem to suggest an abnormal cardiovascular exercise response in this population including decreased cardiac output, a blunted heart rate response (ie, chronotropic incompetence), and exaggerated blood pressure response. Surprisingly, despite these observed changes in the cardiovascular response to exercise, results involving VO 2 max in OSA remain inconclusive. This is reflected by VO 2 max studies involving middle-aged OSA patients showing both normal and reduced CRF. As prior studies have not extensively characterized oxygen desaturation burden, we propose that reductions in VO 2 max may exist in OSA patients with only the most significant disease (as reflected by nocturnal hypoxia). Further characterizing this relationship remains important as some research suggests that positive airway pressure therapy or aerobic exercise may improve CRF in patients with OSA. In conclusion, while it likely that severe OSA, via an abnormal cardiovascular response to exercise, is associated with decreased CRF, further study is clearly warranted to include determining if OSA with decreased CRF is associated with increased morbidity or mortality.

### Research priorities for patients with heart failure and central sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112VUXn8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Schematic of ventilatory-control-system inputs/afferents that converge on integrating respiratory centers in the pons and medulla. Chemoreceptors include both peripheral and central centers. Other physical inputs to breathing include lung stretch and irritant receptors; movement/stretch receptors in muscles and joints, including receptors within the chest wall, larynx, and respiratory muscles (including in the upper airway); and peripheral pain receptors. Higher brain centers impact breathing via volitional drive, emotion, and sleep-versus-wake state (wakefulness drive to breathe). + = stimulate; − = inhibit; ± = stimulate or inhibit; C = location of respiratory groups in the medulla. Adapted by permission from Reference.

The overall responses of these respiratory-control components determine the persistence of rhythmic breathing or the development of breathing instability and recurrent central apnea. Broadly, CSA may be a consequence of low-ventilatory-drive states (often associated with concurrent arterial hypercapnia) leading to intermittent dropout of ventilatory output or may be a consequence of a hyperresponsive system leading to instability (often associated with concurrent arterial hypocapnia). The latter appears to be generally more common and accounts for CSA in the settings of heart failure, CSA observed at high altitude (i.e. environmental hypoxia), idiopathic CSA (i.e. no identifiable underlying cause), emergent CSA in patients with OSA treated with continuous PAP (CPAP), and periodic breathing in infancy.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^114AqjiS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — major conclusions on mechanisms highlight sensory sources and specific percepts. "A wide range of information arising from numerous sensory afferent sources (Table 2) contributes to multiple sensations of dyspnea (Table 3). Specific physiological processes may be linked to corresponding sensory descriptors, the best characterized of which are sensations of work or effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration". Additional conclusions state, "Sensory–perceptual mechanisms underlying sensations of work or effort and of breathing are similar to those underlying similar sensations in exercising muscle", "Tightness is relatively specific to stimulation of airway receptors in conjunction with bronchoconstriction", and "Intensity of air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration is magnified by imbalances among inspiratory drive, efferent activation (outgoing motor command from the brain), and feedback from afferent receptors throughout the respiratory system".

### Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114dpC5N]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — Apnea–Hypopnea Index (AHI) diagnostic criteria and severity thresholds are specified as follows: an OSA diagnosis is defined by ≥ 15 events/h (with or without OSA symptoms) or ≥ 5 events/h with OSA symptoms; severity of OSA classified according to AHI is defined as mild if 5–14 events/h, moderate if 15–30 events/h, and severe if ≥ 30 events/h. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire in which patients rate their chances of dozing in various situations, and the arousal index is the frequency of arousals per hour of sleep measured by electroencephalography.

### Research priorities for translating endophenotyping of adult obstructive sleep apnea to the clinic: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^117BSjsq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on OSA endophenotyping — concepts and clinical use: "Endophenotypes" refer collectively to endotypes and OSA phenotypes, and the singular "endophenotype" may be used to describe a metric that is not clearly one or the other; examples include LG and ArTH, which can decrease after CPAP therapy, and this suggests that high LG may be a reversible consequence of OSA rather than a cause in some patients. In the clinical setting, no metric should be interpreted in isolation; even the best validated endotype, OSA phenotype, or endophenotype should not replace well‑reasoned clinician judgement and should be interpreted in the context of the patient's background, concerns, comorbidities, and goals of therapy. Accordingly, the statement uses the term "endophenotype‑informed" rather than "endophenotype‑guided" for treatment decisions, and notes that an effective therapy intended to target a specific endotype should reduce the burden of upper airway obstruction with a measurable improvement in physiologic disturbances and/or patient‑centered outcomes; physiologic impact metrics and disease expression metrics may be used to assess effectiveness. The page also delineates phenotype scope and examples, including that the physiologic impact metric hypoxic burden quantifies disturbance to gas exchange and that odds ratio product (ORP) shows promise to quantify sleep disturbance, and reports that three to five "symptom subtypes" have been identified using cluster analyses; only the symptom of sleepiness would fall under "OSA phenotype".

Ultimately, however, further stages of development require demonstration of improvement in important clinical endpoints, as addressing physiologic impact does not necessarily imply patient-centered benefits. Accumulating evidence indicates that reduction of the AHI does not necessarily translate to improvement in patient-centered outcomes (,–). A truly effective treatment should alter the OSA disease process and symptom burden, improve quality of life, and/or reduce the risk of long-term sequelae. Accordingly, for prospective validation or impact analysis, studies testing endophenotype-informed therapeutic decisions should include at least one metric from each of the following two categories:
1 Altered OSA disease process by reduced adverse physiologic impact
- **Current**: AHI, time below 90% oxygen saturation, sleep quality (e.g. sleep efficiency).
- **Emerging**: Hypoxic burden, ventilatory burden, heart-rate response, ORP.
- Wherever possible, a physiologic impact metric should be accompanied by or integrate a measurement of therapeutic adherence to demonstrate a true reduction in the burden of physiologic perturbation. For example, the "effective AHI" combines the AHI and adherence to capture both the efficacy of a treatment and the actual use of treatment, thus also facilitating fair comparisons across adherence-dependent and adherence-independent (e.g. upper airway surgery) therapies.
2 Therapeutic effect according to improved OSA disease expression
- Patient-reported outcomes ○ Subjective sleepiness (e.g. Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] sleep-related impairment item) ○ Fatigue (e.g. PROMIS fatigue item, Fatigue Severity Scale) ○ Insomnia symptoms (e.g. Insomnia Severity Index) ○ Subjective sleep quality: PROMIS sleep disturbance item, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ○ Quality of life (e.g. Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index, Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire), Patient Generated Index ○ Other symptoms (e.g. nocturnal gasping/choking, nocturia, brain fog, depressed mood, bothersome snoring, erectile dysfunction)
- Objective outcomes (established or suspected): ○ Blood pressure ○ Metabolic markers (blood glucose handling parameters, glycated hemoglobin) ○ Neurocognitive (objective sleepiness/vigilance, attention, learning, memory, executive function) ○ Motor vehicle accident risk ○ Disorders: hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, etc.

Air travel risk assessment in COPD — physiologic impacts of cabin pressure and exemplar desaturation are described. Commercial aircraft are pressurized to 8,000 ft (2,438 m), equivalent to inspiring 15.1% oxygen at sea level; in healthy individuals, oxygen saturation decreases to 89 to 94% during rest and to even lower levels during exercise or sleep; for example, a stable patient with COPD with an oxygen saturation of 93% at sea level may desaturate to 82% at rest during a commercial flight and experience symptoms of hypoxemia.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — benefits and mechanisms describe that pulmonary rehabilitation is an integral component of managing chronic lung disease and reduces exertional dyspnea, improves exercise tolerance, and decreases self-reported dyspnea severity; exercise is the main component responsible for improvement, and in COPD it may decrease ventilatory requirements and respiratory rate during ambulation; patients with COPD who undergo 6 weeks of exercise training experience comparable small decreases in dyspnea intensity regardless of changes in exercise capacity.
