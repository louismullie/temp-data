## Question

DSM 5 criteria for schizophrenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic criteria and the exact symptom requirements. Then, I should verify the duration thresholds and how they are applied. Next, I will review functional impairment and exclusion criteria. After that, I need to check the dimensional assessment additions and what changed from DSM-IV to DSM-5. Finally, I will consider special populations, controversies, and practical clinical implications, making sure I cite authoritative sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnostic criteria. DSM-5 requires at least two of five characteristic symptoms, with at least one being delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech; the other qualifying symptoms are disorganized or catatonic behavior and negative symptoms, which include affective flattening, alogia, or avolition, and I should double-check that this is accurate before proceeding [^4be21a4c] [^83a2fc00].

> Wait, let me verify the duration requirements because this is easy to misstate. The total duration of continuous illness must be at least 6 months, and within that 6 months there must be at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms meeting Criterion A; the 6-month clock includes prodromal and residual phases, so I need to ensure I'm not implying that all 6 months must be full-blown psychosis, which would be incorrect [^4be21a4c] [^83a2fc00].

> I should confirm the functional impairment criterion. There must be clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or academic functioning, and I need to ensure I'm not overstating this as an absolute requirement for every single case, even though DSM-5 frames it as a core expectation for diagnosis and clinical significance [^4be21a4c] [^fdb384e2].

> Next, I should review exclusion criteria. The disturbance cannot be better explained by schizoaffective disorder, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or a general medical condition, and I should double-check that I'm not missing any of these exclusions before moving on [^4be21a4c] [^ae249da5].

> Hold on, I should verify what changed from DSM-IV to DSM-5 because this often causes confusion. DSM-5 eliminated the classic subtypes such as paranoid, disorganized, and catatonic due to poor longitudinal stability and limited prognostic utility, and it de-emphasized Schneiderian first-rank symptoms, removing their special diagnostic weight; it also introduced a dimensional severity scale for five symptom domains and clarified catatonia as a specifier across psychotic and mood disorders rather than a subtype of schizophrenia [^4be21a4c] [^5e0de970] [^4793e611].

> Let me consider the dimensional assessment addition. DSM-5 includes the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity, covering positive, negative, disorganized, depressed, and manic symptoms, and I should confirm that this is intended to complement, not replace, categorical diagnosis and to support measurement-based care in routine practice [^cbd7f940] [^96ad67bf].

> I need to check special populations and contexts. For children and adolescents, the same DSM-5 criteria apply, but diagnostic reassessment over time is emphasized because presentations evolve; for first-episode psychosis, guidelines suggest, when safely feasible, a brief medication-free observation period to clarify diagnosis and exclude substance-induced or brief psychotic disorders, which I should frame carefully with risk mitigation in mind [^2cbf4e0a] [^8897871f].

> But wait, what about attenuated psychosis syndrome and early detection. DSM-5 placed Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome in Section III as a condition for further study due to concerns about false positives, stigma, and premature antipsychotic use; I should confirm that while CHR instruments have prognostic utility at the group level, individual prediction remains limited and requires cautious, staged care pathways [^0002e3e9] [^70c862d3].

> I should double-check the role of first-rank symptoms because clinicians often ask. Although historically emphasized, DSM-5 removed their privileged status due to limited specificity; a Cochrane review shows sensitivity around 57–61% and specificity around 74–81% for differentiating schizophrenia from other psychoses, so I need to caution against overreliance on them in isolation [^eb04859e] [^4be21a4c].

> Let me reconsider the nosologic implications so I don't overstate categorical validity. Contemporary reviews emphasize that schizophrenia remains a syndromic diagnosis with overlapping boundaries to affective psychoses and shared genetic liabilities, reinforcing the value of dimensional approaches and the need for longitudinal, course-informed assessment in both research and care [^ae249da5] [^8b7b6e3f].

> Finally, I should confirm practical clinical steps. Accurate diagnosis relies on structured clinical interviews, collateral information, careful exclusion of substance effects and medical causes, and repeated assessments over time; integrating dimensional ratings and functional measures improves diagnostic reliability and guides treatment planning, which aligns with best-practice guidelines for initial evaluation and follow-up [^c4e07a12] [^96ad67bf].

The DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia requires **two or more characteristic symptoms** (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms) for at least 1 month, with at least one being delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The total duration of illness, including prodromal and residual phases, must be **at least 6 months**, and there must be significant functional impairment in work, social, or self-care. The diagnosis excludes substance-induced or medical causes and requires differentiation from schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders with psychotic features, and other psychotic disorders. DSM-5 removed subtypes and added a dimensional severity scale to better capture symptom heterogeneity and guide treatment [^4be21a4c] [^cbd7f940].

---

## Core diagnostic criteria (criterion a)

Criterion A requires **two or more** of the following, with at least one from the first three:

- **Delusions**: Fixed false beliefs not grounded in cultural norms.
- **Hallucinations**: Perceptions without external stimuli; auditory hallucinations are most common.
- **Disorganized speech**: Incoherent, derailed, or tangential communication.
- **Disorganized or catatonic behavior**: Markedly disorganized motor behavior or catatonia.
- **Negative symptoms**: Diminished emotional expression, avolition, alogia, or anhedonia.

---

## Duration requirements (criterion b)

Criterion B requires **continuous signs** for at least 6 months, including at least 1 month of active-phase symptoms (Criterion A). Prodromal or residual symptoms (e.g. negative symptoms, social withdrawal) may precede or follow the active phase.

---

## Functional impairment (criterion c)

Criterion C requires **significant impairment** in one or more major areas of functioning, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, representing a decline from premorbid levels.

---

## Exclusion criteria (criteria d and e)

Criterion D excludes **substance-induced or medical causes**; the disturbance must not be attributable to substance use, medication, or a general medical condition. Criterion E excludes **mood disorders**; the disturbance must not be better explained by schizoaffective disorder, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other psychotic disorders.

---

## Changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5

- **Removal of subtypes**: Paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual subtypes were eliminated due to poor reliability and limited clinical utility [^6f650180] [^ee9f6423].
- **Dimensional assessment**: Introduction of a dimensional severity scale for core symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, negative symptoms) to capture symptom heterogeneity [^cbd7f940] [^da42f44b].
- **Catatonia specifier**: Catatonia can now be specified across psychotic and mood disorders, reflecting its transdiagnostic nature [^5e0de970].

---

## Clinical implications

The DSM-5 criteria emphasize **early identification** and **accurate diagnosis** to guide treatment and improve outcomes. The removal of subtypes and addition of dimensional assessment support individualized care and research into symptom dimensions [^6f650180] [^da42f44b].

---

## Controversies and limitations

Controversies and limitations include **heterogeneity**, as the criteria still encompass a broad, heterogeneous syndrome with variable course and treatment response [^ae249da5] [^8b7b6e3f]. The **lack of biomarkers** means diagnosis remains clinical, risking misdiagnosis and delayed treatment [^85f642ac]. The **validity concerns** reflect ongoing debate about the construct validity of schizophrenia and the need for more precise, biologically informed definitions [^8b7b6e3f] [^1f223883].

---

The DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia require two or more characteristic symptoms for at least 1 month, a total duration of at least 6 months, significant functional impairment, and exclusion of other causes. These criteria balance reliability and clinical utility while acknowledging the disorder's heterogeneity and the need for ongoing research [^6f650180] [^ae249da5].

### Structure of the psychotic disorders classification in DSM-5 [^ce7faf70]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders attract great interest among clinicians, researchers, and the lay public. While the diagnostic features of schizophrenia have remained unchanged for more than 100 years, the mechanism of illness has remained elusive. There is increasing evidence that the categorical diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders contributes to this lack of progress. The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) continues the categorical classification of psychiatric disorders since the research needed to establish a new nosology of equal or greater validity is lacking. However, even within a categorical system, the DSM-5 aims to capture the underlying dimensional structure of psychosis. The domains of psychopathology that define psychotic disorders are presented not simply as features of schizophrenia. The level, the number, and the duration of psychotic signs and symptoms are used to demarcate psychotic disorders from each other. Finally, the categorical assessment is complemented with a dimensional assessment of psychosis that allows for more specific and individualized assessment of patients. The structure of psychosis as outlined in the DSM-5 may serve as a stepping-stone towards a more valid classification system, as we await new data to redefine psychotic disorders.

### The DSM-5 proposal for attenuated psychosis syndrome: a history [^f27cb312]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This article narrates a consensus history of the proposal to include diagnostic criteria for a psychosis risk syndrome in the DSM-5, in part, to document what happened, but also to potentially help focus future efforts at clinically useful early detection. The purpose of diagnosing a risk state would be to slow and ideally prevent the development of the full disorder. Concerns about diagnosing a psychosis risk state included a high false positive rate, potentially harmful use of anti-psychotic medication with people who would not transition to psychosis, and stigmatization. Others argued that educating professionals about what 'risk' entails could reduce inappropriate treatments. During the revision, the proposal shifted from diagnosing risk to emphasizing current clinical need associated with attenuated psychotic symptoms. Within the community of researchers who studied psychosis risk, people disagreed about whether risk and/or attenuated symptoms should be an official DSM-5 diagnosis. Once it became clear that the DSM-5 field trials did not include enough cases to establish the reliability of the proposed criteria, everyone agreed that the criteria should be put in a section on conditions for further study rather the main section of the DSM-5. We close with recommendations about some practical benchmarks that should be met for including criteria for early detection in the classification system.

### Definition and description of schizophrenia in the DSM-5 [^6f650180]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease for over a century, its definitions and boundaries have changed over this period and its etiology and pathophysiology remain elusive. Despite changing definitions, DSM-IV schizophrenia is reliably diagnosed, has fair validity and conveys useful clinical information. Therefore, the essence of the broad DSM-IV definition of schizophrenia is retained in DSM-5. The clinical manifestations are extremely diverse, however, with this heterogeneity being poorly explained by the DSM-IV clinical subtypes and course specifiers. Additionally, the boundaries of schizophrenia are imprecisely demarcated from schizoaffective disorder and other diagnostic categories and its special emphasis on Schneiderian "first-rank" symptoms appears misplaced. Changes in the definition of schizophrenia in DSM-5 seek to address these shortcomings and incorporate the new information about the nature of the disorder accumulated over the past two decades. Specific changes in its definition include elimination of the classic subtypes, addition of unique psychopathological dimensions, clarification of cross-sectional and longitudinal course specifiers, elimination of special treatment of Schneiderian 'first-rank symptoms', better delineation of schizophrenia from schizoaffective disorder, and clarification of the relationship of schizophrenia to catatonia. These changes should improve diagnosis and characterization of individuals with schizophrenia and facilitate measurement-based treatment and concurrently provide a more useful platform for research that will elucidate its nature and permit a more precise future delineation of the 'schizophrenias'.

### Defining psychosis: the evolution of DSM-5 schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^ef235a13]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Descriptions of mental illness exist throughout recorded history. However, until the mid-twentieth century, there was no standard nosology or diagnostic standard for mental disorders. This limited understanding of these disorders and development of better treatments. As conditions such as dementia praecox and schizophrenia were being described, collaborative efforts were made in the twentieth century to develop the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This review provides an overview of the history of psychiatric diagnosis with a focus on the history of schizophrenia as a diagnosis in the DSM. DSM-5 updates to diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and related disorders are provided. Limitations to diagnostic validity and reliability are discussed in addition to changes in diagnostic approaches to schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders in an effort to improve diagnostic validity and reliability. The DSM-5 reflects the culmination of an ongoing collaborative effort to improve the diagnosis of mental disorders, and future research in Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will help provide convergent validity when understanding and treating mental illnesses.

### The DSM-5: classification and criteria changes [^2ab0f985]. World Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) marks the first significant revision of the publication since the DSM-IV in 1994. Changes to the DSM were largely informed by advancements in neuroscience, clinical and public health need, and identified problems with the classification system and criteria put forth in the DSM-IV. Much of the decision-making was also driven by a desire to ensure better alignment with the International Classification of Diseases and its upcoming 11th edition (ICD-11). In this paper, we describe select revisions in the DSM-5, with an emphasis on changes projected to have the greatest clinical impact and those that demonstrate efforts to enhance international compatibility, including integration of cultural context with diagnostic criteria and changes that facilitate DSM-ICD harmonization. It is anticipated that this collaborative spirit between the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) will continue as the DSM-5 is updated further, bringing the field of psychiatry even closer to a singular, cohesive nosology.

Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

Does DSM-5 facilitate diagnosis of schizophrenia?

Martin Brüne

Martin Brüne is Professor of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry and Psychiatric Preventive Medicine at the LWL University Hospital of Psychiatry, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. His main research interest is social cognition in patients with schizophrenia, and the study of psychopathology from an evolutionary perspective.

In May 2013, the APA released the DSM-5, and even in its nascent state, it has already incited controversy about its usefulness and appropriateness. In this essay, I focus on the clinical issues relating to psychotic disorders, although there are of course other changes made to DSM that are equally debatable. There is also a need for a more general discussion about the usefulness of a categorical classification versus dimensional approaches respecting the applicability of DSM-5 for scientific purposes.

With regard to psychosis, the question as to whether or not high-risk states should be included in the manual has been a focus of intense discussion about the pros and cons of doing so. On the one hand, concern has arisen as to whether the inclusion of high-risk states may promote stigmatization of individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for a high-risk condition, especially in light of findings suggesting that a transition to psychosis occurs in only about 20% of cases within the first 6 months, although this does rise closer to 40% at 3-year follow-up. On the other hand, it has been argued that such an approach could actually improve mental health care by encouraging earlier provision of indicated prevention based on clinical staging, compared with the current clinical reality for most patients with first episodes of psychosis. The inclusion of high-risk states for psychosis in DSM-5 was eventually dropped, possibly owing to recent reports suggesting that early intervention such as cognitive therapy does not reduce the transition rate to psychosis, and may at best lead to a delay of psychosis onset.

### The case for including attenuated psychotic symptoms syndrome in DSM-5 as a psychosis risk syndrome [^131d2855]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association Task Force on DSM-5 has recently proposed consideration of Attenuated Psychotic Symptoms Syndrome as a new diagnosis, based on nearly 15 years of prospective research in centers across the globe. The condition is also known as "psychosis risk syndrome", "at-risk mental state", "ultra-high risk", and "putative prodrome". We review evidence favoring its inclusion as a new diagnosis in DSM-5 and report new preliminary findings on DSM-IV diagnoses in current clinical use for these patients and on results of diagnostic interviews in unselected volunteers. The main evidence supporting inclusion is: (1) the patients are currently ill, (2) the patients are at high risk for getting worse, (3) no DSM-IV diagnosis accurately captures their current illness or future risk, (4) the diagnosis has been made with reliability and validity in the research setting, and (5) placement in DSM-5 would help promote the needed treatment and prevention research to enable articulation of a standard of care to benefit these patients and their families. Potential harms can be minimized by patient, family, and provider education. It will be important to demonstrate through well-designed field trials whether the diagnostic criteria can be used with reliability in everyday clinical practice.

### Diagnosing schizophrenia circa 2005: how and why? [^9d6c8827]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition in 1980, schizophrenia has been widely diagnosed with good to excellent levels of reliability. This is no small feat, as prior to the 1970s the reliability of this diagnosis over time and place was very poor. Although there have been some changes in the diagnostic algorithm for schizophrenia with subsequent revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, there has been little change in the overall classification scheme. However, there has also been relatively little movement toward enhancing the validity of this diagnosis. Although there is broad consensus that what we now call schizophrenia is probably very heterogeneous with respect to underlying etiology and pathophysiology, attempts to identify more valid subtypes or dimensions have not progressed to the point that they are likely to be incorporated into diagnostic systems any time soon. The limited progress in defining more valid disease categories has increasingly important clinical implications as the field moves more and more to treatment by preset algorithms that are typically driven by diagnosis.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^043dd445]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

With regard to the changes made in DSM-5 respecting the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, these seem, at first sight, subtle, but may have more profound effects on how clinicians diagnose and treat patients with schizophrenia. Discarding Schneider's first-rank symptoms as non-specific breaks with the traditional view that disturbances of 'ego-boundaries' (in Anglo-American conceptualizations of psychosis commonly subsumed under the symptomatic spectrum of delusional beliefs) have 'core' diagnostic validity. This need not be a bad thing, and it would not be justifiable to keep Schneider's first-rank symptoms simply based on historical grounds. However, this paradigmatic shift reflects inconsistency of the diagnostic validity of schizophrenia symptoms occurring with high-risk symptoms. In fact, auditory hallucinations in the form of commenting voices and other first-rank symptoms are 'core' to all early recognition manuals, including the most widely used Structured Interview for Psychotic Symptoms (SIPS) or the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS). Put another way, how can a clinician diagnose an at-risk state based on symptoms that are discarded for the full-blown syndrome?

In a similar vein, dropping the traditional sub-types of schizophrenia in DSM-5 based on alleged diagnostic instability over time can be criticized based on evidence from older work suggesting the opposite, especially when rigorous diagnostic criteria apply. The lack of evidence with regard to differences between the sub-types in response to treatment or longitudinal course is probably based more on a lack of research, rather than on a genuine lack of differences in these respects. In fact, it was the explicit goal of the early protagonists in psychiatry such as Kahlbaum and Kraepelin to describe clinical 'entities' based on symptomatology (which at the time included not just the subjective aspect of symptomatology, but also non-verbal and paraverbal abnormalities in expression), course and outcome. This approach has certainly failed, at least to some degree, yet many clinicians probably share the view that an insidious early onset of schizophrenia, rapid development of negative symptoms, poor insight, and behavioral abnormalities (that is, hebephrenia) is generally associated with a poorer prognosis respecting recovery, social functioning, and quality of life, compared with patients with acute paranoid schizophrenia.

### Impact of DSM-5 changes on the diagnosis and acute treatment of schizophrenia [^4793e611]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the consequences and validity of changes in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, eg, omission of subtypes, using a large dataset of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials.

Methods

Data from 22 short-term efficacy registration trials of second generation antipsychotics for the treatment of acute psychotic episodes in patients with schizophrenia (N = 5233), submitted to the Dutch regulatory authority were analyzed. We examined whether patients in these pre-DSM-5 trials met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to DSM-5. Using linear regression, we examined differences in effect size between DSM-IV subtypes and between DSM-5 symptom dimensions.

Results

Over 99.5% of the patients met DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and no differences in effect size were found between schizophrenia subtypes (P = 0.65). Symptom dimensions that respond best to treatment with second generation antipsychotics were hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and mania (Hedge's g -0.23 to -0.31).

Conclusions

Results of clinical trials in patients with pre-DSM-5 schizophrenia also apply to patients diagnosed with DSM-5 schizophrenia. Omission of the classic subtypes is justified as they are not predictive of response to treatment. The DSM-5 C-RDPSS scale adds valuable information to the categorical diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is relevant for antipsychotic response.

### Logic and justification for dimensional assessment of symptoms and related clinical phenomena in psychosis: relevance to DSM-5 [^da42f44b]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Work on the causes and treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders has long recognized the heterogeneity of the symptoms that can be displayed by individuals with these illnesses. Further, researchers have increasingly emphasized the ways in which the severity of different symptoms of this illness can vary across individuals, and have provided evidence that the severity of such symptoms can predict other important aspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive and/or neurobiological deficits. Additionally, research has increasingly emphasized that the boundaries between nosological entities may not be categorical and that the comorbidity of disorders may reflect impairments in common dimensions of genetic variation, human behavior and neurobiological function. As such, it is critical to focus on a dimensional approach to the assessment of symptoms and clinically relevant phenomena in psychosis, so as to increase attention to and understanding of the causes and consequences of such variation. In the current article, we review the logic and justification for including dimensional assessment of clinical symptoms in the evaluation of psychosis in the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

### Heterogeneity in psychiatric diagnostic classification [^1d7db0d0]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The theory and practice of psychiatric diagnosis are central yet contentious. This paper examines the heterogeneous nature of categories within the DSM-5, how this heterogeneity is expressed across diagnostic criteria, and its consequences for clinicians, clients, and the diagnostic model. Selected chapters of the DSM-5 were thematically analysed: schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; bipolar and related disorders; depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; and trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Themes identified heterogeneity in specific diagnostic criteria, including symptom comparators, duration of difficulties, indicators of severity, and perspective used to assess difficulties. Wider variations across diagnostic categories examined symptom overlap across categories, and the role of trauma. Pragmatic criteria and difficulties that recur across multiple diagnostic categories offer flexibility for the clinician, but undermine the model of discrete categories of disorder. This nevertheless has implications for the way cause is conceptualised, such as implying that trauma affects only a limited number of diagnoses despite increasing evidence to the contrary. Individual experiences and specific causal pathways within diagnostic categories may also be obscured. A pragmatic approach to psychiatric assessment, allowing for recognition of individual experience, may therefore be a more effective way of understanding distress than maintaining commitment to a disingenuous categorical system.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^6e41dac3]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although imperfect, and we could be critical of one or another of the individual changes in DSM-5, it is the natural and appropriate evolution of the DSM based on current evidence, from the original classification system that started with DSM-I in 1952. One example of a solid improvement is the removal of the exclusion criterion for bipolar disorder if a patient 'switched' into a manic episode after treatment with an antidepressant. Because there is now overwhelming evidence that such 'switches' occur uniquely in patients with bipolar disorder and not in those without bipolar disorder, that exclusion criterion present in DSM-IV has now been removed. Similarly, the relocation of premenstrual dysphoric disorder from the Appendix to the Mood Disorders section is based on a decade of research validating this diagnosis.

So why all the controversy? Do the American Neurological Association or the American Cancer Society meetings have demonstrators outside their national meetings protesting their disease classifications? Do they have those in their ranks refusing to use their new ICD-10 disease classification? Clearly not.

Was DSM-5 handed down to our field on tablets from Mount Sinai? Of course not. Were the designers of DSM-5 intentionally anti-scientific? Of course not.

Will DSM-5 further the field by clarifying categorical disease classification? Yes.

Overall, is it an improvement over DSM-IV? Yes, but perhaps not what we all wished for at this stage in our field.

Will DSM-6 include sensitive and specific diagnostic tests that are biologically based for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and PTSD, to name a few? We all certainly hope so.

### How should DSM-V criteria for schizophrenia include cognitive impairment? [^0cab5066]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Neurocognitive impairment is considered a core component of schizophrenia and is increasingly under investigation as a potential treatment target. On average, cognitive impairment is severe to moderately severe compared with healthy controls, and almost all patients with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive decrements compared with their expected level if they had not developed the illness. Compared with patients with affective disorders, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia appears earlier, is more severe, and tends to be more independent of clinical symptoms. While the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, description of schizophrenia includes several references to cognitive impairment, neither the diagnostic criteria nor the subtypology of schizophrenia include a requirement of cognitive impairment. We forward for consideration a proposal that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria include a specific criterion of "a level of cognitive functioning suggesting a consistent severe impairment and/or a significant decline from premorbid levels considering the patient's educational, familial, and socioeconomic background". The inclusion of this criterion may increase the "point of rarity" with affective psychoses and may increase clinicians' awareness of cognitive impairment, potentially leading to more accurate prognosis and better treatment outcomes. Future research will need to address the validity of these possibilities. The reliable determination of cognitive impairment as part of a standard diagnostic evaluation may present challenges to diagnosticians with limited resources or insufficient expertise. Various cognitive assessment methods for clinicians, including brief assessments and interview-based assessments, are discussed. Given the current emphasis on the development of cognitive treatments, the evaluation of cognition in schizophrenia is an essential component of mental health education.

### Toward defining schizophrenia as a more useful clinical concept [^237fefff]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Delineating schizophrenia remains elusive despite considerable interest and study for more than a century. During this time, a variety of terms and defining features have been ascribed to the construct. The predominant contemporary construct, for which substantial limitations persist, has changed little in the past 30 years. With the approaching arrival of the DSM-V, interest in the nosology of schizophrenia has rebounded. Recent publications have focused principally on the following: integrating dimensional approaches to diagnosis, subtypes of schizophrenia, endophenotypes, and identifying those at early risk as part of a staging process. Some have even suggested replacing the term. Although an etiopathic diagnosis remains out of reach, contemporary research is marching down several distinct paths toward defining schizophrenia as a construct of greater clinical utility.

### Schizophrenia [^ae249da5]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of history and by examination of the mental state; there are no diagnostic tests or biomarkers. Schizophrenia usually presents with psychosis and the main differential diagnoses, in DSM5, are affective psychoses (bipolar disorder with psychotic features and major depressive disorder with psychotic features), other, closely related, non-affective psychoses (schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified), substance induced psychotic disorders (alcohol induced, other substance induced) and psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. Differential diagnosis takes into account the duration of illness, the nature and pattern of associated substance abuse, the co-occurrence of depression or mania and the presence of somatic illness.

Schizophrenia, like the majority of psychiatric diagnoses, remains a syndromic concept. The use of operational criteria, such as those embodied in the Diagnostic or Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM), or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World Health Organisationhas provided a reliable approach to making psychiatric diagnoses in the clinic. However, the assumption that the clinical syndromes defined in this way represent valid disease entities with distinct underlying aetiology and pathogenesis is increasingly seen as having impeded research. – Indeed psychiatric diagnoses have the unusual property of being simultaneously too broad and too narrow. Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia vary greatly in predominant symptoms, response to treatment, course and outcome. However, attempts to resolve this heterogeneity into valid subtypes has repeatedly failed. On the other hand, many psychiatric diagnoses have symptoms in common (Box 1) and the boundaries between schizophrenia and other disorders are indistinct as are the boundaries between disorder and wellness. With regard to the latter there is an increasing realization that psychotic symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations and paranoid thinking, occur in attenuated form in 5–8% of the healthy population. This has led to suggestions that dimensional approaches to diagnosis and classification might replace or enhance current categorical approaches.

### Schizoaffective disorder in the DSM-5 [^c5d31f31]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Characterization of patients with both psychotic and mood symptoms, either concurrently or at different points during their illness, has always posed a nosological challenge and this is reflected in the poor reliability, low diagnostic stability, and questionable validity of DSM-IV Schizoaffective Disorder. The clinical reality of the frequent co-occurrence of psychosis and Mood Episodes has also resulted in over-utilization of a diagnostic category that was originally intended to only rarely be needed. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, an effort is made to improve reliability of this condition by providing more specific criteria and the concept of Schizoaffective Disorder shifts from an episode diagnosis in DSM-IV to a life-course of the illness in DSM-5. When psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a Mood Episode, DSM-5 indicates that the diagnosis is the appropriate Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features, but when such a psychotic condition includes at least a two-week period of psychosis without prominent mood symptoms, the diagnosis may be either Schizoaffective Disorder or Schizophrenia. In the DSM-5, the diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder can be made only if full Mood Disorder episodes have been present for the majority of the total active and residual course of illness, from the onset of psychotic symptoms up until the current diagnosis. In earlier DSM versions the boundary between Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder was only qualitatively defined, leading to poor reliability. This change will provide a clearer separation between Schizophrenia with mood symptoms from Schizoaffective Disorder and will also likely reduce rates of diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder while increasing the stability of this diagnosis once made.

### Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia… [^28750a5d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- We compared the joint frequencies and reliabilities of the following sets of criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia: the New Haven Schizophrenia Index; the Carpenter, Strauss, Bartko system; DSM-III; Research Diagnostic Criteria; the Feighner system; and the 1975 criteria of Taylor and Abrams. The systems, of essentially equal reliability, varied sevenfold in their rates of diagnosing schizophrenia. Patients in whom schizophrenia was diagnosed by the lower-rate systems were likely to receive the same diagnosis by the higher-rate systems. This tends not to be the case when an affective syndrome is present. Endicott J, Nee J, Fleiss J, Cohen J, Williams JBW, Simon R.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^017aea1d]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Development of the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), slated for publication in mid-2013, included a reconsideration of the relationship between psychosis occurring during major mental illness, specifically bipolar I disorder (BD I), schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia. These discussions emerged before formal work on DSM-5 began based on critical review of the emerging data on the biological overlap between disorders seen particularly in genetics studies. Historically, there has not been agreement about how biological research should best be interpreted to inform nosological boundaries specifically distinguishing psychotic disorders and, more broadly, all psychiatric disorders. On a phenotypic level, the lines of demarcation are concretely outlined in the current version of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR; see Figure 1), but the clinical features that distinguish disorders are often unclear or overlapping at the level of the presenting patient. Further, the DSM's precise nosology is often incompatible with first person experiences of mental illness.

### A transdiagnostic review of negative symptom phenomenology and etiology [^ff669d79]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

In the DSM5, negative symptoms are 1 of the 5 core dimensions of psychopathology evaluated for schizophrenia. However, negative symptoms are not pathognomonic-they are also part of the diagnostic criteria for other schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, disorders that sometimes have comorbid psychosis, diagnoses not in the schizophrenia-spectrum, and the general "nonclinical" population. Although etiological models of negative symptoms have been developed for chronic schizophrenia, there has been little attention given to whether these models have transdiagnostic applicability. In the current review, we examine areas of commonality and divergence in the clinical presentation and etiology of negative symptoms across diagnostic categories. It was concluded that negative symptoms are relatively frequent across diagnostic categories, but individual disorders may differ in whether their negative symptoms are persistent/transient or primary/secondary. Evidence for separate dimensions of volitional and expressive symptoms exists, and there may be multiple mechanistic pathways to the same symptom phenomenon among DSM-5 disorders within and outside the schizophrenia-spectrum (ie, equifinality). Evidence for a novel transdiagnostic etiological model is presented based on the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) constructs, which proposes the existence of 2 such pathways-a hedonic pathway and a cognitive pathway-that can both lead to expressive or volitional symptoms. To facilitate treatment breakthroughs, future transdiagnostic studies on negative symptoms are warranted that explore mechanisms underlying volitional and expressive pathology.

### The nosology of schizophrenia: toward DSM-5 and ICD-11 [^2203e46a]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease entity for more than a century, definitions and boundaries have changed and its precise cause and pathophysiology remain elusive. Despite uncertain validity, the construct of schizophrenia conveys useful clinical and etiopathophysiologic information. Revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classification of Diseases seek to incorporate new information about schizophrenia and include elimination of subtypes, addition of psychopathological dimensions, elimination of special treatment of Schneiderian "first-rank" symptoms, better delineation of schizoaffective disorder, and addition of a new category of "attenuated psychosis syndrome".

### What is a mental disorder? An exemplar-focused approach [^4756bd63]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Suicidal behavior disorder is included in DSM-5 as a condition for further study. Clearly, it is important for clinicians to be aware of suicidal behavior, and this is often an important target of treatment. On the other hand, suicidal behavior may be due to a range of different mental disorders, reflecting a range of different kinds of dysfunction. Furthermore, suicidal behavior is not always associated with a mental disorder; there is a compelling argument that in particular medical circumstances, it is understandable and appropriate for patients to make a decision to end their lives. Suicide can also arise as a form of political protest or a culturally sanctioned response to shame. Judgments about diagnostic validity may be complex, including consideration of a range of different empirical data of varying quality. This point is also exemplified by other entities included in DSM-5 as conditions for further study, namely persistent complex bereavement disorder, depressive episodes with short-duration hypomania, caffeine use disorder, non-suicidal self-injury, and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (American Psychiatric Association).

Pragmatic concerns

Simple (type) schizophrenia (SS) or simple deteriorative disorder has long been controversial (Serra-Mestres et al.). It has not been included in the nosology since DSM-III (although it was included in DSM-IV as a condition for further study), and while it was in ICD-10 it is not in ICD-11. There is indeed some evidence that simple schizophrenia is a rare deteriorative disorder characterized by nonspecific negative symptoms and an absence of psychotic symptoms. However, while previous iterations of DSM contained schizophrenia sub-types, these were appropriately removed due to a lack of diagnostic validity and reliability, and evidence that schizophrenia is a spectrum disorder (Serra-Mestres et al; Whitwell, Bramham, & Moriarty). Nevertheless, the fact that there continue to be patients who present with these kinds of deteriorative symptoms has been used to support claims that the diagnosis remains relevant (Whitwell et al.). This exemplar illustrates that there is a distinction between judgments regarding whether a condition is a mental disorder, and judgments regarding whether it should be included in the nosology.

### Phenomenology of schizophrenia and the representativeness of modern diagnostic criteria [^08ae61e9]. JAMA Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

This article aims to determine the degree to which modern operationalized diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia reflect the main clinical features of the disorder as described historically by diagnostic experts.

Observations

Amazon.com, the National Library of Medicine, and Forgottenbooks.com were searched for articles written or translated into English from 1900 to 1960. Clinical descriptions of schizophrenia or dementia praecox appearing in 16 textbooks or review articles published between 1899 and 1956 were reviewed and compared with the criteria for schizophrenia from 6 modern US operationalized diagnostic systems. Twenty prominent symptoms and signs were reported by 5 or more authors. A strong association was seen between the frequency with which the symptoms/signs were reported and the likelihood of their presence in modern diagnostic systems. Of these 20 symptoms/signs, 3 (thought disorder, delusions, and hallucinations) were included in all diagnostic systems and were among the 4 most frequently reported. Three symptoms/signs were added then kept in subsequent criteria: emotional blunting, changes in volition, and changes in social life. Three symptoms/signs were added but then dropped: bizarre delusions, passivity symptoms, and mood incongruity. Eleven symptoms/signs were never included in any diagnostic system. Compared with historical authors, modern criteria favored symptoms over signs. Odd movements and postures, noted by 16 of 18 historical authors, were absent from all modern criteria. DSM-5 criteria contain 6 of the 20 historically noted symptoms/signs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although modern operationalized criteria for schizophrenia reflect symptoms and signs commonly reported by historical experts, many clinical features emphasized by these experts are absent from modern criteria. This is not necessarily problematic as diagnostic criteria are meant to index rather than thoroughly describe syndromes. However, the lack of correspondence in schizophrenia between historically important symptoms/signs and current diagnostic systems highlights the limitations of clinical evaluations and research studies that restrict the diagnostic assessments to current diagnostic criteria. We should not confuse our DSM diagnostic criteria with the disorders that they were designed to index.

### DSM-5 and RDoC: progress in psychiatry research? [^6643b4a0]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2013). Medium credibility.

Neuroscience studies into psychiatric disorders generally rely on disease definitions that are based on the influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the fifth edition of which (DSM-5) was released earlier this year. Designed as a purely diagnostic tool, the DSM considers different disorders as distinct entities. However, boundaries between disorders are often not as strict as the DSM suggests. To provide an alternative framework for research into psychiatric disorders, the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently introduced its Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project. In the RDoC, five 'domains' each reflect a brain system in which functioning is impaired, to different degrees, in different psychiatric conditions. Nature Reviews Neuroscience asked six leading investigators for their thoughts on how DSM-5 and the RDoC will influence neuroscience research into psychiatric disorders.

### Towards the DSM-6: results of a survey of experts on the reintroduction of first-rank symptoms as core criteria of schizophrenia and on redefining hallucinations [^2441c240]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic criteria for mental disorders are subject to change. This is particularly true for schizophrenia, whose diagnostic criteria in the current DSM-5 bear little resemblance to what Kraepelin once named "dementia praecox" and Bleuler termed "the schizophrenias". The present study reports results from a survey of experts on two core topics of schizophrenia: (a) whether subsequent editions of the DSM should once again give the Schneiderian first-rank symptoms (FRS; eg, thought broadcasting) the prominent role they had in the DSM-IV and (b) whether the currently quite narrow definition of hallucinations in the DSM-5 requiring them to be vivid and clear and have the full force and impact of normal perceptions should be broadened to incorporate perceptual-like phenomena that the individual can differentiate from proper perceptions but still perceives as real and externally generated.

Hypothesis

The aim of the survey was to learn about experts' opinions with no clear hypotheses.

Study Design

International experts on schizophrenia were recruited via various sources and invited to participate in a short online survey. The final sample comprised 136 experts with a subgroup of 53 experts with verified identity and at least 6 years of clinical and/or research experience.

Study Results

Slightly more experts voted in favor (49.3%) of returning FRS to the prominent role they had in earlier versions of the DSM than against (34.6%). Approximately four out of five experts agreed that the definition of hallucinations in the DSM should be expanded. According to the results, alongside internal symptoms that are phenomenologically indistinguishable from true perceptions, sensory intrusions that the holder is convinced were inserted from another source (ie, not self-generated) should be included in the definition.

Conclusions

While a large majority of experts recommend a change in the definition of hallucinations, the experts' opinions on FRS are more mixed. We hope that this article will stimulate future studies targeting the diagnostic relevance of these symptoms and encourage discussion about the definition of core psychotic symptoms and the diagnostic criteria for the upcoming edition of the DSM.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^2cbf4e0a]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 2 — diagnostic approach: the diagnosis of schizophrenia in children and adolescents should follow DSM-5 criteria, using the same criteria as for adults. A comprehensive diagnostic assessment includes interviews with the child or adolescent and the family plus review of records and ancillary information; diagnostic accuracy may be improved by using a structured diagnostic interview designed for youth that includes a psychosis module. Diagnostic status should be reassessed over time because presentations tend to change, especially during the first few years of illness, and in some cases decreasing a child's medication burden (including attempting a medication-free trial if possible) may be indicated to clarify a complicated clinical presentation.

### Psychiatric comorbidity: a concept in need of a theory [^b1bd7c29]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Here, OCD symptomatology is present in a patient, who also fulfils the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, p. 237), criterion D specifies that a diagnosis of OCD should not be made if the disturbance is better explained by another diagnosis. It is certainly possible that the OCD symptomology in this patient is a part of schizophrenia. Yet, DSM-5 also states, 'OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders… when one of those other disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For example, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of OCD is approximately 12%' (American Psychiatric Association, p. 242). How is the clinician to know whether the obsessions and compulsions are 'better explained' by schizophrenia (which would be the case in ICD-10 due to its hierarchical principles) or if making a comorbid diagnosis of OCD is the sound clinical judgment? Although the patient demonstrates some degree of insight, he is unable to resist or suppress the intrusive thoughts and images, which occur automatically with a weakened sense of being generated by the patient. In classical psychopathological literature, such symptoms exemplify pseudo-obsessive phenomena, which are characteristic of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (for reviews, see Bürgy; Rasmussen & Parnas).

### Competing definitions of schizophrenia: what can be learned from polydiagnostic studies? [^e89fba24]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

The contemporary diagnoses of schizophrenia (sz)-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision(ICD-10)-are widely considered as important scientific achievements. However, these algorithms were not a product of explicit conceptual analyses and empirical studies but defined through consensus with the purpose of improving reliability. The validity status of current definitions and of their predecessors remains unclear. The so-called "polydiagnostic approach" applies different definitions of a disorder to the same patient sample in order to compare these definitions on potential validity indicators. We reviewed 92 polydiagnostic sz studies published since the early 1970s. Different sz definitions show a considerable variation concerning frequency, concordance, reliability, outcome, and other validity measures. The DSM-IV and the ICD-10 show moderate reliability but both definitions appear weak in terms of concurrent validity, eg, with respect to an aggregation of a priori important features. The first-rank symptoms of Schneider are not associated with family history of sz or with prediction of poor outcome. The introduction of long duration criteria and exclusion of affective syndromes tend to restrict the diagnosis to chronic stable patients. Patients fulfilling the majority of definitions (core sz patients) do not seem to constitute a strongly valid subgroup but rather a severely ill subgroup. Paradoxically, it seems that a century after the introduction of the sz concept, research is still badly needed, concerning conceptual and construct validity of sz, its essential psychopathological features, and phenotypic boundaries.

### Diagnostic stability of ICD / DSM first episode psychosis diagnoses: meta-analysis [^bfa27ac9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

The additional clinically relevant finding of our meta-analysis is of no significant differences across ICD-10 vs DSM-IV definitions of each first episode diagnosis, as revealed by meta-regression analyses. Such a result may well reflect the increasing effort of international diagnostic manuals to improve reliability of psychiatric diagnoses and to harmonize the ICD and DSM. Our results may also be used to inform future evaluations and revisions of the new ICD-11 or DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. For example, given existing concerns that schizoaffective disorder may be a heterogeneous pathology in terms of the longitudinal course, we confirmed a good diagnostic stability (0.72). We also found that about 0.16 initial cases of ICD-10/DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder would shift towards schizophrenia. This value can be used as reference, to test if the new DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorderhave actually been successful at improving diagnostic reliability by shifting the concept from episode to life course of the disorder.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^3a533286]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) opted to retain existing diagnostic boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. The debate preceding this decision focused on understanding the biologic basis of these major mental illnesses. Evidence from genetics, neuroscience, and pharmacotherapeutics informed the DSM-5 development process. The following discussion will emphasize some of the key factors at the forefront of the debate.

Discussion

Family studies suggest a clear genetic link between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. However, large-scale genome-wide association studies have not been successful in identifying susceptibility genes that make substantial etiological contributions. Boundaries between psychotic disorders are not further clarified by looking at brain morphology. The fact that symptoms of bipolar I disorder, but not schizophrenia, are often responsive to medications such as lithium and other anticonvulsants must be interpreted within a larger framework of biological research.

Summary

For DSM-5, existing nosological boundaries between bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia were retained and schizoaffective disorder preserved as an independent diagnosis since the biological data are not yet compelling enough to justify a move to a more neurodevelopmentally continuous model of psychosis.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^60a4e765]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hallucinations and delusions are typically considered the hallmark of schizophrenia and mood fluctuations central to BD I; however, psychotic symptoms may be present in both. Although bipolar mood episodes may have an inherent episodic rhythm, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and BD I can all be chronic, lifelong conditions that cause significant functional impairment.

Since both psychosis and mood disturbance may constitute core features of schizophrenia, BD I, and schizoaffective disorder, a debate arose during the early pre-DSM-5 development process about the idea of merging diagnoses in the revised manual. A substantial body of research has focused on the genetic and neuroscientific etiological mechanisms of psychosis given that symptoms occur in schizophrenia in addition to schizoaffective disorder and BD I, among other psychiatric illnesses (major depression not being considered here). The argument in favor of merging diagnostic entities is based, in part, on the idea that schizoaffective disorder has proven to be a challenging differential diagnosis in clinical realms. Its diagnostic reliability across both clinicians and treatment settings is poor, and data promoting effective schizoaffective disorder-specific treatments are very limited.

Our aim in this paper is to first briefly and concisely review existing lines of biological evidence from behavioral and molecular genetics, neuroscience, and psychopharmacotherapeutics in order to determine whether they support or refute the idea of merging diagnoses involving psychosis in DSM-5. Given that DSM-5 has chosen to retain DSM-IV-TR's operative criteria for BD I, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, the subsequent discussion will in part emphasize some of the key factors that may have informed the decision to sustain separation of nosologic and diagnostic criteria for BD I, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. Revisions in DSM-5 to all psychiatric diagnoses were made only after balancing tensions in creating a manual of psychiatric nosology that both adheres to the medical model of psychiatry and is at once accurate, useful, and contemporary.

### The component structure of the scales for the assessment of positive and negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis and its dependence on variations in analytic methods [^57f7334a]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Psychotic disorders represent a broad family of psychological conditions that are characterised by cognitive, affective, perceptual, behavioural, and social symptoms. Whilst the psychoses have traditionally been described using a categorical approach based on diagnostic criteria, a number of authors have argued that psychotic disorders in fact represent a heterogeneous collection of phenomena, with diagnostic categories demonstrating poor validity, reliability and aetiological specificity. As an alternative dimensional based classification systems posit that psychosis may be better formulated with respect to multiple, continuous symptom dimensions. This is a view that has permeated both research and clinical practice. For example, the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) carries a rating tool called the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity, and further, no longer includes the traditional sub-types of schizophrenia (e.g. paranoid, disorganised, catatonic etc.) on the basis that they lack reliability, validity and stability. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure of psychotic symptoms is therefore critical.

### Catatonia in DSM-5 [^5e0de970]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Although catatonia has historically been associated with schizophrenia and is listed as a subtype of the disorder, it can occur in patients with a primary mood disorder and in association with neurological diseases and other general medical conditions. Consequently, catatonia secondary to a general medical condition was included as a new condition and catatonia was added as an episode specifier of major mood disorders in DSM-IV. Different sets of criteria are utilized to diagnose catatonia in schizophrenia and primary mood disorders versus neurological/medical conditions in DSM-IV, however, and catatonia is a codable subtype of schizophrenia but a specifier for major mood disorders without coding. In part because of this discrepant treatment across the DSM-IV manual, catatonia is frequently not recognized by clinicians. Additionally, catatonia is known to occur in several conditions other than schizophrenia, major mood disorders, or secondary to a general medical condition. Four changes are therefore made in the treatment of catatonia in DSM-5. A single set of criteria will be utilized to diagnose catatonia across the diagnostic manual and catatonia will be a specifier for both schizophrenia and major mood disorders. Additionally, catatonia will also be a specifier for other psychotic disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and substance-induced psychotic disorder. A new residual category of catatonia not otherwise specified will be added to allow for the rapid diagnosis and specific treatment of catatonia in severely ill patients for whom the underlying diagnosis is not immediately available. These changes should improve the consistent recognition of catatonia across the range of psychiatric disorders and facilitate its specific treatment.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^83a2fc00]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Definitions for early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) — EOS is defined as onset before 18 years of age, with onset before 13 years of age often described as COS. Diagnosis follows DSM-5 criteria requiring two or more characteristic symptoms for at least 1 month (or shorter if successfully treated), with hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech present during the active phase, and evidence of the disorder for at least 6 months; International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision criteria are similar except that the total duration of illness required is at least 1 month. DSM-5 differs from DSM-IV-TR in that delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech are required for diagnosis, and commenting and conversing hallucinations and bizarre delusions are no longer accorded special diagnostic status.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^1cccab48]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Schizoaffective disorder — diagnostic distinctions emphasize that by definition it requires the presence of psychotic symptoms plus prominent mood episodes that meet full criteria for mania or depression and are present for a substantial duration of the illness; the DSM-5 emphasizes the requirement of a full mood episode, which should be present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness. These distinctions are important because mood symptoms are common in individuals with schizophrenia, and the reliability of the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder in clinical settings has been poor.

### Attenuated psychosis syndrome in DSM-5 [^0002e3e9]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Despite advances in the treatment of schizophrenia over the past half-century, the illness is frequently associated with a poor outcome. This is principally related to the late identification and intervention in the course of the illness by which time patients have experienced a substantial amount of socio-occupational decline that can be difficult to reverse. The emphasis has therefore shifted to defining psychosis-risk syndromes and evaluating treatments that can prevent transition to psychosis in these ultra-high risk groups. To consider the appropriateness of adding psychosis risk syndrome to our diagnostic nomenclature, the psychotic disorders work group extensively reviewed all available data, consulted a range of experts, and carefully considered the variety of expert and public comments on the topic. It was clear that reliable methods were available to define a syndrome characterized by sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (in severity or duration) and which was associated with a very significant increase in the risk of development of a full-fledged psychotic disorder (schizophrenia spectrum, psychotic mood disorder, and other psychotic disorders) within the next year. At the same time, the majority of individuals with "attenuated psychotic symptoms" had one or more other current psychiatric comorbid conditions (usually mood or anxiety disorders, substance use disorder; Fusar-Poli 2012) and exhibited a range of psychiatric outcomes other than conversion to psychosis (significant proportions either fully recover or develop some other psychiatric disorder, with a minority developing a psychotic disorder). Although the reliability of the diagnosis is well established in academic and research settings, it was found to be less so in community and other clinical settings. Furthermore, the nosological relationship of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) to schizotypal personality disorder and other psychiatric conditions was unclear. Further study will hopefully resolve these questions. The work group decided to recommend the inclusion of attenuated psychosis syndrome as a category in the appendix (Section 3) of DSM-5 as a condition for further study.

### Sample ascertainment and clinical outcome measures in the accelerating medicines partnership® schizophrenia program [^ff76ef62]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnoses

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5(Modules A through E) is used in the AMP SCZ project to assess diagnostic criteria for psychotic, mood, and substance use disorders. Administering these modules allows for differential diagnosis of DSM-5 schizophrenia spectrum and associated disorders, which are primary outcome variables of AMP SCZ.

Depression

In addition to APS, ~40–60% of CHR individuals report current or previous depressive episodes. This observation is noteworthy as depression is often the foremost initial complaint. For some CHR individuals, more serious or recurrent depression has been observed to develop over the course of two years, thus making depression an important outcome. In addition to obtaining DSM-5 diagnoses, we use the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), a structured interview, to capture depression severity on a continuous scale that is independent of negative symptoms. The CDSS is one of the most widely used depression measures in clinical trials for psychosis and has been validated for CHR.

### Lack of use in the literature from the last 20 years supports dropping traditional schizophrenia subtypes from DSM-5 and ICD-11 [^ee9f6423]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnoses of paranoia, catatonia, and hebephrenia preceded the use of dementia praecox and Bleuler's subsequent recognition of a heterogenous "Group of Schizophrenias". With some modification, traditional schizophrenia subtypes have been formalized for many years in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classification systems. While widely used in the past, it is not clear that the schizophrenia subtypes remain in wide use or are influential in 21st-century research and clinical practice, and especially in the scientific literature. A review of published articles reveals over the last 20 years (1990, 2000, 2010) the use of traditional subtypes in the literature has fallen from 27.7% to 9.8% to 6.5%. Thus, by 2010, the use of subtypes in the leading literature venues declined to < 10%. These facts strongly support DSM-5 and ICD-11 proposed elimination of traditional schizophrenia subtypes from a research and evolving knowledge perspective because traditional subtypes are simply no longer being used much in the scientific literature.

### What is a mental disorder? An exemplar-focused approach [^fdb384e2]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DSM definitions of mental disorder

DSM has responded to these debates in its definitions of mental disorders. Thus DSM-III emphasizes, for example, that clinicians should not misclassify or label a cultural expression of distress or political deviance as a disease (American Psychiatric Association). Subsequent editions of DSM have emphasized that the boundaries of mental disorders are fuzzy (Table 1) (American Psychiatric Association).

Table 1.
DSM-IV definition of mental disorder

During the development of DSM-5, along with others, we attempted to further clarify the DSM criteria for a mental disorder (Table 2) (Stein et al.). While our proposal differs modestly from the later DSM-5 wording (Table 3), three differences are relevant here. First, while the DSM-5 definition refers to dysfunction in 'psychological, biological, or developmental processes', we prefer 'psychobiological', to emphasize that psychology and biology are intertwined constructs that encompass development, as well as other life-course constructs.

Table 2.
DSM-V proposal for the definition of mental/psychiatric disorder

Table 3.
DSM-5 definition of mental disorder

Second, our proposal suggested that the consequences of a mental disorder are clinically significant distress or disability (B). The DSM-5 wording indicates that mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or impairment. The word 'usually' may be technically accurate, in that on rare occasions, a mental disorder is listed in DSM-5, and there is no 'clinical criterion' (First & Wakefield). However, given that psychiatric symptoms are often on a continuum with normality, the clinical criterion is one key way of providing a relatively valid and reliable marker of underlying dysfunction, so lessening the risk of false positives and over-medicalization (Cooper). Other ways in which clinical criteria can validly and reliably point to underlying dysfunction include descriptions of symptom severity, excessiveness, frequency, and duration (First & Wakefield).

Third, our proposal made reference to considerations of diagnostic validity and clinical utility. This explicitly emphasizes that decisions about proposals for new entities must address empirical data. Certainly, data on diagnostic validity and clinical utility of proposed entities were carefully assessed during the DSM-5 revision process.

### Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia: aetiology, pathophysiology, and treatment [^518e4b57]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

A decline in cognitive function over the course of the illness was originally seen as a defining feature of schizophrenia. Meta-analyses of longitudinal studies, however, have tended to show improvement across multiple cognitive domains. However, many of the studies examined were of limited duration and the observed improvements are likely artefacts of practice effects, with less improvement observed in patients than in controls. Long-term longitudinal studies of over 10 years duration are rare, and have shown both improvement and decline in cognitive function. It is difficult in these studies, either due to lack of controls, relatively small sample sizes, or poor matching to controls, to disambiguate how much observed changes reflect normal cognitive trajectories, versus how much is due to a changing magnitude of impairment. Large-scale cross-sectional studies have suggested that while cognitive functioning decline with age this follows normal trajectories with no increase in the severity of impairment. There is some evidence for a more rapid decline in cognitive function over the age of 65 in institutionalised individuals with schizophrenia than controls. The basis of this decline is unclear, but could partly be secondary to poor physical health in patients with schizophrenia, which becomes increasingly evident in later life (Fig. 3). Both the lower starting point and this subsequent decline likely contribute to the increased incidence and earlier onset of dementia in individuals with schizophrenia.

Are cognitive deficits in schizophrenia distinct from those in other psychiatric disorders?

During the development of the DSM-5, the addition of cognitive impairment as a new diagnostic criterion for schizophrenia was considered. However, this was not implemented, because cognitive deficits in schizophrenia were regarded as not sufficiently distinct from those in other conditions (such as bipolar disorder) to be of diagnostic value. Nevertheless, the pattern of deficits across different psychiatric disorders is not the same. For example, cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are more severe than in bipolar disorder and depression, and are clearly present before the expression of symptoms, which is not the case for bipolar disorder or depression Ironically, subjective cognitive impairment is one of the DSM criteria for the latter disorders. In schizophrenia, however, the use of a subjective criterion is complicated by the lack of insight associated with the disorder, although subjective cognitive difficulties can be used as diagnostic criteria for the CHR state.

### Schizophrenia, "just the facts" 4. clinical features and conceptualization [^95877d46]. Schizophrenia Research (2009). Low credibility.

Although dementia praecox or schizophrenia has been considered a unique disease entity for the past century, its definitions and boundaries have continued to vary over this period. At any given time, the changing concept of schizophrenia has been influenced by available diagnostic tools and treatments, related conditions from which it most needs to be distinguished, extant knowledge and scientific paradigms. There is significant heterogeneity in the etiopathology, symptomatology, and course of schizophrenia. It is characterized by an admixture of positive, negative, cognitive, mood, and motor symptoms whose severity varies across patients and through the course of the illness. Positive symptoms usually first begin in adolescence or early adulthood, but are often preceded by varying degrees of negative and cognitive symptomatology. Schizophrenia tends to be a chronic and relapsing disorder with generally incomplete remissions, variable degrees of functional impairment and social disability, frequent comorbid substance abuse, and decreased longevity. Although schizophrenia may not represent a single disease with a unitary etiology or pathogenetic process, alternative approaches have thus far been unsuccessful in better defining this syndrome or its component entities. The symptomatologic, course, and etio-pathological heterogeneity can usefully be addressed by a dimensional approach to psychopathology, a clinical staging approach to illness course, and by elucidating endophenotypes and markers of illness progression, respectively. This will allow an approach to the deconstruction of schizophrenia into its multiple component parts and strategies to reconfigure these components in a more meaningful manner. Possible implications for DSM-V and ICD-11 definitions of schizophrenia are discussed.

### Associations between patterns in comorbid diagnostic trajectories of individuals with schizophrenia and etiological factors [^e0ed1d46]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric disorders have been classified for close to a century using a categorical and syndromic approach based on subjectively observed and reported psychiatric symptoms, rather than objective biomarkers, which limits their specificity and utility for guiding interventions. Schizophrenia, in particular, can be seen as the canonical example of a syndrome with varying clinical presentations, inconsistent treatment response, and longitudinal prognostic instability –. From one perspective, the heterogeneity of schizophrenia implies that the diagnosis is too broad because it is sensitive to various unique clinical presentations. From another perspective, however, it is too narrow, as the diagnosis is often not unitary, but regularly appears in constellation with multiple comorbid symptoms, diagnoses, or pathologies. This necessitates questions into the nature of this phenomenon — does heterogeneity in schizophrenia merely reflect a constellation of random phenomena with distinct etiologies?

The idea of subtypes within schizophrenia dates back more than a century, but previous subtypes were used infrequently, had modest longitudinal stability, inadequately described symptom heterogeneity, and have been abandoned in DSM-5and ICD-11. This reflects initiatives to describe the clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia on symptom dimensionsand factor analysis of symptom dimensions. However, these approaches have been limited by their cross-sectional design (e.g. Picardi et al.), short follow-up (e.g. Dwyer et al.), or retrospective data collection (e.g. Strous et al.). Despite this, interest in describing heterogeneity in schizophrenia persistsand longitudinal cohorts, with broad phenotyping, and representative ascertainment are well poised to make important contributions to this topic.

Although there is substantial pleiotropy, or sharing of genetic risk factors, across different psychiatric disordersgenetic differences are also present, which indicates that different pathological mechanisms are implicated, at least to some extent, depending on the psychiatric diagnoses. Since psychiatric comorbidity is very common in schizophreniadifferent comorbid diagnoses might reflect differences in underlying biology and therefore there is a need for broader investigations into the nature of clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia, especially with respect to longitudinal outcomes and comorbid diagnostic patterns.

### Schizophrenia [^8b7b6e3f]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Arguably the greatest challenge facing future research into aetiology, pathogenesis and treatment is the failure of current syndromic definitions to delineate a valid disease entity. If research is to progress, we will need new approaches to patient stratification that recognize the varying degree of overlap between syndromes and which bring modern neuroscience to bear on intermediate phenotypes that index the pathophysiology underlying the various clinical features and impairments. Given the complex and variable clinical features and cognitive impairments associated with the disorder it seems likely that multiple brain systems are impacted to varying extents in different individuals and it would be unwise to expect to implicate dysfunction of a single brain region or circuit that accounts for the full range of features of the disorder and which distinguishes it from other disorders. Rather we should expect that different features of the disorder reflect underlying disturbances of different brain functions and moreover that these will cross current diagnostic boundaries. These considerations also imply that we should expect that novel treatments will target particular symptoms or groups of symptoms sharing common underlying mechanisms and that they will be applicable across diagnostic groups.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^3745a881]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
DSM-IV-TR features of bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia, which occurs in approximately 1% of the population, may be characterized by dramatic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations, affective flattening and amotivation, or negative symptoms. While individuals with schizophrenia may need ongoing support to maintain themselves independently, recovery initiatives have demonstrated that achievement of personal or professional goals and expansion of self-concept are attainable for individuals with schizophrenia. By comparison, BD I occurs in about 1% of the population and is notable for its episodic nature with severe but periodic symptoms of mania and depression. A common manic presentation includes reports of minimal sleep accompanied by increased energy, changes in mood and judgment, and impulsivity. About 50% of manic episodes contain psychotic elements such as grandiosity, frank delusions and hallucinations, or paranoia. Even in cases where manic episodes manifest psychotic content, many individuals may be responsive to medications and essentially return to full functioning with ongoing treatment. Schizoaffective disorder, estimated to occur in less than 1% of the population, appears to represent a midpoint on the pathologic spectrum between BD I and schizophrenia with psychotic symptoms predominant and mood symptoms of mania and depression less evident (see Figure 1). Individuals meeting criteria for this diagnosis report at least a two-week period without evidence of mood instability and persistent psychotic symptoms. In the DSM-IV TR categorization scheme, schizoaffective disorder includes both psychotic symptoms and severe mood episodes; however, by definition, there must be periods of psychosis without any disturbance in mood.

### Restoring course as a core diagnostic element of psychotic disorders [^542523c3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Foundational models of the psychoses included course as a core element differentiating patients. Current models, ICD-11 and DSM-5, only require symptom criteria to be met to make a diagnosis. We explore the proposition that making course designation essential, again, would improve the categorization of patients with psychotic disorders.

Study Design

We briefly discuss the history by which symptoms, alone, became the primary elements required for diagnosis. We review past and recent evidence on the best models for differentiating among psychoses.

Study Results

The use of course designations, along with symptoms, produces the best fit to the way in which psychotic disorders present and progress. It also matches how clinicians assess patients and choose therapeutic interventions. A model including course as a factor is more accurate and complete than models using symptoms alone. And it produces groups of patients that are likely to be more homogeneous than purely symptom-based models. The degree of heterogeneity among patients classified together within current International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) categories can lead to false findings in research and a lack of clarity on the best treatment in individual cases. Increasing homogeneity in diagnostic groups, by including course designations, could advantage clinical care, clinical trials, and research on underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

Conclusions

Adding a course as a diagnostic element is practical. Clinicians already consider it. Specifying courses can be required in making a diagnosis. Doing so is evidence based and enhances the accuracy and value of diagnoses. We recommend restoring the course as a core element of any new diagnostic system.

### Negative symptoms: history of the concept and their position in diagnosis of schizophrenia [^8c1a1594]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Current conceptualizations of schizophrenia have been introduced over centuries and continue to progress in recent decades. Symptoms have been divided into several domains, contrasting negative and positive symptoms which are different in their nature, onset, progression and response to treatment. An account of the different historical changes of the concept – essentially nosographic – has led to models attempting to integrate findings for each dimension of the disorder. This paper reviews the history of negative symptoms in diagnosis and how different approaches have been utilised to consider negative symptoms in the concept of schizophrenia. The paper also bridges various international classifications which have evolved and modified the role of negative symptoms in their diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, which highlights the challenge of defining this disease.

### Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? A 50-year assessment of diagnostic stability based on a national case registry [^0a77268e]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) remains a controversial diagnosis in terms of necessity and reliability.

Objectives

We assessed diagnostic patterns of SAD and schizophrenia (SZ) among hospitalized psychiatric patients over a fifty-year period.

Method

Data from the Israeli National Psychiatric Registry on 16,341 adults diagnosed with SZ or SAD, hospitalized at least twice in 1963–2017, were analyzed. Stability between most-frequent, first and last diagnosis, and diagnostic-constancy (the same diagnosis in > 75% of a person's hospitalizations) were calculated. Three groups were compared: People with both SAD and SZ diagnoses over the years (SZ-SAD), and people with only one of these diagnoses (SZ-only; SAD-only). The incidence of SAD and SZ before and after DSM-5 publication was compared.

Results

Reliability between last and first diagnosis was 60% for SAD and 94% for SZ. Agreement between first and most-frequent diagnosis was 86% for SAD and 92% for SZ. Diagnostic shifts differ between persons with SAD and with SZ. Diagnostic-constancy was observed for 50% of SAD-only patients. In the SZ-SAD group, 9% had a constant SAD diagnosis. Compared to the other groups, the SZ-SAD group exhibited a higher substance use prevalence, younger age at first-hospitalization, and more hospitalizations/person (p < 0.0001). The incidence of a first-hospitalization SAD diagnosis increased by 2.2% in the 4-years after vs. prior to DSM-5.

Conclusions

A SAD diagnosis is less stable than SZ. The incidence of a SAD diagnosis increased after DSM-5, despite stricter diagnostic criteria. The SZ-SAD group exhibited the poorest outcomes. SAD may evolve over time necessitating periodic re-evaluation.

### Informing DSM-5: biological boundaries between bipolar I disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia [^75c87a71]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

It is helpful to consider competing nosological models involving mood and psychotic disorders before attempting to critically evaluate biological evidence. Kraepelin's dichotomous classification of psychosis into dementia praecox and manic-depressive insanity has informed earlier iterations of the DSM. However, the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH's) Research Domain Criteria, or RDoC, may be a more useful lens through which to examine data linking biology and behavior in psychosis. The RDoC framework purports a full spectrum, neurodevelopmentally continuous model for understanding psychiatric illness that is dimensional in nature and encourages assessment of behavior at genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological levels. In other words, RDoC is a way to digest the relatively common findings that risk genes for one psychiatric disorder are associated with risk for many psychiatric disorders or that similar changes in brain structure or function are observed in many psychiatric disorders.

One way to conceptualize the debate about whether or not to merge schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and BD I is to consider whether biological evidence for a dimensional model of psychosis consistent with RDoC is currently strong enough to warrant such a dramatic change to the DSM-IV-TR nosological system featuring discrete categorical classifications of normal and abnormal behavior. A third alternative for DSM-5 was potentially to bridge categorical and dimensional classification strategies by including additional intermediate 'spectra' diagnoses. Biological evidence from the domains of behavioral and molecular genetics and brain morphology and functioning were considered. Additionally, psychopharmacotherapeutics, or differential response patterns to psychiatric medications for psychosis (that is, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics), were interpreted within the broader framework of biological mediators and moderators of treatment response (Tables 1 and 2).

### What causes the onset of psychosis in individuals at clinical high risk? A meta-analysis of risk and protective factors [^14470f2b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of risk and protective factors for transition to psychotic disorders in CHR-P individuals that includes a robust hierarchical classification of the published evidence. After two decades of CHR-P research, it was imperative to advance knowledge by screening the available evidence against robust criteria. Overall, 128 individual studies comprising 17 967 patients and 26 factors potentially associated with transition to psychosis were included. There were no factors with convincing evidence (class I) for an association with risk of transition. Attenuated positive psychotic symptoms and global functioning were characterized by highly suggestive evidence (class II) with negative psychotic symptoms supported by suggestive evidence (class III).

The main finding of this meta-analysis is that, although a large number of risk/protective factors for transition to psychotic disorders have been evaluated in numerous CHR-P studies, none show convincing evidence with few having suggestive or stronger support. This likely reflects a research field which is fragmented, heterogeneous and that still represents a small niche to display a scalable impact. For example, the availability of different CHR-P assessment instruments is associated with disagreement in the designation of cases or definition of their outcomes. The recent introduction of the DSM-5 category of Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome has further complicated the psychometric comparability of CHR-P cases. On a similar note, the heterogeneity of the CHR-P group has already been demonstrated at both diagnostic, and prognostic, level, to the point that stratification of this group has been suggested in a previous issue of this journal. The limited scalability and impact of the CHR-P field has also received empirical demonstration on several lines of evidence. Since the CHR-P literature is characterized by relatively small studies with infrequent events (transition to psychosis), the meta-analytical findings did not survive the strict criteria for the classification of evidence, with it being particularly rare for factors to have more than 1000 cases. Although this criterion is intended to identify robust epidemiological risk/protective factors, the CHR-P field is per se epidemiologically weak, because it is characterized by substantial sampling biases. A striking example of these points is the recent evidence showing that only about 5% of individuals who will develop psychosis can be detected at their CHR-P stage in secondary mental health care. Overall, this finding clearly indicates that future CHR-P research should be collaborative, scalable, and better harmonized in terms of assessment of intake criteria and outcomes. Ongoing international projects such as PSYSCAN, PRONIA, and North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS)which have all been integrated in the HARMONY project may reach the critical mass that is needed to better identify risk/protective factors that modulate transition to psychosis with convincing evidence.

### On the diagnostic and neurobiological origins of bipolar disorder [^35e88812]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Symptom classes according to diagnostic criteria.

Status with respect to five primary symptom classes for nine DSM-5 diagnoses according to the formal diagnostic criteria. The status describes whether symptoms in the given class must be present for the diagnosis to be made ("Required") or may be present but not necessary for the diagnosis to be made ("Possible").

Bipolar disorder (BD) is notable amongst psychiatric diagnoses for manic, depressive, and psychotic symptoms all being core features. Canonically, BD is described as alternating episodes of mania and depression. In reality, individuals who receive this diagnosis are clinically heterogeneous, varying with respect to symptomatology, comorbidity, and longitudinal course. There are several diagnoses on the BD spectrum, including bipolar I disorder (BD I), bipolar II disorder (BD II), and schizoaffective disorder bipolar type (SAB). The criteria for these diagnoses differ from one another — and from clinically related diagnoses such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) — by nuances in the timing, co-occurrence, and severity of manic, depressive, and psychotic symptoms. The DSM establishes thresholds to differentiate full-blown "episodes" (e.g. manic episodes, depressive episodes) from the sub-threshold occurrence of symptoms that comprise such episodes — for example, "three (or more) of the following symptoms". An episode of mania equates to a diagnosis of BD I unless psychotic symptoms occur both during the episode and for at least 2 weeks outside the episode — if these two criteria are met, then the diagnosis is SAB. A history of hypomanic and depressive episodes equates to a diagnosis of BD II. However, if psychosis occurs during an otherwise hypomanic episode, then the episode is defined as manic and the diagnosis BD I (or SAB if the aforementioned criteria are met). Psychosis during a depressive episode does not preclude a diagnosis of BD II. Manic symptoms do not preclude diagnoses of MDD or SCZ if below threshold for a manic or hypomanic episode. As with other DSM diagnoses, the criteria for disorders on the BD spectrum can be fulfilled in many thousands of different ways.

### Melancholia and catatonia: disorders or specifiers? [^be64783e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 defines mental disorders as syndromes and also introduced disorder "specifiers" with the aim of providing increased diagnostic specificity by defining more homogeneous subgroups of those with the disorder and who share certain features. While the majority of specifiers in DSM-5 define a specific aspect of the disorder such as age at onset or severity, some define syndromes that appear to meet the DSM-5 definition of a mental disorder. Specifically, melancholia is positioned in DSM-5 as a major depressive disorder (non-coded) specifier, while catatonia is listed as both a disorder secondary to a medical condition and as a specifier associated with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Despite decades of research supporting melancholia's status as a categorical "disorder" (a higher-order construct than a specifier), failure to provide convincing support for its disorder status has contributed to its current positioning in DSM-5. As DSM-5 has similar symptom criteria for major depression and for its melancholia specifier, research seeking to differentiate melancholic and non-melancholic depression according to DSM-5 criteria will have limited capacity to demonstrate "melancholia" as a separate disorder and risks melancholia continuing to be reified as a low-order specifier and thus clinical marginalization. There have been few advances in catatonia research in recent years with its positioning largely relying on opinion and clinical observation rather than on empirical studies.

### Symptom severity scale of the DSM5 for schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders: diagnostic validity and clinical feasibility [^cbd7f940]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

Innovations in DSM5 include dimensional diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) and other psychotic (OP) disorders using the symptom severity scale (SS-DSM5). We evaluated the psychometric properties and diagnostic validity of the SS-DSM5 scale using a cross-sectional design and an unselected convenience unselected sample of 314 inpatients and outpatients with SZ/OP and mood disorders who received standard care in routine clinical practice. The SS-DSM5 scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S), the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale (BRMS) were administered. Factor structure, reliability, internal consistency, convergent and diagnostic ability of the DSM5-SS were evaluated. Factor analysis indicated two latent factors underlying the SS-DSM5 (Psychotic and Deficit sub-scales). Cronbach's alpha was > 0.70. Convergent validity of the SS-DSM5 was highly significant. Patients with SZ/PO disorders were correctly diagnosed (77.9%) using the SS-DSM5 scale (72% using PANSS). The agreement of the diagnostic decisions between the SS-DSM5 and PANSS was substantial for SZ/PO disorders (Kappa = 0.75). Classifying participants with SZ/PO versus mood disorders using SS-DSM5 provided a sensitivity of 95%, and specificity of 34%. Thus, this study suggests that the SS-DSM5 has acceptable psychometric properties and that its use in clinical practice and research is feasible in clinical settings. The dimensional option for the diagnosis of schizophrenia and related disorders using SS-DSM5 is discussed.

### The clinical features of paranoia in the 20th century and their representation in diagnostic criteria from DSM-III through DSM-5 [^bb191eb6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

This review traces, through psychiatric textbooks, the history of the Kraepelinian concept of paranoia in the 20th century and then relates the common reported symptoms and signs to the diagnostic criteria for paranoia/delusional disorder in DSM-III through DSM-5. Clinical descriptions of paranoia appearing in 10 textbooks, published 1899 to 1970, revealed 11 prominent symptoms and signs reported by 5 or more authors. Three symptoms (systematized delusions, minimal hallucinations, and prominent ideas of reference) and 2 signs (chronic course and minimal affective deterioration) were reported by 8 or 9 of the authors. Four textbook authors rejected the Kraepelinian concept of paranoia. A weak relationship was seen between the frequency with which the clinical features were reported and the likelihood of their inclusion in modern DSM manuals. Indeed, the diagnostic criteria for paranoia/delusional disorder shifted substantially from DSM-III to DSM-5. The modern operationalized criteria for paranoia/delusional disorder do not well reflect the symptoms and signs frequently reported by historical experts. In contrast to results of similar reviews for depression, schizophrenia and mania, the clinical construct of paranoia/delusional disorder has been somewhat unstable in Western Psychiatry since the turn of the 20th century as reflected in both textbooks and the DSM editions.

### Wherefrom and whither PD? Recent developments and future possibilities in DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality disorder diagnosis [^df50f02b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

However, there also are notable differences. Most notably, (1) ICD-11 's essential features tend to be more descriptive than the more prescriptive AMPD criteria (i.e. a non-exhaustive list of characteristics in the ICD-11 model vs. e.g. " manifested by characteristic difficulties in two or more of the following four areas " in the AMPD); (2) five maladaptive-range traits are provided as optional specifiers rather than included among the essential (required) features; (3) only four of each model's five traits are shared — NA, DET, ANT (call Dyssocial in ICD-11), and DIS — PSY is not among the ICD-11 traits because Schizotypal Disorder is placed in the Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses chapter in ICD-11 and Anankastia, which encompasses traits relevant to obsessive–compulsive PD such as rigid perfectionism and behavioral and emotional constraint; and (4) the ICD-11 model also provides an optional Borderline Pattern specifier that may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self- image, and affects, and marked impulsivity as indicated by many of the criteria for DSM-5, Section II Borderline personality disorder. See Table 1 for a detailed side-by-side comparison of the two models.

Table 1
Comparison of DSM-5 and ICD-11 models of personality disorder

DSM-5 = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ICD-11 = International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (World Health Organization, 2022)

The differences summarized above and detailed in Table 1 are largely due to the different purposes and constituencies of the documents. More specifically, (1) the ICD-11 is designed to be used globally, in all countries that are member states of the World Health Organization. By international treaty, these 193 countries have agreed to use the ICD and its codes for reporting national health information. This agreement ensures that the reported data will be internationally comparable for communicating about diseases and health conditions (note that the ICD covers all medical diagnoses, not just mental disorders). Moreover, because WHO's ultimate objective is "the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health", p. 2, a public-health focus is fundamental to the goals and internal organization of the ICD.

### An organization-and category-level comparison of diagnostic requirements for mental disorders in ICD-11 and DSM-5 [^ad79859e]. World Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published the 5th edition of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). In 2019, the World Health Assembly approved the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). It has often been suggested that the field would benefit from a single, unified classification of mental disorders, although the priorities and constituencies of the two sponsoring organizations are quite different. During the development of the ICD-11 and DSM-5, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the APA made efforts toward harmonizing the two systems, including the appointment of an ICD-DSM Harmonization Group. This paper evaluates the success of these harmonization efforts and provides a guide for practitioners, researchers and policy makers describing the differences between the two systems at both the organizational and the disorder level. The organization of the two classifications of mental disorders is substantially similar. There are nineteen ICD-11 disorder categories that do not appear in DSM-5, and seven DSM-5 disorder categories that do not appear in the ICD-11. We compared the Essential Features section of the ICD-11 Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) with the DSM-5 criteria sets for 103 diagnostic entities that appear in both systems. We rated 20 disorders (19.4%) as having major differences, 42 disorders (40.8%) as having minor definitional differences, 10 disorders (9.7%) as having minor differences due to greater degree of specification in DSM-5, and 31 disorders (30.1%) as essentially identical. Detailed descriptions of the major differences and some of the most important minor differences, with their rationale and related evidence, are provided. The ICD and DSM are now closer than at any time since the ICD-8 and DSM-II. Differences are largely based on the differing priorities and uses of the two diagnostic systems and on differing interpretations of the evidence. Substantively divergent approaches allow for empirical comparisons of validity and utility and can contribute to advances in the field.

### What is formulation in psychiatry? [^59a8bd8b]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The 4P model has fallen out of use – eclipsed by DSM-III and treatment algorithms based on its categories. It suffers from the problem that causative effects are often unknown, or when known multiple and small and that they apply to groups rather than individuals. That can make it challenging to apply.

Another version of the biopsychosocial model originating in DSM-III needs some mention – the multi-axial system. This was a sort of bolt on to the neo-Kraepelinism of DSM-III (Williams). It is an attempt to provide a biopsychosocial assessment by specifying each case in terms of five axes. DSM-III specified the axes as follows:

Axis I – clinical syndrome (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression)

Axis II – lifelong disorders or handicaps (personality disorder or mental retardation)

Axis III – associated physical health problems

Axis IV – severity of psychosocial stressors

Axis V – highest level of social and occupational functioning in last year

The intention was to give a more holistic picture of a case by placing a psychiatric diagnosis (axis 1) within a wider context of personality, learning abilities, physical health and psychosocial stresses. The multi-axial system like the 4P model has rather died out and a little remarked upon change in DSM-5 is that the multi-axial system has been removed 2.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^c48a1d2a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The most important changes in the classification of psychotic disorders from the ICD-10 to ICD-11, based on evidence review and consensus of the Working Group, include the following:
The ICD-10 section entitled 'Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders' has been replaced by 'Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders'. The term 'primary' was intended to distinguish these disorders from bipolar and other mental or medical disorders that may include psychotic symptoms.
Accordingly, non-primary (i.e. 'secondary') psychotic disorders, such as psychotic disorders due to substance use or withdrawal and psychotic disorders in general medical conditions, are respectively placed in the sections of the mental disorders chapter corresponding to 'Disorders due to substance use' and 'Mental and behavioural disorders associated with disorders or diseases classified elsewhere'. However, the unique features of the ICD-11, including its fully relational and electronic development for complex coding, make it possible to cross-list substance-induced psychotic disorders and those associated with general medical conditions in the section on primary psychotic disorders as well, enhancing clinical utility while still retaining the ability to allocate and aggregate these disorders appropriately for public health reporting.
The overall structure proposed for the ICD-11 block on 'Schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders' is as follows: ◦ Schizophrenia ◦ Schizoaffective disorder ◦ Acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) ◦ Schizotypal disorder ◦ Delusional disorder ◦ Other primary psychotic disorders ◦ Unspecified primary psychotic disorders
Disorders in this section continue to be categorized on the basis of their psychopathological profile, duration, or course characteristics, as described in the Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines being developed for use by mental health professionals in clinical settings.
Similar to the DSM-5, in the ICD-11, the nine ICD-10 schizophrenia subtypes (paranoid, hebephrenic, catatonic, etc.) are now omitted because of their longitudinal instability and lack of prognostic validity, and have been replaced by a system of coded symptom and course qualifiers (see below). Although first-rank symptoms are somewhat deemphasized, a diagnosis of schizophrenia requires the presence of at least two of seven symptom categories, including at least one 'core' symptom. Core symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, experiences of influence, passivity or control, and disorganized thinking. Symptoms should have been clearly present for most of the time during a period of at least 1 month, hence retaining the ICD-10 duration requirement. If the symptom requirements for schizophrenia are fulfilled but the duration is less than 1 month, 'Other specified primary psychotic disorder' would be the appropriate diagnosis until the duration requirement is met.
In the ICD-11, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be made only when the symptom criteria of schizophrenia and of a moderate or severe mood episode are fulfilled simultaneously or within a few days of each other. The total duration requirement is 1 month, including both mood and schizophrenic symptoms. According to long-term studies, 10% of persons with schizoaffective disorder have only a single episode, while decades-long, symptom-free intervals may occur between episodes among people who have had more than one episode.
For the category of 'acute and transient psychotic disorder' (ATPD), the ICD-11 places the diagnostic focus on sudden onset, brief duration and high variability/fluctuation of psychotic and affective symptoms (i.e. the 'polymorphic' clinical presentation). For simplification and due to a lack of empirical support for the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of the distinctions made in the ICD-10 among several subtypes of ATPD, only F23.0 'Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia' is retained as the core clinical category for ATPD, whereas F23.3 'Other acute predominantly delusional disorder' is incorporated into the revised category delusional disorder. F23.1 'Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder with symptoms of schizophrenia' and F23.2 'Acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder' are replaced by 'Other specified primary psychotic disorder' if the duration is less than 1 month, and should be diagnosed as schizophrenia if all diagnostic requirements are met.
ICD-10 categories F22 'Persistent delusional disorder', F23.3 'Other acute predominantly delusional psychotic disorder', and F24 'Induced delusional disorder', which is a very rare entity, are collapsed into a single diagnostic category of 'Delusional disorder', omitting the durational qualifier 'persistent' to adapt to its durational heterogeneity and also to simplify the classification system.
Schizotypal disorder remains largely unchanged in the ICD-11. As in the ICD-10, it is considered a validated member of the schizophrenia 'spectrum' as a potential precursor or subsyndromal variant of schizophrenia rather than a personality disorder and is therefore included in the section on primary psychotic disorders.
As an alternative to subtypes, coded qualifiers to describe the course of the disorder as well as symptom presentation are included in the section and can be applied to all primary psychotic disorders. Course qualifiers allow the differentiation of first- and multiple-episode cases, and between acute episodes with symptoms, full or partial remission, and a chronic course due to different prognostic implications. Symptom qualifiers include the presence of positive, negative, depressive, manic, psychomotor, and cognitive symptoms, each of which may be rated as mild, moderate, or severe. A qualifier for cognitive symptoms is intended to provide more diagnostic and therapeutic attention to cognitive symptoms as these are linked to functional outcome. The 'psychomotor symptoms' qualifier includes catatonic symptoms. In addition, catatonia is also included as a separate category in the ICD-11.

### Accelerating medicines partnership® schizophrenia (AMP® SCZ): rationale and study design of the largest global prospective cohort study of clinical high risk for psychosis [^70c862d3]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis approach is used to prospectively identify people who are at increased clinical risk for developing psychotic disorders, ie, in the putatively prodromal phase of psychotic disorders. CHR criteria, which are based on a combination of attenuated symptoms, brief psychotic symptoms, and trait risk factors, are well-validated, reaching a good group-level prognostic accuracy (AUC = 0.85 at 34 months). Approximately one-quarter of CHR individuals convert to a psychotic disorder within a 3-year period, and 35% within 10 years. This rate is considerably higher than in the general population and other clinical populations, who have 0.5% and 3.9% likelihood of developing psychotic disorders over 3 years, respectively. The prevalence of CHR is 1.7% in the general population and 19.2% in clinical samples of youth. The CHR for psychosis criteria have been remarkably influential, with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) including "Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome", based on CHR criteria, as a condition for further study.

Research to date, however, indicates substantial heterogeneity in clinical, neurocognitive, and neurobiological presentation, and trajectories and outcomes in the CHR population. Of CHR individuals who do not convert to psychosis, 48% experience full CHR remission at 12 months, and this number increases to 50% remission after 36 months. The remainder show progressing or persisting attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS), along with impaired functioning, cognition, and other symptoms. This high degree of heterogeneity in clinical course makes stratification of CHR individuals or prediction of individual-level outcomes using clinical information and/or biomarkers difficult but nonetheless of great importance. For example, it is challenging to match existing one-size-fits-all CHR interventions to the individual needs and phenotypes presented by CHR individuals and/or to develop new treatments that target individual pathoetiological mechanisms underlying variable CHR course. Reliable prognostic and predictive biomarkers are thus urgently required to meet these goals. In the current context, the term "biomarker" is used to refer broadly to cognitive, neuroimaging, digital health technology-derived, genetic, and biological markers.

### The American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia [^c4e07a12]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, APA 2020 guidelines recommend to include the following in the initial assessment of patients with a possible psychotic disorder:

- reason the patient is presenting for evaluation

- patient's goals and preferences for treatment

### What is behind the 17-year life expectancy gap between individuals with schizophrenia and the general population? [^71783fce]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology Brașov, Romania, an academic center with 100 beds for acute psychiatric patients and 315 beds for long-term admissions. The study assessed clinical characteristics, mortality, and causes of death in a cohort of 635 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized between 2010 and 2013, and followed for a period of 10 years.

Participants

Inclusion criteria were: patients aged 18 years or older at the time of hospitalization, with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia based on DSM-5 criteria, admitted between 2010 and 2013, and who provided written informed consent. All patients had a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia made prior to the hospitalization episode included in the study, by board-certified psychiatrists using structured assessments consistent with DSM-5 criteria. Socio-economic status was assessed at the time of hospital admission using a standardized intake protocol that included educational level, employment status, and monthly income. This information was used to construct a basic socio-economic index for each patient and was available for the entire cohort. Exclusion criteria included diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder, acute or substance-induced psychosis, brief or delusional disorders, intellectual disability, and organic mental disorders. Gender was recorded as a binary variable (male/female) based on hospital records; gender identity was not assessed.

Data collection and ethics

Patients were identified through hospital records and matched in the National Health Insurance (CNAS) database using their Unique Personal Number (CNP) to confirm survival status. Deaths were verified through the Forensic Medicine Service Brașov. Ethical approval was obtained from the "Ethics Committee of the Brașov Clinical Hospital of Psychiatry and Neurology " (decision no. 13, 13 November 2023). All patients had previously signed the hospital's general informed-consent form, which permits the use of fully anonymized clinical data for ethically approved research. Because the data were retrospective and de-identified, the committee waived the need for additional written consent. Data were fully anonymized and no identifiable information was processed. All procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinkiand EU GDPR.

### DSM-5: a collection of psychiatrist views on the changes, controversies, and future directions [^788b08be]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the context of the enthusiasm to revise diagnosis along the lines of biological rather than clinical phenomenology, it is sobering to recall the purpose behind the historic shift in psychiatric diagnosis represented in DSM-III. Prior to this, clinical diagnosis was based on vague, largely implicit assumptions about personality styles and psychological concepts, such as defense mechanisms. It was often noted that before DSM-III, the principal determinant of the diagnosis of a psychiatric patient was the training program of the psychiatrist. Clinicians in psychoanalytically oriented programs would interpret symptoms as indicative of specific psychological mechanisms, in contrast to trainees from a more biologically oriented program, and the resulting diagnoses would diverge, often dramatically. DSM-III introduced explicit criteria that allowed a psychiatrist on the west coast of the USA to have a much higher likelihood of reaching a similar diagnosis to a colleague on the east coast. Although the approach was never meant to establish disease validity, it rescued the field from decades of diagnostic unreliability. It is therefore potentially worrisome that classification using biological phenomena, such as working memory or amygdala responsivity, both of which are highly dependent on context and research protocols, may reintroduce some of this earlier vagueness, subjectivity, and imprecision.

Much has been made of the apparent overlap of some genes found to be associated with multiple psychiatric disorders, but the implications of these findings for a new diagnostic approach is unclear. Although the genetics of psychiatric diagnoses may show some overlap, so do the genetics of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, which are distinct clinical conditions requiring different clinical interventions. The fact that there may be shared genetic and environmental contributors to both major depression and PTSD, such as early life trauma and FKBP5 polymorphisms, should not be surprising, and does not in any way detract from the utility of these categorical diagnoses for the practicing physician. Ultimately, a principle reason for clinical diagnosis is to predict the course of illness and to prescribe treatment. Current psychiatric medications are symptomatic treatments and although many are helpful beyond a single diagnosis, there are some dissociations of efficacy that conform to the existing diagnostic boundaries and exemplify their continuing utility. For example, lithium is not an effective antipsychotic, but it is nearly curative for many patients who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Likewise, stimulants tend to make patients with psychosis worse, but they help most patients with an ADHD diagnosis. Clozapine, an especially effective treatment for schizophrenia, is not effective in autism, intellectual disability, ADHD, or PTSD.

### Auditory hallucinations, not necessarily a hallmark of psychotic disorder [^d0335eab]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).

### First rank symptoms for schizophrenia [^eb04859e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia may have long-term advantages for the patient; the longer psychosis goes untreated the more severe the repercussions for relapse and recovery. If the correct diagnosis is not schizophrenia, but another psychotic disorder with some symptoms similar to schizophrenia, appropriate treatment might be delayed, with possible severe repercussions for the person involved and their family. There is widespread uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of First Rank Symptoms (FRS); we examined whether they are a useful diagnostic tool to differentiate schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of one or multiple FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia, verified by clinical history and examination by a qualified professional (e.g. psychiatrists, nurses, social workers), with or without the use of operational criteria and checklists, in people thought to have non-organic psychotic symptoms.

Search Methods

We conducted searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using OvidSP in April, June, July 2011 and December 2012. We also searched MEDION in December 2013.

Selection Criteria

We selected studies that consecutively enrolled or randomly selected adults and adolescents with symptoms of psychosis, and assessed the diagnostic accuracy of FRS for schizophrenia compared to history and clinical examination performed by a qualified professional, which may or may not involve the use of symptom checklists or based on operational criteria such as ICD and DSM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all references for inclusion. Risk of bias in included studies were assessed using the QUADAS-2 instrument. We recorded the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) for constructing a 2 x 2 table for each study or derived 2 x 2 data from reported summary statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, and/or likelihood ratios.

Main Results

We included 21 studies with a total of 6253 participants (5515 were included in the analysis). Studies were conducted from 1974 to 2011, with 80% of the studies conducted in the 1970's, 1980's or 1990's. Most studies did not report study methods sufficiently and many had high applicability concerns. In 20 studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from all other diagnoses with a sensitivity of 57% (50.4% to 63.3%), and a specificity of 81.4% (74% to 87.1%) In seven studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from non-psychotic mental health disorders with a sensitivity of 61.8% (51.7% to 71%) and a specificity of 94.1% (88% to 97.2%). In sixteen studies, FRS differentiated schizophrenia from other types of psychosis with a sensitivity of 58% (50.3% to 65.3%) and a specificity of 74.7% (65.2% to 82.3%).

Authors' Conclusions

The synthesis of old studies of limited quality in this review indicates that FRS correctly identifies people with schizophrenia 75% to 95% of the time. The use of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will incorrectly diagnose around five to 19 people in every 100 who have FRS as having schizophrenia and specialists will not agree with this diagnosis. These people will still merit specialist assessment and help due to the severity of disturbance in their behaviour and mental state. Again, with a sensitivity of FRS of 60%, reliance on FRS to diagnose schizophrenia in triage will not correctly diagnose around 40% of people that specialists will consider to have schizophrenia. Some of these people may experience a delay in getting appropriate treatment. Others, whom specialists will consider to have schizophrenia, could be prematurely discharged from care, if triage relies on the presence of FRS to diagnose schizophrenia. Empathetic, considerate use of FRS as a diagnostic aid - with known limitations - should avoid a good proportion of these errors. We hope that newer tests - to be included in future Cochrane reviews - will show better results. However, symptoms of first rank can still be helpful where newer tests are not available - a situation which applies to the initial screening of most people with suspected schizophrenia. FRS remain a simple, quick and useful clinical indicator for an illness of enormous clinical variability.

### Diagnostic stability of ICD / DSM first episode psychosis diagnoses: meta-analysis [^1ebb031b]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Search Strategy

Two independent investigators (M.C. Z.B.) conducted 2-step literature searches according to a specific protocol. First, the Web of Knowledge database was searched, incorporating both the Web of Science and MEDLINE. The search was extended until June 30, 2015, including abstracts in English language only. The electronic research adopted several combinations of the following keywords: "First episode psychosis", "Diagnostic accuracy", "Sensitivity", "Specificity", "Psychosis prediction", "Psychosis onset", "Diagnostic stability", "Prediction", "DSM-IV", "ICD-10", and "Follow-up". Second, we used Scopus to investigate citations of possible previous reviews/meta-analyses on diagnostic stability of first episode psychosis diagnoses, and a manual search of the reference lists of retrieved articles. Articles identified through these 2 steps were then screened for the selection criteria on basis of abstract reading. The articles surviving this selection were assessed for eligibility on basis of full-text reading, following the MOOSE checklist.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if the following criteria were fulfilled: (a) were original articles, written in English; (b) included a group of ICD-10 or DSM-IV/DSM-IV-TR first episode psychosis patients (defined as first-ever admission to mental health services), diagnostically assessed at baseline and follow-up; and (c) reported the baseline and follow-up number of specific psychotic diagnoses: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, schizophreniform disorder, affective spectrum psychoses, delusional disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, acute and transient psychotic disorder/brief psychotic disorder. Further details on the specific ICD-10/DSM-IV diagnostic codes are appended in. When data were not directly presented they were indirectly extracted from associated data. Corresponding authors were contacted to retrieve additional data when possible. Exclusion criteria were: (a) abstracts, pilot datasets, and papers in languages other than English; (b) articles not employing the internationally ICD/DSM validated diagnoses for psychosis; (c) articles not providing enough meta-analytical data; (d) articles reporting on organic psychoses, and (e) articles with overlapping datasets. Specifically, in case of multiple publications deriving from the same study population, we selected the articles reporting the largest and most recent data set. Literature search was summarized according to the PRISMA guidelines.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^8897871f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider allowing approximately 2 weeks without antipsychotic treatment to clinically appraise the initial course of psychosis to exclude acute or transient psychotic disorders and substance-induced psychotic disorders, only when risks such as aggression, self-harm, self-neglect, vulnerability, or deterioration can be appropriately monitored and mitigated. Consider prescribing GABA-modulating agents if applicable, such as benzodiazepines, for anxiety or insomnia for up to 2 weeks before tapering off.

### Differential-diagnostic confusion and non-specificity of affective symptoms and anxiety: an empirical study of first-admission patients [^9bf74a7c]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

In everyday clinical work, psychiatrists encounter patients who present with symptoms spanning several diagnostic categories, e.g., showing signs of a psychosis, depression, and anxiety. This raises the critical question of which symptoms hold precedence over other and, by extension, which diagnosis is the right diagnosis. ICD-10 and DSM-5 do not provide unambiguous answers to this question and therefore psychiatry remains exposed to diagnostic disagreement with consequences for treatment and research. We explored symptom distribution in a sample of 98 first-admission psychiatric patients. We extracted and categorized singular symptoms into symptom domains: anxiety, mania, delusions, hallucinations, first-rank symptoms, and negative symptoms. Most symptoms were seen in most disorders. We found symptoms of depression and anxiety in almost all patients. Thus, just counting symptoms do not seem to be a valid way to make diagnoses. We elaborately discuss these issues in the context of the differential-diagnosis between schizophrenia and depression. Finally, we suggest that a combination of a criteria- and Gestalt-based approach to diagnosing mental disorders may contribute to counteract some of the current differential-diagnostic confusion.

### Assessing the validity of a self-reported clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia [^fc1a1c36]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

UK Biobank

UK Biobank is a population-based UK cohort of around 500,000 participants, aged between 40–69 at recruitment. Participants completed a range of assessments and provided a sample for genetic analysis. Ethical approval was granted by the Northwest Multi-Centre Ethics Committee. This study was conducted under UK Biobank project number 13310.

Diagnosis definitions

Table 1 provides an overview of the self-reported, research interview and medical record diagnosis definitions used in this study.

Self-reported diagnosis

In NCMH, participants were asked whether a doctor or health professional had ever told the participant that they had a mental health diagnosis and prompted with a list of psychiatric diagnoses to choose from (Supplementary Fig. 1). In UK Biobank, participants were asked to report if a doctor had told them they had any serious medical condition in the initial assessment. A subset of participants in the UK Biobank (31%) completed the Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ), where they were prompted with a list of psychiatric diagnoses to choose from (Supplementary Fig. 2). For both NCMH and UK Biobank, if the participant chose schizophrenia from the list or they verbally self-reported a schizophrenia diagnosis, they were assigned a schizophrenia self-reported diagnosis in this study. Table 1 describes the subtypes of self-reported diagnoses available in the clinically-ascertained sample. A self-reported schizoaffective disorder diagnosis was excluded from analyses, as it was not possible to differentiate between the depressed and manic subtypes.

Research interview diagnosis

In the clinically-ascertained samples (NCMH and CardiffCOGS), DSM-IV, DSM-5, and ICD-10 research diagnoses were derived from a SCAN-based clinical interview and note review where available. A research interview diagnosis of schizophrenia was given in this study if either a DSM or ICD schizophrenia criteria were met. If participants met criteria for schizoaffective disorder depressed-type (SA-D), they were also included alongside participants with schizophrenia given evidence that these participants do not differ on a range of phenotypic and genotype measures, including symptoms, cognition and polygenic risk. 'Other psychotic disorders' in this study refer to the following diagnoses: psychosis not otherwise specified, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, acute polymorphic disorder, and other psychotic illness.

### Could PANSS be a useful tool in the determining of the stages of schizophrenia? A clinically operational approach [^18b0e2a9]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Staging in schizophrenia might be an important approach for the better treatment and rehabilitation of patients. The purpose of this study was to empirically devise a staging approach in a sample of stabilized patients with schizophrenia. One hundred and seventy patients aged ≥ 18 years (mean = 40.7, SD = 11.6) diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Principal components analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was used. The model was examined in the total sample and separately across a hypothesized stage of illness based on three age groups and between the two sexes. The PCA revealed a six factor structure for the total sample: 1) Negative, 2) Positive, 3) Depression and anxiety, 4) Excitement and Hostility, 5) Neurocognition and 6) Disorganization. The separate PCAs by stage of illness and sex revealed different patterns and quality of symptomatology. The Negative and Positive factors were stable across all examined groups. The models corresponding to different stages differed mainly in terms of neurocognition and disorganization and their interplay. Catatonic features appear more prominent in males while in females neurocognition takes two forms; one with disorganization and one with stereotype thinking with delusions. This study suggests that the three arbitrary defined stages of illness (on the basis of age) seem to reflect a progress from a preserved insight and more coherent mental functioning to disorganization and eventually neurocognitive impairment. Sexes differ in terms of the relationship of psychotic features with neurocognition. These results might have significant research and clinical implications.

### Development of a blood-based molecular biomarker test for identification of schizophrenia before disease onset [^7b2905ca]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diagnosis of schizophrenia has not changed over the last 100 years since Emil Kraepelin first defined the disease and is still based on evaluation of signs and symptoms in clinical interviews. If a patient does not acknowledge the occurrence of symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions, the disease can remain undiagnosed. In addition, some of the symptoms can also occur in patients with mood and personality disorders and, therefore, misdiagnosis is a common occurrence. For example, Gonzalez-Pinto et al. found that approximately one-third of bipolar patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, particularly in youths with short medical histories. Another complication and reason for the delay in diagnosis of schizophrenia is the insidious disease onset and the possibility of multiple or combinatorial causes in the development or manifestation of the disease.

Over the last two decades, prodromal schizophrenia has become a major focus of psychiatric research. This condition is also known as ultra-high-risk syndrome and is normally characterized using structured clinical interviews between patients and psychiatrists for the evaluation of disturbances in perception, thought processing, language and attention. Investigations have shown that 20–30% of these individuals eventually develop schizophrenia over a 2–3-year period. Early diagnosis of schizophrenia would be beneficial for the outcome of patients, especially if this could be achieved before or during the prodromal stages. This is due to the fact that shorter periods of untreated psychosis have been linked to better patient outcomes. In line with this, the recent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has led to discussions on the prodromal syndrome as a potential diagnostic category and this has now been listed in the DSM-5 appendix as a 'condition for further systematic study'. However, there is still concern that an incorrect diagnosis could result in unwarranted treatment and stigma as ~70% of individuals who fulfil prodromal criteria do not develop schizophrenia. These concerns highlight the pressing need to identify robust biomarkers for detection of schizophrenia before disease onset.

### Revisiting the seven pillars of RDoC [^1f223883]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

More than a decade has passed since the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project was initiated, and RDoC has opened a door for researchers who strive to move beyond diagnostic syndromes derived by clinical description as the starting point or the outcome measure(s) for research on mental illness. RDoC has helped to expand the conversation about how psychopathology research is carried out and introduced new ways to conduct it. Some researchers have embraced the principles of RDoC, while others have challenged it in ways that have helped it to evolve. Psychopathology research has diversified in various ways over the past decade. New approaches include studying common dimensions across a combination of disorders pooled together (e.g. across the psychosis spectrum) researching a particular feature within a heterogenous disorder, such as blunted reward processing in melancholic depression or brain connectivity in schizophrenia; carrying out research with new dependent variables, for instance, changes in striatal activity in the study of anhedonia; and researching relevant variables independent of existing diagnostic classifications.

The existence of several major initiatives to reframe psychiatric diagnosis, including the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model, the network approach, and the clinical staging model, illustrates the ongoing need for new approaches to better understand psychopathology. It has become clear that syndromal diagnoses as defined in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM;) and the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease (ICD;) for the past four decades, while emphasizing reliability, have not borne out the identification of valid mechanisms. A more complete understanding of the disruptions in the systems that interact between biology and behavior and their relation to palpable psychopathology is needed for the development of novel therapeutic agents and important to sharpen psychological interventions as well. Perhaps the highest hurdle faced in overcoming problems in psychiatric nosology concerns the extent that diagnoses have been reified — seen as "real entities" — when in reality they are not natural kinds. The reification of clinical syndromes left clinicians and researchers alike with an epistemic roadblock. By providing reference points for third-party payers and disability adjudications, as well as for regulatory bodies, clinical diagnostic manuals face practical constraints on the degree to which they can modify their descriptions and criteria. We (and others) have argued that researchers need a framework that is independent of such constraints in order to facilitate progress connecting advances from integrative neuroscience with disordered behavior and to obtain the knowledge that can help improve clinical diagnostic manuals.

### Subtyping schizophrenia according to outcome or severity: a search for homogeneous subgroups [^46dec88c]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

There is a growing consensus that current definitions of schizophrenia (SZ) include different disorders, or else different dimensions underlain by different pathophysiologies. This article reviews the evidence for the validity of three novel strategies to subtype SZ according to outcome or severity (deficit vs. nondeficit, Kraepelinian vs. non-Kraepelinian, congenital vs. adult-onset). Medline and bibliographies were used to locate articles. The methodology of the studies was reviewed, and their results were grouped according to seven validating criteria. Several differences were found between subtypes, particularly for the deficit/nondeficit subtypes. However, for most of these differences, replications have yet to be undertaken. Important indicators of etiology from the environmental risk factors and genetic domains have received very little attention. These three subtyping strategies represent promising attempts to address the etiologic heterogeneity of SZ. However, one cannot conclude whether these strategies identify etiologically distinct SZ subgroups. We propose ten methodological and conceptual recommendations for future studies aimed at the identification of valid SZ subtypes according to outcome or severity.

### Prognostic accuracy and clinical utility of psychometric instruments for individuals at clinical high-risk of psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cafb3531]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis is a mainstream strategy to improve clinical outcomes. Primary indicated prevention in help-seeking young people displaying attenuated symptoms (at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis, CHR-P) holds the greatest potential to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis. The impact of the CHR-P paradigm is dependent on the accurate prognostication of their outcomes.

Unlike other areas of medicine where biological tests are available, CHR-P prognostication is entirely conducted through psychometric instruments such as the Comprehensive Assessment for At Risk Mental States (CAARMS) and the Structured Interview for Psychosis Risk Syndromes (SIPS) (for the assessment of Ultra High Risk [UHR] criteria); and the Bonn Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS) and Schizophrenia Proneness Instruments - Adult (SPI-A) and Child & Youth (SPI-CY) versions (for the assessment of Basic Symptom criteria). Furthermore, in 2013, diagnostic criteria for Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome were introduced to the DSM-5 (DSM-5-APS) (for comparative analyses see and eIntroduction).

In a previous meta-analysis (including studies until March 2015), we synthesised the prognostic accuracy of CHR-P instruments (n = 11 studies) as excellent (area-under-the-curve, AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87–0.93). Ever since, numerous new CHR-P prognostic accuracy studies have been published, making an update necessary. This is particularly essential given the recently updated transition risk in CHR-P individuals and new diagnostic criteria (DSM-5-APS). This study primarily aims to produce a prognostic accuracy meta-analysis for CHR-P assessments, complementing it with an investigation of its clinical utility.

### Risk factors, clinical features, and polygenic risk scores in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder depressive-type [^8d456dc4]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizoaffective disorder depressive-type (SA-D) is characterized by the co-occurrence of depressive episodes with core features of schizophrenia. However, the validity of schizoaffective disorder, both depressive-type and bipolar-type (SA-BP), has long been debated, particularly given evidence of limited inter-rater reliability and low stability over time. Issues with reliability and stability may in part be driven by a lack of consensus on the definition of SA-D, particularly in terms of the duration and overlap of psychosis and depression. ICD-10 requires 2 weeks or more of psychosis, with psychosis and depression concurrent for at least part of the episode. DSM-IVrequires psychosis for at least 1 month, including at least 2 weeks of hallucinations or delusions in the absence of any prominent symptoms of depression; depression must also occur for a substantial portion of the total illness. The major change in DSM-5was that depression was required to be present for the majority of the total duration of the lifespan of the illness (see table 1 for full criteria). As this criterion requires continuous observation over time, individuals can fluctuate between meeting and not meeting the diagnostic criteria, thus leading to an exaggerated perception of schizoaffective disorder as an unstable diagnosis.

### Schizoaffective disorder diagnosed according to different diagnostic criteria – systematic literature search and meta-analysis of key clinical characteristics and heterogeneity [^c71c63d3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Schizoaffective disorder is viewed as a heterogeneous diagnosis among psychotic illnesses. Different diagnostic systems differ in their definition with DSM (-IIIR, -IV, and -V) providing a narrower definition than RDC and ICD-10. It is unclear whether this difference is reflected in patient samples diagnosed according to different diagnostic systems.

Methods

Exploratory study based on a systematic review of studies of schizoaffective disorder samples diagnosed by either RDC and ICD-10 (group of "broad criteria") or DSM-IIIR and -IV ("narrow criteria"); comparison (by Mann-Whitney-U-tests) of key characteristics, such as age, number of hospitalizations, or scores in psychometric tests, between more broadly and more narrowly defined schizoaffective disorder samples using standard deviations as a measurement of heterogeneity as well as weighted means and percentages. To reduce selection bias only studies including schizoaffective patient samples together with affective disorder and schizophrenia samples were selected.

Results

55 studies were included, 14 employing RDC, 4 ICD-10, 20 DSM-IIIR, and 17 DSM-IV. Thirteen characteristics were compared: patients diagnosed according to broader criteria had fewer previous hospitalizations (2.2 vs. 5.4) and were both less often male (42 vs. 51%) and married (21 vs. 40%). Heterogeneity was similar in both groups but slightly higher in RDC and ICD-10 samples than in DSM-IIIR and -IV-samples: +4% regarding demographic and clinical course data and +13% regarding psychometric tests (pooled SD).

Limitations

Secular trends and different designs may have confounded the results and limit generalizability. Some comparisons were underpowered.

Conclusions

Differences in diagnostic criteria are reflected in key characteristics of samples. The association of larger heterogeneity with wider diagnostic criteria supports employing standard deviations as a measurement of heterogeneity.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^1a905159]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The personal, cultural, and clinical significances of hallucinations have changed in the 200 years since they were defined by Esquirol as "the intimate conviction of actually perceiving a sensation for which there is no external object". There is a growing recognition that hallucinatory experiences attend a wide variety of psychiatric diagnoses and can be part of everyday experience for people who do not meet criteria for mental illness. For the experiencer, hallucinations can have important personal meanings, and for clinicians, they are also significant in varied ways, including as diagnostic symptom and as factors which may impact on functioning and prognosis, and therefore potentially the necessity of treatment.

Since the earliest clinical texts, auditory hallucinations have been closely linked to schizophrenia. Hallucinations constitute one of the 5 domains of abnormality of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders in DSM-5. Although not diagnostic of schizophrenia when occurring in isolation, the presence of persistent auditory hallucinations is sufficient for a diagnosis of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, if it is combined with clinically significant distress or functional impairment (ref. p. 122).

The emphasis on the clinical significance of hallucinations in DSM-5requires closer examination given our growing understanding of hallucinations that feature outside of psychosis. It is increasingly recognized that hallucinations occur with significant frequency in other psychiatric (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], personality disorders) and medical conditions (neurodegenerative conditions and eye disease) and that they are especially predictive of multimorbid psychopathology. A predominant view, however, is that some features of hallucinations may distinguish schizophrenia and related disorders from other conditions. Candidate distinguishing features that have become important diagnostically include negative and derogatory auditory hallucinations; command hallucinations; voices heard conversing about the individual in the third person; and location in external space.

Given the status of hallucinations as diagnostic markers in DSM-5, there is a pressing need to establish their specificity to psychotic disorders, particularly through comparison of their featural properties across different population groups. This exercise is also essential if we are to understand how hallucinations function in cognitive and neuroscientific models of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

### Is schizoaffective disorder a useful diagnosis? [^71706cb6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is frequently used to describe a psychotic person with significant symptoms of depression and/or mania. The word schizoaffective was introduced by Jacob Kasanin in 1933 and has appeared in all editions of the DSM since 1952. However, the current DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is not reliable and is of limited clinical utility. The validity is built primarily on the prediction of course and outcome and on emerging findings from genetic and neurobiological studies. This review of the current status of schizoaffective disorder concludes with several suggestions for a revision of the diagnosis within a categorical or dimensional nosology of psychotic and affective disorders.

### Treatment-resistant schizophrenia: treatment response and resistance in psychosis (TRRIP) working group consensus guidelines on diagnosis and terminology [^ddb56686]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Research and clinical translation in schizophrenia is limited by inconsistent definitions of treatment resistance and response. To address this issue, the authors evaluated current approaches and then developed consensus criteria and guidelines.

Method

A systematic review of randomized antipsychotic clinical trials in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was performed, and definitions of treatment resistance were extracted. Subsequently, consensus operationalized criteria were developed through 1) a multiphase, mixed methods approach, 2) identification of key criteria via an online survey, and 3) meetings to achieve consensus.

Results

Of 2,808 studies identified, 42 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 studies (50%) did not provide operationalized criteria. In the remaining studies, criteria varied considerably, particularly regarding symptom severity, prior treatment duration, and antipsychotic dosage thresholds; only two studies (5%) utilized the same criteria. The consensus group identified minimum and optimal criteria, employing the following principles: 1) current symptoms of a minimum duration and severity determined by a standardized rating scale; 2) moderate or worse functional impairment; 3) prior treatment consisting of at least two different antipsychotic trials, each for a minimum duration and dosage; 4) systematic monitoring of adherence and meeting of minimum adherence criteria; 5) ideally at least one prospective treatment trial; and 6) criteria that clearly separate responsive from treatment-resistant patients.

Conclusions

There is considerable variation in current approaches to defining treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The authors present consensus guidelines that operationalize criteria for determining and reporting treatment resistance, adequate treatment, and treatment response, providing a benchmark for research and clinical translation.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^99d72a65]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Schizoaffective disorder maintenance context — paliperidone LAI "has been studied in the maintenance treatment of schizoaffective disorder by the DSM-IV criteria and was shown to be effective". Diagnostic changes specify that in DSM-IV the mood episode duration had to be "brief", defined as "2.5% of the time", whereas DSM-5/DSM-5-TR enlarged the allowable duration for schizophrenia to a "minority" of illness time "(i.e., it could be as high as 49%)", so "many individuals who would have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder will now meet the criteria for schizophrenia".

### A dimensional approach to psychosis: identifying cognition, depression, and thought disorder factors in a clinical sample [^9765348d]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Dimensions of psychosis

Our understanding of primary psychotic disorders could benefit from a multi-dimensional approach. They are characterized by the presence of delusions (fixed false beliefs) and hallucinations (sensory perceptions in the absence of a stimulus), which are not secondary to a somatic disease or the psychological effects of a substance. In the DSM-5, they are summarized as schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Defining these disorders as part of a spectrum is a first step towards a multi-dimensional view, corroborated by the inclusion of a Psychosis Symptom Severity Scale, where the occurrences of different symptoms are rated on a five-point scale. Still, the spectrum consists of several discrete diagnoses that differ in severity and symptom profile. Test-retest reliability was high for a dimensional measure of psychosis, but lower for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar I disorder as per the DSM-5, which can be seen as evidence in favor of a multi-dimensional approach. Internal consistency was also higher for dimensional psychosis traits when directly compared to DSM diagnoses. Evidence also suggests that the psychosis dimension continues into the healthy spectrum. A study investigating how well personality traits align with schizophrenia symptoms and schizotypal traits found that the model combining them provided the best fit. This notion is also supported by the prevalence of transient psychotic experiences, especially during adolescence, that do not develop into a psychotic disorder, which has been taken as evidence of a psychosis continuum.

### Validity and utility of a set of clinical criteria for cognitive impairment associated with psychosis (CIAPs) [^42b7a4a8]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia and other psychoses display a common profile of mild to moderate cognitive deficits that are associated with poor functional outcomes. Cognitive impairment is usually evaluated by neuropsychological assessment, and interview-based measures with good psychometric properties and high utility for clinical practice are now available. However, the extent to which a set of clinical criteria can be used as proxy measures of cognitive deficits in this population has not been tested. This study aimed to examine the empirical validity of a set of clinical criteria for cognitive impairment associated with psychosis (CIAPs). Ninety-eight patients with non-pure affective psychosis and 50 healthy-matched controls were included. The CIAPs criteria were empirically tested against antecedent, concurrent and outcome validators and by means of a neuropsychological evaluation based on MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The CIAPs criteria showed strong associations with outcomes and certain antecedent validators and moderate associations with concurrent validators. The CIAPs criteria achieved superior neuropsychological validity compared to current DSM 5 criteria for schizophrenia, the B-criterion of DSM 5 schizophrenia or a combination of both criteria. Cognitive impairment associated with psychosis can be clinically assessed and is a useful tool for clinical practice and predicting outcomes of schizophrenia and related psychosis.

DSM-IV to DSM-5 major depressive episode/disorder — additional criteria and exclusions: Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment and are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a medical condition; symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode, there has never been a manic or hypomanic episode, and major depressive episode (MDE) is not better explained by schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders; symptoms are also not better accounted for by bereavement, including persistence for longer than 2 months or specified severe features. Footnotes specify persistence most of the day, daily, for at least 2 weeks in a row (with exclusion of A3 and A9 from this persistence requirement) and define a mixed episode as occurring almost daily for at least a 1-week period.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider defining a sufficient response to initial treatment as a reduction of 25% in total score on a symptom assessment scale or a one-point improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale within 2 weeks. Define a definitive response as a 40–50% reduction or a two-point improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions scale after 6 weeks. Aim for symptom remission, such as no more than a mild severity rating for a range of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale items, as the target for the overall treatment of the initial episode.

Table 1.
Criteria for Schizoaffective Disorder Depressive-Type in ICD-10, DSM-IV, and DSM-5

Research into schizoaffective disorder has often combined bipolar and depressive subtypes, despite evidence supporting their distinction. Studies that have done so have suggested that schizoaffective disorder may represent an intermediate category between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder are more likely than individuals with schizophrenia to have been married, to have better cognitive functioning, and to have a better treatment response. Compared to individuals with mood disorders, individuals with schizoaffective disorder had poorer outcomes for these characteristics, as well as for various other demographics and clinical characteristics. Patterns of familial aggregation have also been reported to differ between those with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. In comparison with healthy controls, people with schizoaffective disorder have a higher family history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder, while diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are most strongly associated with a family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, respectively. However, as noted above, much of this research has combined (or not distinguished between) bipolar and depressive subtypes of schizoaffective disorder, and therefore it is unclear whether these findings are applicable to both or only one subtype.

Studies that have distinguished SA-D from SA-BP have found that people with SA-D typically have poorer functioning than individuals with a diagnosis of psychotic depression, but better functioning than individuals with schizophrenia across a range of measures, including cognitive, premorbid, and overall functioning. In the context of shared symptoms, SA-D might be better considered an intermediate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorderrather than between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A twin study found that co-twins of individuals with SA-D were more likely to experience schizophrenia, SA-D, SA-BP, mania, and psychotic depression, than co-twins of unaffected controls. Therefore, SA-D may arise from elevated liability to schizophrenia and depression, and, to a lesser extent, mania. Family studies have supported this conclusion, showing that relatives of individuals with SA-D are at higher risk of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, compared to relatives of unaffected individuals. Although SA-D, like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is highly heritable (around 80%), there has been very little genetic research into SA-D, individuals with SA-D being generally treated as if they have a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

### Characteristics and heterogeneity of schizoaffective disorder compared with unipolar depression and schizophrenia-a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^3fb5ea97]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Comparisons of illness characteristics between patients with schizoaffective disorder (SAD) patients and unipolar depression (UD) are rare, even though UD is one of the most important differential diagnoses of SAD. Also, the variability of illness characteristics (heterogeneity) has not been compared. We compared illness characteristics and their heterogeneity among SAD, UD, and - as another important differential diagnosis - schizophrenia (S).

Methods

In order to reduce sampling bias we systematically searched for studies simultaneously comparing samples of patients with SAD, UD, and S. Using random effects and Mantel-Haenszel models we estimated and compared demographic, illness course and psychopathology parameters, using pooled standard deviations as a measurement of heterogeneity.

Results

Out of 155 articles found by an earlier meta-analysis, 765 screened in Medline, 2738 screened in EMBASE, and 855 screened in PsycINFO we selected 24 studies, covering 3714 patients diagnosed according to RDC, DSM-III, DSM-IIIR, DSM-IV, or ICD-10. In almost all key characteristics, samples with schizoaffective disorders fell between unipolar depression and schizophrenia, with a tendency towards schizophrenia. On average, UD patients were significantly older at illness onset (33.0 years, SAD: 25.2, S: 23.4), more often women (59% vs. 57% vs. 39%) and more often married (53% vs. 39% vs. 27%). Their psychopathology was also less severe, as measured by BPRS, GAS, and HAMD. In demographic and clinical variables heterogeneity was roughly 5% larger in UD than in SAD, and samples of patients with schizophrenia had the lowest pooled heterogeneity. A similar picture emerged in a sensitivity analysis with coefficient of variation as the measurement of heterogeneity.

Limitations

Relative to bipolar disorder there are fewer studies including unipolar patients. No studies based on DSM-5 could be included.

Conclusions

Regarding unipolar affective disorder this study confirms what we have shown for bipolar disorders in earlier studies: schizoaffective disorder falls between schizophrenia and affective disorders, and there are relevant quantitative differences in key illness characteristics, which supports the validity of the schizoaffective disorder concept. Contrary to our expectations heterogeneity is not larger in SAD than in UD and not substantially higher than in S. Lower reliability of the diagnosis of SAD therefore cannot be ascribed to higher variability of illness characteristics in SAD.

### Remission criteria for schizophrenia: evaluation in a large naturalistic cohort [^542e4e72]. Schizophrenia Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, remission criteria for schizophrenia have been proposed, based on low symptom severity of core symptoms (severity criterion), sustained over minimally 6 months (time criterion). Little is known, however, about the added value of the time criterion in addition to the cross-sectional severity criterion.

Methods

In order to evaluate whether remission is a valid concept for daily clinical practice, the cumulative incidence of patients meeting remission criteria was evaluated in a large naturalistic prospective study of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in different treatment settings in Belgium. The impact of being in remission on global and daily functioning was evaluated.

Results

Over time, nearly 1 out of 3 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (29%) met criteria for remission at study endpoint. Patients in remission had better insight in their disorder, a higher level of global functioning and functioned better with respect to daily living tasks, both compared to patients never meeting remission criteria and to patients only meeting the severity criterion but not the time criterion. Of the patients not meeting remission criteria at baseline, 21% attained remission at study endpoint.

Conclusion

The remission severity and time criteria appear to combine into a valid concept for daily clinical practice and should be a target for treatment.

### Deconstructing bipolar disorder: a critical review of its diagnostic validity and a proposal for DSM-V and ICD-11 [^4d3b5bc9]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

The Validity of Bipolar Disorder as a Diagnostic Category

Content Validity Problems of Current Definitions of Bipolar Disorder

The concept of bipolar disorder involves the current or past occurrence of at least one episode of mania or hypomania or a mixed episode, which is usually, but not necessarily, preceded or followed by a depressive episode, cyclic changes between mood states, and eventually psychotic symptoms, which are assumed to be a marker of the severity of the episode. By excluding psychotic symptoms from the definition, leaving them as mere correlate of impairment or severity (criterion D), the DSM s have indirectly reinforced the (wrong) idea that psychotic symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia but not bipolar disorder. Furthermore, they have taken little advantage of the potential value of characterizing psychotic features (ie, mood congruent vs mood incongruent) for discriminant validity vs schizophrenia.

Moreover, the definition of major depression in bipolar disorder in the DSM s does not make any difference with unipolar depression. Nevertheless, the DSM acknowledges the bipolar/unipolar dichotomy as opposed to the Kraepelinian concept of manic-depressive illness, which is still advocated by some authors. This carries the problem that the diagnosis of bipolar depression can only be made after a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode has occurred. The system is, thus, assuming some loss of predictive validity in unipolar depression and increasing the heterogeneity of the concept of major depression, which may be too broad. Conversely, the concept of mixed episodes is very narrowly defined as the concurrence of a full manic and depressive episode, leaving behind many potentially useful concepts such as mixed hypomania, and excluding the possibility that bipolar II patients may have mixed episodes. The definition of mixed states underlines once again the difficulties of converting dimensional concepts into diagnostic categories.

ICD-10 was to ICD-9 what DSM-III was to DSM-II: a major switch from a pure classification code towards a novel classification with operational diagnostic criteria; in some way, it was born as a "global" alternative to DSM-III. As far as bipolar disorder is concerned, the most relevant difference between the 2 systems is that in ICD-10 episodes are also diagnosis and that hypomania is seen as mild form of mania in the latter (1 week duration, social impairment needed); to differentiate the concept between affective and nonaffective psychoses, the "prominence" of psychotic vs affective symptoms is claimed, without any clear definition of what prominence means.

### Negative symptom domain prevalence across diagnostic boundaries: the relevance of diagnostic shifts [^e94a92f5]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Negative symptoms are included in diagnostic manuals as part of criteria for schizophrenia spectrum psychoses only, however some studies have found their presence in other diagnoses. This study sought to clarify negative symptom domain prevalence across diagnostic categories, while investigating whether negative symptoms predicted diagnostic shift over time. Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) data were collected at first presentation in 197 individuals presenting with first episode psychosis and again at one year follow-up assessment. Negative symptoms were highest among individuals with schizophrenia and among those whose diagnosis shifted from non-schizophrenia spectrum at baseline to schizophrenia spectrum at follow-up. In a non-schizophrenia spectrum group negative symptoms at baseline were not a significant predictor of diagnostic shift to schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses. The study suggests negative symptoms can present among individuals with non-schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses, although this is most relevant for individuals following diagnostic shift from non-schizophrenia spectrum to schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses. The findings support introduction of a negative symptom dimension when describing a range of psychotic illnesses, and indicate that further research investigating the evolution of negative symptoms in non-schizophrenia diagnoses is needed.

### Unique and overlapping symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and dissociative disorders in relation to models of psychopathology: a systematic review [^f1bf43c7]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) and dissociative disorders (DDs) are described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and tenth edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as 2 categorically distinct diagnostic categories. However, several studies indicate high levels of co-occurrence between these diagnostic groups, which might be explained by overlapping symptoms. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research concerning overlap and differences in symptoms between schizophrenia spectrum and DDs. For this purpose the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature. The literature contained a large body of evidence showing the presence of symptoms of dissociation in SSDs. Although there are quantitative differences between diagnoses, overlapping symptoms are not limited to certain domains of dissociation, nor to nonpathological forms of dissociation. In addition, dissociation seems to be related to a history of trauma in SSDs, as is also seen in DDs. There is also evidence showing that positive and negative symptoms typically associated with schizophrenia may be present in DD. Implications of these results are discussed with regard to different models of psychopathology and clinical practice.

### Diagnostic model development for schizophrenia based on peripheral blood mononuclear cell subtype-specific expression of metabolic markers [^85f642ac]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition, which currently affects approximately 20 million people around the world. It is consistently ranked amongst the most debilitating disorders and is estimated to account for 13.4 million years of life lived with a disability annually. The severity of the disease, as well as its debilitating symptoms, cause a significant burden not only to the affected individuals but also to society at large, despite the relatively low prevalence. The annual direct and indirect costs of schizophrenia in the UK alone are estimated at 6.7 billion pounds, with the cost of lost productivity due to unemployment, absence from work, and premature mortality of patients amounting to 3.4 billion pounds. With the prevalence of schizophrenia continuously rising, both the personal and economic costs are expected to increase accordingly. These negative impacts of the disease could be averted with earlier and more accurate diagnostic tools for schizophrenia, as its early diagnosis is associated with improved long-term outcomes.

One of the greatest challenges to the effective treatment and diagnosis of schizophrenia is the lack of understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease. Schizophrenia is considered a highly heterogenous disorder, and is often misdiagnosed with other mental health conditions. For instance, it is estimated that 24% of schizophrenia patients are initially misdiagnosed, primarily with bipolar disorder. The current diagnostic procedures involve interview-based methods in accordance with guidelines such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th edition, and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), 11th revision. Therefore, diagnosis is often impacted by subjective interpretation of symptoms, and may be inconsistent between psychiatrist evaluations. For example, the interrater agreement when diagnosing schizophrenia according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV guidelines is at best moderate, with Cohen's kappa coefficients ranging from 0.56 to 0.59 on a 0–1 scale. In addition, psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia usually appear after a pre-psychotic prodromal stage, when initial symptoms of schizophrenia may be indistinguishable from those of certain affective disorders, further complicating early diagnosis. Moreover, while there are currently no preventive measures protecting from developing schizophrenia, evidence suggests that responses to existing treatments in first-episode patients are superior to those of chronic patients, and that biological effects are strongest following early interventions. Considering that current estimates for the mean duration of untreated psychosis range from 22 to over 150 weeks, these factors highlight the pressing need for novel, objective diagnostics capable of differential diagnosis at the early stages of schizophrenia.

Bipolar II disorder — DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria require at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode, with no history of a manic episode; the episodes are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder or superimposed on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, and the symptoms of depression or the unpredictability from frequent alternation between depression and hypomania cause clinically significant distress or impairment.

### Monozygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia differ in maturation and synaptic transmission [^4be21a4c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 1% worldwide, and full recovery of these patients is limited and the prognosis is guarded. Schizophrenia is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, (DSM-5) by at least 2 of the following symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, negative symptoms, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. At least one of the symptoms must be the presence of disorganized speech, delusions, or hallucinations. These signs and symptoms of the disturbance must persist for at least 6 months; during this time, the patient must experience at least one month of active symptoms and social or occupational deterioration problems over a significant period. These problems are unique and not related to other conditions, e.g. psychoactive substances or neurologic conditions.

First-episode psychosis (FEP) in U.S. military populations — According to the DSM-5, the peak age of onset in the general population occurs "between the early to mid-20s for males and late-20s for females". A Department of Defense report "covering calendar years 2018–2020 estimated the prevalence of FEP among U.S. active duty Service members to be 95 per 100,000", and "of the 3,943 cohort members in the study period, 57% (2,320) were separated from service by one year of the initial diagnosis". Recognition of prodromal syndromes and FEP is described as "critical because effective management of these conditions could have a substantial downstream impact on the severity and progression of psychiatric illness later in life", yet "as of the writing of this CPG, no standard early intervention and treatment protocol exists for those individuals in the DoD military system".

### The impact of diagnostic criteria on the prevalence of schizophrenic subtypes [^c1b94d05]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The distribution of schizophrenic subtypes shows a high range of cross-cultural and historical variations. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of different diagnostic criteria on the prevalence of schizophrenic subtypes. A sample of 220 consecutively admitted schizophrenic patients from 3 different psychiatric institutions was classified according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and Bleuler's and Leonhard's criteria. Especially, the frequency of catatonic (10%-22%) and hebephrenic (5%-20%) subtypes of schizophrenia varied within a broad range depending on the diagnostic system applied. The comparison of International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition with "classical" criteria (Bleuler, Leonhard) for the different schizophrenic subtypes showed a reduction of typical symptoms and the introduction of criteria of prominence during the last century. These changes caused 2 trajectories ("paranoidization" and "shift into residual categories") explaining these cross-sectional variations.
