## Question

What are the best antibiotics for skin infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about selecting antibiotics for skin and soft tissue infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the infection phenotype and severity. Then, I should verify likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. Next, I will consider source control and whether antibiotics are even indicated. After that, I will select empiric therapy tailored to severity and risk factors, including MRSA and gram-negative coverage. Finally, I should confirm duration, IV-to-oral switch criteria, and stewardship checkpoints, and I will double-check special scenarios like necrotizing infections, immunocompromise, and surgical site infections.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification because empiric therapy hinges on it; I need to distinguish purulent versus nonpurulent disease, assess for necrotizing features, and gauge severity using systemic inflammatory response and hemodynamic stability, since these dimensions drive both the need for broad-spectrum therapy and the urgency of surgical source control [^115p3xNL] [^115pZHJE].

> Wait, let me verify the likely pathogens before choosing antibiotics; Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci predominate in community-acquired SSTIs, but gram-negative and polymicrobial infections are not rare in selected contexts, so I should factor in patient-specific risks and local epidemiology before finalizing coverage [^111Ga75V] [^114jKMrH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for abscesses; for uncomplicated purulent infections, incision and drainage is the cornerstone, and routine antibiotics are not required, though I should consider adding TMP-SMX or clindamycin when there are multiple lesions, systemic features, immunocompromise, or slow response, and I should remember that clindamycin has higher adverse event rates than TMP-SMX in trials [^11537E23] [^113gWrmr] [^117K9Mud].

> I need to ensure I tailor empiric therapy to severity and setting; for mild nonpurulent cellulitis without MRSA risk, a beta-lactam active against streptococci such as cephalexin or dicloxacillin is appropriate, whereas with MRSA risk or purulence I should add MRSA-active therapy like TMP-SMX or doxycycline, and for severe disease or suspected necrotizing infection I should start broad-spectrum IV therapy with MRSA plus gram-negative and anaerobic coverage and arrange urgent surgical evaluation [^116QtZHg] [^115p3xNL] [^1125JJvB].

> Let me consider oral options for MRSA coverage; TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, and linezolid are reasonable choices depending on local resistance, patient tolerance, and the need for streptococcal coverage, and I should double-check clindamycin inducible resistance locally before prescribing it for MRSA [^112w921g] [^111aNudS].

> For severe infections requiring IV therapy, I should confirm dosing and options; vancomycin remains a standard MRSA backbone, with alternatives including linezolid, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and the long-acting lipoglycopeptides dalbavancin and oritavancin, while broad gram-negative coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, or a carbapenem is indicated when polymicrobial infection is suspected or the patient is critically ill [^114QR2Zr] [^116BXJks] [^1125JJvB].

> I should double-check duration and de-escalation; uncomplicated cellulitis can often be treated for 5 days if improving, whereas severe infections or those with slow response may require 7–14 days, and I need to reassess at 48–72 hours to narrow therapy based on cultures and clinical trajectory, switching to oral agents as soon as the patient is clinically stable and bacteremia has cleared if present [^116QtZHg] [^111hLpaX] [^115bjUCK].

> But wait, what if this is a necrotizing infection; I need to act immediately with surgical exploration and debridement, aggressive resuscitation, and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, adding clindamycin for toxin suppression in streptococcal disease, and I should continue antibiotics until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient is clinically improved, and fever has resolved for 48–72 hours [^115pZHJE] [^115KTVPq] [^113QMhjS].

> Let me verify special populations; in immunocompromised hosts I should broaden empiric coverage early, consider atypical pathogens, and involve infectious diseases consultation, whereas in pediatrics I must avoid doxycycline in children under 8 and tailor dosing to weight, and in patients with renal impairment I should adjust renally cleared agents and consider alternatives like linezolid when appropriate [^114UMZjh] [^112w921g] [^114QR2Zr].

> I need to ensure I address surgical site infections correctly; for deep incisional SSI, suture removal with incision and drainage is essential, and systemic antibiotics are indicated when there is a significant systemic response or incomplete source control, with gram-positive coverage for clean procedures and broader coverage for procedures involving the axilla, GI, GU, or perineum [^115R1LHt] [^113Etuia].

> Hold on, I should verify stewardship levers; computerized prompts that estimate MDRO risk can safely reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic use without worsening outcomes, and I should routinely incorporate local antibiograms, avoid unnecessary antipseudomonal coverage in low-risk patients, and de-escalate promptly when cultures return [^1157vWmV] [^112Skm19].

> Let me reconsider emerging options; newer agents like omadacycline and delafloxacin offer oral or IV flexibility with MRSA activity and can be useful in selected patients, but I should confirm local availability, cost, and resistance patterns before positioning them in routine care [^112aFry4] [^116Mhbs2].

> In summary, I should confirm classification and severity, secure source control when indicated, match empiric therapy to likely pathogens and local resistance, start IV therapy for severe disease with timely oral step-down, reassess at 48–72 hours to narrow or stop antibiotics, and individualize duration to clinical response, because these steps align with guideline-based care and contemporary evidence [^115sNUpw] [^111hLpaX] [^115pZHJE].

---

The best antibiotics for skin infections depend on severity, likely pathogens, and local resistance patterns [^111hLpaX]. For uncomplicated cellulitis, use **cephalexin or dicloxacillin** for 5–7 days [^116QtZHg]; add **doxycycline or TMP-SMX** if MRSA risk is high [^112w921g]. For abscesses, **incision and drainage is primary** [^116VEGCz]; add **TMP-SMX or clindamycin** if systemic features or high MRSA risk [^113UkXua]. For severe or necrotizing infections, use **vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam** or a carbapenem [^1125JJvB]; consider linezolid or daptomycin for MRSA [^114QR2Zr]. Tailor to culture results and local antibiograms, and limit duration to 5–7 days when clinically improved [^111hLpaX].

---

## Common pathogens and resistance patterns

- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common; MRSA is prevalent in the community and hospitals [^113QrJ7t].
- **Beta-hemolytic streptococci**: Common in nonpurulent cellulitis and erysipelas [^116VEGCz].
- **Gram-negative rods**: More frequent in healthcare-associated or complicated infections [^114jKMrH].
- **Anaerobes**: Consider in necrotizing infections or diabetic foot ulcers [^notfound].

---

## Antibiotic selection by clinical scenario

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated cellulitis (nonpurulent) | - Cephalexin <br/> - Dicloxacillin <br/> - Amoxicillin-clavulanate | - 5–7 days [^114JW9ff] <br/> - Add doxycycline or TMP-SMX if MRSA risk [^111aNudS] |
| Purulent infection/abscess | - Incision and drainage primary [^116VEGCz] <br/> - TMP-SMX <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - Doxycycline | Add antibiotics if systemic features, multiple lesions, or immunocompromised [^113UkXua] |
| Severe infection (systemic symptoms, necrotizing features) | - Vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam <br/> - Vancomycin + carbapenem <br/> - Linezolid or daptomycin for MRSA | - Broad-spectrum coverage <br/> - Early surgical consultation [^112EmR9h] |
| MRSA coverage | - TMP-SMX <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Linezolid <br/> - Daptomycin | Choice depends on severity, allergies, and local resistance [^114JW9ff] |
| Beta-lactam allergy | - Clindamycin <br/> - TMP-SMX <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Linezolid | Adjust based on severity and local patterns [^111hLpaX] |

---

## Duration of therapy

Uncomplicated infections typically require **5–7 days**, extending if the response is slow [^116QtZHg]. Severe or complicated infections generally require **10–14 days**, individualized to clinical response [^111aNudS].

---

## Emerging therapies and novel antibiotics

- **Omadacycline**: Oral/IV aminomethylcycline effective for MRSA and streptococci [^112aFry4].
- **Delafloxacin**: Fluoroquinolone with MRSA activity and favorable safety [^notfound].
- **Long-acting agents**: Dalbavancin and oritavancin enable single-dose IV therapy for MRSA [^116BXJks].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Clinical cure is high with appropriate therapy, though **recurrence is common** in MRSA and abscesses [^113gWrmr]. Recurrence is reduced by **adequate drainage, adherence, and MRSA decolonization** [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing antibiotic choice

- **Allergies**: Avoid beta-lactams in severe allergy; use clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline [^115KTVPq].
- **Comorbidities**: Adjust dosing for renal/hepatic impairment; consider drug interactions [^112pM8B3].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones; use beta-lactams or clindamycin [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures and adjunctive therapies

Preventive measures include **hygiene, wound care, and MRSA decolonization** [^117Sqa6Q]. Adjunctive therapies include **topical mupirocin for impetigo** [^116VX7UL] and **wound care to reduce recurrence**.

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA 2014 provides comprehensive guidance on diagnosis, empiric therapy, and duration [^115p3xNL]. WSES/SIS-E 2018 emphasizes **early source control, broad-spectrum empiric therapy, and early IV-to-oral switch** [^116BXJks].

---

The best antibiotics for skin infections are those that match severity, likely pathogens, and local resistance, with **source control and stewardship** to optimize outcomes and minimize resistance [^112Skm19].

### Advances in the medical management of skin and soft tissue infections [^115csuj1]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

### Current international and national guidelines for managing skin and soft tissue infections [^111a7LNw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections account for a significant percentage of both community and nosocomial infections. Several nosological entities are included in this concept. However, there is a very scarce body of doctrine for their treatment based on randomised trials. Therefore, we considered it necessary to review current treatment guidelines to bring new recommendations and improvements to our colleagues. In this review of recent literature, we identified updated guidelines in this area by searching the databases PubMed, evidence-based medicine online, York University reviewers group, Cochrane, MBE-Trip and Sumsearch using the terms: soft tissue infection, therapy, guideline.

Recent Findings

Developments focus on using new antimicrobials and on the prescription of shorter antibiotic treatment courses.

Summary

With the development of new drugs and the current evidence of their use, there is a need to refine the appropriate drug's decision-making. Drugs with a long half-life, which allows weekly administration, can reduce hospital admission and length of stay with fewer healthcare resources. Shorter courses of antibiotics are recommended. The role of stewardship programmes will continue to expand. The surgical indication and its value are evident in many patients. Therefore, management should rely on a collaborative group with experience in this disease.

### Novel ways of preventing antibiotic-resistant infections: what might the future hold? [^111iaAgK]. American Journal of Infection Control (2006). Low credibility.

Most antibiotic-resistant bacteria are opportunistic pathogens; they colonize the skin and mucosal surfaces and only cause infection when the opportunity arises. Thus, the processes that lead to an infection attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be broadly divided into those processes that lead to acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and those that lead to the development of an infection with that organism. We review the processes that lead to the development of infections attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We then discuss options that may become available to interrupt these processes and, thus, may reduce the rate of infections attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the future.

### Emerging treatment options for skin and soft tissue infections tailoring drug selection to individual patients [^114S9jGm]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a brief overview of drugs in Phase II and III of development for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), offering insights into potential customized treatment options.

Recent Findings

Several drugs are currently in advanced stages of evaluation for the treatment of ABSSSI, and numerous molecules are entering in the early development phases. Notably, many of these drugs exhibit unique mechanisms of action and interesting antimicrobial spectrum.

Summary

Tailoring antibiotic therapy based on patient characteristics, likely pathogens, type, site and severity of ABSSSI is crucial. Given the inherent limitations of available treatments, the development of novel agents is a pivotal avenue. Such advancements hold promise for enhancing treatment efficacy and simplifying drug selection for ABSSSI in everyday clinical practice.

### Alternative clinical indications for novel antibiotics licensed for skin and soft tissue infection? [^1138LN5G]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A number of novel antibiotics in different classes have been registered and licensed in recent years for complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Many of these have activity against resistant gram-positive bacteria (linezolid, daptomycin, oritavancin, dalbavancin and tedizolid). In addition, two have gram-negative activity (ceftaroline and tigecycline). The licence for the clinical use of these agents is very narrow, but the clinical need is much broader. This is a personal opinion of the prospective clinical roles for these novel antibiotics.

Recent Findings

All were found to be noninferior to standard comparators in registration trials. There are few data on their use in other clinical conditions outside the narrow confines of the registration trials. 'Off-label' use is likely to be more common than the licensed use, and data need to be collected on clinical and microbiological efficacy and adverse effects in real life.

Summary

There is now a wide range of antibiotics for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and they all have a role in different clinical scenarios. Use in nonlicensed situations needs to be assessed.

### Meta-analysis of trials evaluating parenteral antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infections [^113BUpgQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many trials have been carried out to determine the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in treating skin and soft tissue infections. The results of these studies are often utilized to make determinations about the use of these antimicrobials against other types of infections. Despite the importance of these trials in determining clinical care, we hypothesized that many of these studies failed to include a variety of infections of significant enough severity to effectively draw objective conclusions about antimicrobial efficacy.

Methods

We conducted a modified PubMed search to identify studies of antimicrobial agents in treating soft tissue infections that were published from 1998 through 2008. We then evaluated these trials for specific recommended study criteria, which were based on published US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for the conduct of trials of antimicrobials for soft tissue infection.

Results

Seventeen studies were identified for inclusion in the trial. Upon review, only 30% of trials required both local and systemic signs of infection for inclusion in the trial. One trial stratified results on the basis of operative intervention, less than half reported patient comorbidities, and only 53% provided a specific definition for "cure".

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis of current trials evaluating antimicrobial therapy for skin and soft tissue infections revealed substantial shortcomings in the design of most of these trials. These data provide evidence for the importance of designing specialist panels to objectively evaluate studies and photographs of included infections to ensure that conclusions drawn from these trials concerning clinical practice are justified.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^113QrJ7t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs) are a common reason for seeking care at acute healthcare facilities, including emergency departments. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism associated with these infections, and the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has represented a considerable challenge in their treatment. To address this need, a number of new antibiotics have been developed for the treatment of ABSSSIs in the past several years. Most of these agents focus primarily on gram-positive organisms, particularly MRSA; however, there has not been an oral agent that can reliably treat MRSA, as well as relevant gram-negative pathogens. Acute skin infections that involve mixed gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens must also be considered as they can be associated with discordant antimicrobial therapy. Here, I review ABSSSI treatment guidelines in the hospital setting and discuss current and future antibiotic options for treatment of this commonly encountered infection.

### The role of older antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections: current perspectives [^116BCrDn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the evidence and recent literature on the role of older antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs).

Recent Findings

The choice of therapy for SSTIs is complicated in view of the rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the availability of new antibiotics. SSTIs are predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci, but other organisms can be involved in patients with comorbidities or post trauma. Treatment options are dictated by the accessibility and cost of newer antibiotics in resource-constrained settings. 'Old antibiotics' including β-lactams, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin remain good choices in treating SSTIs. They offer affordable options for outpatient settings. Only few randomized trials have addressed the role of the old agents in SSTIs treatment. Studies suggest that these agents remain effective for empirical and targeted therapy based on the epidemiological context. Ongoing surveillance and clinical trials are needed to assess the role of these agents and to integrate them into modern SSTIs management, supporting sustainable treatment models in both high-income and low-income settings.

Summary

Older antibiotics can be effectively used in treating SSTIs, provided their use is guided by current epidemiological data or culture and susceptibility results.

### Novel antibiotic treatment for skin and soft tissue infection [^112on7Wg]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) is a common and significant indication for antibiotic treatment. The microbial aetiology is becoming more resistant to available antibiotics and the treatment of patients is additionally challenged by extremes of age, obesity, diabetes and other co-morbidities. This review examines recent antimicrobial developments.

Recent Findings

In many parts of the world, multidrug-resistant (MDR) staphylococci are the predominant cause of ABSSSI in both the community and in hospital. Increasing resistance in Gram-negative organisms presents problems in the management of surgical-site infections. Most new antibiotics have been developed to treat MDR Gram-positive bacteria and there are few agents to treat infections caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

A number of novel agents are available clinically, with other agents of related chemical structure under development. There are no entirely new classes of antibiotics. Maintaining the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment require effective antibiotic stewardship, good infection prevention and the development of further new antibiotics.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^117L8GRv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Antibiotic treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^111hLpaX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) are a leading cause of morbidity, with a considerable variety of clinical presentation and a wide range of etiological pathogens. Of importance, the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains (i.e. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Gram-negative bacteria) is increasingly reported in some regions. in this review, we summarize the current clinical approach to patients with ABSSSI.

Recent Findings

Accurate diagnosis and identification of risk factors for MDR pathogens are key determinants for administering appropriate therapy in patients with ABSSSI. In daily clinical practice, this can be critical as there are many features defining the 'high risk patient' including both disease and host-associated risk factors.

Summary

Antibiotic therapy should be based according to the different clinical spectrum of disease belonging to the ABSSSI, on the pathogens most likely to be involved and local resistance. Careful evaluation of antibiotic therapy after 48–72h of initial therapy could help clinicians to early identify patients with treatment failure and to consider an alternative approach. Close monitoring of patients with multiple comorbidities, drug-drug interaction or adverse host factors are also necessary.

### Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [^1145FNnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft tissue infections that range in virulence from very mild to limb/life threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations are varying and subject to controversy. Antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

---

### Antibiotic resistance: an editorial review with recommendations [^116GdVG8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Within a relatively short period of time after the first antimicrobial drugs were introduced, bacteria began exhibiting varying degrees of resistance. The excessive use (and abuse) of antibiotics in agriculture, and in both human and veterinary medicine, has played a critical causative role in the development of antibiotic resistance, which is now recognized as a global public health threat. Increasing concern over this issue should impact the practice of cutaneous medicine and surgery, as dermatologists can easily adopt new healthcare delivery patterns that might reduce the development of antibiotic resistance and still achieve acceptable treatment outcomes. Dermatologists should seriously consider any and all alternative therapies before committing to an extended course of antibiotic therapy for disease entities that are almost certainly not infectious. Conversely, dermatologists should carefully and closely adhere to dosage and duration recommendations when using antibiotics to treat a bona fide infectious disorder.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Urvcy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^11537E23]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

IDSA = Infectious Diseases Society of America; EBM = Evidence-Based Medicine; NHG = Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap; ESCMID = European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116BbNeu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A panel of national experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to update the 2005 guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). The panel's recommendations were developed to be concordant with the recently published IDSA guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The focus of this guideline is the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of diverse SSTIs ranging from minor superficial infections to life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, because of an increasing number of immunocompromised hosts worldwide, the guideline addresses the wide array of SSTIs that occur in this population. These guidelines emphasize the importance of clinical skills in promptly diagnosing SSTIs, identifying the pathogen, and administering effective treatments in a timely fashion.

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^111Ga75V]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The burden and cost of acute skin infections in the United States, including ambulatory visits and hospitalizations, are substantial. While S. aureus (including MRSA) and Streptococcus spp. remain common SSTI causes, Gram-negative and mixed infections, though often underappreciated by clinicians when choosing empiric coverage, are present in up to 30% of culture-positive SSTIs. To optimize outcomes, it is important for clinicians to recognize factors that may increase the risk for MRSA as well as for a Gram-negative or a mixed infection. Future research should address the optimal duration of SSTI therapy, including the timing of IV to oral switch, and further characterize risk factors for polymicrobial infections. Such data would augment antibiotic stewardship efforts to provide effective empiric antimicrobial therapy to patients with SSTIs while also avoiding unnecessarily broad-spectrum treatment.

---

### Current guidelines and recommendations for the management of skin and soft tissue infections [^117MabCv]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The incidence of severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) has significantly increased over the last years. In addition, major ecological changes have been reported with the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), involved in a large proportion of these cases. A large number of expert opinions, guidelines, and recommendations for the management of SSTIs have been published over the last decade. The purpose of this review is to compare these guidelines.

Recent Findings

A total of six official publications have presented recommendations for the management of SSTIs. During the same period, other guidelines for the management of MRSA infections have also been published, including some recommendations for SSTIs.

Summary

The applicability of the guidelines is questionable in many ways. The distinction between necrotizing/nonnecrotizing infections is valuable but difficult to apply prior to surgical management. The prescribers should choose a pragmatic approach to empirical antibiotic therapy, taking into account the patient's initial severity, the extent of infection and risk factors for resistant microorganisms essentially related to healthcare-associated circumstances.

### Current challenges in acute bacterial skin infection management [^115pZHJE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are aspects of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) that remain unresolved, such as current numbers, classification criteria, how best to define severity and predict the outcome, what diagnostic tests to perform, what new treatment options are available, or what the duration of antibiotic treatment should be. We have reviewed the literature over the last 18months to clarify these issues and provide our opinion.

Recent Findings

SSTIs are common and among the top 10 most frequent infections worldwide. They represent a burden on the healthcare system and have a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Regarding classification, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) provides a practical guide that distinguishes between uncomplicated and complicated infections, acute and chronic wound infections, and necrotising and nonnecrotizing infections based on skin extension and tissue necrosis. With new microbiological and imaging diagnostic techniques, SSTIs can now be better diagnosed. New PCR techniques are available, and mass spectrometry can be applied to samples collected in liquid transport media. Moreover, new treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy, reactive oxygen, and phages are emerging. SSTI patients can be treated with shorter antibiotic courses if they receive an active drug with good tissue penetration. Antibiotic treatment in necrotizing infections can be shortened to 48h after the last debridement.

Summary

SSTIs remain a challenge regarding rapid and accurate diagnosis and clinical management.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117Sqa6Q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is new in the prevention of SSIs? What are the principles of SSI prevention?

Recent global guidelines for the prevention of SSIs can support healthcare workers to develop or strengthen infection prevention and control programs, with a focus on surgical safety, as well as antimicrobial resistance action plans. We recommend that all healthcare workers adopt these evidence-based recommendations in their clinical practice (recommendation 1C).

SSIs are the most common healthcare-associated infections among surgical patients. It is obviously important to improve patient safety by reducing the occurrence of SSIs. Preventing SSIs is a global priority. Bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, making SSI prevention even more important nowadays.

SSIs are a major clinical problem in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and overall direct and not-direct costs worldwide. Despite progress in prevention knowledge, SSIs remain one of the most common adverse events in hospitals. SSI prevention is complex and requires the integration of a range of measures before, during, and after surgery.

Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently published guidelines for the prevention of SSIs. The 2016 WHO Global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site infection are evidence-based including systematic reviews presenting additional information in support of actions to improve practice.

The guidelines include 13 recommendations for the pre-operative period, and 16 for preventing infections during and after surgery. They range from simple precautions such as ensuring that patients bathe or shower before surgery, appropriate way for surgical teams to clean their hands, guidance on when to use prophylactic antibiotics, which disinfectants to use before incision, and which sutures to use.

The proposed recommendations are as follows:
"Strong" – Expert panel was confident that benefits outweighed risks, considered to be adaptable for implementation in most (if not all) situations, and patients should receive intervention as course of action.
"Conditional" – Expert panel considered that benefits of intervention probably outweighed the risks; a more structured decision-making process should be undertaken, based on stakeholder consultation and involvement of patients and healthcare professionals.

### Antibiotics and resistance in dermatology: focus on treating the elderly [^1161a4zp]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Although elderly patients are at an increased risk for skin infections, the chief culprits are no different than in younger patients. However, many of these organisms have developed resistance to antibiotics. Resistance increases the morbidity, mortality, and cost of treating infections. The mechanisms by which resistance occurs include efflux of antibiotic through a cellular pump, inactivation of the antibiotic by enzymes, or changes in the target affinity for the antibiotic. For dermatologic conditions in the elderly, documented resistance is seen in staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. Clinicians can reduce the development of resistance by following infection control and antibiotic use guidelines. To optimize the antibiotic effect and minimize adverse effects in the elderly, pharmacokinetic changes seen with aging should guide antibiotic choice and dosing.

### Staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [^114JW9ff]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria causing purulent skin and soft tissue infections. Many disease-causing S aureus strains are methicillin resistant; thus, empiric therapy should be given to cover methicillin-resistant S aureus. Bacterial wound cultures are important for characterizing local susceptibility patterns. Definitive antibiotic therapy is warranted, although there are no compelling data demonstrating superiority of any one antibiotic over another. Antibiotic choice is predicated by the infection severity, local susceptibility patterns, and drug-related safety, tolerability, and cost. Response to therapy is expected within the first days; 5 to 7 days of therapy is typically adequate to achieve cure.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^112pM8B3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

ABSSSIs pose a significant burden to the healthcare system. The challenge of treating these infections has been lessened by recent development of new antibiotic treatment options that target gram-positive organisms including MRSA strains. However, new antibiotics that can cover both gram-positive pathogens (including MRSA) and gram-negative pathogens can fulfill an important need in the treatment of selected hospitalized patients with acute skin infections. Examples of such infections include abscesses with mixed bacterial growth, surgical-site infections, particularly those related to abdominal surgery, and selected acute skin infections in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, antibiotics that can offer hospital clinicians other attributes, such as the flexibility to transition from IV to oral formulation, infrequent dosing, pharmacokinetics that are unaffected by various patient characteristics, a low risk of drug–drug interactions, and no requirement for therapeutic monitoring, will be particularly useful when treating ABSSSIs.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1151PCTJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Importantly, the guidelines recommend that antibiotic prophylaxis should be used to prevent infections before and during surgery only. Antibiotics should not be used after surgery, as is often done. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered for operative procedures that have a high rate of postoperative surgical site infection, or when foreign materials are implanted. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered within 120 min prior to the incision. However, administration of the first dose of antibiotics is dependent on its pharmacological characteristics. Underlying patient factors may also affect drug disposition (e.g. malnourishment, obesity, cachexia, and renal disease with protein loss may result in suboptimal antibiotic exposure through increased antibiotic clearance in the presence of normal or augmented renal function). Additional antibiotic doses should be administered intraoperatively for procedures > 2–4 h (typically where duration exceeds two half-lives of the antibiotic). There is no evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The key evidence-based recommendations outlined in these guidelines should be adopted by all healthcare staff that care for surgical patients throughout all stages of that patient's surgical care.

### Chinese herbal medicines for treating skin and soft-tissue infections [^113M6v7j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections of the epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous tissue. SSTIs range in severity from minor, self-limiting, superficial infections to deep, aggressive, gangrenous, life-threatening infections. Some classifications divide SSTIs into 'complicated' and 'uncomplicated' infections based on clinical severity. Treatments of SSTIs involves antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement or drainage, and resuscitation if required. Sometimes these treatments are limited by high treatment costs, bacterial resistance to antibiotics and side effects, therefore, many people with SSTIs are turning to Chinese herbal medicines to treat this problem. Chinese herbal medicines are natural substances that have been used for centuries in China where they are generally considered to be effective for SSTIs. Some Chinese herbal medicines have been shown to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, although a few herbal medicines have been reported to have side effects. Therefore there is a need to review the current clinical evidence systematically to inform current practice and guide future studies on Chinese herbal medicines for SSTIs.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of Chinese herbal medicines for treating skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs).

Search Methods

Searches were not restricted by date, language or publication status. In July 2014 we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; Ovid AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine); and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people with SSTIs that compared Chinese herbal medicines with another intervention or control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the literature search results independently; there were no disagreements.

Main Results

We identified no RCTs that met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no information available from RCTs to support or refute the use of Chinese herbal medicines in treating people with SSTIs.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111aNudS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113QMhjS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for necrotizing infections?

In the absence of definitive clinical trials, antibiotic therapy should be administered until further debridement is no longer necessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has resolved for 48–72 h (recommendation 1C).

Procalcitonin monitoring may be useful to guide antimicrobial discontinuation (recommendation 2B).

There is no direct evidence about optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, and the expert panel shares that antimicrobial therapy should be administered until further debridement is no longer necessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been resolved for 48–72 h.

Several controlled clinical studies have evaluated the potential of the infection biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) to improve the diagnostic work-up of patients with bacterial infections and its influence on decisions regarding antibiotic therapy.

In order to develop a PCT ratio indicating successful surgical intervention in patients with necrotizing infections, Friederichs et al. designed a study of 38 patients treated with clinical signs of sepsis caused by a NSTI. All patients received radical surgical treatment. Serum levels of PCT and C-reactive protein were monitored postoperatively. The ratio of day 1 to day 2 was calculated. An eradication of the infectious focus was successfully performed in 84% of patients, averaging 1.9 operations (range 1–6) to achieve the elimination of the infectious source. The PCT ratio was significantly higher in the group of patients with successful surgical intervention (1.665 versus 0.9, p < 0.001). A ratio higher than the calculated cutoff of 1.14 indicated successful surgical treatment with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 71.4%. The positive predictive value was 75.8%, and the negative predictive value was 80.0%.

The PCT ratio of postoperative day 1 to day 2 following major surgical procedures for necrotizing infections represented a valuable clinical tool indicating successful surgical eradication of the infectious focus and correlated with the successful elimination of the infectious source and clinical recovery.

### MRSA new treatments on the horizon: current status [^114TKvLc]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

There is a choice of anti-MRSA antibiotic available with proven efficacy in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI). Additional anti-MRSA antibiotics are in development, which have the potential to influence how such infections are managed. The emergence of resistance to current anti-MRSA agents, toxicity, and general lack of oral agents with proven efficacy for deep seated infection justify the development of new agents. However, there is a relative dearth of information specific to patients with orthopaedic-related infection. Combination therapy is often used in these patients, although there is a paucity of controlled trial data to support particular antibiotic combinations. As the choice of anti-MRSA agents increases, so does the need to identify which are best for the large variety of infections included in the group of cSSSIs. This is particular true for infections occurring in orthopaedic patients where poorly vascularised tissue, trauma or implanted prosthetic material, pose specific challenges.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116QtZHg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Rapidly progressive soft tissue infections [^11438Qaj]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2005). Medium credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common reasons for people to seek medical advice. They also represent one of the most common indications for antimicrobial therapy and account for approximately 7–10% of hospitalisations in North America. Although non-limb and non-life threatening infections may be treated on an out-patient basis with oral antibiotics, patients with more serious acute skin and soft tissue infections may require admission to hospital for management; this decision is especially true if the infection is rapidly progressive. We provide a concise overview of the differential diagnosis and approach to management of community-acquired rapidly progressive skin and soft tissue infections.

### New therapeutic options for skin and soft tissue infections [^1126gvqk]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The occurrence of methicillin-resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, that represents the most frequent cause of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) worldwide, is a major concern and has been associated with increased length of stay, health care costs, and overall mortality. Although vancomycin is still considered the standard therapy in this setting, limitations of its use in clinical practice are represented by a progressive increase in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) minimum inhibitory concentrations, drug-related toxicity, and the lack of an oral formulation. New therapeutic options for MRSA cSSTIs have recently become available, with promising implications for the management of cSSTIs in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

A number of new antimicrobials with activity against MRSA have been recently approved for the treatment of cSSTIs, and other agents are under investigation. We have reviewed the recent developments, with a specific focus on the possible advantages of new drugs for the management of cSSTIs into the everyday clinical practice.

Summary

The new approved drugs for the treatment of cSSTIs are expected to offer many advantages for the management of patients with suspected or confirmed MRSA cSSTIs. The most promising features of the new compounds include the availability of oral formulations, once-weekly intravenous regimens, and broad spectra of activity.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^112vEQE9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing soft tissue infections. Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are potentially life-threatening infections of any layer of the soft tissue compartment associated with widespread necrosis and systemic toxicity. Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidence-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The multifaceted nature of these infections has led to a collaboration among surgeons, intensive care and infectious diseases specialists, who have shared these guidelines, implementing clinical practice recommendations.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113UkXua]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

### When to switch to an oral treatment and / or to discharge a patient with skin and soft tissue infections [^115uj1iH]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Skin and soft tissue infections prevalence is increasing and represent a frequent cause of hospital admission. New guidelines have become available in order to better define these infections and their response to antimicrobial treatment. Gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, remain the most frequently isolated pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections. To treat complicated forms and infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, hospital admission and administration of intravenous antibiotics are often required, impacting on healthcare costs and patients' morbidity.

Recent Findings

New therapeutic options offer efficacy against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria as well as potential to favor early patients' discharge, including the possibility for intravenous to oral switch and infrequent drug administration because of prolonged drug half-life. Although data from real-world studies on new antimicrobials is awaited, clinicians need clear direction on how to optimize the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in order to avoid prolonged hospitalizations and extra costs. Early assessment of patient's clinical conditions and response to treatment appear useful in order to facilitate patients' discharge.

Summary

We have reported the evidence for early intravenous to oral switch and early hospital discharge for patients with skin and soft tissue infections. New therapeutic options that represent promising tools in promoting an optimized management of these infections have also been reviewed.

### Review of the guidelines for complicated skin and soft tissue infections and intra-abdominal infections – are they applicable today? [^117Hg2MC]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-treat infections in surgical patients, such as serious skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs), are the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, and carry an economic burden. These surgical site infections are typically polymicrobial infections caused by a plethora of pathogens, which include difficult-to-treat organisms and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Optimal management of SSTIs and cIAIs must take into account the presence of resistant pathogens, and depends on the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (i.e. the correct spectrum, route and dose in a timely fashion for a sufficient duration as well as the timely implementation of source control measures). Treatment recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Surgical Infection Society are available for guidance in the management of both of these infections, yet the increased global prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has complicated the antibiotic selection process. Several pathogens of concern include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, responsible for problematic postoperative infections, especially in patients with SSTIs, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, including CTX-M-type-producing Escherichia coli strains, and multidrug-resistant strains of Bacteroides fragilis. New empirical regimens, taking advantage of potent broad-spectrum antibiotic options, may be needed for the treatment of certain high-risk patients with surgical site infections.

### The future of antibiotics [^11555dVW]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

An advantage of the PPP mechanism, which requires both a vigorous private industry and strong and focused support from government, is the ability to ensure that R&D efforts are aligned with unmet need. Traditional drug development programs in industry have focused on the largest markets, such as skin infections and CAP, since they are perceived to bring the largest return on investment and to be the easiest trials to complete. Thus, a plethora of new treatments for bacterial skin infections have become available in the last decade, even though there is little unmet need for such therapies. Even worse, when broad-spectrum antibiotics that can be used to treat lethal Gram-negative infections are developed to treat skin infections or even pneumococcal pneumonia, the drugs are wasted post-marketing on such diseases when numerous other, more narrow-spectrum therapies would suffice. Thus, we need to begin to align drug development with unmet need, to ensure that the drugs we need to save lives are being developed, and also to protect those drugs from overuse post-approval.

Ironically, the rise of highly resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections has created a new opportunity for an economic incentive: pricing. Pricing is the one 'pull' incentive that is likely to be highly effective at stimulating new industry R&D in the antibacterial space. If a new antibiotic is developed to treat lethal infections caused by resistant bacteria with limited to no alternative therapy, a marked pricing premium can be charged. As a result, a large market can result even if the number of cases is relatively small. For example, economic modeling indicates that a pathogen-specific therapy to treat carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections could be priced well in excess of $10,000 per treatment course, and perhaps as much as $30,000 per treatment course, while still easily meeting standard cost-effective metrics. Such a therapy would be attractive to invest in, would focus on major unmet need, and would be protected from overuse or misuse for more sensitive, easier to treat infections because of its high pricing.

What are the resuscitation principles in patients with necrotizing infection?

Supportive treatment in managing necrotizing infections must be early and aggressive to halt progression of the inflammatory process (recommendation 1A).

Early detection of sepsis and prompt aggressive treatment of the underlying organ dysfunction is an essential component for improving outcomes of critical ill patients. Necrotizing infections may present with a fulminant course and may be associated with great morbidity and high case-fatality rates, especially when they occur in conjunction with TSS.

Early blood cultures, empirical antibiotic treatment, and intensive care for hemodynamic and metabolic support should be performed as soon as possible. Moreover, patients may lose fluids, proteins, and electrolytes through a large surgical wound. In addition, hypotension is caused by vasodilation induced by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome to infection. Fluid resuscitation and analgesia are the mainstays of support for patients with advanced sepsis usually combined with vasoactive amines associated with mechanical ventilation and other organ function supports, if needed. No ideal fluid exists: resuscitation therapy must be prompt and immediate as in any type of shock.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1116bQXs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term "skin and soft-tissue infections" describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

### Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI): practice guidelines for management and care transitions in the emergency department and hospital [^11338ebt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), formally referred to as complicated skin and soft tissue infections, include infections with resistance to previously effective antimicrobials. Increasing dramatically in incidence, they have become a challenging medical problem associated with high direct and indirect costs to both the medical system and society.

Objectives

To describe the burden of ABSSSI and to explore multidisciplinary approaches to its management and new treatments that can be initiated in the emergency department.

Discussion

We offer a best practice model aimed at providing risk-stratified and convenient care for ABSSSI at the lowest possible cost, while minimizing complications, readmissions, and inappropriate antibiotic use. In doing so, we focus on the care provided by emergency physicians and hospitalists and the transition of management between them for inpatient care, as well as the facilitation of observation or direct-to-outpatient care for suitable patients.

Conclusions

A standard, consistent, and multidisciplinary approach to ABSSSI can streamline care, reduce admissions, support antimicrobial stewardship, and improve clinical and resource consumption outcomes.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^115NHrBg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

There is clinical consensus that patients may be divided into low- and high-risk groups depending on the cause, nature, and location of the injury and on patient characteristics, but no evidence-based guidelines are currently available.

Deep irrigation of the wound serves to remove foreign bodies and pathogens. Irrigation under pressure is not recommended, as it may lead to the uncontrolled spread of bacteria into deeper tissue layers. Surgical treatment is based on the removal of necrotic tissue and mechanical reduction of the burden of pathogens. Universal prophylaxis with antibiotics is not recommended. The comprehensive meta-analyses of Medeiros et al. in the Cochrane Database demonstrated no evidential basis for a reduction of the infection rate by prophylactic antibiotics, except for bite wounds on the hands. Despite the poor state of the evidence, most experts recommend early antibiotic treatment for 3 to 5 days for fresh, deep wounds and wounds in certain critical bodily areas (hands, feet, areas near joints, face, genitals), for persons at elevated risk of infection, and for persons with implants, such as artificial heart valves. Antibiotics should not be given if the patient presents 24 h or more after the bite and there are no clinical signs of infection.

Significant burn injuries can predispose to infectious complications. Burn wound infections are one of the most important and potentially serious complications that occur in the acute period following injury. Accurate management of the wound with early excision of the eschar can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive burn wound infection. Damage to this barrier following a burn disrupts the innate immune system and increases susceptibility to bacterial infection. Although burn wound surfaces are sterile immediately following thermal injury, these wounds may be colonized with microorganisms. If the patient's host defenses and therapeutic measures (such as excision of necrotic tissue and wound medications) are inadequate, microorganisms can colonize viable tissue, and a burn wound infection may occur.

Burn wound infections usually are polymicrobial. They can be immediately colonized by Gram-positive bacteria from the patient's endogenous skin flora or the external environment. However, they can also be rapidly colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, usually within a week of the burn injury. Bacterial cultures can aid in the selection of an appropriate antibiotic, especially in cases of bacterial drug resistance, but altered pharmacokinetic parameters in burn patients must be considered and dosing should be adjusted accordingly to maximize antibiotic efficacy.

### Acute bacterial skin infections: developments since the 2005 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines [^114maJKF]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) commonly present to Emergency Departments (EDs) where physicians encounter a wide spectrum of disease severity. The prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has increased in the past decade, and CA-MRSA is now a predominant cause of purulent ABSSSI in the United States (US).

Objectives

This article reviews significant developments since the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the management of ABSSSI in the CA-MRSA era, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CA-MRSA, newer antimicrobials with improved MRSA activity, new diagnostic technologies, and options for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT).

Discussion

The increasing prevalence of CA-MRSA has led the IDSA and other organizations to recommend empiric coverage of CA-MRSA for purulent ABSSSI. The availability of rapid MRSA detection assays from skin and soft tissue swabs could potentially facilitate earlier selection of targeted antimicrobial therapy. Several newer intravenous antibiotics with expanded MRSA coverage, including ceftaroline fosamil, daptomycin, linezolid, and telavancin, may be utilized for treatment of ABSSSI. OPAT may be an option for intravenous administration of antibiotics in selected patients and may prevent or shorten hospitalizations, decrease readmission rates, and reduce nosocomial infections and complications.

Conclusion

The growing prevalence of CA-MRSA associated with ABSSSI in the US has a significant impact on clinical management decisions in the ED. Recent availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options may help meet the demand for effective antistaphylococcal agents.

Skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions that involve the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle, ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections. SSTIs may affect any part of the body and are a frequent clinical problem in surgical departments.

Successful management of patients with severe SSTIs involves prompt recognition, appropriate antibiotic therapy, timely surgical debridement or drainage, and resuscitation when required.

Several critical issues have been debated in the management of these patients. In order to clarify these major issues in the management of SSTIs, a panel of experts met in Bertinoro, Italy, on June 28, 2018, for a specialist multidisciplinary consensus conference under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Surgical Infection Society Europe (SIS-E).

During the consensus conference, 17 panelists presented the statements developed for each of the main questions regarding the diagnosis and management of SSTIs. An agreement on all the statements was reached.

The expert panel met via email to prepare and revise the consensus paper resulting from the meeting. The manuscript was successively reviewed by all members and ultimately revised as the present manuscript. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference which outlines clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^112EmR9h]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections result from microbial invasion of the skin and its supporting structures. Management is determined by the severity and location of the infection and by patient comorbidities. Infections can be classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or nonnecrotizing), or as suppurative or nonsuppurative. Most community-acquired infections are caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Simple infections are usually monomicrobial and present with localized clinical findings. In contrast, complicated infections can be mono- or polymicrobial and may present with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation. Laboratory testing may be required to confirm an uncertain diagnosis, evaluate for deep infections or sepsis, determine the need for inpatient care, and evaluate and treat comorbidities. Initial antimicrobial choice is empiric, and in simple infections should cover Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Patients with complicated infections, including suspected necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene, require empiric polymicrobial antibiotic coverage, inpatient treatment, and surgical consultation for debridement. Superficial and small abscesses respond well to drainage and seldom require antibiotics. Immunocompromised patients require early treatment and antimicrobial coverage for possible atypical organisms.

### Optimal antibacterial treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: applying a novel treatment algorithm [^113EN1oM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Incision and drainage combined with antibiotic therapies form the backbone of managing uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). An algorithm has been developed to guide the treatment of uSSSIs in the primary care setting in situations where initial empiric therapy is appropriate. This includes instances when a culture is taken, but it is deemed appropriate to begin an antibiotic empirically pending the results of the culture. The panel that developed the algorithm was chaired by Dr. Richard Scher of Columbia University and included thought leaders in the fields of clinical dermatology, dermatologic surgery, infectious disease, pediatric infectious disease, podiatry, and HIV infection. The panel acknowledged that the initial choice of antibiotic is generally determined by tolerability, ease of administration, cost, and efficacy. The usual choices for initial empiric therapy include cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Currently marketed cephalosporins, penicillinase-resistant penicillins, and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations lack activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) was a major consideration when designing the treatment algorithm. Many CA-MRSA skin infections present as abscess, and drainage is the most important component of therapy in this setting. When the history and physical exam suggest CA-MRSA infection, and there is no fluctuant collection of purulent material to be drained, a sulfa drug or tetracycline is generally the best choice for initial empiric therapy.

Bacterial Infection Clinical Outcome Assessments

A strong example of an impactful project that has resulted in direct benefit to patients and improved standards of care is evident from the results of the BC projects in community‐acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), acute skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI), hospital‐acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), and ventilator‐associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP).

Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, many bacterial infections are very difficult to treat, and new antibiotics are urgently needed to save patient lives. The traditional measures of treatment success in clinical trials of antibiotics for skin infections and pneumonia have not kept pace with the evolving standards of regulatory science, which has led to substantial uncertainty and delays for companies developing these important drugs. Historically, efficacy end points for antibiotic registrational trials were based on resolution or improvement of signs and symptoms of infection at a time point after completion of therapy. 9 By design, these end points included assessments at earlier time points as an element of outcome. As novel drug development understanding moved forward, the FDA and the scientific community realized the design of noninferiority trials evaluating antibiotics could be improved by defining more reliable outcome measures that reduced dependence on subjective elements and by evaluating outcomes at time points for which prior evidence had demonstrated well‐defined, reliable, and reproducible drug effects. 10 The ability to measure known treatment effects on these outcome measures is essential for noninferiority (NI) trial designs. NI clinical trials are designed to determine whether the effectiveness of a new treatment is not unacceptably worse than the current or control treatment regimen. 11 In addition, the "patient voice" has become a critical component of drug development, and the FDA stipulates that outcome measures for studies that support drug registration should be direct measures or established surrogates of how patients feel, function, or survive.

### Part I antimicrobial resistance: bacterial pathogens of dermatologic significance and implications of rising resistance [^114SKBwF]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has been the defining global health crisis of our time, public health officials have been sounding the alarm of another ominous threat for years: an impending antimicrobial resistance crisis. In dermatology, antibiotics are often used for prolonged courses in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections and common inflammatory skin conditions, increasing the risk of microbiome alteration and antibiotic-related adverse effects, all while exerting consequential selective pressures on both pathogenic and bystander bacteria. In this review, we hope to raise awareness of the crisis of antimicrobial resistance and review resistance concerns related to dermatology-relevant bacterial pathogens.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115R1LHt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Surgical site infections — management recommendations: Suture removal plus incision and drainage should be performed for surgical site infections (strong, low). Adjunctive systemic antimicrobial therapy is not routinely indicated, but in conjunction with incision and drainage may be beneficial for surgical site infections with a significant systemic response such as erythema and induration extending > 5 cm from the wound edge, temperature > 38.5° C, heart rate > 110 beats/minute, or white blood cell (WBC) count > 12 000/μL (weak, low). A brief course of systemic antimicrobial therapy is indicated in patients with surgical site infections following clean operations on the trunk, head and neck, or extremities that also have systemic signs of infection (strong, low). For infections following operations on the axilla, gastrointestinal tract, perineum, or female genital tract, agents active against gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes, such as a cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone in combination with metronidazole, are recommended (strong, low).

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with skin and soft tissue infection: the INSPIRE 3 skin and soft tissue randomized clinical trial [^1157vWmV]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics are routinely prescribed for patients hospitalized with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) despite low likelihoods of infection with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).

Objective

To evaluate whether computerized provider order entry (CPOE) prompts presenting patient-specific and pathogen-specific MDRO infection risk estimates could reduce empiric extended-spectrum antibiotics for noncritically ill patients admitted with SSTI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cluster randomized clinical trial included 92 hospitals and assessed the effect of an antibiotic stewardship bundle that included CPOE prompts vs routine stewardship on antibiotic selection during the first 3 hospital days (empiric period) in noncritically ill adults hospitalized with SSTI. The trial population included adults 18 years and older treated with empiric antibiotics for SSTI in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Data were collected from January 2019 to December 2023.

Interventions

CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics in patients prescribed extended-spectrum antibiotics during the empiric period when absolute risk of MDRO SSTI was estimated to be less than 10%, coupled with feedback and education.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy (summed number of different extended-spectrum antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative bacteria received per patient each calendar day). The secondary outcome was antipseudomonal days of therapy. Safety outcomes included days to ICU transfer and hospital length of stay. Outcomes compared differences between baseline and intervention periods across strategies.

Results

Among 118 562 patients admitted with SSTI at 92 hospitals, 67 033 (56.7%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 58.0 (17.5) years. A total of 57 837 patients were included in the baseline period and 60 725 in the intervention period. Receipt of any empiric extended-spectrum antibiotic during the baseline and intervention periods was 57.0% (16 855 of 29 595) and 56.0% (17 534 of 31 337), respectively, for the routine stewardship group compared with 55.4% (15 650 of 28 242) and 43.0% (12 647 of 29 388), respectively, for the CPOE group. Empiric extended-spectrum days of therapy per 1000 empiric days targeting Pseudomonas and/or MDR gram-negative pathogens was 511.5 during the baseline period and 488.7 during the intervention period in the routine stewardship group and was 496.2 and 359.1, respectively, in the CPOE bundle group (rate ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.67–0.79; P < .001). There was no evidence of inferiority in the CPOE bundle group for mean (SD) hospital length of stay (routine stewardship, 6.5 [3.8] days; CPOE bundle, 6.4 [3.8] days) and days to ICU transfer (routine stewardship, 6.3 [3.2] days; CPOE bundle, 6.3 [3.1] days).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, CPOE prompts recommending standard-spectrum empiric antibiotics for low-risk patients hospitalized with SSTI coupled with education and feedback significantly reduced use of extended-spectrum antibiotics without increasing admissions to ICUs or hospital length of stay.

### Omadacycline for acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections [^112aFry4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections are associated with substantial morbidity and health care costs. Omadacycline, an aminomethylcycline antibiotic that can be administered once daily either orally or intravenously, is active against pathogens that commonly cause such infections, including antibiotic-resistant strains.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive omadacycline (100 mg given intravenously every 12 hours for two doses, then 100 mg given intravenously every 24 hours) or linezolid (600 mg given intravenously every 12 hours). A transition to oral omadacycline (300 mg every 24 hours) or oral linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after 3 days; the total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. The primary end point was an early clinical response at 48 to 72 hours, defined as survival with a reduction in lesion size of at least 20% without rescue antibacterial therapy. A secondary end point was an investigator-assessed clinical response at the post-treatment evaluation 7 to 14 days after the last dose, with clinical response defined as survival with resolution or improvement in signs or symptoms of infection to the extent that further antibacterial therapy was unnecessary. For both end points, the noninferiority margin was 10 percentage points.

Results

In the modified intention-to-treat population, omadacycline (316 patients) was noninferior to linezolid (311 patients) with respect to early clinical response (rate of response, 84.8% and 85.5%, respectively; difference, -0.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.3 to 4.9). Omadacycline also was noninferior to linezolid with respect to investigator-assessed clinical response at the post-treatment evaluation in the modified intention-to-treat population (rate of response, 86.1% and 83.6%, respectively; difference, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.2 to 8.2) and in the clinical per-protocol population (96.3% and 93.5%, respectively; difference, 2.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.0 to 6.9). In both groups, the efficacy of the trial drug was similar for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Adverse events were reported in 48.3% of the patients in the omadacycline group and in 45.7% of those in the linezolid group; the most frequent adverse events in both groups were gastrointestinal (in 18.0% and 15.8% of the patients in the respective groups).

Conclusions

Omadacycline was noninferior to linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections and had a similar safety profile. (Funded by Paratek Pharmaceuticals; OASIS-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02378480 .).

Initial Antibiotic Treatment and Outcomes in Patients With SSTIs

Because initial management of serious infections relies on the clinician's judgment regarding the likelihood of different potential causative pathogens, in the setting of shifting resistance patterns, choosing effective coverage becomes challenging. Some early indirect evidence that supports the associations between initial treatment failure and higher mortality, longer hospital stays, and higher hospital charges was reported from large administrative data analyses. More recently, clinically focused studies confirmed that poor outcomes are frequently associated with the use of initial antibiotic regimens that fail to cover the pathogen that eventually grows in culture. Thus, it is imperative that clinicians understand their local antibiograms, identify patient risk factors for resistance, and provide prompt empiric treatment that includes appropriate coverage for suspected pathogens.

Patients with HCA-SSTI are at risk for acquiring different pathogens than those with CA-SSTI. Compared to patients with CA-SSTI, patients admitted with HCA infection are at increased risk for infections due to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and this high risk of resistance makes them more likely to receive inappropriate empiric therapy and have poor outcomes (Table 2). In a single-center, retrospective analysis that included 527 patients with HCA SSTI, nearly 25% received inappropriate empiric treatment, with an almost 2-day prolongation of LOS. Furthermore, those patients with a mixed infection (approximately 10% of the total population) were at higher risk for receiving inappropriate empiric coverage than those without mixed pathogens (Figure 4). A more recent multicenter, prospective, observational study supports these findings with regards to patients with polymicrobial infections being more likely to receive inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (OR, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.62–7.78). Monomicrobial Gram-negative infections were associated with increased risk for inappropriate empiric treatment compared to monomicrobial Gram-positive infections (OR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.79–6.60). Zervos and colleagues found a similar association between increased risk of inappropriate empiric therapy in patients with MRSA, Gram-negative infections, or mixed pathogens compared to patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus or streptococci (P < .05). Thus, in some scenarios, in order to administer appropriate empiric treatment, clinicians need to consider the probability of pathogens other than susceptible Gram-positive organisms as the cause of SSTI.

During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present".

The decision to use intravenous or oral agents has been debated. Currently, oral therapy is recommended for mild infections and intravenous therapy for severe infections. Moderate infections may be treated via the oral route, or with one to two intravenous doses and then transitioning to oral therapy. For patients with severe infections who are able to tolerate oral therapy and in whom clinical improvement has been documented, the goal should be to transition to the oral route as soon as possible. There is evidence to suggest that this approach positively impacts length of stay as well.

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Three hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized, comparative study for complicated skin and skin structure infections. The patients were randomized to receive either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily (IV followed by oral), or an approved comparator for a median of 10 ± 4.7 days. As is expected in complicated skin and skin structure infections, surgical procedures were performed in the levofloxacin and comparator groups. Surgery (incision and drainage or debridement) was performed on 45% of the levofloxacin-treated patients and 44% of the comparator-treated patients, either shortly before or during antibiotic treatment and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication.

Among those who could be evaluated clinically 2 to 5 days after completion of study drug, overall success rates (improved or cured) were 116/138 (84.1%) for patients treated with levofloxacin and 106/132 (80.3%) for patients treated with the comparator.

Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 68% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with infected wounds and abscesses. These rates were equivalent to those seen with comparator drugs.

What are necrotizing infections?

Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) are life-threatening, invasive, soft-tissue infections with a necrotizing component involving any or all layers of the soft-tissue compartment, from the superficial dermis and subcutaneous tissue to the deeper fascia and muscle. The latter is most commonly called "necrotizing fasciitis".

The necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection should be always specified when classifying patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

Delay in diagnosis and delay in treatment of these infections increase the risk of mortality. Because of its aggressive character, NSTIs should always be differentiated from non-necrotizing infection. Several definitions were published over the last few years, and all these definitions can be confusing. NSTIs are defined by the presence of a spreading infection in any of the layers of the soft tissues (skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, deep fascia, or muscles) which is associated with the presence of necrosis of the layer(s) involved and hence requires surgical debridement. All NSTIs fulfill this definition and have common features in their clinical presentation and diagnosis, and most importantly, all of these infections by definition require surgical debridement. Therefore, labeling them with different terms does not serve a useful purpose and may in fact complicate management by delaying diagnosis and/or delaying surgical debridement.

PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT GUIDELINES

In addition to the lack of specific guidance for the choice of antibiotics for treatment of DLIs, definitions and classification of LVAD infections vary across countries and studies, and the existing guidelines and recommendations are not construed equally among physicians. Differences in understanding and interpretation of the definitions and respective guidelines, especially outside the United States, may lead to misunderstanding or misclassification of the infections and impede evidence-based recommendations or comparisons. For example, in the Anglo-Saxon literature, the term 'cellulitis' is used as a generic term for erysipelas or for limited (or sometimes severe) soft tissue infections, while in the German terminology, the term 'limited phlegmon' (limited soft tissue infection/limited cellulitis) is used. National guidelines, such as the German guideline for parenteral therapy of soft tissue infections (under the auspices of the Paul-Ehrlich-Gesellschaft für Infektionstherapie e.V.) have only recently tried to clarify the definitions, but misunderstandings may still occur.

An additional source of confusion arises from the term 'acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection' (ABSSSI, see details below), which uses the extent of erythema as a quantifiable criterion for evaluation of therapeutic response. Guidelines or recommendations for treatment of wound or soft tissue infections under the definition of ABSSSIs have been published, but since DLIs are not explicitly included in the definition of ABSSSIs, it can be unclear to the treating physician or the regulatory authorities whether these treatment guidelines also apply to DLIs. Consequently, the use of certain antibiotics that are approved for ABSSSIs may be considered 'off-label' when used for treating DLIs, leading to rejection of reimbursement applications in some countries, thereby, affecting treatment strategies and patients' outcomes.

Historically, most antimicrobials with broad activity against Gram-positive pathogens have been approved for specific indications (only). From the perspective of the infectious disease specialist, this limits the available therapeutic options. The choice of substances active against Gram-positive bacteria should mainly be driven by the rules of microbiological susceptibility testing, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, as is common practice for so-called reserve antimicrobials that are active against Gram-negative pathogens (e.g. cefiderocol, ceftazidime/avibactam, cetolozane/tazobactam, imipenem/relebactam).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^111jEtWA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

An incisional SSI should be sampled if there is a clinical suspicion of infection. Lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic microbiology of SSIs present a challenge to monitor the global epidemiology of surgical site infection. Emergence of antibiotic resistance has made the management of SSIs difficult. Moreover, rapidly emerging nosocomial pathogens and the problem of multidrug resistance necessitates periodic review of isolation patterns and their sensitivity.

Adequate treatment of incisional SSIs should always include:
Surgical incision and drainage of abscess.
Debridement of necrotic tissue, if present.
Appropriate wound care.
Resuscitation to improve perfusion when sepsis is present.
Adequate empiric antibiotic therapy when indicated.
De-escalation when antibiogram is available.

Incisional SSIs should always be drained, irrigated, and if needed, opened and debrided. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should always be performed. Percutaneous drainage, wound irrigation, and negative pressure-assisted wound management are new and effective options that reduce the need for open management of wound infections. In cases where open management is needed, once the infection has cleared, the wound can be closed.

Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics.

In patients with incisional SSIs with the presence of any systemic inflammatory response criteria or signs of organ failure such as hypotension, oliguria, decreased mental alertness, or in immunocompromised patients, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment should be started with coverage for Gram-positive cocci and/or the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antibiotic treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of gram stain, wound culture, and antibiogram.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Treatment of bacterial skin infections in ED observation units: factors influencing prescribing practice [^114jJpxo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) publishes evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. How closely physicians follow these guidelines is unknown, particularly in the emergency department observation unit (EDOU) where increasing numbers of patients are treatment for these infections. Our objectives were to describe (1) the antibiotic treatment patterns EDOU patients, (2) physicians' adherence to the IDSA guidelines, and (3) factors that influence physician's prescribing practices.

Methods

This prospective cohort enrolled adult patients discharged from an EDOU at an academic medical center after treatment for a skin or soft tissue infection. Information was collected from chart review and patient interview pertaining to the patient's sociodemographic characteristics, presenting illness, and antibiotic treatment regimens. Treatment regimens were compared with national guidelines.

Results

The study included 193 patients of which only 43% were treated according to IDSA guidelines, 42% were overtreated, and 15% were undertreated. Women were more likely to be undertreated (relative risk, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.06), whereas patients 50 years and older were at risk for overtreatment (relative risk, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.02). Women also received shorter courses of antibiotic therapy with an average of 9.6 days of treatment compared with 10.6 days for men.

Conclusions

Physician antibiotic prescribing practices demonstrated poor adherence to IDSA guidelines and were influenced by the patient's age and sex. Standardized antibiotic protocols for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections to IDSA guidelines in the EDOU would minimize physician bias.

Skin cancer reconstruction — office-based systemic antibiotics: Based on the preponderance of evidence, in the office setting, it is recommended that clinicians not administer routine perioperative systemic antibiotics. Benefits of avoiding antibiotic prophylaxis include cost savings, absence of antibiotic side effects, prevention of drug-drug interactions, reduced time delay prior to reconstruction, avoidance of complications associated with oral or intravenous administration, and absence of contribution to antibiotic resistance, but potential risks and harms include medicolegal vulnerability if an infection occurs. Exclusions to this recommendation are appropriate for reconstructions in special high-risk populations, such as those requiring large or complex reconstructions, those with clean-contaminated or chronic wounds, and those with medical histories or comorbidities associated with immunosuppression or elevated risk of infection.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antibiotics for smaller skin abscesses [^113gWrmr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin abscesses are common, yet the appropriate management of the condition in the era of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, double-blind trial involving outpatient adults and children. Patients were stratified according to the presence of a surgically drainable abscess, abscess size, the number of sites of skin infection, and the presence of nonpurulent cellulitis. Participants with a skin abscess 5 cm or smaller in diameter were enrolled. After abscess incision and drainage, participants were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

Results

We enrolled 786 participants: 505 (64.2%) were adults and 281 (35.8%) were children. A total of 448 (57.0%) of the participants were male. S. aureus was isolated from 527 participants (67.0%), and MRSA was isolated from 388 (49.4%). Ten days after therapy in the intention-to-treat population, the cure rate among participants in the clindamycin group was similar to that in the TMP-SMX group (221 of 266 participants [83.1%] and 215 of 263 participants [81.7%], respectively; P = 0.73), and the cure rate in each active-treatment group was higher than that in the placebo group (177 of 257 participants [68.9%], P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The results in the population of patients who could be evaluated were similar. This beneficial effect was restricted to participants with S. aureus infection. Among the participants who were initially cured, new infections at 1 month of follow-up were less common in the clindamycin group (15 of 221, 6.8%) than in the TMP-SMX group (29 of 215 [13.5%], P = 0.03) or the placebo group (22 of 177 [12.4%], P = 0.06). Adverse events were more frequent with clindamycin (58 of 265 [21.9%]) than with TMP-SMX (29 of 261 [11.1%]) or placebo (32 of 255 [12.5%]); all adverse events resolved without sequelae. One participant who received TMP-SMX had a hypersensitivity reaction.

Conclusions

As compared with incision and drainage alone, clindamycin or TMP-SMX in conjunction with incision and drainage improves short-term outcomes in patients who have a simple abscess. This benefit must be weighed against the known side-effect profile of these antimicrobials. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028 .).

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Which antibiotics are best for skin and soft tissue infections?… [^1177STE7]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Bacterial skin and soft tissue infections have traditionally responded well to treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics or macro-lides. However, there has been concern whether they are still effective given the emerging resistance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. Results: Twenty studies involving 4, 817 patients were reviewed. The beta-lactam agents included in the studies were extended-spectrum agents; first-generation ceph-alosporins; and third-generation cephalosporins. Overall, fluoroquinolones were more effective than beta-lactam antibiotics for empirically treating SSTIs, but the difference was small.

Fluoroquinolones also were more effective in treating mild to moderate SSTIs. However, both of these advantages disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded from the analysis. There also was no difference between the antibiotic classes in the treatment of moderate to severe infections. Fluoroquinolones were no more effective than beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of abscesses and wound infections, nor were they more effective in treating patients hospitalized for SSTIs. Microbiologically, eradication rates of S. aureus and streptococci infections were the same for the two groups of medications. However, fluoroquinolones were more effective where gram-negative or anaerobic infections were identified. Conclusion: The authors concluded that although fluo-roquinolones were slightly more effective in treating SSTIs compared with beta-lactam antibiotics, this difference disappeared when third-generation cephalosporins were excluded.

When the greater adverse effect profile of fluoroquinolones was also considered, there was no substantial advantage to using them over beta-lactam agents for the empiric treatment of SSTIs. Although third-generation cephalosporins often are used to treat SSTIs, they appear to be less effective than extended-spectrum penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision… [^117K9Mud]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- TMP-SMX or clindamycin can be combined with incision and drainage of skin abscesses to decrease the risk of treatment failure and recurrence.
- TMP-SMX is weakly recommended over clindamycin because of its lower risk of diarrhea.
- Cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. Recommendations Based on high-quality evidence, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin combined with incision and drainage has been shown to decrease the risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month and the risk of recurrence by approximately 8% at three months compared with no antibiotic treatment. TMPSMX and clindamycin also are associated with decreases in pain, hospitalizations, and infections in household contacts based on moderate-quality evidence. There is no crucial difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin, and both have similar risk of recurrence.

TMP-SMX is typically taken twice per day, and clindamycin is taken three or four times per day; both are often combined with over-the-counter pain medication. TMP-SMX is usually inexpensive, whereas clindamycin can be expensive in some areas. However, both are available by prescription or over the counter in many countries. Using the GRADE framework, the panel gave a weak recommendation in favor of TMP-SMX over clindamycin. Either agent is recommended over incision and drainage alone. This decision should be made in conjunction with the patient to ensure that the option chosen is in line with what the patient determines is most important with regard to desirable outcomes and undesirable consequences. Patients who prefer to avoid recurrence may opt to take clindamycin, whereas those who prefer avoiding diarrhea may select TMP-SMX.

Although cephalosporins or other antibiotics are often prescribed for skin abscesses, in most circumstances, including settings with high rates of methicillin-resistant. S. aureus, cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. For this reason, believing that most patients would want to take an antibiotic that has been demonstrated to be effective, including TMPSMX or clindamycin, the panel strongly recommends against the use of cephalosporins.

### Treatment of impetigo… [^116VX7UL]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What are the best treatments for impetigo. Evidence-Based Answer Topical mupirocin and fusidic acid are more effective than placebo and at least as effective as oral antibiotics for the treatment of limited impetigo, and are better tolerated. Based on the available evidence on effectiveness, no clear preference can be given for any one oral antibiotic over another. Limited evidence does not support the use of topical antiseptics in the treatment of impetigo. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of topical versus oral antibiotics in widespread impetigo. Two recent systematic reviews have cast doubt on the traditional role of oral antibiotics as first-line therapy for impetigo. The first, a meta-analysis of 57 trials including 3, 533 patients, studied varying comparisons of 20 oral and 18 topical treatments for impetigo.
4.

Topical antibiotics had better cure rates than placebo, and there was no significant difference between the two most studied topical antibiotics, mupirocin and fusidic acid. Ten of these trials compared mupirocin with oral erythromycin and showed significantly better cure rates with mupirocin. Six of the studies comparing topical to other oral antibiotics found no differences among cure rates. Twenty-five of the studies, most commonly comparing two oral antibiotics, also showed little difference in cure rates between antibiotics. Cephalosporins and macrolide antibiotics, usually erythromycin and azithromycin, were most often studied. Oral antibiotic therapy caused more side effects than topical therapy. Topical antiseptic agents, which have traditionally been used either alone or in conjunction with other therapies, have not been adequately studied or have not been compared with placebo treatment. Two older studies were found comparing topical antibiotics with antiseptic treatment; pooled data favored topical antibiotic therapy.
