Treatment of mrsa bateremia

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment of MRSA bacteremia, preserving the step-by-step thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and source control. Then, I should verify empiric antimicrobial choices and the timing of therapy. Next, I will review definitive therapy selection based on susceptibilities and MICs, followed by monitoring and response assessment. After that, I need to consider management of persistent bacteremia and combination strategies. I will then determine treatment duration by clinical category, address special populations, and finally outline follow-up, prevention, and a concise algorithm summary, ensuring each step is supported by current guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the first 6–12 hours: hemodynamic stabilization and source control are foundational because delays in effective therapy and incomplete source control drive mortality and complications in S. aureus bacteremia, including MRSA, which carries a 15–30% case fatality and frequent metastatic seeding, so I need to ensure early appropriate antibiotics and removal of infected devices or drainage of abscesses without delay [^115srBTr] [^1162ySZU].

> Wait, let me verify the empiric antimicrobial strategy before susceptibilities return. Vancomycin or daptomycin are appropriate first-line empiric agents for suspected MRSA bacteremia, with vancomycin favored when MIC is ≤ 2 μg/mL and daptomycin reasonable when vancomycin MIC is high or nephrotoxicity risk is elevated; I initially thought vancomycin troughs of 15–20 mg/L were the modern target, but hold on, I should correct that — current guidance favors AUC-guided monitoring rather than trough-only targets for serious MRSA infections, so I should plan AUC-based dosing from the outset to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^114D2QMm] [^115G4Uaf] [^1129Rg8D].

> I need to check the timing imperative. Every 24–48 hour delay to effective anti-MRSA therapy increases mortality, so empiric coverage should start as soon as S. aureus is suspected in high-risk contexts, with de-escalation once methicillin susceptibility is confirmed; rapid organism identification systems can shorten time-to-appropriate therapy and reduce unnecessary glycopeptide exposure, which I should leverage when available [^1162ySZU] [^112zMXTr].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy once MICs return. If the isolate is MRSA with vancomycin MIC ≤ 2 μg/mL, vancomycin remains standard with AUC-guided monitoring targeting an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 when MIC is 1 mg/L, recognizing method-dependent MIC variability and the need to individualize; if MIC is > 2 μg/mL or if there is clinical failure on vancomycin, I should switch to daptomycin, typically 6–10 mg/kg daily, noting that higher doses are often used in complicated disease and that prior vancomycin exposure may select for daptomycin nonsusceptibility, so I must monitor closely [^115G4Uaf] [^1129Rg8D] [^115JPW7w] [^115Da6tt].

> Hold on, I should verify vancomycin PK/PD nuances. Observational data link AUC/MIC ≥ 398–400 to improved outcomes, but MIC methodology matters; Etest MICs tend to be 1.5–2-fold higher than broth microdilution, complicating cross-lab targets, and some contemporary data suggest that very high AUCs may not confer additional benefit and could increase nephrotoxicity, reinforcing the principle of precision AUC monitoring rather than chasing supratherapeutic exposures [^112Zgmvk] [^1129Rg8D].

> I will now examine response monitoring. Repeat blood cultures at 48–72 hours are essential to document clearance; persistent bacteremia beyond this window is a red flag for complications and warrants intensified imaging and source reassessment, with echocardiography mandatory for adults with S. aureus bacteremia to evaluate for endocarditis, using TTE for all and TEE when risk is higher or TTE is nondiagnostic; I should double-check that this approach aligns with IDSA endocarditis guidance, which it does [^112aB5oL] [^114dLHwr] [^115srBTr].

> But wait, what if bacteremia persists beyond 3–5 days despite appropriate therapy. I should define persistent MRSA bacteremia pragmatically as > 1 calendar day of ongoing bacteremia after initiation of appropriate therapy and escalate evaluation: repeat cultures, TEE if not done, and whole-body imaging (CT/MRI) to find occult foci; management then shifts to salvage strategies such as daptomycin 8–10 mg/kg, ceftaroline monotherapy at higher off-label doses (up to 600 mg every 8 hours), or combination therapy, while aggressively pursuing source control [^114hvj2j] [^113oF8VG] [^113pZkPC].

> Let me consider combination therapy carefully. The CAMERA2 RCT showed that adding an antistaphylococcal β-lactam to vancomycin or daptomycin reduced day-5 persistent bacteremia but increased AKI without improving the composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or failure at 90 days; thus, routine combination therapy is not recommended, though it may be considered selectively in high-burden infections or salvage settings with close monitoring for toxicity and stewardship oversight [^111RGgSg] [^113uYSHx] [^113pZkPC].

> I should confirm the role of rifampin. The ARREST randomized trial found no overall benefit of adjunctive rifampin for S. aureus bacteremia and highlighted drug interactions and adverse effects; therefore, rifampin should not be used routinely, though IDSA suggests it may be considered for prosthetic joint infections or selected device-related infections after clearance of bacteremia, underscoring the need for case-by-case judgment and caution [^1176MarX] [^113r4DPE] [^111Ns9vf].

> Next, I should review duration of therapy by clinical category. Uncomplicated MRSA bacteremia — negative follow-up cultures within 2–4 days, defervescence within 72 hours, no prosthetic material, no endocarditis or metastatic infection — can be treated for a minimum of 14 days of IV therapy; complicated bacteremia or endocarditis generally requires 4–6 weeks, with endocarditis often 6 weeks and device infections individualized to device management and surgical input, and I need to ensure durations are extended when source control is delayed or incomplete [^114sjMPF] [^114D2QMm] [^115srBTr].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric-specific considerations. In children, vancomycin remains first-line for MRSA bacteremia with weight-based dosing and interval adjustments; pediatric data suggest that very high vancomycin exposures may increase AKI without clear outcome benefit, so AUC-guided dosing with attention to early response is prudent, and echocardiography is reserved for those with persistent bacteremia, congenital heart disease, or clinical suspicion of endocarditis rather than universal screening [^114kCttQ] [^112wmScK] [^116tzX7C].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and scenarios. In patients with high vancomycin MICs (1.5–2 μg/mL), early daptomycin may yield faster clearance and less nephrotoxicity than vancomycin; in renal impairment, daptomycin or linezolid are reasonable alternatives to avoid vancomycin accumulation; in pregnancy, vancomycin is preferred over daptomycin due to limited safety data; and in critical illness, I should consider early ID consultation and aggressive source control given the narrow therapeutic window and high complication rates [^116vCxYP] [^115JPW7w] [^115srBTr].

> Next, I should review follow-up and prevention. After completing therapy, I should arrange clinical follow-up at 1–2 weeks and again at 3 months to detect late complications or recurrence, and document MRSA bacteremia clearly in the discharge summary; decolonization strategies and addressing modifiable risks such as injection drug use, diabetes, and device care can reduce recurrence risk, aligning with public health and stewardship principles [^115moQ7J] [^1113FHUC].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Start with early anti-MRSA therapy and source control; tailor to MICs with vancomycin AUC-guided dosing or switch to daptomycin if MIC is high or failure occurs; monitor with repeat cultures and echocardiography; escalate at 3–5 days if bacteremia persists with salvage agents and intensified source evaluation; set duration by clinical category with 14 days for uncomplicated and 4–6 weeks for complicated disease; and embed ID consultation and stewardship throughout to minimize toxicity and resistance selection [^115srBTr] [^115G4Uaf] [^114hvj2j].

> Finally, I should double-check key evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Many recommendations remain supported by observational data and expert opinion rather than large RCTs, and practice varies internationally, reinforcing the need for individualized care, careful monitoring, and ongoing re-evaluation of the source and clinical response to guide therapy duration and intensity [^114VkSSW] [^112jHeYS] [^111XBsCZ].

MRSA bacteremia requires **prompt source control** (remove infected devices, drain abscesses) [^115srBTr] and **early effective antibiotics** (vancomycin or daptomycin) [^114D2QMm] [^111RGgSg]. Vancomycin is first-line; use **AUC-guided dosing** (target AUC/MIC ≥ 400) [^115G4Uaf] and monitor for nephrotoxicity [^1129Rg8D]. Daptomycin is an alternative, especially with high vancomycin MICs or intolerance; use 8–10 mg/kg IV daily [^115JPW7w] [^1139yWMx]. For persistent bacteremia (> 5–7 days), consider combination therapy (e.g. daptomycin plus ceftaroline or fosfomycin) [^113pZkPC] [^114RxjGF] or linezolid [^116LHh7u]. Treat uncomplicated cases for 14 days and complicated cases (endocarditis, osteomyelitis, undrained foci) for 4–6 weeks [^114sjMPF]. Repeat blood cultures every 2–4 days until clearance, and obtain echocardiography for all patients to assess for endocarditis [^112aB5oL] [^114dLHwr].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

- **Blood cultures**: Obtain at least two sets from different venipuncture sites before antibiotics when possible [^notfound].

- **Echocardiography**: Perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for all patients; use transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) if TTE is inconclusive or if endocarditis is suspected [^115srBTr].

- **Source identification**: Evaluate for and remove infected devices (catheters, prosthetic material), drain abscesses, and debride necrotic tissue [^115srBTr].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should start immediately when MRSA is suspected; **vancomycin** is first-line at 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours (max 2 g/dose), with AUC-guided monitoring (target AUC/MIC ≥ 400) [^11578u6K] [^1129Rg8D]. Daptomycin is an alternative at 8–10 mg/kg IV daily, especially with high vancomycin MICs or intolerance [^115JPW7w].

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive therapy should be guided by **susceptibility results** and clinical response:

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Dose** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin | First-line | 15–20 mg/kg IV every 8–12 hours | AUC-guided monitoring; renal function |
| Daptomycin | Alternative or intolerance | 8–10 mg/kg IV daily | CPK monitoring |
| Linezolid | Persistent bacteremia or intolerance | 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours | CBC monitoring |
| Ceftaroline | Persistent bacteremia or salvage | 600 mg IV every 8 hours | CBC monitoring |
| Fosfomycin | Combination therapy | 2 g IV every 6 hours | Electrolytes, renal function |

---

## Duration of therapy

Uncomplicated bacteremia is treated for **14 days** after the first negative blood culture, whereas **complicated bacteremia** (endocarditis, osteomyelitis, undrained foci) requires 4–6 weeks, individualized to clinical response and source control [^114sjMPF] [^11565wtp].

---

## Management of persistent or refractory bacteremia

Persistent bacteremia is commonly defined as **≥ 5–7 days** of positive cultures despite appropriate therapy [^notfound]. For management, consider **combination therapy** — such as daptomycin plus ceftaroline or fosfomycin — or linezolid [^113pZkPC] [^114RxjGF]. Also reassess for undrained foci, retained devices, or metastatic infection, and pursue surgical intervention when indicated [^115srBTr].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Repeat blood cultures every 2–4 days until clearance, and monitor renal and hepatic function, CPK (with daptomycin), and CBC (with linezolid or ceftaroline). Track clinical response — fever curve, hemodynamics, and signs of metastatic infection — and adjust therapy based on culture results, MICs, and clinical course [^112aB5oL].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and special considerations

Adjunctive **rifampin** is **not routinely recommended** and should be considered only in selected cases (e.g. prosthetic infections) after clearance of bacteremia [^113r4DPE]. Immunomodulatory agents remain investigational and are not standard care. Infectious diseases consultation is advised for complicated cases, **persistent bacteremia**, or when considering combination therapy [^116JxcCZ].

---

## Outcomes and complications

MRSA bacteremia has high mortality (15–30%) [^1139yWMx] and risks of metastatic infection, recurrence, and resistance emergence. Early effective therapy and source control improve outcomes [^1113FHUC].

---

MRSA bacteremia management centers on **early source control**, appropriate antibiotics, and vigilant monitoring. Vancomycin or daptomycin are first-line; use combination therapy for persistent cases and tailor duration to clinical complexity.

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: does it work, which combination, and for which patients? [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by current standards. In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (eg, with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (ie, monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new therapeutic approaches [^1156vTRT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent clinical evidence for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Vancomycin remains the initial antibiotic of choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis due to isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL, whereas daptomycin is an effective alternative, and ceftaroline seems promising. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^111AvHcK]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is still a major global healthcare problem. Of concern is S. aureus bacteremia, which exhibits high rates of morbidity and mortality and can cause metastatic or complicated infections such as infective endocarditis or sepsis. MRSA is responsible for most global S. aureus bacteremia cases, and compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, MRSA infection is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. S. aureus virulence is affected by the unique combination of toxin and immune-modulatory gene products, which may differ by geographic location and healthcare- or community-associated acquisition. Management of S. aureus bacteremia involves timely identification of the infecting strain and source of infection, proper choice of antibiotic treatment, and robust prevention strategies. Resistance and nonsusceptibility to first-line antimicrobials combined with a lack of equally effective alternatives complicates MRSA bacteremia treatment. This review describes trends in epidemiology and factors that influence the incidence of MRSA bacteremia. Current and developing diagnostic tools, treatments, and prevention strategies are also discussed.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^112a313j]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although identification and prevention techniques have improved, MRSA remains a major healthcare issue. MRSA bacteremia can be challenging to manage, especially in patients at high risk of complications or in those with toxigenic or multidrug-resistant strains. Early identification of MRSA is an important step toward timely implementation of appropriate treatment. The development of new molecular and immunochromatographic testing technologies has the potential to dramatically shorten delays to diagnosis and treatment. In addition, novel antibiotic therapies are becoming available to provide effective alternatives for strains that have acquired resistance to existing drugs. While these advances do not preclude the need for vigilance and effective MRSA prevention strategies, they help mitigate some of the challenges associated with MRSA bacteremia treatment.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115nMZR7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health concern, and, of the Gram-positive bacteria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious threat. S. aureus causes a wide range of infections commonly involving the skin, soft tissue, bone, joints, and infections associated with indwelling catheters or prosthetic devices. In addition, S. aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in industrialized nations. Although methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia incidence has decreased over the past decade, MRSA remains associated with poorer clinical outcomes compared with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) often causes metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis (IE), septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. Moreover, SAB can lead to complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Taken together, these issues make SAB particularly challenging to treat.

Choice and timing of antibacterial therapy greatly affect treatment outcomes in SAB. For SAB caused by MSSA, β-lactam therapy is considered the gold standard. For MRSA, the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend treatment with vancomycin or daptomycin. However, each antimicrobial agent has limitations. Several issues restrict the utility of vancomycin, including slow bactericidal activity, low tissue penetration, and increasing reports of resistance and failure. While daptomycin is effective against MRSA bacteremia, treatment-emergent nonsusceptibility is concerning, and evidence suggests prior vancomycin treatment may encourage daptomycin resistance in S. aureus. Given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with SAB and the limitations of currently approved treatments, there is a need to identify alternative agents for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Time to effective treatment is largely dependent on pathogen identification. Delays in diagnosing and treating SAB lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Standard microbial identification techniques take between 48 and 72 h, while recently developed rapid diagnostic tests provide data within 3 h of collection. By enabling optimized antimicrobial therapy, rapid diagnostic tests may lower mortality, hospitalization, and costs. This review discusses the global incidence and prevalence, diagnostic methods, and current management strategies for SAB. We also briefly discuss another key part of MRSA infection management — prevention; however, an in depth discussion is beyond the scope of this review.

### Persistent methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: resetting the clock for optimal management [^114hvj2j]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

A positive follow-up blood culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) while on seemingly appropriate therapy is a common and ominous development. However, the definition and management of persistent MRSA bacteremia is unstandardized. In this Opinion Paper, we identify the presence of bacteremia for > 1 calendar day as a "worry point" that should trigger an intensive diagnostic evaluation to identify metastatic infection sites. Next, we define the duration of MRSA bacteremia that likely constitutes antibiotic failure and outline a potential management algorithm for such patients. Finally, we propose pragmatic clinical trial designs to test treatment strategies for persistent MRSA bacteremia.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^114VkSSW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections? [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than 4 decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may in part be explained by the inability of attaining appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature. The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. The emergence of resistance and cost considerations, however, favor a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the current available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practice for treating patients with MRSA infections.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^116yn9zF]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Empirical treatment decisions in MRSA bacteremia require consideration of the prevalence and resistance profile of local strains, risk factors for a complicated clinical course, presence of comorbidities, concurrent interventions, and response to prior antibiotics. Current US and European treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 3. For most cases of MRSA bacteremia, vancomycin or daptomycin is the recommended treatment. The choice of antibiotic may also depend on if the bacteremia is secondary to another infection. For example, daptomycin, although indicated for treatment of SAB, is contraindicated for SAB originating from pneumonia since pulmonary surfactants inactivate it. Vancomycin poorly penetrates lung tissue; thus, linezolid or clindamycin are recommended if the strain is susceptible. Reports of MRSA isolates resistant or nonsusceptible to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and ceftaroline, as well as multidrug-resistant MRSA clones, are a concerning trend. These data highlight the importance of early identification of MRSA and susceptibility to identify the optimal antibiotic.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: an update on new therapeutic approaches [^116g3NZp]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are options for the initial treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.

### Time for a change: considering vancomycin alternatives for pediatric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^116tzX7C]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2023). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin remains the standard of care for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in pediatrics largely because no alternative antibiotic is definitively superior. Long-standing historical precedent and S. aureus' notable lack of vancomycin resistance are clear benefits, but vancomycin's use remains plagued by nephrotoxicity and the need for therapeutic drug monitoring, with inadequate consensus on how best to dose or monitor vancomycin in pediatrics. Daptomycin, ceftaroline, and linezolid are all promising alternatives, with improved safety relative to vancomycin. However, inadequate and variable efficacy data limit confidence in their use. Despite this, we contend that it is time for clinicians to reconsider vancomycin's place in clinical use. In this review, we summarize the supporting data for using vancomycin versus these other anti-MRSA antibiotics, present a framework for antibiotic decision-making that considers patient-specific factors, and discuss approaches to antibiotic selection for various etiologies of MRSA bacteremia. This review aims to help pediatric clinicians choose among the various treatment options for MRSA bacteremia, acknowledging that the optimal antibiotic choice is sometimes uncertain.

MRSA treatments and outcomes

Although MRSA bacteremia must always be taken seriously, some clinical characteristics place patients at risk of a complicated course requiring prolonged treatment (Table 2). S. aureus bacteremia is considered uncomplicated when the infection meets the following requirements: a catheter-related infection where the catheter is removed; negative result on follow-up blood culture; fever resolution within 72 h; no abnormal findings on transesophageal echocardiogram; no implanted prosthetic material; and no symptoms of a metastatic infection. Complicated bacteremia is diagnosed when any of these criteria are not met. In general, antistaphylococcal treatment should be continued for about 14 days in those with uncomplicated bacteremia, and for 4 to 6 weeks in those with complicated SAB.

Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with more severe SAB

Abbreviations: APACHE Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, CURB-65 confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age 65, HIV human immunodeficiency virus, MRSA methicillin-resistant S. aureus, SAB S. aureus bacteremia

An important first step in MRSA bacteremia management is to identify and eliminate the source of infection. If an intravascular catheter is the source, it should be removed as soon as possible after diagnosis; any wounds should be debrided. In patients with short- or long-term catheter-related MRSA infection who develop suppurative thrombophlebitis, remove the catheter and treat as complicated bacteremia; anticoagulation with heparin has been reported, but evidence to support a recommendation is lacking. Patients with MRSA IE and a prosthetic valve should be evaluated for valve replacement surgery, as should those with native valve IE if the infection is extensive or complicated. When bacteremia is persistent, hidden sources of infection should be identified using MRI or CT imaging and removed by drainage or surgical debridement.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children: executive summary [^114D2QMm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Future strategies for treating Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections [^114ah2Mj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are potentially life-threatening diseases. They can cause serious secondary infections, such as infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis, and may result in severe sepsis. One of the most critical determinants of survival is the induction of timely and effective antibiotic therapy. One of the leading causes of bloodstream infections is Staphylococcus aureus, with an increasing proportion of isolates being resistant to methicillin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is associated with greater morbidity and mortality rates than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Standard-of-care antibiotic treatments for S. aureus bloodstream infections are limited by toxicity and/or differential efficacy against MRSA and MSSA, which makes the choice of empirical therapy difficult. New management strategies are required to address the challenges raised by S. aureus bloodstream infections and MRSA in particular. These may include the use of techniques that allow the early identification of complications arising from S. aureus bacteraemia, rapid pathogen identification to enable the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and the identification of new drugs with novel modes of action that may circumvent antibiotic resistance and enable effective empirical treatment of both MSSA and MRSA infections.

### Avoiding the perfect storm: the biologic and clinical case for reevaluating the 7-day expectation for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia before switching therapy [^111vHmmW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia (MRSAB) is associated with poor outcomes and serious complications. The MRSA guidelines define treatment failure and persistent bacteremia as lasting ≥ 7 days; however, this definition requires reevaluation. Aggressively reducing the bacterial inoculum promptly is critical because factors already in place before clinical presentation are driving resistance to the few antibiotics that are available to treat MRSAB. Alternative approaches to treat MRSAB should be considered within 3–4 days of persistent MRSAB. With rapid molecular diagnostics emerging in clinical microbiology laboratories and biomarkers as a potential for early patient risk stratification, a future shorter threshold may become possible.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Problem

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital acquired bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci. Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. Failure of any aspect of the optimal management, however, is associated with negative patient outcomes.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^11578u6K]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Although vancomycin is the first-line antibiotic for MRSA bacteremia treatment, it has a relatively slow onset of bactericidal activity and poorly penetrates some tissues. While US guidelines recommend a fixed dose, European guidelines advise dosing vancomycin based on the trough plasma concentration (C min) with the goal to achieve a vancomycin area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 400 for as long as possible throughout the 24-h dosing interval. However, recent evidence suggests C min is not an accurate surrogate for 24-h vancomycin exposure, underestimating the area under the curve by up to 25%. In an analysis of MRSA bacteremia cases that received vancomycin, those who achieved a C min of 15 to 20 mg/L within 72 h had a significantly lower rate of vancomycin failure compared with lower C min values, but 40% of patients who had a C min in the recommended range still did not. This may reflect the observed slow increase in the MIC (MIC creep) of vancomycin from the 1990s to the present, whereby higher doses are needed to maintain efficacy. Reports conflict on the correlation between vancomycin MICs > 1.5 mg/L and treatment failure in MRSA bacteremia. Additionally, individual studies may be affected by the method used to determine MIC (Etest or broth microdilution) or by duration of storage of isolates. Another concern of using higher doses of vancomycin is the potential for nephrotoxicity, a risk factor for mortality in SAB. In a recent meta-analysis, continuous infusion of vancomycin was associated with less risk of nephrotoxicity compared to intermittent infusion, but no significant difference was found for mortality. However, Echeverria-Esnal et al. highlight factors that affect vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity not considered in the individual studies, and suggest a multicenter randomized trial is needed to resolve the inconsistencies.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^115Da6tt]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Daptomycin is considered an alternative first-line agent for MRSA bacteremia, but MICs for vancomycin and daptomycin are correlated, and up to 15% of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus isolates are also nonsusceptible to daptomycin. Furthermore, some studies suggest prior vancomycin failure is correlated with the acquisition of heteroresistance and reduced success of daptomycin therapy. Thus, higher doses of daptomycin (8–10 mg/kg) may be required for complicated or persistent MRSA bacteremia. Teicoplanin is another option for patients who are refractory to vancomycin; however, it is unavailable in some markets, including the US. It is approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in bacteremia associated with several Gram-positive infections, and is considered as effective and safe as vancomycin in treating healthcare-associated MRSA bacteremia.

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: definitions and treatment [^111sDnDT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality and often results in metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis, which have a negative impact on patient outcomes. We review the importance of the use of precise definitions of uncomplicated bacteremia and complicated bacteremia and present a case study to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia. Traditionally, the treatment of choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended to a large extent on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics with proven efficacy against both susceptible and resistant strains are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents that are currently available for use in the treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and the scientific evidence that forms a basis for the use of these agents for this indication are reviewed.

### Management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113Aray5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis are serious infections that demand prompt clinical attention to ensure good outcomes. Of foremost importance is identifying and managing the source of infection and any associated complications. Evaluation for the presence of cardiac involvement is essential because inadequately managed S. aureus endocarditis is life threatening. Thus, physicians must aggressively negotiate treatment paths, considering whether the S. aureus bacteremia is complicated, whether foreign sources of infection should be removed or replaced, and whether surgical intervention is necessary. Selection of an antibiotic treatment is also an essential factor for optimal management. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections has created a tremendous demand for effective and safe antimicrobial agents other than the historic anti-MRSA agent vancomycin.

### Ceftaroline as salvage monotherapy for persistent MRSA bacteremia [^113oF8VG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize published data regarding the use of ceftaroline as salvage monotherapy for persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia.

Data Sources

PubMed (January 1980-June 2016) was searched using combinations of the search terms methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, bacteremia, ceftaroline, refractory, and persistent Supplemental references were generated through review of identified literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Available English-language, full-text articles pertaining to the use of ceftaroline for persistent MRSA bacteremia (MRSAB) were included.

Data Synthesis

The PubMed search yielded 23 articles for evaluation. There are no randomized controlled trials to date-only case series and reports. Four retrospective case series detailing the use of ceftaroline as monotherapy for persistent MRSAB were included. Most patients received at least 4 days of an appropriate anti-MRSA antimicrobial prior to ceftaroline and were able to clear bacteremia within 3 days. The most common rationales for ceftaroline use were progression of disease or nonresponse to current therapy. Higher off-label dosing of ceftaroline is often utilized to achieve optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. Adverse events are not well described due to lack of follow-up; however, neutropenia has been associated with prolonged use.

Conclusions

Treatment options for persistent MRSAB remain few and far between. Ceftaroline is an effective agent for the salvage treatment of MRSAB. Off-label doses up to 600 mg every 8 hours are often used to achieve optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters. Because of lack of follow-up in these reports, the incidence of adverse effects of prolonged use of ceftaroline is not well defined.

### Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management strategies [^113aCp4v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia, and S. aureus bacteremia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, compared with bacteremia caused by other pathogens. The burden of S. aureus bacteremia, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia, in terms of cost and resource use is high. The risk of infective endocarditis and of seeding to other metastatic foci increases the risk of mortality and raises the stakes for early, appropriate treatment. The incidence of S. aureus bacteremia and its complications has increased sharply in recent years because of the increased frequency of invasive procedures, increased numbers of immunocompromised patients, and increased resistance of S. aureus strains to available antibiotics. This changing epidemiology of S. aureus bacteremia, in combination with the inherent virulence of the pathogen, is driving an urgent need for improved strategies and better antibiotics to prevent and treat S. aureus bacteremia and its complications.

In Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, mortality rates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are consistently lower than observational studies. Stringent eligibility criteria and omission of early deaths in RCTs contribute to this mortality gap. Clinicians should acknowledge the possibility of a lower treatment effect when applying RCT results to bedside care.

### What's new in the treatment of serious MRSA infection? [^111NyMon]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vancomycin has been the cornerstone of treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. This review describes new MRSA-active antibiotics that have recently been introduced and highlights emerging resistance.

Recent Findings

Elevations in the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration within the susceptible range are associated with treatment failure and mortality in the treatment of MRSA infections. Ceftaroline and ceftobiprole are anti-MRSA cephalosporins and are noninferior to comparator agents in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) and pneumonia. Tedizolid is more potent than linezolid, has improved pharmacokinetics and reduced toxicity and is active against cfr-containing S. aureus. Telavancin now has approval for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and recent phase 2 trial data showed similar cure rates in S. aureus bacteremia. Dalbavancin and oritavancin are administered once weekly and are noninferior to comparators for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Resistance has emerged against many new anti-MRSA antimicrobials including ceftaroline. Combination therapy of β-lactams with vancomycin or daptomycin is increasing.

Summary

Several new MRSA-active agents are now approved for use, although much of the data is derived from treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections or pneumonia. Further studies are required for more invasive infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111up4Zy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Although first identified just > 4 decades ago, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has undergone rapid evolutionary changes and epidemiologic expansion to become a major cause of nosocomial and community-acquired infections worldwide. Increasing resistance to vancomycin among MRSA strains in conjunction with availability of new antibiotics, including daptomycin and linezolid, have increased treatment choices but made clinical treatment decisions more challenging. This article describes the clinical features and management issues of 2 challenging-to-treat manifestations of MRSA infection, bacteremia and/or endocarditis and osteomyelitis. It also presents a brief review of community-associated MRSA infections and preventive strategies directed against MRSA.

### Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^111XBsCZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 patients with S aureus bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing S aureus bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of S aureus bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging S aureus strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research.

Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1176MarX]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, also known as bacteraemia, is one of the most common and serious community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. When S aureus enters the bloodstream it can disseminate to cause metastatic, deep-seated infection of almost any organ, with an associated mortality of approximately 20%. Despite the frequency and severity of S aureus bacteraemia, the optimal antibiotic treatment is uncertain. Fewer than 1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection over the past 50 years. Most treatment recommendations are therefore based on observational studies and clinical experience. Opinions on best management vary widely, but current guidelinesrecommend S aureus bacteraemia be treated with at least 14 days of an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic, or a glycopeptide if the bacteria are resistant to meticillin. Combination antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended, except in severe meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections (eg, endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections); however, evidence in support of its use in such cases is weak.

### Incidence, prevalence, and management of MRSA bacteremia across patient populations-a review of recent developments in MRSA management and treatment [^1178SAFD]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is another option being explored. Davis et al. compared vancomycin plus flucloxacillin to vancomycin alone in 60 MRSA bacteremia patients. Duration of bacteremia was reduced by 1 day and fewer combination therapy patients had persistent bacteremia at 3 and 7 days. Combination of daptomycin and ceftaroline retained a bactericidal effect on isolates that had increased daptomycin MICs. A phase 3 trial investigating β-lactam antibiotics given with daptomycin or vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia is ongoing (NCT02365493). Certain patients with IE may also benefit from combination of vancomycin or daptomycin with rifampin or an aminoglycoside. Although there are no definitive studies supporting its use, the addition of short-term gentamicin or rifampin is recommended in patients with prosthetic valve or left-sided disease; however, the European Society of Cardiology recommends against the use of an aminoglycoside in S. aureus native valve IE due to increased renal toxicity. Rifampin is bactericidal and can penetrate biofilms; however, it should not be used alone due to high potential to induce resistance. Any benefits of combination therapies should be carefully weighed against the probable effects on the intestinal microbiota, development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and possibly defying the protocols established by antimicrobial stewardship programs.

### Addition of rifampin to vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: what is the evidence? [^116LHh7u]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate evidence supporting efficacy and safety of the combination of vancomycin and rifampin for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1946-February 2013), EMBASE (1974-February 2013) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched.

Study Selection

All human prospective trials and retrospective studies evaluating clinical outcomes of vancomycin-rifampin combinations were included. Case reports, case series, and in vitro or animal data were excluded.

Data Extraction

Full-text articles were included and abstracts excluded; 43 of 421 references were reviewed. Five articles met inclusion and were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A nonrandomized prospective trial reported complete clearance of MRSA bacteremia at 24 hours in all 14 burn patients receiving vancomycin-rifampin therapy. In a case-control study of 42 patients with MRSA endocarditis, adding rifampin prolonged bacteremia (5.2 vs 2.1 days, p < 0.001), decreased survival rates (79% vs 95%, p = 0.048), resulted in drug interactions (52% of cases), and increased hepatic transaminases (21% vs 2%, p = 0.014). In a retrospective analysis of 28 patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia requiring salvage therapy, switching from vancomycin-based to linezolid-based treatment was associated with better salvage success than adding rifampin (88% vs 0%, p < 0.001). In a randomized open-label trial of 42 patients with MRSA endocarditis, addition of rifampin to vancomycin did not affect cure rates (90% combination vs 82% monotherapy, p > 0.20), but increased duration of bacteremia (9 vs 7 days, p > 0.20) compared with vancomycin monotherapy. Another randomized open-label trial of combination versus monotherapy for MRSA pneumonia in 93 intensive care unit patients reported higher clinical successes (53.7% vs 31.0%, p = 0.047), similar 30-day mortality rates, and more adverse events with combination therapy (11 vs 6).

Conclusions

Limited evidence exists to support the adjunctive use of rifampin to treat MRSA infections. The combination may increase drug interactions, adverse effects, and rifampin resistance. Further studies are needed to define the role of rifampin adjunct therapy.

### Daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of complicated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113rFx9j]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens. Resistance to antibiotic therapy has been known to emerge especially in clinically complex scenarios, resulting in challenges in determining optimal treatment of serious MRSA. Daptomycin, in combination with other antibiotics, has been successfully used in the treatment of these infections, with the aims of resulting in reducing the prevention of antimicrobial resistance and increased killing compared with daptomycin monotherapy.

Methods

This article reviews all the published studies that used daptomycin combination therapy for the treatment of bacteremia and associated complicated infections caused by gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. We discuss the rationale of combination antibiotics and the mechanisms that enhance the activity of daptomycin, with special focus on the role of β-lactam antibiotics.

Findings

There are limited clinical data on the use of daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics. Most of this use was as successful salvage therapy in the setting of failing primary, secondary, or tertiary therapy and/or relapsing infection. Synergy between β-lactams and daptomycin is associated with several characteristics, including increased daptomycin binding and β-lactam-mediated potentiation of innate immunity, but the precise molecular mechanism is unknown.

Implications

Use of daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics, especially β-lactams, offers a promising treatment option for complicated MRSA bacteremia in which emergence of resistance during treatment may be anticipated. Because it is currently not possible to differentiate complicated from uncomplicated bacteremia at the time of presentation, combination therapy may be considered as first-line therapy, with de-escalation to monotherapy in uncomplicated cases and cases with stable pharmacologic and surgical source control.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^111pnDGz]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is characterized by a unique ability to involve metastatic infections in almost every organ system in the body. Around 20% of the patients with SAB die within 30 days. In patients with SAB, the distinction between uncomplicated and complicated SAB is therapeutically important, as guidelines recommend different treatment durations for these two entities. However, this dichotomous classification strategy can incompletely reflect the heterogeneity of SAB. In this viewpoint, we discuss the limitations of the currently used definitions for SAB. We then propose a new approach to define the extent of infection in patients with SAB, providing an individualized framework for diagnosis and treatment.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^115Cka8X]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of bacteremia in children; however, optimal management of these patients remains unclear. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia recommend vancomycin therapy for up to 6 weeks, depending on the source and clinical response. Guidelines for the treatment of methicillin- susceptible S aureus (MSSA) bacteremia recommend nafcillin as first-line therapy, with cefazolin as an alternative.

Despite these recommendations, the application of broad guidelines to specific scenarios encountered in the management of S aureus bacteremia (SAB) in children remains difficult. Recent literature has challenged long-held notions regarding optimal management of SAB associated with osteoarticular infections; however, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management in several other common scenarios including the following: nonpersistent SAB without a source, prolonged MRSA bacteremia, and central-line associated SAB. Given the complexity in the management of children with SAB, we sought to describe practice patterns and clinical decision making among pediatric infectious diseases (PID) providers.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review [^115srBTr]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of death from bacteremia worldwide, with a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and an estimated 300 000 deaths per year.

Observations

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia causes metastatic infection in more than one-third of cases, including endocarditis (≈12%), septic arthritis (7%), vertebral osteomyelitis (≈4%), spinal epidural abscess, psoas abscess, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli, and seeding of implantable medical devices. Patients with S aureus bacteremia commonly present with fever or symptoms from metastatic infection, such as pain in the back, joints, abdomen or extremities, and/or change in mental status. Risk factors include intravascular devices such as implantable cardiac devices and dialysis vascular catheters, recent surgical procedures, injection drug use, diabetes, and previous S aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia (≥ 48 hours) is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant (MRSA) based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted. Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care (treatment success, 53/120 [44%] vs 48/115 [42%]) and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin (treatment success, 132/189 [70%] vs 136/198 [69%]). Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement.

Conclusions and Relevance

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^115moQ7J]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

S. aureus bacteraemia is associated with a mortality of 20–30%, and suboptimal management can significantly impact on the associated morbidity. Failure to remove an infected intravascular focus increases the risk of treatment failure, recurrence of S. aureus bacteraemia and metastatic complications. Based on this data, our first measurement evaluated the adequacy and timely removal or debridement of the source of bacteraemia.

Endocarditis is a well documented complication in around 12% of cases, although rates vary between different population groups and rates from 5% up to 60% have been reported. This highlights the need for echocardiography in all cases of S. aureus bacteraemia, even in the absence of peripheral stigmata of endocarditis. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) both recommend echocardiography in all cases of S. aureus bacteraemia in their guidelines. Based on these guidelines, our second measurement assessed whether echocardiography was performed in all adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia.

Obtaining a repeat blood culture is recommended after initiation of appropriate treatment. This enables the early identification of complications and persistence of bacteraemia. Hence our third measurement assessed whether clearance blood cultures were obtained.

Treatment of less than two weeks is associated with a higher risk of complications. The presence of an irremovable or undrainable primary focus, endocarditis, a metastatic focus of infection or persistence of bacteraemia are all indications for prolonged antimicrobial therapy of four to six weeks. It is uncertain whether de-escalation to oral therapy impacts on the relapse rate.

Based on this evidence, the fourth measurement evaluated the adequacy of antimicrobial duration and choice. A minimum of two weeks of intravenous antibiotics for uncomplicated bacteraemia, and four to six weeks of antibiotics for complicated bacteraemia was considered adequate.

Documentation of S. aureus bacteraemia in the discharge summary enables earlier identification of complications following a patient's discharge, such as recurrence of bacteraemia, metastatic foci of infection or endocarditis. The fifth measurement assessed whether S. aureus was documented in the discharge summary.

A previous study revealed that patients under the care of medical teams who did not follow the treatment recommendations by infectious diseases consultants were more likely to experience a relapse of the bacteraemia. Many of the project's Plan-Do-Study-Act learning cycles were therefore centred around improving clinical liaison between the clinicians and the microbiology team.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^114HXRzj]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin, as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, particularly in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 8% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected treatments for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 312 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 133 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 55 studies and the further review of 78 full publications. Of the 78 full articles evaluated, 15 systematic reviews and one subsequent RCT were added at this update. In addition, six studies were added to the Comment sections. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for five interventions, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of cephalosporins (ceftobiprole, ceftaroline), daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin (streptogramins), and tigecycline.

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^111RGgSg]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study CAMERA2 (original research) was published by Steven Y C Tong and colleagues in 2020 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Infective endocarditis, Sepsis and septic shock, Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Cellulitis, Community-acquired pneumonia, Skin abscess, Acute bacterial meningitis, Septic arthritis, Parapneumonic effusion and empyema, Ventilator-associated pneumonia and Hospital-acquired pneumonia. In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of combining anti-staphylococcal β-lactam and standard therapy in MRSA bacteremia? In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the population was: 352 patients (121 female, 231 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adult patients with MRSA bacteremia. The key exclusion criteria were history of type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to β-lactams; polymicrobial bacteremia; pregnancy; currently receiving β-lactam therapy that could not be ceased or substituted for a non-β-lactam antibiotic; death expected in the next 48 hours; treatment limitations precluding the use of antibiotics. In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 174 combination therapy (an antistaphylococcal β-lactam [intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin] plus intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) n = 178 standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, or microbiological treatment failure at 90 days (35% vs. 39%; AD -4.2%, 95% CI -14.3 to 6). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes at 90 days (21% vs. 16%; AD 4.5%, 95% CI -3.7 to 12.7) Significant decrease in persistent bacteremia at day 5 (11% vs. 20%; AD -8.9%, 95% CI -16.6 to -1.2) Significant increase in AKI (excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline) (23% vs. 6%; AD 17.2%, 95% CI 9.3 to 25.2). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in microbiological treatment failure or microbiological relapse. significant differences in adverse events (13.2% vs. 3.9%), AKI (7.5% vs. 0.6%). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adult patients with MRSA bacteremia, combination therapy was not superior to standard therapy with respect to death, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, or microbiological treatment failure at 90 days.

Persistent Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

For the treatment of children with persistent MRSA bacteremia despite adequate vancomycin levels, 37% continue vancomycin and add a second agent, most commonly rifampin. A minority (12%) continue vancomycin monotherapy, whereas 43% change to other agents, most commonly daptomycin; 8% of providers chose an alternative management strategy.

Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter-Associated Thrombus With Staphylococcus aureus Bacteremia

There was no consensus on the duration of IV therapy for children with PICC-associated thrombus and bacteremia; 34% treated for 2 weeks, 37% treated for 4 weeks, 18% treated for 6 weeks, and 11% chose an alternative treatment strategy. The majority (71%) recommend anticoagulation.

### Predicting risk for death from MRSA bacteremia [^111TabHQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide concern; it colonizes and infects patients in the hospital and in the community. For the past 50 years in the United States, the standard therapy has been vancomycin. Recent vancomycin treatment failures have raised questions regarding optimal treatment. Although new antimicrobial drugs (e.g. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) have been developed, none has been consistently superior to vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA, and MRSA resistance rapidly develops for many new drugs. Some studies have suggested MIC creep (increasing vancomycin MICs against MRSA over time), but others have not. In 2006, the upper limit of vancomycin susceptibility for S. aureus was redefined, lowered from 4 µg/mL to 2 µg/mL, first by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and soon thereafter by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility.

Vancomycin treatment failures for MRSA occur even when MICs are within the range considered susceptible, especially 1–2 µg/mL. Among high-risk bacteremic patients, Sakoulas et al. documented treatment failure rates of 44% when vancomycin MICs were < 0.5 µg/mL and of 90% when vancomycin MICs were 1–2 µg/mL (p = 0.01). Hidayat et al. found that mortality rates were higher for patients infected with strains with higher vancomycin MICs

Some apparently susceptible strains of MRSA might actually be heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) strains. That is, although the hVISA isolates seem to be susceptible to vancomycin according to conventional testing, the isolates contain subpopulations of colonies resistant to vancomycin. Testing for hVISA has not been standardized and is not routinely undertaken. hVISA strains are more common in strains with higher vancomycin MICs. hVISA might contribute to worse clinical outcomes, but this possibility has not been convincingly confirmed by large studies.

To determine predictors of risk for death among patients with MRSA bacteremia, we conducted a retrospective study that compared demographic and clinical characteristics of adult patients with MRSA bacteremia. MRSA strains from these patients were vancomycin susceptible, VISA, and hVISA. We analyzed a 5-year trend of vancomycin MICs among adult patients with MRSA bacteremia. We also analyzed the associations between host factors, organism factors, and death versus survival, and quantifed the marginal contribution of key factors to risk for death.

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^111usLe4]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The framework proposed here for the classification and management of patients with SAB has the potential to solve the shortcomings of the current simplistic definition of uncomplicated and complicated SAB. It consists of four steps: (1) risk stratification for the presence of metastatic infection that (2) directs a diagnostic work-up in search for these infections leading to (3) 'final clinical diagnoses' corresponding with a general direction for treatment that (4) can be individualized to favorable clinical characteristics. This framework provides guidance to the clinician and a context for future research to improve patient outcome and individualized treatment.

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^113uYSHx]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.

Objective

To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4%]), 345 (98%) completed the trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35%) with combination therapy and 68 (39%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -14.3% to 6.0%). Seven of 9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21%) vs 28 (16%) (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, -3.7% to 12.7%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11%) vs 35 of 172 (20%) (difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%); and, excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23%) vs 9 of 145 (6%) (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3%-25.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with MRSA bacteremia, addition of an antistaphylococcal β-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered when interpreting the findings.

### Combination of vancomycin and β-lactam therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a pilot multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113dWDie]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro laboratory and animal studies demonstrate a synergistic role for the combination of vancomycin and antistaphylococcal β-lactams for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Prospective clinical data are lacking.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, clinical trial, adults with MRSA bacteremia received vancomycin 1.5 g intravenously twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g every 6 hours for 7 days (combination group) or no additional therapy (standard therapy group). Participants were stratified by hospital and randomized in permuted blocks of variable size. Randomization codes were kept in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was the duration of MRSA bacteremia in days.

Results

We randomly assigned 60 patients to receive vancomycin (n = 29), or vancomycin plus flucloxacillin (n = 31). The mean duration of bacteremia was 3.00 days in the standard therapy group and 1.94 days in the combination group. According to a negative binomial model, the mean time to resolution of bacteremia in the combination group was 65% (95% confidence interval, 41%-102%; p = 0.06) that in the standard therapy group. There was no difference in the secondary end points of 28- and 90-day mortality, metastatic infection, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity.

Conclusions

Combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with vancomycin may shorten the duration of MRSA bacteremia. Further trials with a larger sample size and objective clinically relevant end points are warranted. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000940077 (www.anzctr.org.au).

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^1137KxLf]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

The current duration of therapy in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is based on differentiating complicated from uncomplicated disease. While this approach allows clinicians and investigators to group SAB patients into broadly similar clinical categories, it fails to account for the intrinsic heterogeneity of SAB. This is due in part to the fact that risk factors for metastatic infection and confirmed metastatic infection are considered as equivalent in most scoring systems. In this viewpoint, we propose a two-step system of categorizing patients with SAB. Initially, patients with SAB would be categorized as 'high risk' or 'low risk' for metastatic infection based upon an initial set of diagnostic procedures. In the second step, patients identified as 'high-risk' would undergo additional diagnostic evaluation. The results of this stepwise diagnostic evaluation would define a 'final clinical diagnosis' to inform an individualized final treatment plan.

### Impact of source of infection and vancomycin AUC0–24 / MICBMD targets on treatment failure in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^112Zgmvk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Despite recent controversies about toxicity and reduced efficacy, vancomycin remains the current treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. The parameter associated with treatment success is the vancomycin 24-h area under concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (AUC0–24/MIC). We aimed to determine the utility of calculated AUCs and explore the optimal AUC0–24/MIC targets associated with treatment success. In this single-centre retrospective observational cohort study of 127 patients with MRSA bacteraemia, forty-five (35.4%) did not respond to vancomycin treatment. Patient characteristics were essentially the same between those who did not respond to vancomycin treatment and those with treatment success, with independent predictors of treatment failure being source of bacteraemia (odds ratio (OR), 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.50–12.26; p 0.007) and not achieving an AUC0–24/MICBMD (using broth microdilution) target of ≥ 398 (OR, 11.4; 95% CI, 4.57–28.46; p < 0.001). Bacteraemic source-specific thresholds were observed with a higher AUC0–24/MICBMD target of 440 required for high-risk sources (e.g. infective endocarditis) compared with 330 for low-risk sources (line related bacteraemia). Overall treatment success in patients with MRSA bacteraemia was associated with a vancomycin AUC0–24/MICBMD target of ≥ 398, with source-specific targets observed. Future vancomycin practice guidelines will need to take into account MIC methodology, source of bacteraemia and patient populations prior to setting targets and monitoring recommendations.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1139yWMx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

(.)

Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Microbiological failures including persistent and recurrent infection remain a major problem in the management of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. The persistently high mortality rate in MRSA bacteremia, ranging from 13% to 30%, is a matter of concern. A major factor contributing to these adverse outcomes is the limited efficacy of the current standard antibiotic therapy with either vancomycin or daptomycin.

Vancomycin is the agent for which the greatest cumulative clinical experience is available for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. Compared to β-lactams, vancomycin has relatively slow bacterial killing, poor tissue penetration, and potential for toxicity, all of which may be responsible for the clinical failures reported. The use of vancomycin plus β-lactam therapy and adjunctive therapy with rifampicin to improve outcomes has proved unsatisfactory, providing little or no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy and increasing toxicity. In a significant randomized trial, daptomycin at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily was not inferior to standard therapy for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistant strains and subsequent therapeutic failures using a once-daily dose of 6 mg/kg of daptomycin has led to the use of higher doses (8–10 mg/kg once daily) in some centers. Despite the use of high doses, treatment failures due to persistent or relapsing infections have been reported. Therefore, more effective strategies for the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections are urgently needed.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^111Ns9vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study shows that even the most basic aspects of treating patients with SAB differ profoundly between geographic regions. This variation was most marked in fundamental aspects of decision-making for SAB treatment, including antibiotic choice for MSSA bacteremia, addition of rifampin for prosthetic device infections, and route of administration. An anti-staphylococcal penicillin was treatment of choice for MSSA bacteremia in Europe and Oceania but a distant second to cefazolin in North America. The evidence for superiority of either of the 2 is limited to cohort studies with conflicting results and with underrepresentation of complicated disease, emphasizing the need for randomized trials.

The role of adjunctive rifampin in patients with prosthetic material infections also differed by continent. This controversy persists despite the availability of published society guidelines that recommend the use of rifampin in S. aureus infections involving prosthetic valves and arthroplasties. However, the recommendation to use rifampin for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis has a very limited evidence base. Thus, well-designed randomized trials are needed to define any potential role of adjunctive rifampin in prosthesis-associated SAB. Importantly, the wide range of practices regarding the use of rifampin in this survey demonstrates the presence of the global equipoise necessary to ethically conduct such a trial.

The practice of prescribing part of the treatment course for SAB with oral antibiotics was well accepted in all continents except North America, where only a minority of physicians would consider its routine use. This infrequent use of oral therapy in the United States may be due in part to a high prevalence of MRSA, the presence of a well-organized outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy system, or concerns related to medical malpractice. This lack of global consensus on the role of oral switch therapy is also reflected by the lack of consensus on which setting in which it should be considered. In fact, only the criteria of " source control" and " absence of central nervous system infection " were considered essential for oral switch by a clear majority. By contrast, all other listed criteria were regarded as essential by approximately half of the respondents — which implies that these were considered non-essential by the other half. Because oral switch therapy has potential to decrease the number of adverse drug events, catheter-associated problems and costs, and the fact that the survey respondents are in equipoise on the question, the need for a well-designed randomized trial seems clear. Current studies such as SABATO and SNAP might provide answers in the future.

### Clinical consensus conference: survey on Gram-positive bloodstream infections with a focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^116QLD2T]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The increased incidence over the past decade of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, highlights the critical need for a consistent approach to therapy. However, there is currently no international consensus on the diagnosis and management of gram-positive BSIs. The Clinical Consensus Conference on Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections was convened as a session at the 9th International Symposium on Modern Concepts in Endocarditis and Cardiovascular Infections held in 2007. Participants discussed various aspects of the practical treatment of patients who present with gram-positive BSI, including therapeutic options for patients with BSIs of undefined origin, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy, and treatment of complicated and uncomplicated BSIs. The opinions of participants about these key issues are reflected in this article.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: a Bayesian-guided approach [^111yqkGd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective study involving pediatric MRSA bacteremia cases with a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 3.7%, we suggest an optimal target for vancomycin AUC simulated using Bayesian dosing software. An AUC 24–48 ≤ 530 mg·h/L may serve as a threshold for improved outcomes, reducing the risk of persistent bacteremia ≥ 48 hours and AKI.

Bayesian-derived TDM is more adaptive to the patient's dynamic physiological changes and has the advantage of requiring fewer constraints on the timing or frequency of samplings, even before steady-state is achieved. Though still evolving, this approach shows promise in optimizing dosing strategies for patient outcomes and may be cost-effective, depending on the institution's size. In pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia, no study has proposed an applicable Bayesian-derived AUC target. One study utilizing an equation model indicated an association between an initial AUC/MIC < 300 mg·h/L and persistent bacteremia at 48–72 hours. However, the study relied on equations using only C trough to estimate the AUC, and as MIC values were identified using MicroScan, the interpretation of AUC/MIC values cannot be directly compared with those derived from the BMD method. For MIC determination of S. aureus isolates, this study adopted the MicroScan method, which tends to overcall MIC compared with the BMD method. These discrepancies in MIC results depending on measurement methods raise challenges in establishing interinstitutional targets of AUC/MIC as parameters for appropriate PK/PD targets. Consequently, AUC itself may be a more viable monitoring target. In addition, the 48-hour time point following antibiotic administration serves as a critical juncture, marking both the identification of the causative pathogen and the assessment of treatment response. This time window is corroborated by a recent multicenter prospective study, which indicated that persistence at day 3 marked an inflection point for increased mortality. Therefore, the timeframes of AUC 24–48 and persistent bacteremia ≥ 48 hours utilized in this study are expected to be clinically practical.

### Use of daptomycin to treat infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates having vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.5 to 2 μ g / mL [^115JPW7w]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate daptomycin use for the treatment of infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates having vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1.5 to 2 µg/mL.

Data Sources

The literature was retrieved through PubMed and EMBASE (January 2006 to August 2013).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English articles were reviewed. Studies that included separate daptomycin data (clinical outcome or in vitro surveillance) for MRSA isolates with vancomycin MICs of 1.5 to 2 µg/mL by any testing methodology were included.

Data Synthesis

Clinical and microbiological outcomes associated with daptomycin used as first-line or subsequent therapy for MRSA infections with vancomycin MICs of 1.5 to 2 µg/mL were reported in 7 retrospective clinical studies; susceptibility information involving such isolates was reported from 12 surveillancestudies. Although not all studies demonstrated outcome differences between daptomycin and comparator treatments (usually vancomycin), when differences were reported, they were in favor of daptomycin. Individual studies found lower 60-day (8% vs 20%, P = 0.046) and 30-day mortality (3.5% vs 12.9%, P = 0.047) and increased treatment success with daptomycin (68.6% vs 43.1%, P = 0.008; 76.9% vs 53.8%, P = 0.048) in bacteremic patients. The median doses used for treatment of bacteremia were greater than that approved by the FDA for this indication (6 mg/kg/d).

Conclusions

Current published evidence indicates daptomycin may be an acceptable alternative to vancomycin for MRSA infections, especially bacteremia, involving isolates with vancomycin MIC values of 1.5 to 2 µg/mL. Additional evidence is needed to fully elucidate daptomycin utility in this area.

### Practice patterns of providers for the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: results of an emerging infections network survey [^114kCttQ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides insights on the variation in the management of children with S aureus bacteremia. Notably, we found very little agreement in (1) the optimal route of antibiotics for children with osteomyelitis-associated SAB and nonpersistent SAB, (2) choice of antibiotic for MSSA bacteremia, (3) antibiotic approach in children with persistent MRSA bacteremia on vancomycin, and (4) optimal duration of antibiotics for PICC-associated thrombus and SAB.

These results highlight the complexity in caring for children with SAB and current gaps in consensus guidelines for the optimal management of these patients. Clinicians often encounter scenarios with little data to support treatment decisions, or they are forced to extrapolate data from adult studies. In children with SAB, however, the mortality, pathophysiology, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics are quite different than adults. The IDSA guidelines for MRSA bacteremia recommend echocardiography for all adult patients, whereas in children this is only recommended for those with congenital heart disease, persistent bacteremia (> 48–72 hours), or clinical findings suggestive of endocarditis. Our results reflect this recommendation because less than one third of providers routinely obtain an echocardiogram in a clinically improving child with SAB (Figure 1A). Notably, for a vignette describing bacteremia in a child with significant atopic dermatitis, 17% of respondents chose to discontinue antibiotics, assuming that S aureus was a contaminant — a recommendation at odds with the Committee on Infectious Diseases recommendation that " S. aureus almost never is a contaminant when isolated from a blood culture". Although it is certainly biologically plausible that a positive blood culture for S aureus could be a result of skin contamination, particularly in atopic dermatitis with or without cutaneous S aureus infection, there is historic precedent to treat these children with a short course of parenteral antibiotics. Whether this is suitable in practice is thus far unstudied and merits further discussion in subsequent guideline revisions.

Shortcomings of the current classification

The major limitation of including predisposing host characteristics, features of bacteremia, and the clinical course (see below) in the definition of complicated SAB is that they increase the risk of metastatic infection and are not, in themselves, metastatic infection. As a result, it is possible for patients at risk for metastatic infection but without its confirmed presence to be diagnosed with and treated presumptively for complicated SAB. In addition, the current classification can discourage a precise clinical diagnosis, since SAB encompasses a much wider range of clinical manifestations than uncomplicated and complicated SAB. Explicitly defining patient characteristics and SAB diagnosis would allow a more personalized treatment including shorter durations of intravenous (IV) therapy and more convenient routes of administration. -

### Redefining Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a structured approach guiding diagnostic and therapeutic management [^114sjMPF]. The Journal of Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Current classification

There is currently no consensus on the exact definitions of 'complicated' and 'uncomplicated' SAB. In 1998, uncomplicated SAB was described in a study that investigated the association between adherence to consensus recommendations for treatment and patient outcome. In this study, SAB patients were classified into three categories: simple SAB, uncomplicated SAB, and complicated SAB, with differing durations of therapy with each category. Over a decade later, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections omitted the category of 'simple SAB', and defined uncomplicated SAB as the presence of all of the following: a) negative follow-up blood cultures obtained 2–4 days after the initial set; b) defervescence within 72 h of initiating effective therapy; c) no prosthetic material; and d) no endocarditis and metastatic infection. These guidelines recommend that patients with uncomplicated SAB should be treated with at least 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics.

The term 'complicated' SAB, further defined in 2003to include attributable mortality, metastatic foci or infection beyond the primary focus, or relapse, has become embedded in everyday practice and scientific research. Subsequent studiesand the IDSA guidelinesalso included the presence of positive follow-up blood cultures in the definition of complicated SAB, because of its strong association with metastatic infection and death. Other investigators considered patient characteristics including persistent fever, prosthetic material, and hemodialysis dependenceas indicative of complicated SAB.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: a Bayesian-guided approach [^115w7nNq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Vancomycin is the most used drug for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aures (MRSA) infections. The parameter associated with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, because of difficulties in directly measuring AUC, trough concentration (C trough) monitoring has been employed as a surrogate marker since 2009. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that C trough does not consistently reflect AUC values and lacks a significant correlation with outcomes. – Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that AUC monitoring may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with C trough measurement. The 2020 revised vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidelines recommend AUC monitoring and suggest using Bayesian software to estimate AUC. Bayesian-derived TDM can easily estimate AUC using the vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model and individual patient data.

Previous studies on adults with severe MRSA infections have recommended an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L as a therapeutic target, despite variations in AUC estimation methods and the inherent limitations of retrospective studies. – Given the differences in clinical severity, prognosis and physiological responses to vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia compared with adults, it remains uncertain whether the AUC/MIC target recommended for adults can be directly extrapolated to the pediatric population. Two retrospective pediatric studies, in which the AUC was calculated using Bayesian estimation or equations, have investigated clinical outcomes with an AUC/MIC ratio of 400 mg·h/L as the cutoff point. However, neither study found significant clinical benefits at an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L. Another retrospective pediatric study observed a statistically significant increase in persistent bacteremia at 48–72 hours at an AUC/MIC < 300 mg·h/L. Furthermore, although the guidelines recommend measuring MIC values using the broth microdilution (BMD) method, the significant variability in MIC results across different measurement methods poses challenges for the practical clinical application of AUC/MIC.

Therefore, we conducted a study to determine the optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target for achieving the best outcomes in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia, using AUC as a parameter instead of AUC/MIC while considering clinical outcomes such as persistent bacteremia, 30-day all-cause mortality, recurrence and AKI.

### Does contemporary vancomycin dosing achieve therapeutic targets in a heterogeneous clinical cohort of critically ill patients? Data from the multinational DALI study [^115Uy4Uq]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major pathogen in severe healthcare-associated infections. In the past decades, the anti-MRSA armamentarium has broadened. Still, vancomycin remains the most common first-line option for treating severe infections with parenteral therapy. Achievement of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices associated with maximal bacterial kill is recommended to increase the likelihood of clinical cure. To achieve target serum concentrations in life-threatening infections such as sepsis, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia, current guidelines recommend trough serum concentrations of vancomycin (C min) ranging 15 to 20 mg/L. Such serum concentrations should achieve an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24-hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio) of > 400 (assuming an MIC ≤ 1 mg/L). This threshold was significantly associated with favourable clinical and bacteriological outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and therefore generally accepted as the appropriate PK/PD target. Other investigators confirmed that an AUC 0–24 /MIC ratio for optimizing clinical outcomes should be at least 400.

### The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam for staphylococcal bacteremia [^1121VHpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus bacteremias leads to common use of vancomycin as empirical therapy. However, investigators have reported poor outcomes with vancomycin treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We review the evidence supporting empirical combination of both vancomycin and a β-lactam agent for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Vancomycin therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with 2–3 times the risk of morbidity and mortality compared to an antistaphylococcal penicillin (oxacillin and nafcillin) or first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin). De-escalation of empirical vancomycin to definitive β-lactam therapy still appears inferior to initial β-lactam therapy. Although there is no clinical trial supporting combination therapy, a scientific rationale for benefit exists and should be weighed against the risks (adverse events, antibiotic resistance, and cost) of additional pharmacotherapy. The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam (either nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) for staphylococcal bacteremia may improve infection-related clinical outcomes.

### Therapeutic options for adult patients with persistent methicillin-susceptibleBacteremia: a narrative review [^116JxcCZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies used in the management of persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

Data Sources

A literature search using the PubMed database (inception to December 2022) was conducted using the search terms " Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", "persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia", and "refractory methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia ". In addition, therapeutic agents which could be used as treatment for MSSA including "nafcillin", "oxacillin", "cefazolin", "ceftaroline", "gentamicin", "rifampin", and "daptomycin" were also combined with the aforementioned search terms to capture data using these agents.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

Clinical data were limited to those published in the English language. Articles and abstracts were considered for inclusion in addition to ongoing trials identified through ClinicalTrials.gov.

Data Synthesis

A total of 78 articles were reviewed including 17 in vitro or animal model studies and 39 studies including patient data. The remaining 22 articles included guidelines, review articles, and editorials. Recent data evaluating use of dual β-lactam regimens for persistent MSSA bacteremia were limited to 8 case reports or case series.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

At present, there is little guidance on how to best manage patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia. This narrative review collates the available data to assist clinicians in selecting the best possible antimicrobial regimen when facing this clinical conundrum.

Conclusions

Modification of antimicrobial therapy, in conjunction with source control and infectious diseases consultation, may all be necessary to sterilize blood cultures in patients with persistent MSSA bacteremia.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: a Bayesian-guided approach [^112wmScK]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent multicenter observational study on hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin reported that higher vancomycin exposure with an AUC > 515 mg·h/L did not provide advantages, nor did it act as a worsening factor in terms of treatment failure, defined as 30-day mortality or persistent bacteremia lasting ≥ 7 days. However, a study by McNeil et alon pediatric healthcare-associated S. aureus bacteremia observed a trend toward a longer duration of bacteremia and higher mortality in the higher vancomycin exposure group (vancomycin C trough > 15 mg/L). Similarly, in our study, the higher vancomycin exposure group (AUC 24–48 > 530 mg·h/L) showed increased rates of AKI, along with trends toward higher 30-day mortality and greater rates of persistent bacteremia at 48 hours. These findings suggest that higher vancomycin exposure is associated not only with increased AKI but also with poorer clinical and microbiological outcomes in pediatric MRSA bacteremia. The exact explanation for these findings remains unclear. While there were no significant differences in baseline glomerular filtration rate between the higher and lower vancomycin exposure groups, patients in the higher exposure group tended to present with more severe conditions at baseline (although this trend was not statistically significant), which may have led to more aggressive dosing. Moreover, consistently worse clinical and microbiological outcomes were observed in the higher vancomycin exposure group, regardless of age group. This suggests that the observed outcomes are unlikely to be attributed to age-related differences. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size, and the role of noneradicable/not eradicated foci in persistent bacteremia cannot be conclusively excluded. Further large-scale studies on vancomycin exposure in pediatric bacteremia will be necessary to elucidate these findings more clearly.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^112Rufiq]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This open-label, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial conducted in 19 Spanish hospitals aimed to evaluate whether the combination of cloxacillin and fosfomycin achieved better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in patients with MSSA bacteremia. The primary endpoint was chosen based on the recommendations of international experts that proposed primary endpoints for use in clinical trials comparing treatment options for bloodstream infections in adults. We chose day 7 for the primary endpoint as it seemed an appropriate timepoint to evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment on the initial response and the early resolution of the infection.

The main finding of our trial is that cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 than cloxacillin alone among patients with MSSA bacteremia. Secondary endpoints, including adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy, were similar in the two treatment groups, with the exception of persistent bacteremia at day 3, which was less common in the combination treatment arm.

The results of our study are in line with the findings of the few randomized clinical trials carried out to date assessing different antibiotic combinations, which have also failed to improve treatment success rates and outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis, as shown in a recent meta-analysis. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the ARREST trial)conducted in 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom evaluated whether adjunctive rifampicin improved the outcomes of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia, of whom 6% had infection with methicillin-resistant strains. In that trial, adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in terms of avoiding treatment failure, disease recurrence, or death at 12 weeks after randomization. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial performed at two hospitals in Canada evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive daptomycin given with either cloxacillin or cefazolin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia found that it did not shorten the duration of bacteremia (the primary endpoint) and did not improve 90-day mortality.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113nTgUs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: a revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^1129Rg8D]. American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Vancomycin AUC/MIC exposure–response in MRSA bacteremia — study thresholds and outcome signals are as follows: The formula-based approach will overestimate vancomycin CL by approximately 40% to 50%, and Bayesian software programs can be used to generate accurate and reliable estimates of the daily AUC values with trough-only PK sampling. In a multicenter, observational prospective study evaluating prespecified day 2 AUC/MIC ratios — AUC/MICbroth of ≥ 320 and AUC/MICEtest of ≥ 650 — in adult patients (n = 265) with MRSA bacteremia, treatment failure rates were not significantly different between the prespecified day 2 AUC/MIC groups. Post hoc analyses suggested the best global outcome among patients in the 2 lowest AUC exposure quintiles, defined by an AUC of ≤ 515 mg·h/L, and only 20% of the study population (n = 54) had an AUC of 400 mg·h/L, leaving uncertainty about efficacy below this threshold of 400 mg·h/L. Notably, the higher AUC value cited above (515 mg·h/L) is still within the recommended AUC range of 400 to 600 mg·h/L (assuming a MIC of 1 mg/L), and MICbest value tends to be 1.5- to 2-fold higher than the MICbroth value, which can affect apparent AUC/MIC targets across methods.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^114Rr8LM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, MRSA, IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend to administer vancomycin 15 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 2–6 weeks, depending on the source, presence of endovascular infection, and metastatic foci of infection, in pediatric patients with bacteremia and IE caused by MRSA.
Consider administering daptomycin 6–10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily as an alternative option.
Do not use clindamycin or linezolid in pediatric patients with IE.

### The utility of risk factors to define complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in a setting with low methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalence [^114Nmb4q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The clinical spectrum of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) varies widely and ranges from uncomplicated peripheral venous catheter infection to widespread disseminated infection. SAB is commonly divided in complicated and uncomplicated SAB to guide clinical management. Guidelines recommend to treat uncomplicated SAB for 2 weeks and complicated SAB for 4 to 6 weeks with antibiotics. A frequently used definition of complicated SAB is the one introduced in 2003 by Fowler and coworkers, in which complicated SAB is defined as SAB complicated by infection-related mortality, metastatic or locally complicated infection, embolic stroke, or recurrent SAB. However, this definition includes outcomes that are unknown at the moment a physician needs to decide whether to treat for 2 weeks or longer. To help identify patients with complicated SAB, the same investigators determined risk factors for complicated SAB: community acquisition of bacteremia, persistent fever, persistently positive blood cultures, and skin findings suggesting acute systemic infection. Although the presence of risk factors for complicated SAB does not equate the actual existence of complicated SAB, presence of these (and other) risk factors is now often used to define complicated SAB, even in the absence of proven metastatic or locally complicated infection. For instance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteremia define complicated SAB as presence of locally complicated or metastatic infection, or the presence of 1 of several risk factors (presence of prosthetic material, persistent fever, persistently positive blood cultures, and skin findings suggestive of systemic infection).

However, associations between risk factors and occurrence of complicated SAB are poorly validated, and the investigators reporting these risk factors did not recommend including them as part of the definition. The use of risk factors, therefore, implies the possibility of misclassification, either leading to over- and underdiagnosis of complicated SAB, potentially leading to over- and undertreatment with antibiotics.

In a prospective cohort study of patients with SAB, we retrospectively adjudicated all episodes as either complicated or uncomplicated SAB using a reference definition based on clinical course and outcome as proposed by Fowler et al. and quantified associations and predictive values of risk factors for this outcome. Second, we determined the accuracy of categorizing complicated SAB using the IDSA criteria, compared with the reference definition, and estimated the potential consequences for antibiotic use.

### Empirical therapy for serious Gram-positive infections: making the right choice [^116zpWA8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

It is well established that delaying the administration of effective antimicrobials for the treatment of serious infections has a significant impact on patient outcomes. In this atmosphere of urgency, decision-making regarding therapy is further complicated by the current high rates of drug resistance among important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. To improve treatment outcomes, decrease the risk of mortality and reduce hospital costs, physicians should always administer the most appropriate antimicrobial for the given scenario. When a staphylococcal infection is suspected but the resistance phenotype is not known, agents that are effective against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus provide optimal empirical coverage. However, the number of such empirical monotherapeutic options is limited. Daptomycin has proven clinical efficacy as compared with comparator agents in Gram-positive infections, and could be considered an appropriate therapy for the treatment of infections caused by either methicillin-susceptible S. aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^114RxjGF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

We aimed to determine whether daptomycin plus fosfomycin provides higher treatment success than daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and endocarditis.

Methods

A randomized (1:1) phase 3 superiority, open-label, and parallel group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia was conducted at 18 Spanish hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily. Primary endpoint was treatment success 6 weeks after the end of therapy.

Results

Of 167 patients randomized, 155 completed the trial and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Treatment success at 6 weeks after the end of therapy was achieved in 40 of 74 patients who received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 34 of 81 patients who were given daptomycin alone (54.1% vs 42.0%; relative risk, 1.29 [95% confidence interval,.93–1.8]; p = 0.135). At 6 weeks, daptomycin plus fosfomycin was associated with lower microbiologic failure (0 vs 9 patients; p = 0.003) and lower complicated bacteremia (16.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.022). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 13 of 74 patients (17.6%) receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin, and in 4 of 81 patients (4.9%) receiving daptomycin alone (P = 0.018).

Conclusions

Daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. This antibiotic combination prevented microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia, but it was more often associated with adverse events.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Longer-term mortality and kidney outcomes of participants in the combination antibiotics for methicillin-resistant (CAMERA2) trial: a post hoc analysis [^112EbYZH]. Open Forum Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The study CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) was published by Amy Legg and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Open Forum Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock, Cellulitis, Septic arthritis, Catheter-related bloodstream infection, Parapneumonic effusion and empyema, Community-acquired pneumonia, Ventilator-associated pneumonia, Hospital-acquired pneumonia, Infective endocarditis and Acute bacterial meningitis. In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the role of combination antibiotic therapy in patients hospitalized for MRSA bacteremia? In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 260 patients (91 female, 169 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients hospitalized for MRSA bacteremia. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis before enrollment. In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 129 combination therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin plus intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) n = 131 standard monotherapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin). In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from all causes (50% vs. 44%; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.7). In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in AKI at 1 year (29% vs. 9%; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.68). In the CAMERA2 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients hospitalized for MRSA bacteremia, combination therapy was not superior to standard monotherapy with respect to death from all causes.

### Relationship of MIC and bactericidal activity to efficacy of vancomycin for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^117BdmoU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

We attempted to find a relationship between the microbiological properties of bloodstream isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the efficacy of vancomycin in the treatment of bacteremia. Vancomycin susceptibility testing was performed, and bactericidal activity was determined for 30 isolates from 30 different patients with MRSA bacteremia for whom clinical and microbiological outcome data were available. The majority of these patients had been previously enrolled in multicenter prospective studies of MRSA bacteremia refractory to conventional vancomycin therapy. Logistic regression found a statistically significant relationship between treatment success with vancomycin and decreases in both vancomycin MICs (≤ 0.5 microg/ml versus 1.0 to 2.0 microg/ml; P = 0.02) and degree of killing (reduction in log(10) CFU/milliliter) by vancomycin over 72 h of incubation in vitro (P = 0.03). For MRSA isolates with vancomycin MICs ≤ 0.5 microg/ml, vancomycin was 55.6% successful in the treatment of bacteremia whereas vancomycin was only 9.5% effective in cases in which vancomycin MICs for MRSA were 1 to 2 microg/ml. Patients with MRSA that was more effectively killed at 72 h by vancomycin in vitro had a higher clinical success rate with vancomycin therapy in the treatment of bacteremia (log(10) < 4.71 [n = 9], 0%; log(10) 4.71 to 6.26 [n = 13], 23.1%; log(10) > 6.27 [n = 8], 50%). We conclude that a significant risk for vancomycin treatment failure in MRSA bacteremia begins to emerge with increasing vancomycin MICs well within the susceptible range. Elucidating the mechanisms involved in intermediate-level glycopeptide resistance in S. aureus should begin by examining bacteria that begin to show changes in vancomycin susceptibility before the development of obvious resistance. Prognostic information for vancomycin treatment outcome in MRSA bacteremia may also be obtained by testing the in vitro bactericidal potency of vancomycin.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113r4DPE]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This large, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, including 758 adults with S aureus bacteraemia, aimed to establish whether rifampicin added to standard backbone antibiotics for up to 14 days reduced bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by 12 weeks. We found that although rifampicin did not have a significant effect on any of the composite primary or secondary efficacy measures, including mortality, duration of bacteraemia, or development of rifampicin-resistant S aureus, it was associated with a small but significant reduction in bacteriologically and clinically defined disease recurrences.

Our trial highlights the severity and heterogeneity of S aureus bacteraemia. Participants were mostly older adults with comorbidities, 9% of whom were enrolled in an intensive care unit. Most (64%) infections were acquired in the community, and 6% were caused by MRSA, reflecting substantial improvements in prevention and control of hospital-acquired S aureus and MRSA infection in the UK over the past decade, and the consequent decline in infections. A deep infection focus was present at baseline in 301 (40%) participants — around half with endocarditis, orthopaedic or intravascular devices, or osteoarticular infections — and 139 (18%) had no established infection focus. Therefore, a substantial proportion had what could be considered as uncomplicated disease.

The choice and duration of backbone antibiotics varied substantially between participants, but 82% received flucloxacillin and 50% received a glycopeptide at some point during their primary treatment. The choice of first-line anti-staphylococcal penicillin for the treatment of MSSA infections varies by country. In the UK and Australia, flucloxacillin is used; whereas, in the United States, other agents, such as nafcillin and cloxacillin, are preferred. There is no evidence to support clinically relevant differential anti-staphylococcal activity between these antibiotics, and we therefore believe our results are generalisable across countries, regardless of their chosen anti-staphylococcal penicillin. The use of other antibiotics (including open-label rifampicin) and the total duration of active antibiotic therapy (median 29 days) was similar between randomised groups. Fewer rifampicin-treated than placebo-treated participants were restarted on antibiotics after the primary treatment course, possibly reflecting the lower recurrence rate in this group.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^111nJ6KB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine whether daptomycin plus fosfomycin provides higher treatment success than daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and endocarditis.

Methods

A randomized (1:1) phase 3 superiority, open-label, and parallel group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia was conducted at 18 Spanish hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily. Primary endpoint was treatment success 6 weeks after the end of therapy.

Results

Of 167 patients randomized, 155 completed the trial and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Treatment success at 6 weeks after the end of therapy was achieved in 40 of 74 patients who received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 34 of 81 patients who were given daptomycin alone (54.1% vs 42.0%; relative risk, 1.29 [95% confidence interval, .93–1.8]; p = 0.135). At 6 weeks, daptomycin plus fosfomycin was associated with lower microbiologic failure (0 vs 9 patients; p = 0.003) and lower complicated bacteremia (16.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.022). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 13 of 74 patients (17.6%) receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin, and in 4 of 81 patients (4.9%) receiving daptomycin alone (P = 0.018).

Conclusions

Daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. This antibiotic combination prevented microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia, but it was more often associated with adverse events.

### Bacteremia is an independent risk factor for mortality in nosocomial pneumonia: a prospective and observational multicenter study [^113fpfRy]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

There are several factors linked with MRSA isolation in VAP episodes: administration of antibiotics before the development of VAP and the length of hospital stay rather than the period of mechanical ventilation were strongly associated with MRSA isolation. Methicillin resistance represents an independent risk factor for a poor outcome, prolonged hospitalization and high hospital costs in VAP episodes, even when therapy was appropriate. Interestingly, new antimicrobial development and novel anti-adherence tools based upon fibrinogen-binding protein derivatives might provide new opportunities to improve survival by preventing bacteremic nosocomial pneumonia. The time to initiation of appropriate therapy with a molecular analysis of MRSA isolates and virulence factors would be useful in future research.

Our results show that there is an independent association between MRSA and A. baumannii etiology and development of bacteremia in NP patients; but mortality is associated with bacteremia and severity of disease. These results confirm the concept shown in the study by Agbaht and colleagues, since they also found an independent association between MRSA and bacteremia but mortality was associated with bacteremia rather with MRSA. In addition, the presence of bacteremia has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality by other authors and included in clinical scores for severity assessment of VAP episodes.

### Impact of an assay that enables rapid determination of Staphylococcus species and their drug susceptibility on the treatment of patients with positive blood culture results [^112zMXTr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether an earlier determination of staphylococcal species and their antibiotic susceptibility decreases unnecessary antistaphylococcal treatment and/or facilitates earlier appropriate treatment.

Methods

We used the Xpert MRSA/SA BC system (Cepheid) for immediate determination of species and their drug susceptibility in patients whose blood cultures revealed gram-positive cocci in clusters. We compared the treatment of patients whose physicians received early notification of these results (group 1) with the treatment of patients in a historical cohort with delayed reporting after traditional microbiological studies (group 2). Outcomes were analyzed according to whether blood culture was positive for Staphylococcus species other than S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and whether the drugs used were appropriate for methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant staphylococci (hereafter referred to as "MSS drug" or "MRS drug" therapy, respectively).

Results

There were 44 (76%) of 58 patients with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus species other than S. aureus in group 1 and 58 (55%) of 106 patients with bacteremia due to Staphylococcus species other than S. aureus in group 2 who received no antistaphylococcal antibiotics (P < .01). Five (6%) of 89 patients in group 1 and 31 (25%) of 123 patients in group 2 received 0–168 hours (0–7 days) of MRS drug therapy (P < .01). Among patients with MSSA bacteremia, the mean time to initiation of appropriate therapy was 5.2 hours in group 1 and 49.8 hours in group 2 (P = 0.007). Excluding patients who received MRS drug therapy for unrelated conditions, the mean duration of treatment was 19.7 hours in group 1 and 80.7 hours in group 2 (P = 0.003). Six (50%) of the 12 patients in group 1 and 39 (81%) of the 48 patients in group 2 received MRS drug therapy for MSSA bacteremia (P = 0.025). Time to initiation of therapy for MRSA bacteremia did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

The use of an assay with rapid results reduced the use of antistaphylococcal therapy among patients who did not have S. aureus bacteremia; it also decreased the use of MRS drug therapy and led to earlier appropriate therapy among patients with MSSA bacteremia.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^116CgUVU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 25 — CRBSI or bacteremia specifies that patients with suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) should have blood cultures obtained from the CVC and peripheral source (dialysis circuit ± peripheral veins), and broad-spectrum antibiotics that treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms should be initiated immediately. Due to the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus, empiric therapy should include coverage for methicillin-resistant S aureus and be guided by local infection rates, antibiotic sensitivities, and dialysis center policies. Once the final organism and sensitivities are identified, patients should receive long-term antibiotic treatment according to the CDC or IDSA guidelines, for 4 to 6 weeks for uncomplicated S aureus.

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in non surgical wounds [^116xfUbm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Non surgical wounds include chronic ulcers (pressure or decubitus ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, ischaemic ulcers), burns and traumatic wounds. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation (i.e. presence of MRSA in the absence of clinical features of infection such as redness or pus discharge) or infection in chronic ulcers varies between 7% and 30%. MRSA colonisation or infection of non surgical wounds can result in MRSA bacteraemia (infection of the blood) which is associated with a 30-day mortality of about 28% to 38% and a one-year mortality of about 55%. People with non surgical wounds colonised or infected with MRSA may be reservoirs of MRSA, so it is important to treat them, however, we do not know the optimal antibiotic regimen to use in these cases.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased mortality and improved quality of life) and harms (such as adverse events related to antibiotic use) of all antibiotic treatments in people with non surgical wounds with established colonisation or infection caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 13 March 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (2013, Issue 2); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (2013, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February Week 4 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, March 12, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 10); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 8 March 2013).

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic treatment with no antibiotic treatment or with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA-infected non surgical wounds. We included all relevant RCTs in the analysis, irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials, and extracted data from the trial reports. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both fixed-effect and random-effects models. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We identified three trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review. In these, a total of 47 people with MRSA-positive diabetic foot infections were randomised to six different antibiotic regimens. While these trials included 925 people with multiple pathogens, they reported the information on outcomes for people with MRSA infections separately (MRSA prevalence: 5.1%). The only outcome reported for people with MRSA infection in these trials was the eradication of MRSA. The three trials did not report the review's primary outcomes (death and quality of life) and secondary outcomes (length of hospital stay, use of healthcare resources and time to complete wound healing). Two trials reported serious adverse events in people with infection due to any type of bacteria (i.e. not just MRSA infections), so the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was not available for MRSA-infected wounds. Overall, MRSA was eradicated in 31/47 (66%) of the people included in the three trials, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated in any of the comparisons, as shown below.1. Daptomycin compared with vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillin: RR of MRSA eradication 1.13; 95% CI 0.56 to 2.25 (14 people).2. Ertapenem compared with piperacillin/tazobactam: RR of MRSA eradication 0.71; 95% CI 0.06 to 9.10 (10 people).3. Moxifloxacin compared with piperacillin/tazobactam followed by amoxycillin/clavulanate: RR of MRSA eradication 0.87; 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36 (23 people).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no trials comparing the use of antibiotics with no antibiotic for treating MRSA-colonised non-surgical wounds and therefore can draw no conclusions for this population. In the trials that compared different antibiotics for treating MRSA-infected non surgical wounds, there was no evidence that any one antibiotic was better than the others. Further well-designed RCTs are necessary.

### Vital signs: epidemiology and recent trends in methicillin-resistant and in methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections-United States [^1113FHUC]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Community-associated MRSA infections provide a reservoir that contributes to health care–associated disease incidence and fuels transmission both outside and within health care settings. USA300 strains, for example, emerged in the community and spread to health care settings. Community-associated S. aureus infections are not declining, and the ongoing opioid epidemic might be contributing to this trend. Emerging evidence suggests a 16-fold risk for invasive MRSA infection among persons who inject drugs; 9.2% of invasive MRSA cases in 2016 occurred in persons who inject drugs. Prevention of opioid misuse, increasing access and linkage to medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder, ensuring access to sterile injecting equipment, improving education about safer injection practices and how to recognize early signs of infection, and linking those with an infection to care are needed. Additionally, community-associated S. aureus infections are known to disproportionately affect persons in lower socioeconomic strata; this has implications for the formulation of approaches to enhance prevention. The observed increases in rates of community-onset MSSA infections highlight the need to systematically study the epidemiology of MSSA and develop innovative, evidence-based prevention strategies for this setting. Research for a vaccine or for novel ways to decrease S. aureus bioburden should continue.

The incidence of S. aureus bloodstream infections and associated deaths is substantial and consistent with estimates using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Mortality was unchanged over the time studied and comparable to what was achieved in the VA hospital system through implementation of improved clinical management of infection. Appropriate and timely diagnosis and antimicrobial susceptibility-guided treatment of S. aureus infections remain key to reducing poor outcomes and preventing sepsis and death.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the lack of detailed epidemiologic information on previous health care exposures captured in EHR precluded subclassification of community-onset infections into those with and without previous health care exposures. Second, possible variability in clinical or data capture practices across different hospitals might affect the validity of EHR data and trends.

Strengths of this study include the use of multiple data sources; the detailed epidemiologic information provided in the population-based EIP surveillance; the inclusion of two widely used EHR systems representing a large number of U.S. acute-care hospitals; and the use of weights to derive national estimates. As has been previously shown with another infection-related condition (sepsis), clinical criteria using EHR data are immune to temporal variations in coding practices that can be significant, whereas death-certificate data are an insensitive measure of sepsis-related mortality.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^1162ySZU]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — empiric MRSA coverage in adults with sepsis or septic shock: For high risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), "we recommend using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage over using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage" (best practice statement); for low risk of MRSA, "we suggest against using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage, as compared with using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage" (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Context includes that "MRSA accounts for approximately 5% of culture-positive infections among critically ill patients", varies by region "ranging from ~2% in Western Europe to 10% in North America", and among patients with documented MRSA infections, delays of " > 24–48 hours" to antibiotics "are associated with increased mortality", whereas in undifferentiated pneumonia or sepsis, broad-spectrum regimens including anti-MRSA agents "were associated with higher mortality, particularly among patients without MRSA".

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus vancomycin for severe infections caused by meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus: randomised controlled trial [^1113MbZX]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The main treatment options for MRSA infections other than vancomycin (or teicoplanin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole include linezolid, tedizolid, telavancin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, daptomycin, tigecycline, and ceftaroline. Most of the new antibiotics were evaluated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in randomised controlled trials. Mortality was rarely assessed in these trials and when reported was very low (usually < 1%). Few randomised controlled trials targeted infections other than skin and soft tissue infections, and most did not include only MRSA. Daptomycin was non-inferior to standard therapy in a randomised controlled trial including 245 patients with S aureus bacteraemia, of whom 89 had MRSA bacteraemia and were treated with daptomycin or vancomycin. The overall mortality was 11%. Similar efficacy and safety for was shown for linezolid and vancomycin in nosocomial pneumonia, and the mortality rate in these trials was 14%. Tigecycline was non-inferior to vancomycin in a randomised controlled trial including 156 patients with invasive MRSA infections, but most were skin and soft tissue infections (mortality rate 5%). Telavancin was non-inferior to vancomycin in hospital acquired pneumonia (293 patients with MRSA, overall mortality in the study 19%). Compared with these trials, ours included a larger group of patients with MRSA bacteraemia and a sicker cohort overall, as evidenced by the mortality rates, more closely reflecting patients treated with MRSA infections in clinical practice.

Limitations of study

The main limitation of our trial is the small sample size of patients with bacteraemia, in whom results suggest an important advantage for vancomycin. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups at baseline for nearly all variables. However, a subtle difference existed for important prognostic variables, and more patients allocated to vancomycin were bacteraemic. Multivariable analysis of the entire study cohort showed a larger advantage of vancomycin with regard to treatment failure, reaching statistical significance. Patients with polymicrobial infections and receiving additional antibiotics were included in the study, reflecting its pragmatic nature. However, these were mostly inactive against MRSA and concomitant antibiotics covering MRSA were not allowed at randomisation. Patients excluded owing to inability to provide informed consent had higher severity of illness scores than those included, affecting the trial's external validity. Finally, the dosing of vancomycin and trough levels achieved (≥ 15 µg/mL in only 67% of patients) were lower than currently recommended, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the efficacy of vancomycin and the difference between arms.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hospitalized empiric therapy and resistant pathogens — Options for empiric therapy for HIV-infected children outside of the neonatal period who are hospitalized for suspected community-acquired bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) (AIII). The addition of azithromycin or other macrolide can be considered for hospitalized patients with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin (for non-CNS infections), doxycycline (non-CNS, for children aged > 8 years) or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug with consideration for adding an aminoglycoside if infection with Pseudomonas sp. is likely, and severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Adjunctive daptomycin in the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized, controlled trial [^111kVW28]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our objective in this study was to determine the efficacy of synergistic treatment with daptomycin when given with either cefazolin or cloxacillin for the treatment of MSSA BSI.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at 2 academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patientsaged ≥ 18 years with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard-of-care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days.

Results

Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age, 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin vs 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference, 0.39 days; p = 0.40). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis that involved participants who remained bacteremic at the time of enrollment, we found a median duration of bacteremia of 3.06 days among patients who received daptomycin vs 3.0 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference, 0.06 days; p = 0.77). Ninety-day mortality in the daptomycin arm was 18.9% vs 17.7% in the placebo arm (P = 1.0).

Conclusions

Among patients with MSSA BSIs, the administration of adjunctive daptomycin therapy to standard-of-care treatment did not shorten the duration of bacteremia and should not be routinely considered.

### Comparative effectiveness of vancomycin versus daptomycin for MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin MIC > 1 mg / L: a multicenter evaluation [^116vCxYP]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinical studies comparing vancomycin with alternative therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia are limited. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of early daptomycin versus vancomycin treatment for MRSA bacteremia with high vancomycin MICs in a geographically diverse multicenter evaluation.

Methods

This nationwide, retrospective, multicenter (N = 11), matched, cohort study compared outcomes of early daptomycin with vancomycin for MRSA bloodstream infection (BSI) with vancomycin MICs 1.5 to 2 µg/mL. Matching variables, based on propensity regression analysis, included age, intensive care unit (ICU), and type of BSI. Outcomes were as follows: (1) composite failure (60-day all-cause mortality, 7-day clinical or microbiologic failure, 30-day BSI relapse, or end-of-treatment failure (EOT; discontinue/change daptomycin or vancomycin because of treatment failure or adverse event]); (2) nephrotoxicity; and (2) day 4 BSI clearance.

Findings

A total of 170 patients were included. The median (interquartile range) age was 60 years (50–74); the median (range) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was 15 (10–18); 31% were in an ICU; and 92% had an infectious disease consultation. BSI types included endocarditis/endovascular (39%), extravascular (55%), and central catheter (6%). The median daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg, and the vancomycin trough level was 17 mg/L. Overall composite failure was 35% (59 of 170): 15% due to 60-day all-cause mortality, 14% for lack of clinical or microbiologic response by 7 days, and 17% due to failure at end of therapy (discontinue/change because of treatment failure or adverse event). Predictors of composite failure according to multivariate analysis were age > 60 years (odds ratio, 3.7; P < 0.01) and ICU stay (odds ratio, 2.64; P = 0.03). Notable differences between treatment groups were seen with: (1) end of therapy failure rates (11% vs 24% for daptomycin vs vancomycin; P = 0.025); (2) acute kidney injury rates (9% vs 23% for daptomycin vs vancomycin; P = 0.043); and (3) day 4 bacteremia clearance rates for immunocompromised patients (n = 26) (94% vs 56% for daptomycin vs vancomycin; P = 0.035).

Implications

Results from this multicenter study provide, for the first time, a geographically diverse evaluation of daptomycin versus vancomycin for patients with vancomycin-susceptible MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin MIC values > 1 µg/mL. Although the overall composite failure rates did not differ between the vancomycin and daptomycin groups when intensively matched according to risks for failure, the rates of acute kidney injury were significantly lower in the daptomycin group. These findings suggest that daptomycin is a useful therapy for clinicians treating patients who have MRSA bacteremia. Prospective, randomized trials should be conducted to better assess the potential significance of elevated vancomycin MIC.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: clinical manifestations and antimicrobial therapy [^117VGESn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common skin coloniser and less commonly causes infection. MRSA colonisation should be contained by infection control measures and not treated. MRSA infections cause the same spectrum of infection as MSSA infections, i.e., skin/soft tissue infections, bone/joint infections, central IV line infections, and acute bacterial endocarditis (native valve/prosthetic valve). There is a discrepancy between in-vitro sensitivity and in-vivo effectiveness with MRSA. To treat MRSA infections, clinicians should select an MRSA drug with proven in-vivo effectiveness, i.e., daptomycin. Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, or vancomycin, and not rely on in-vitro susceptibility data. For MRSA, doxycycline cannot be substituted for minocycline. Linezolid and minocycline are available for oral administration and both are also effective in treating MRSA CNS infections. Vancomycin is being used less due to side effects, (increasing MICs/resistance, VISA/VRSA), and increased VRE prevalence. The most potent anti-MRSA drug at the present time is daptomycin. Daptomycin is useful when rapid/effective therapy of MRSA bacteraemia/endocarditis is necessary. Daptomycin is also useful to treat persistent MRSA bacteraemias/MRSA treatment failures with other drugs, i.e., vancomycin. There is no difference in virulence between MSSA and MRSA infections if treatment is started early and with an agent that has in-vivo effectiveness.

### Exebacase in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis: a phase 3, superiority-design, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (DISRUPT) [^115Pg2hq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel treatments are needed for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, particularly for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Exebacase is a first-in-class antistaphylococcal lysin that is rapidly bactericidal and synergizes with antibiotics.

Methods

In Direct Lysis of Staph Aureus Resistant Pathogen Trial of Exebacase (DISRUPT), a superiority-design phase 3 study, patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous exebacase or placebo in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA population.

Results

A total of 259 patients were randomized before the study was stopped for futility based on the recommendation of the unblinded Data Safety Monitoring Board. Clinical response rates at day 14 in the MRSA population (n = 97) were 50.0% (exebacase + antibiotics; 32/64) versus 60.6% (antibiotics alone; 20/33) (P = 0.392). Overall, rates of adverse events were similar across groups. No adverse events of hypersensitivity related to exebacase were reported.

Conclusions

Exebacase + antibiotics failed to improve clinical response at day 14 in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. This result was unexpected based on phase 2 data that established proof-of-concept for exebacase + antibiotics in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. In the antibiotics-alone group, the clinical response rate was higher than that seen in phase 2. Heterogeneity within the study population and a relatively small sample size in either the phase 2 or phase 3 studies may have increased the probability of imbalances in the multiple components of day 14 clinical outcome. This study provides lessons for future superiority studies in S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT04160468.

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve Be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In this counterpoint we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodologically weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

### Mrsa bone and joint… [^1131cRoq]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Empiric therapy for five to 10 days is recommended pending culture results for outpatients with purulent cellulitis. Infection from β-hemolytic streptococci does not usually require empiric therapy. For those with nonpurulent cellulitis, five to 10 days of empiric therapy for β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is recommended, based on the patient's clinical response. Empiric coverage for community-associated MRSA is recommended in patients who do not respond to beta-lactam antibiotics, and also may be considered in those with systemic toxicity. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response.

Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. Recommended treatment for adults with uncomplicated bacteremia includes vancomycin or daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg per kg intravenously once per day for at least two weeks. For adults with complicated bacteremia, four to six weeks of therapy is recommended, depending on the extent of infection. Some experts recommend higher dosages of daptomycin. In patients with MRSA pneumonia complicated by empyema, antimicrobial therapy should be used with drainage procedures.

Some experts recommend adding oral rifampin to the chosen antibiotic. For patients with concurrent bacteremia, rifampin should be added after bacteremia has cleared. Persistent MRSA Bacteremia and Vancomycin Treatment Failures in Adults A search for and removal of other foci of infection, drainage, or surgical debridement is recommended. High-dose daptomycin, if the isolate is susceptible, in combination with another agent should be considered.
