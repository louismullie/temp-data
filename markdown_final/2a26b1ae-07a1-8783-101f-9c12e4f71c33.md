## Question

Which prurigo nodularis patients are appropriate candidates for dupilumab based on LIBERTY-PN PRIME/PRIME2, and what benefits and timelines should you discuss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which prurigo nodularis patients are appropriate candidates for dupilumab based on LIBERTY-PN PRIME/PRIME2, and what benefits and timelines should be discussed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial designs and inclusion/exclusion criteria to define the labeled population. Then, I should verify the efficacy outcomes and how they translate into clinically meaningful benefits. Next, I will examine onset and durability of response, including any subgroup differences. After that, I need to check the safety profile and monitoring considerations. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, patient-centered recommendation and dosing plan, making sure I reconcile any apparent discrepancies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the trial designs and regulatory context so I don't jump to conclusions. LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2 were phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week studies in adults with prurigo nodularis, and they formed the basis for FDA approval of dupilumab for PN in adults, which establishes the labeled indication and dosing regimen [^2868220f] [^36fb21ab] [^52868293].

> I need to verify the inclusion criteria that define appropriate candidates. Adults aged 18–80 years with a dermatologist-confirmed PN diagnosis for at least 3 months, at least 20 nodules on the extremities and/or trunk, and severe pruritus with a Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) average of 7 or higher over 7 days were enrolled; importantly, patients had to have failed or be unable to use medium-to-super-potent topical corticosteroids, and were allowed to continue low-to-medium potency TCS/TCI if already on a stable regimen, which mirrors real-world practice patterns [^651d1aa2] [^d7e0a7f2].

> Hold on, I should review key exclusions so I don't overgeneralize. Patients with PN secondary to medications or medical conditions, active tuberculosis or NTM, uncontrolled thyroid disease, severe renal disease, or other significant systemic illnesses were excluded; those with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were also excluded to isolate PN biology, and prior biologics or recent systemic immunosuppressants were not permitted, which shapes the safety and generalizability profile of the trial population [^651d1aa2] [^d7e0a7f2].

> Next, I should confirm the dosing regimen used in the trials and reflected in labeling. The regimen is a 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose on Day 1, followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, which aligns with the trial protocols and FDA label for adult PN [^3534d630] [^52868293].

> Now, let me consider the primary efficacy outcomes and their clinical meaning. In PRIME, 60.0% of dupilumab-treated patients achieved a ≥ 4-point WI-NRS reduction at week 24 versus 18.4% with placebo, and in PRIME2, 37.2% achieved this at week 12 versus 22.0% with placebo; a 4-point reduction on WI-NRS is validated as a clinically meaningful improvement in PN, which supports using this threshold when counseling patients [^a1e5e07e] [^0e0e1cac] [^558ed3d7].

> I will now examine lesion outcomes, because patients care about both itch and nodules. Significantly more dupilumab-treated patients achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA PN-S 0/1, ≤ 5 nodules) at week 24: 48.0% in PRIME and 44.9% in PRIME2 versus 18.4% and 15.9% with placebo, respectively; composite responses (itch and skin) were also higher, reinforcing dual benefit on core disease features [^ac57d535] [^250c8380].

> Wait, let me verify onset and durability so expectations are realistic. Itch improvement begins early, with statistically significant separation from placebo by week 3–4 in both trials, and continues to accrue through week 24; lesion counts lag but show progressive improvement, with about one-third achieving ≤ 5 nodules by week 12 and nearly half by week 24, which helps set expectations for a 3–6 month horizon to see maximal skin clearance [^a321d848] [^ac57d535].

> I should double-check whether benefits vary by atopy, because clinicians often ask this. A pre-specified pooled subgroup analysis showed similar efficacy in atopic and non-atopic patients, with approximately 58–59% achieving ≥ 4-point itch reduction at week 24 in both subgroups, supporting use regardless of atopic status; this aligns with the trial design that capped atopic enrollment and excluded moderate-to-severe AD to isolate PN biology [^21ab32a5] [^d1225fb9].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring so I don't understate risks. The safety profile in PN trials was consistent with the known dupilumab profile: conjunctivitis and herpes viral infections occurred more frequently with dupilumab, whereas non-herpetic skin infections were less common than with placebo; serious adverse events were balanced and no treatment-related discontinuous occurred in the dupilumab arms, and routine laboratory monitoring is not required by labeling, though clinical vigilance for ocular symptoms and infections remains prudent [^8136a466] [^1a194e42] [^e41b2020].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on higher-potency topicals or systemic agents; does that change candidacy. The trials allowed continuation of low-to-medium potency TCS/TCI if stable, and prohibited initiation or escalation of potency during the study; in practice, many patients will have already tried and failed or cannot tolerate higher-potency topicals, which fits the trial's "inadequately controlled with topical therapies" framing and supports considering dupilumab as the next step [^d7e0a7f2] [^651d1aa2].

> Let me synthesize the appropriate candidate profile so it's actionable. Appropriate candidates are adults with a confirmed PN diagnosis, at least 20 nodules, severe pruritus (WI-NRS ≥ 7), and inadequate control with or inability to use medium-to-super-potent topical corticosteroids; candidates should not have PN secondary to medications or systemic diseases, active TB/NTM, uncontrolled thyroid disease, severe renal disease, or other significant comorbidities that were exclusionary, and they should be counseled that efficacy is independent of atopic status [^651d1aa2] [^21ab32a5].

> I should confirm the practical counseling points and timelines. Patients can expect early itch relief within 2–4 weeks, with a meaningful chance of ≥ 4-point itch reduction by 12 weeks and further gains by 24 weeks; skin clearance to ≤ 5 nodules accrues more slowly, with about 25–32% achieving this by week 12 and 45–48% by week 24, so a 3–6 month trial is reasonable before declaring nonresponse; fewer patients needed rescue medications on dupilumab, reinforcing disease control [^a321d848] [^ac57d535] [^8136a466].

> Hold on, I should verify the dosing and administration details so there are no gaps. The labeled regimen is 600 mg subcutaneously on Day 1, then 300 mg every 2 weeks; patients can be trained for self-injection, and concomitant low-to-medium potency TCS/TCI can be continued for problem areas, which aligns with trial allowances and real-world practice [^3534d630] [^d7e0a7f2].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and reference-aligned. Based on LIBERTY-PN PRIME/PRIME2, dupilumab is appropriate for adults with moderate-to-severe PN characterized by ≥ 20 nodules and severe, uncontrolled pruritus despite topical therapy, who meet the trial inclusion criteria and do not have the specified exclusions; benefits include early and sustained itch reduction and progressive lesion clearance with a favorable safety profile, and a 24-week trial period is supported by the pivotal data and FDA labeling [^2868220f] [^52868293] [^36fb21ab].

Dupilumab is appropriate for adults with **moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis** [^52868293] who have **≥ 20 nodules** [^651d1aa2] and **severe itch (WI-NRS ≥ 7)** [^0e0e1cac] uncontrolled by topical therapies [^2868220f]. It is also suitable for patients with or without atopic comorbidities [^21ab32a5], as efficacy is consistent across both groups. Patients should be counseled that **itch improvement** [^a1e5e07e] can begin within 2–4 weeks [^a321d848], with about 37% achieving ≥ 4-point itch reduction by week 12 [^a1e5e07e] and 60% by week 24 [^3dcaed50]. Skin lesions improve more slowly, with ~45% achieving clear or almost clear skin by week 24 [^ac57d535]. Benefits include reduced itch, fewer nodules, improved sleep, and better quality of life [^96d785cc], with a safety profile consistent with other indications [^8136a466].

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^2868220f]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with intensely pruritic nodules. The LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2 phase 3 trials enrolled adults with PN with ≥ 20 nodules and severe itch uncontrolled with topical therapies. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. Patients were randomized 1:1 to 300mg dupilumab or placebo subcutaneously every 2weeks for 24weeks. The primary endpoint was pruritus improvement, measured by proportion of patients with a ≥ 4-point reduction in Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) from baseline at week 24 (PRIME) or week 12 (PRIME2). Key secondary endpoints included nodule number reduction to ≤ 5 at week 24. PRIME and PRIME2 enrolled 151 and 160 patients, respectively. Both trials met all the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints. A ≥ 4-point WI-NRS reduction at week 24 in the dupilumab and placebo arms was achieved by 60.0% and 18.4% of patients, respectively, in PRIME (95% confidence interval (CI), 27.8–57.7 for the difference, P < 0.001) and at week 12 by 37.2% and 22.0% of patients, respectively, in PRIME2 (95% CI, 2.3–31.2; P = 0.022). Dupilumab demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in itch and skin lesions versus placebo in PN. Safety was consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^dff0bfc7]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 was published by Gil Yosipovitch and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prurigo nodularis and Pruritus. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis? In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the population was: 160 patients (103 female, 57 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with prurigo nodularis with ≥ 20 nodules and severe itch uncontrolled with topical therapies. The key exclusion criteria were prurigo nodularis secondary to medications or medical conditions; severe renal conditions; uncontrolled thyroid disease; active tuberculosis or NTM infection. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the interventions were: n = 78 dupilumab (at a dose of 300 mg SC every 2 weeks for 24 weeks) n = 82 placebo (matching placebo SC every 2 weeks for 24 weeks). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 12 (37.2% vs. 22%; AD 16.8%, 95% CI 2.3 to 31.2). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis-Stage score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (44.9% vs. 15.9%; AD 30.8%, 95% CI 16.4 to 45.2) Significant increase in reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 24 (57.7% vs. 19.5%; AD 42.6%, 95% CI 29.1 to 56.1) Significant increase in concomitant reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4 points and Investigator's Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis-Stage score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (32.1% vs. 8.5%; AD 25.5%, 95% CI 13.1 to 37.9). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with prurigo nodularis with ≥ 20 nodules and severe itch uncontrolled with topical therapies, dupilumab was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 12.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with prurigo nodularis with or without atopic comorbidities: a subgroup analysis from two randomized phase III clinical trials [^21ab32a5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic papulonodular lesions. Patients with PN frequently experience comorbid atopic conditions. Dupilumab is the first approved therapy for PN, but the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with PN with or without atopic comorbidities has not been investigated.

Objective

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with PN with or without a history of atopic comorbidities.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 24-week, phase III trials LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2 were conducted independently in 16 countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Patients were randomized 1:1 to dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched placebo. In this pre-specified subgroup analysis of pooled data, adults with moderate-to-severe PN, inadequately controlled by topical prescription therapies, were stratified according to the presence or absence of atopic comorbidity history. Investigators assessed itch (Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale), skin lesions (Investigator's Global Assessment for PN Stage), and patient-reported quality of life (evaluated using the Dermatology Life Quality Index, Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and a Sleep Numeric Rating Scale).

Results

Three hundred and eleven patients were randomized to dupilumab (N = 153; atopic/non-atopic n = 67/86) or placebo (N = 158; atopic/non-atopic n = 68/90). At week 24 in both the atopic and non-atopic subgroups, significantly more patients achieved clinically meaningful improvements with dupilumab treatment compared with placebo in itch (atopic: 58.2% vs 20.6%; P < 0.0001; non-atopic: 59.3% vs 17.8%; P < 0.0001), clear/almost clear skin (atopic: 52.2% vs 16.2%; P < 0.0001; non-atopic: 41.9% vs 17.8%; P = 0.0005), and concomitant itch and skin lesion improvements (atopic: 37.3% vs 7.4%; P = 0.0057; non-atopic 33.7% vs 10.0%; P = 0.007). Patients showed significant improvements in skin pain, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and sleep, with dupilumab treatment compared with placebo, regardless of atopic history. Safety was generally consistent with the known dupilumab safety profile.

Conclusions

Dupilumab significantly improved disease signs, symptoms, and health-related quality of life with similar onset time and response magnitude compared with placebo in adult patients with PN, irrespective of the presence or absence of atopic comorbidities.

Methods

Study design

PRIME and PRIME2 were phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, 24-week trials designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with PN inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies. Patients were enrolled in 16 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia, from 12 December 2019 to 3 February 2022 (PRIME) and 16 January 2020 to 22 November 2021 (PRIME2). Each study had a 2–4-week screening period, followed by a 24-week intervention period and a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period (Extended Data Fig. 1).

The PRIME and PRIME2 protocols were developed by the sponsors, Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (redacted protocols are provided in Supplementary Data 1). Data were collected by the investigators and analyzed by the sponsors. The studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guideline and applicable regulatory requirements. The local institutional review board/ethics committee at each study center oversaw trial conduct and documentation (institutional review board from 7 February 2020; Supplementary Data 2; the complete list of investigators is provided in the Supplementary Information). All patients provided written informed consent before participating in the trial.

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^d7e0a7f2]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

PN represents a substantial therapeutic challenge, and inadequate disease control is common in this population. Although topical treatments, UV light therapy, immunosuppressive agents and systemic neuromodulators are frequently prescribed, these therapies are limited by insufficient evidence for efficacy and/or associated side effects. Recently, dupilumab was approved as the first systemic therapy indicated in PN.

Case reports have shown successful treatment with dupilumab in PN –. Dupilumab, a fully human VelocImmune-derived monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component (IL-4Rα) for interleukin (IL)−4 and IL-13, thus inhibiting signaling of these central drivers of type 2 inflammation.

In two parallel phase 3 trials of similar design, LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2, we assessed the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with PN that was inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies (Extended Data Fig. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg or matching placebo every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Patients on a stable regimen of low-to-moderate potency topical corticosteroids (TCSs) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) before screening were allowed to continue their use throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a ≥ 4-point reduction in Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) score (range 0 ('no itch') to 10 ('worst imaginable itch')) at week 24 (PRIME) or week 12 (PRIME2). WI-NRS is validated in PN, with research to date supporting a four-point reduction as clinically meaningful –. Key secondary endpoints in both trials included proportion of patients with reduction in skin lesion number to an Investigator Global Assessment for PN-Stage (IGA PN-S) score of 0 or 1 at week 24. IGA PN-S is also validated in PN, with scores ranging from 0 to 4 (0, 'clear' (no nodules); 1, 'almost clear' (≤ 5 nodules); 2, 'mild' (6–19 nodules); 3, 'moderate' (20–99 nodules); 4, 'severe' (≥ 100 nodules)). Other pre-specified secondary and tertiary endpoints included assessment of QoL, skin pain, sleep and mental health.

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^a321d848]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous use of topical and, in over 60% of patients, systemic therapies, the patients enrolled in PRIME and PRIME2 had a high disease burden at baseline, with severe itch and skin lesions impacting sleep, QoL and mental health. All primary and key secondary endpoints addressing itch and number of skin lesions were met in both trials. Non-multiplicity-controlled significant itch improvement started as early as week 3 or 4, with progressively larger treatment differences from placebo throughout the 24-week treatment period. From an initial baseline of 20 to > 100 nodules, 32.0% (PRIME) and 25.6% (PRIME2) of dupilumab-treated patients showed a reduction to ≤ 5 nodules, corresponding to a response of 'clear' or 'almost clear' skin at week 12, compared to 11.8% and 12.2% of placebo-treated patients; the treatment effect on skin lesions continued to improve after week 12, with 48.0% (PRIME) and 44.9% (PRIME2) of patients achieving ≤ 5 nodules at week 24 with dupilumab versus 18.4% and 15.9%, respectively, with placebo. Approximately one-third of dupilumab-treated patients met the composite pruritus and skin lesion endpoint at the end of treatment. Dupilumab treatment also led to fewer patients using rescue medication compared to placebo in both trials.

Improvements in skin pain mirrored those in itch throughout both trials, with non-multiplicity-controlled significant improvement starting at week 3 and week 4 in PRIME and PRIME2, respectively. Dupilumab-treated patients experienced non-multiplicity-controlled significant improvement in DLQI from week 4 and, by the end of the treatment, achieved mean DLQI scores at the threshold between 'small' and 'moderate' impact on life in both trials, whereas the 'very large' impact of PN on QoL at baseline was maintained in placebo groups to week 24. Improvements (non-multiplicity-controlled significance in PRIME2) were also seen for HADS anxiety and depression.

The safety profile of dupilumab observed in PN was consistent with its known safety profile –. TEAEs most frequently reported with dupilumab versus placebo were conjunctivitis and herpes viral infection, none of which was serious/severe or led to treatment discontinuation. In contrast, non-herpetic skin infections occurred more often in placebo-treated patients.

### FDA approves first treatment for prurigo nodularis… [^36fb21ab]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Action FDA has approved Dupixent injection for the treatment of adults with prurigo nodularis. This is the first FDA-approved treatment for PN. Dupixent is FDA-approved for multiple indications, including treatment of atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupixent comes as a single-dose pre-filled syringe with needle shield or as a pre-filled pen and is given as an injection under the skin. The patient's health care provider determines the treatment duration for Dupixent to treat PN. Disease or Condition PN is a rare skin disease that causes hard, itchy lumps to form on the skin. The itching can be intense, causing people to scratch themselves to the point of bleeding or pain. Scratching can also cause more skin lesions to appear. The disease affects approximately 87, 000 adults per year according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases database.

Effectiveness Safety and effectiveness of Dupixent to treat PN among adults were evaluated in two clinical trials, EFC16459 and EFC16460. Each trial evaluated 300 mg of Dupixent administered every 2 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg. The treatment lasted for 24 weeks. Effictiveness was mainly assessed by the proportion of subjects whose itchy skin improved by more than four points on the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale, the proportion of subjects who achieved score of 0 or 1 on Investigator's Global Assessment PN-stage scale, and the proportion of subjects who achieved a response on both scales at week 24. In the trials for the PN indication, the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints were considered significant when compared to placebo.

Safety Information The most common side effects of Dupixent include injection site reactions, herpes simplex virus infections, common cold, muscle pain, diarrhea, and throat pain. Dupixent can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions, eye problems, inflammation of blood vessels, and joint aches and pain. It is not known if Dupixent is safe and effective in children with PN under 18 years of age. See full prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Dupixent. Designation Dupixent received priority review for this indication.

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^3dcaed50]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study LIBERTY-PN PRIME was published by Gil Yosipovitch and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Nat Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prurigo nodularis and Pruritus. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the trial question was: what is the role of dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis? In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the population was: 151 patients (100 female, 51 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with prurigo nodularis with ≥ 20 nodules and severe itch uncontrolled with topical therapies. The key exclusion criteria were prurigo nodularis secondary to medications or medical conditions; severe renal conditions; uncontrolled thyroid disease; active tuberculosis or NTM infection. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the interventions were: n = 75 dupilumab (at a dose of 300 mg SC every 2 weeks for 24 weeks) n = 76 placebo (matching placebo SC every 2 weeks for 24 weeks). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 24 (60% vs. 18.4%; AD 42.7%, 95% CI 27.8 to 57.7). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis-Stage score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (48% vs. 18.4%; AD 28.3%, 95% CI 13.4 to 43.2) Significant increase in reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 12 (44% vs. 15.8%; AD 29.2%, 95% CI 14.5 to 43.8) Significant increase in concomitant reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4 points and Investigator's Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis-Stage score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (38.7% vs. 9.2%; AD 29.6%, 95% CI 16.4 to 42.8). In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent serious adverse events. In the LIBERTY-PN PRIME study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with prurigo nodularis with ≥ 20 nodules and severe itch uncontrolled with topical therapies, dupilumab was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in Worst Itch NRS by ≥ 4-point at week 24.

Dupilumab was investigated in 151 and 160 adult patients, respectively, in the two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials LIBERTY-PN PRIME and PRIME2. The patients received dupilumab 300 mg (loading dose 600 mg) subcutaneously (SC) or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 24 weeks and were allowed to continue stable therapies with low-to-moderate potency TCS or TCI during the trial. In the dupilumab arm, 37.2% of patients at week 12 (PRIME2) and 60.0% of patients at week 24 (PRIME) reached the primary endpoint of an improvement of Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS) ≥ 4 points (PRIME2 placebo arm: 22.0% of patients; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, 2.3–31.2; p = 0.022; PRIME placebo arm: 18.4% of patients; 95% CI for the difference, 27.8–57.7; p < 0.001).

Dupilumab was also significantly superior to placebo regarding the improvement of skin lesions as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment for PN–Stage (IGA PN-S). A score of 0 ('clear') or 1 ('almost clear') was achieved by 48%/44.9% (PRIME/PRIME2) of patients at week 24 (placebo: 18.4%/15.9%; 95% CI for the difference, PRIME: 13.4–43.2; p < 0.001; PRIME2: 16.4–45.2; p < 0.001) as well as by 32.0%/25.6% of patients at week 12 (placebo: 11.8%/12.2%; 95% CI for the difference, PRIME: 7.8–34.0; p = 0.003; PRIME 2: 2.6–27.0; p = 0.019). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) comprised conjunctivitis (PRIME/PRIME2: 2.7%/3.9% of patients) and herpes viral infections (PRIME2: 5.2% of patients). Skin infections (herpes infections excluded) occurred more often in placebo-treated patients. Figure 2 demonstrates a CNPG patient who was successfully treated with dupilumab.

Secondary endpoints addressing skin lesions

Significantly more dupilumab-treated patients achieved an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 ('clear' or 'almost clear', ≤ 5 nodules) in each trial at week 24: PRIME, 48.0% versus 18.4% (95% CI for the difference, 13.4–43.2; P < 0.001); PRIME2, 44.9% versus 15.9% (95% CI for the difference, 16.4–45.2; P < 0.001). At week 12, this endpoint was achieved by 32.0% versus 11.8% of patients in PRIME (95% CI for the difference, 7.8–34.0; non-multiplicity-controlled P = 0.003) and 25.6% versus 12.2% in PRIME2 (95% CI for the difference, 2.6–27.0; P = 0.019) (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3 for proportions of patients achieving IGA 0/1 over time and Supplementary Table 5 for a summary of missing data). Significantly more patients achieved the composite endpoint (key secondary endpoint in both trials) of a concomitant ≥ 4-point reduction in WI-NRS from baseline and an IGA PN-S score of 0 or 1 at week 24 in the dupilumab group (29 (38.7%) and 25 (32.1%) in PRIME and PRIME 2, respectively) compared to seven patients in each placebo group (9.2% and 8.5%, 95% CI, 16.4–42.8 and 13.1–37.9 for the difference, respectively; P < 0.001 for both comparisons), demonstrating efficacy on pruritus and skin lesions within the same patient (Fig. 2c).

Supplementary (as-observed and hybrid method) analyses results for primary and key secondary endpoints in both trials were consistent with the primary analysis, confirming the robustness of results (Extended Data Table 2).

Efficacy analyses

A study-level multiplicity procedure was used to control for the overall type I error rate for testing primary, key secondary and selected other endpoints (Methods and Extended Data Table 1). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant if the endpoint was included in the testing hierarchy.

Primary endpoint

The primary endpoint in both trials addressed clinically meaningful itch improvement. A weekly WI-NRS score was calculated as the average of daily non-missing scores within the week window of each trial week. The trials were originally designed similarly, with week 12 as the timing for the primary endpoint. However, results from PRIME2, which preceded PRIME, showed continued improvement of itch after week 12. To represent more precisely the effect of the treatment on itch and to harmonize the assessment of the itch and lesion endpoint evaluations, a protocol amendment was submitted and approved while the PRIME study was ongoing to change the timing for the primary endpoint to week 24.

Significantly more dupilumab-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint of a ≥ 4-point reduction in WI-NRS compared to placebo-treated patients in both trials: 45/75 (60.0%) versus 14/76 (18.4%) at week 24 in PRIME (95% confidence interval (CI), 27.8–57.7 for the difference; P < 0.001); 29/78 (37.2%) versus 18/82 (22.0%) at week 12 in PRIME2 (95% CI, 2.3–31.2 for the difference; P = 0.022) (Table 2, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). Patients with missing data (PRIME, week 24: 1 (1.3%) in the dupilumab group and 16 (21.1%) in the placebo group; PRIME2, week 12: 2 (2.6%) and 6 (7.3%), respectively) were considered non-responders due to missing data (see Supplementary Table 5 for a summary of missing data).

Use of rescue medication

Fewer dupilumab-treated patients required rescue medication compared to those given placebo during the 24-week studies (PRIME, 6.7% versus 21.1%; PRIME2, 7.7% versus 24.4%; non-multiplicity-controlled P versus placebo = 0.004 in both trials) (Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 5).

Results for additional efficacy endpoints are summarized in Extended Data Table 5.

This manuscript reports on all the multiplicity-controlled and pre-specified supportive endpoints included in the PRIME and PRIME2 trials. Additional pre-specified secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints not reported in this manuscript are listed in the Methods section and will be reported in subsequent publications.

Safety outcomes

In both trials, dupilumab was well tolerated and had an overall safety profile consistent with its known profile (Table 3 and Supplementary Tables 6–8). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in five (6.7%) and six (8.0%) patients in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively, in PRIME, and two (2.6%) and two (2.4%), respectively, in PRIME2. Except for two events of mesenteritis and sepsis experienced by one patient in the placebo group in PRIME, none were considered related to the study intervention. Two placebo-treated patients (2.7%) in PRIME and one placebo-treated patient (1.2%) in PRIME2 discontinued treatment due to a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); no dupilumab-treated patients discontinued treatment. Conjunctivitis occurred equally in the dupilumab and placebo groups in PRIME (two (2.7%) in each) and was more frequent with dupilumab in PRIME2 (three (3.9%) versus zero). None were serious or severe, and none led to study drug discontinuation. Herpes viral infections were also more common with dupilumab in PRIME2: four (5.2%) versus zero, whereas no herpes infections occurred in either group in PRIME. Skin infections occurred less in dupilumab-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in both trials: PRIME, two (2.7%) versus seven (9.3%); PRIME2, four (5.2%) versus five (6.1%).

Discussion

Management of PN is challenging, particularly for patients with moderate or severe PN for whom topical therapies are, in many cases, insufficient to control the disease –. Other treatments currently used for PN also have limitations, including unsatisfactory effectiveness and associated side effects and toxicities. In PRIME and PRIME2, dupilumab compared to placebo significantly improved multiple measures of signs and symptoms as well as health-related QoL in patients with PN. These data represent the first replicate positive results from two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled global trials.

Given the seminal role of pruritus and resultant scratching in the patient experience with PN, as exemplified by the 'butterfly sign' where there is an absence of lesions in regions of the body that the patient cannot easily reach, this was chosen as the primary endpoint for the trial. The 24-week treatment period was considered an appropriate duration to observe dupilumab's effect in PN to ensure an adequate evaluation of PN lesions based on the observation that dupilumab has shown clinical efficacy and biomarker data, including thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and eotaxin-3, plateauing before week 24 in all phase 3 clinical trials across all dupilumab indications.

History of systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy, including any excipients
Any other medical or psychological condition, including relevant laboratory abnormalities at screening, that, in the opinion of the investigator, suggested a new and/or insufficiently understood disease, may have presented an unreasonable risk to the study patient as a result of his/her participation in this clinical trial, may have made the patient's participation unreliable or may have interfered with study assessments. The specific justification for patients excluded under this criterion was to be noted in study documents (chart notes and eCRF).

Initiation of treatment with TCS/TCI (any potency) during the screening period or treatment with high-potency or super-potent TCS/TCI during the screening period
For patients who were on a stable regimen of TCS/TCI (maintain same medicine, same dose from 2 weeks before screening visit) at the screening visit: Application of TCS/TCI on fewer than 6 days during the 7 days immediately preceding randomization Application of TCS/TCI of incorrect potency within 7 days before day 1 (correct application was low potency if on low potency at screening visit and medium potency if on medium or higher potency at screening visit)
Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 4 weeks before the screening visit For patients who had vaccination with live, attenuated vaccines planned during the study (based on national vaccination schedule/local guidelines), it was determined, after consultation with a physician, whether the administration of vaccine could be postponed until after the end of study or preponed to before the start of the study, without compromising the health of the patient.

Statistical analysis

A sample size of 150 patients for PRIME and PRIME2 each was estimated to provide 90% power to detect a 28% difference in the primary endpoint between dupilumab and placebo with a Fisher exact test at a two-sided alpha of 0.05, assuming response rates of 39% and 11%, respectively. Efficacy analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomized patients analyzed according to the intervention group allocated by randomization regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not. Safety analyses were performed on all patients randomly assigned to study intervention and who received at least one dose of study intervention. Patients were analyzed according to the intervention they received.

A study-level multiplicity procedure was used to control for the overall type I error rate for testing primary, key secondary and selected other endpoints (Extended Data Table 1). Efficacy endpoints that measured binary responses were analyzed using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusted by stratification factors and baseline antidepressant use. Patients with missing data at the timepoint or who used rescue/prohibited medications/procedures before the timepoint were considered non-responders. Data collected after discontinuation were included in the analysis. Continuous efficacy endpoints were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with intervention group, stratification factors, baseline antidepressant use and relevant baseline measurement as covariates. Data from patients who used rescue/prohibited medications/procedures were set to 'missing' after medication use, and the endpoint value was imputed by the worst post-baseline value available before medication use. For participants who discontinued due to lack of efficacy, a worst-observation carried forward (WOCF) approach was used to impute missing data if needed. For participants who discontinued due to other reasons or any other type of missing data, a multiple imputation (MI) approach was used to impute missing data. All data collected after treatment discontinuation were used in the analysis. Safety analyses were descriptive. All analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4.

14.5	Prurigo Nodularis

The efficacy of DUPIXENT in adults with prurigo nodularis (PN) was evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group trials (PRIME (NCT04183335) and PRIME 2 (NCT04202679)). These trials enrolled 311 adult subjects with pruritus (WI-NRS ≥ 7 on a scale of 0 to 10) and greater than or equal to 20 nodular lesions. PRIME and PRIME 2 assessed the effect of DUPIXENT on pruritus improvement as well as its effect on PN lesions.

In these two trials, subjects received either subcutaneous DUPIXENT 600 mg (two 300 mg injections) on day 1, followed by 300 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 24 weeks, or matching placebo.

In these trials, the mean age was 49.5 years, the median weight was 71 kg, 65% of subjects were female, 57% were White, 6% were Black, and 34% were Asian. At baseline, the mean Worst Itch-Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) was 8.5, 66% had 20 to 100 nodules (moderate), and 34% had greater than 100 nodules (severe). Eleven percent (11%) of subjects were taking stable doses of antidepressants at baseline and were instructed to continue taking these medications during the trial. Forty-three percent (43%) had a history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy).

### Worst itch numeric rating scale for prurigo nodularis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^0e0e1cac]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a debilitating skin disease characterized by the hallmark symptom of chronic itch; the intensity of itch in PN was assessed using the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) to evaluate the primary efficacy end point of 2 recent phase 3 studies of dupilumab treatment for PN.

Objective

To validate the psychometric properties and to determine the clinically meaningful improvement threshold for WI-NRS in patients with moderate to severe PN.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this secondary analysis of the PRIME and PRIME2 trials, content validity of WI-NRS was assessed through in-depth patient interviews. Psychometric assessments used pooled data from masked, intention-to-treat (ITT) patients with PN from randomized, double-masked, and placebo-controlled studies. Psychometric assessments included test-retest reliability, construct validity, known-groups validity, and sensitivity to change in adult patients with moderate-to-severe PN. Thresholds for meaningful within-patient improvement in the WI-NRS score were determined using anchor and distribution-based approaches. Data were analyzed after completion of each study, December 2019 to November 2021 for PRIME and January 2020 to August 2021 for PRIME2.

Exposures

Dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks for 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

WI-NRS score at specified time points up to 24 weeks after randomization.

Results

A total of 20 patients were included across the 2 studies (mean [SD] age, 49.3 [17.2] years; 11 female [55%]); 311 patients were included in the pooled intention-to-treat analysis (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [16.1] years; 203 female [65.3%]). The WI-NRS questions (20 of 20 patients), recall period (19 of 20 patients), and response scale (20 of 20 patients) were easy to understand and relevant for patients with PN. Adequate test-retest reliability was observed between screening and baseline (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.72, using Patient Global Impression of Severity [PGIS] to define stable patients). Convergent and discriminant validity was supported by moderate to strong correlations (absolute r range = 0.34–0.73) with other conceptually related measures and weaker correlations (absolute r range = 0.06–0.32) with less-related measures, respectively. WI-NRS was sensitive to change, as demonstrated by differences in change from baseline among groups (per PGIS change and PGI of Change [PGIC]). Using anchor-based approach with PGIS and PGIC, the clinically meaningful improvement threshold was 4 points (range, 3.0–4.5), which was also supported by distribution-based methods.

Conclusion and Relevance

This study found that WI-NRS may be a fit-for-purpose instrument to support efficacy end points measuring the intensity of itching in adults with PN.

Trial Registration

NCT04183335 (PRIME) and NCT04202679 (PRIME2).

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^64dc6138]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Dupilumab specifically targets the IL-4/IL-13 cytokine axis and has not been associated with systemic immunosuppression, as suggested by the lower incidence of non-herpetic skin infections and absence of systemic infections in the dupilumab groups compared to placebo.

In our studies, improvements in WI-NRS, Skin Pain NRS and DLQI increased progressively over 24 weeks of treatment without plateauing, indicating that further treatment could lead to continued improvements. The relatively short duration of treatment in this study for this chronic disease precluded assessment of efficacy maintenance beyond 24 weeks. Also, of the atopic population enrolled, mild, active AD was capped at 10%, limiting the strength of statistical analysis for this subpopulation. Lastly, although patients had high compliance with the daily diary, with over 90% at week 12 and 85% at week 24 completing the majority of the days for both studies (Supplementary Table 4), missing data from a patient-reported outcome are acknowledged as a potential weakness.

In conclusion, dupilumab treatment in PRIME and PRIME2 led to significant improvements in multiple aspects of PN in patients with disease inadequately controlled with topical therapies, with a safety profile consistent with its known safety profile. These positive studies support the involvement of type 2 cytokines in driving PN disease pathogenesis and the targeting of the IL-4/IL-13 axis as a novel therapeutic paradigm for patients with PN.

Efficacy outcomes

Unless otherwise indicated, efficacy analyses were performed in the full analysis set, which included all patients who underwent randomization. The primary and secondary endpoints were tested with a hierarchical testing procedure in a pre-specified order, and inferential conclusions about successive endpoints required statistical significance of the previous endpoint at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. For endpoints that measured binary responses, P values were derived by a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. The difference versus placebo is the response rate difference derived from the Mantel–Haenszel estimator. For continuous efficacy endpoints, P values and difference versus placebo were derived by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. For the endpoint of rescue medication, the difference versus placebo is based on the time to first use of rescue medication and was calculated as hazard ratio of dupilumab versus placebo; P values were derived from the Cox proportional hazard model.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^26aa2952]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The WI-NRS is comprised of a single item, rated on a scale from 0 ("no itch") to 10 ("worst imaginable itch"). Subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their worst pruritus (itch) over the past 24 hours using this scale. The Investigator's Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis-Stage (IGA PN-S) is a scale that measures the approximate number of nodules using a 5-point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).

Efficacy was assessed with the proportion of subjects with improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥ 4 points, the proportion of subjects with IGA PN-S 0 or 1 (the equivalent of 0–5 nodules), and the proportion of subjects who achieved a response in both WI-NRS and IGA PN-S per the criteria described above.

The efficacy results for PRIME and PRIME2 are presented in Table 31 and Figures 14, 15, and 16.

Psychometric Measurement Properties of WI-NRS

Psychometric properties of WI-NRS were evaluated in accordance with the regulatory guidance, and best practices in the field. Psychometric analyses were performed using the pooled data from masked, intention-to-treat (ITT) patients with PN from PRIME and PRIME2 studies. Both studies were randomized, double-masked and placebo-controlled, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab over a 24-week treatment period in adult patients with PN. Eligible patients were those with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of PN with an average worst itch score of 7 or higher on the WI-NRS in the 7 days prior to baseline and those with at least 20 PN lesions on both legs, both arms, and/or trunk at screening visit and baseline. The primary end point of these studies was the percentage of patients with improvement (ie, reduction) in WI-NRS score from baseline to week 12 (PRIME) and week 24 (PRIME2) of 4 points or higher. For all time points and analyses, a weekly average WI-NRS score was defined as the average score over a 7-day period (a minimum of 4 daily scores out of the 7 days was required to calculate the baseline average score).

The psychometric evaluation of the WI-NRS included assessment of test-retest reliability, construct validity, known-groups validity, and responsiveness or sensitivity to change in other disease outcomes. Several clinician-reported outcome (CRO) and PRO measures were used to support this analysis (eTable 1 in Supplement 3).

Test-Retest Reliability

Test-retest reliability of the WI-NRS was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in patients with stable PN, defined as patients reporting no change on (1) the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) from baseline to week 4, (2) the PGIS from week 8 to week 12, and (3) the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at week 4 (note the PGIC measures change since starting the study medication). An ICC of 0.70 or higher indicated adequate test-retest reliability.

Sensitivity and supplementary analysis

For the primary estimand for the primary endpoint, and for the key secondary endpoints, sensitivity/supplementary analyses were performed in both PRIME and PRIME2.

As-observed analysis (included all data after taking selected prohibited and/or rescue medications)

Data collected after taking all prohibited medications and/or rescue medications were included in the supplementary analysis to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results with respect to the method of handling data while taking selected prohibited/rescue medications (for example, treatment policy strategy). In addition, for patients discontinuing the study treatment before week 12 (or 24), their off-study treatment values measured up to week 12 (or 24) were included in the analysis. The patients having missing data at week 12 (or 24) regardless of reason(s) were considered non-responders at that timepoint (Extended Data Table 2).

Hybrid method analysis (WOCF and MI)

In the primary analysis of change from baseline in WI-NRS (continuous variable) at week 12 (or 24), the hybrid method of the WOCF and MI was used. Similar to the continuous variable, the same imputation method was used in the analysis of the proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥ 4 from baseline to week 12 (or 24), which is consistent for the intercurrent event strategy and missing data handling in the binary variables and continuous variable. That is, after the imputation of continuous WI-NRS data at week 12 (or 24) using the hybrid method of the WOCF and MI, responders were defined as patients with improvement in WI-NRS by ≥ 4 from baseline to week 12 (or 24) in each of the imputed datasets with about 40 imputations, and then the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test adjusted by documented history of atopy (atopic or non-atopic), stable use of TCS/TCI (yes or no), region and baseline antidepressant use (yes or no) was used. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data was combined using Rubin's rule (Extended Data Table 2).

Rescue treatments

If medically necessary (that is, to control intolerable PN symptoms), rescue treatment for PN was provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator. Although the use of rescue medications was allowed at any time during the study, the use of such medications was delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after the initiation of the investigational treatment. The date and time of rescue medication administration, as well as the name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication, was recorded in the eCRF. For the efficacy responder analysis, a pre-specified algorithm was used to classify rescue. In addition, a blinded review of all post-baseline medications, based on medical judgment, was performed to adjudicate rescue treatment. Patients who received rescue treatment as per this adjudication during the study were considered as having treatment failure.

Dermatological preparations of high-potency or super-potent TCS and TCI could be used as rescue medications.

Randomization

Randomization was performed centrally using a permuted block randomization schedule via interactive voice response system/interactive web response system and was stratified by documented history of atopy (atopic or non-atopic), stable use of TCS/TCI (yes or no) and country/territory code. Atopy was defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma or food allergy. Atopic and non-atopic PN populations were to be capped at 60% of the total enrolled population. Of the atopic population enrolled, mild, active AD was capped at 10%.

Endpoints

Instruments used to measure efficacy endpoints are described in Supplementary Table 2. The original primary endpoint in both trials was improvement (reduction) in WI-NRS by ≥ 4 points from baseline to week 12. Results from PRIME2, which preceded PRIME, showed that the effect of dupilumab over time continually improved after week 12 across all endpoints, with a similar timecourse of improvement in both itch and lesion endpoints through week 24. Based on these data, before the PRIME database lock, the timing for the primary efficacy endpoint in PRIME was moved from week 12 to week 24 in the protocol amendment 03 (Supplementary Data 1) to represent the overall treatment effect more accurately and to synchronize the primary itch assessment with the primary lesion assessment.

Prurigo Nodularis

A total of 309 adult subjects with prurigo nodularis (PN) were evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (PRIME and PRIME2) [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. The safety pool included data from the 24-week treatment and 12-week follow-up periods from both trials.

The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 3% of the placebo group and 0% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group.

Subjects with co-morbid conditions included 43% of subjects with a history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhino conjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy), 8% of subjects with a history of hypothyroidism and 9% of subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2.

Table 11 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in PRIME and PRIME2.

### Prurigo nodularis in 2025: current and emerging treatments [^0aec40e5]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory dermatologic condition that is often incredibly itchy and imposes a debilitating burden on patient quality of life. Patients have historically faced the hurdles of limited knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying PN, physician awareness, and effective therapies. Many of the conventional treatments offer minimal benefit or are accompanied by adverse effects. Over the last several years, striking advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis contributing to PN have allowed for the development of novel treatments. The first and only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is dupilumab, a biological agent targeting interleukins 4 and 13, has revolutionized management for patients with moderate-to-severe PN. Several other drugs are on the horizon that have the potential to become widely available. This contribution aims to review the current and emerging therapies for PN and address the challenges that may hinder effective treatment.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: management of prurigo nodularis [^2671833f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intense pruritus and nodular lesions associated with reduced quality of life. Until recently, no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies have been available for the management of PN. Treatment regimens have been highly variable and clinical management guidelines are lacking overall; formal treatment guidelines do not exist within the US. In 2022, dupilumab became the first FDA-approved medication for PN. Multiple novel agents that target the neuroimmune underpinnings of the disease are currently in development and show promise for this challenging disorder.

Objective

To review current treatments and emerging therapies for effective management of patients with PN.

Methods

We reviewed publications on PN management identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We also included publicly available data on clinical trials for PN therapies reported on the US National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Database, and the European Clinical Trials (EudraCT) Database.

Results

The recommended management of PN begins with an assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity, and evaluation of comorbid medical disorders. Treatment goals include resolution of itch, improvement in nodules or cutaneous lesions, and improvement in quality of life. Therapies should be selected based on a patient&rsquo; s clinical presentation and comorbidities. Treatment should simultaneously address the neural and immunologic components of PN. Combination therapy, particularly with conventional agents, may be beneficial.

Limitations

Data on most conventional PN treatments are limited to anecdotal reports, small clinical trials, or expert consensus recommendations. No head-to-head comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of conventional and/or emerging agents, or combination therapy.

Conclusion

An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should reduce pruritus, allow nodular lesions to heal, and improve individual quality of life. The treatment landscape for PN is rapidly evolving with one FDA-approved agent and several new promising therapies on the horizon. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22:12(Suppl 2):s15-22.

Introduction

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic condition that reduces quality of life. PN may exist in 50% of cases as an overlap syndrome with atopic dermatitis (AD), although its etiology has not been clearly established. Because of a paucity of data and randomized controlled trials, treatment of PN is challenging. Consequently, patients often endure multiple unsuccessful therapeutic trials. We report on 2 patients with PN who did not respond to a variety of treatments and subsequently achieved clearance of lesions with dupilumab.

4 Discussion

This is the largest multicenter real‐world study to demonstrate the clinical use of dupilumab for PN in China, suggesting the good effectiveness and safety of dupilumab in real‐world settings. Our study landscapes the actual practice of dupilumab in Chinese PN patients and provides evidence for clinical use and guideline recommendation.

Our results redemonstrate the heavy burden of PN. Despite previous topical and systemic therapies, especially high usage of off‐label drugs, the patients had a poor disease control and dissatisfaction for treatment at baseline, which reveals a huge unmet need for treatment of PN in China, indicating a strong need for effective therapy.

Our results confirmed the efficacy of dupilumab for PN in clinical trials. In our study, the PP‐NRS4 and IGA 0/1 at Week 12 showed a higher percentage than phase 3 clinical trials (PP‐NRS4: 84.9%, 44.0% and 37.2% in our study, PRIME and PRIME2, respectively; IGA 0/1: 37.0%, 32.0% and 25.6% in our study, PRIME and PRIME2, respectively). In phase 3 clinical trials, significant itch improvement started at Week 3 or 4, while we observed significant itch improvement as early as Week 2. The difference is possibly due to the longer disease duration, higher baseline PP‐NRS, and ethic difference in clinical trials.

When compared with real‐life data, improvements in itching and nodular lesions in our study mirrored previous single‐center studies. A study reported that 87.5% and 91.2% of patients achieved PP‐NRS4, as well as 28.4% and 39.6% of patients achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 12 and 16, respectively. Another study did not displayed the results at Week 12, while demonstrated 91.1% and 100% of the patients achieved PP‐NRS4, as well as 31.1% and 71.1% of the patients achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 8 and 16, respectively. These real‐world data showed better results than clinical trials.

The fast‐action on pruritus relieve can be explained by the direct block of IL‐4Rα on the nerve fibers. As the nodular lesions may be related to cutaneous fibrosis and a time‐consuming process, the regression of nodules also needs more time, in which dupilumab acts on IL‐4Rα on immune cells and fibroblasts.

### Historic perspectives of prurigo nodularis [^81470b0f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) manifests as a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by developing highly pruritic nodules. It is often accompanied by a variety of skin, metabolic, neurologic, and psychiatric comorbidities. A wealth of observational evidence indicates that PN disproportionately impacts non-White individuals, leading to a range of lasting, detrimental effects on patient quality of life and mental health. Despite its clinical significance, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PN remain elusive, contributing to the limited efficacy of existing therapeutics such as topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, and systemic treatments. A significant milestone was achieved when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Dupixent (dupilumab), a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody targeting IL-4 and IL-13, as the first and only treatment for PN in adults. Persistent pruritus and the appearance of lesions continue to severely disrupt daily activities, sleep quality, and psychologic well-being. W We review key historic developments and summarize pipeline therapies for this debilitating condition.

### Dupilumab treatment for prurigo nodularis and pruritis [^abd9a606]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a disease in which chronic scratching and picking of the skin due to intense pruritis results in papulonodules, notably in areas that are accessible to the patient. The pathophysiology is hypothesized to be mediated by a Th2 helper cell response, similar to that seen in atopic dermatitis, therefore, treatment of PN with dupilumab would be expected to elicit a therapeutic response. We demonstrated that treatment of PN with dupilumab significantly decreased pruritis and the size and number of new lesions after 2 months of treatment.

### Worst itch numeric rating scale for prurigo nodularis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^1ea3f3a1]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) an appropriate tool for quantifying the intensity of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis?

Findings

This secondary analysis of pooled data from the PRIME and PRIME2 clinical trials found that the WI-NRS was a valid and fit-for-purpose instrument to support the efficacy end points of clinical trials in patients with prurigo nodularis. WI-NRS demonstrated good evidence of validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change. The clinically meaningful within-patient improvement threshold was found to be 4 points.

Meaning

The WI-NRS may be a valid instrument for assessing pruritus in future clinical trials of prurigo nodularis.

### Dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: a 5-year open-label extension study [^5b427afa]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and sustained pruritus. Due to its chronic and recurrent nature, patients with moderate to severe AD usually require long-term treatment. However, many available AD treatments, including high-potency topical corticosteroids (TCSs), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), systemic corticosteroids (SCSs), systemic immunosuppressants, and UV therapy, are typically not recommended for long-term use due to concerns around safety or lack of efficacy data. Janus kinase inhibitors, which are also approved to treat moderate to severe AD, carry an increased risk of infections and cardiovascular events.

Dupilumab is a human VelocImmune-derived, (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc) monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by blocking a shared receptor component. Dupilumab is approved for the treatment of multiple type 2 inflammatory diseases, including AD, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, prurigo nodularis, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Previously, dupilumab treatment (with concomitant TCS) for up to 52 weeks was evaluated in adult patients with moderate to severe AD in the phase 3 placebo-controlled LIBERTY AD CHRONOS randomized clinical trialand in an interim analysis of dupilumab monotherapy for up to 4 years in the open-label extension study, the LIBERTY AD OLE study. These previous analyses demonstrated that dupilumab treatment for up to 4 years improved AD signs, symptoms, and quality of life, with acceptable safety in adults with moderate to severe AD. Here, we report the final, end-of-study 5-year safety and efficacy results from the LIBERTY AD OLE study.

### Effectiveness and safety of dupilumab for prurigo nodularis in China: a multicentric and observational study [^9ef31a22]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with refractory prurigo nodularis (PN) is well established in clinical trials, but there is a lack of multicenter data regarding its effectiveness and safety in real-world settings.

Methods

Patients with moderate-to-severe PN who initiated dupilumab treatment between July 2023 and January 2024, with a follow-up period of at least 16weeks at 10 hospitals in China were included. We used peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS), investigator global assessment (IGA) for PN, and dermatology life quality index for adults or children (DLQI/CDLQI) to assess disease control status and quality of life impairment, and monitored adverse events to assess the safety.

Results

A total of 73 PN patients (33 female, 40 male; mean age 45.9 ± 21.5years) were included. A clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 4 points in PP-NRS (PP-NRS4) was achieved in 84.9% of patients at Week 12. The percentage of patients achieving IGA 0/1 significantly increasing from 0% to 37.0% and 46.6% at Week 12 and 16, respectively. Patient-reported quality of life outcomes showed substantial improvement, with decreasing from 16.6 ± 6.8 at baseline to 7.2 ± 4.9 at Week 12, 6.4 ± 4.5 at Week 16. The safety profile of dupilumab was favorable, with one patient reporting dry eyes.

Conclusion

Dupilumab can effectively improve the pruritus, nodular lesions and quality of life for PN in real-world settings.

### Dupilumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials [^d1225fb9]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

More than 50% of patients enrolled did not have an atopic background, and only 4% had concomitant mild AD. Efficacy was consistent regardless of the assessed atopic or non-atopic status, although patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were not included in this study. These results support PN as a disease independent from AD. Thus, whether one has concomitant AD or not, the pathophysiology of PN may be highly conserved in terms of nodules yet distinct from AD lesions.

Concomitant TCS/TCI therapy was allowed especially because topical treatments are the standard of care in clinical practice, and patients who experienced severe disease could continue with the standard of care, but higher placebo responses were observed in patients who did not use concomitant TCS/TCI compared to those who did. Possible reasons include the fact that patients who continued TCS/TCI use during the trials in each group were those with more severe disease. It is, therefore, not unexpected that improvements should come more easily in patients who started with less severe disease at baseline.

Dupilumab, through its blockade of IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, may impact PN pathogenesis in multiple ways. Epithelial-derived cytokines are released in response to chronic scratching in PN, leading to upregulation of IL-4 and other type 2 cytokines in PN lesions that promote further inflammatory response –. Type 2 cytokines can also directly activate sensory neurons in the skin –, thus bridging the immune and neural dysregulation in PN. IL-4Rα is increased in PN lesions, and its activation sensitizes sensory neurons to the effects of other pruritogens, thereby amplifying the itch response. IL-13 plasma levels are also increased in patients with PN compared to healthy control patients. Treatment with dupilumab blocks this pathway, potentially breaking the pathologic itch–scratch cycle. Additionally, IL-4Rα is expressed on fibroblasts, and IL-4 and IL-13 have been implicated in promoting cutaneous fibrosis.

### Worst itch numeric rating scale for prurigo nodularis: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials [^558ed3d7]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

As per the anchor-based analysis, a 4-point improvement on the WI-NRS can be considered as a within-patient meaningful change in the patients with PN. These data support the primary end point used in PRIME and PRIME2 clinical studies. A 2022 studyreported a clinically meaningful threshold of 3.8-point improvement in WI-NRS in PN. Furthermore, an improvement threshold of 2.3 to 4.5 points, corresponding to a 30% to 60% improvement in WI-NRS scores was reported in a previous psychometric analysis in patients with PN. In a recent study, utilizing phase 2 clinical trial data (67 patients), the within-patient meaningful change threshold for peak pruritus NRS (PP-NRS) was reported to range from 2 to 5 points. The difference in the threshold range for PP-NRS and WI-NRS could be attributed to the difference in the terminologies used to define the instruments (itch "at its most intense" in the WI-NRS vs "at the worst moment" in the PP-NRS). Similar findings were also reported in other studies for NRS instruments measuring pruritus in PN.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. Data from clinical trials with stringent patient eligibility criteria were used for psychometric analyses. Therefore, patients may have experienced changes in condition, such as worsening, that may not have been fully captured. Furthermore, a few patients reported worsening in the WI-NRS scores; therefore, only the improvement threshold could be estimated. Using observational studies might provide a more accurate insight of the thresholds for meaningful within-patient worsening.

### Effectiveness and safety of dupilumab for prurigo nodularis in China: a multicentric and observational study [^107e510a]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with refractory prurigo nodularis (PN) is well established in clinical trials, but there is a lack of multicenter data regarding its effectiveness and safety in real‐world settings.

Methods

Patients with moderate‐to‐severe PN who initiated dupilumab treatment between July 2023 and January 2024, with a follow‐up period of at least 16 weeks at 10 hospitals in China were included. We used peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP‐NRS), investigator global assessment (IGA) for PN, and dermatology life quality index for adults or children (DLQI/CDLQI) to assess disease control status and quality of life impairment, and monitored adverse events to assess the safety.

Results

A total of 73 PN patients (33 female, 40 male; mean age 45.9 ± 21.5 years) were included. A clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 4 points in PP‐NRS (PP‐NRS4) was achieved in 84.9% of patients at Week 12. The percentage of patients achieving IGA 0/1 significantly increasing from 0% to 37.0% and 46.6% at Week 12 and 16, respectively. Patient‐reported quality of life outcomes showed substantial improvement, with decreasing from 16.6 ± 6.8 at baseline to 7.2 ± 4.9 at Week 12, 6.4 ± 4.5 at Week 16. The safety profile of dupilumab was favorable, with one patient reporting dry eyes.

Conclusion

Dupilumab can effectively improve the pruritus, nodular lesions and quality of life for PN in real‐world settings.

### Dupilumab for prurigo nodularis: case series and review of the literature [^8f33ae1f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab is a recombinant complete human monoclonal antibody modulating the signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathways and has been approved for the treatment of moderate/severe atopic dermatitis. Here, we present three cases of prurigo nodularis treated off-label with dupilumab, and a review of the existing literature. All patients in this study had longstanding severe disease and had tried multiple treatment modalities. They were treated with dupilumab at an initial dose of 600mg subcutaneously, followed by 300mg every 2weeks. Systematic literature searches were performed to identify literature describing the evaluation of the effect of treatment with dupilumab in prurigo nodularis. The physician's assessment of the patients revealed a good or excellent response to the treatment with dupilumab. Patients were evaluated after treatment for 4 and 7 months. Treatment was generally well-tolerated; one in three patients reported dry eyes. Four studies with a total of 11 patients (range: 1–4) were identified by the literature search. Complete response was noted in all 11 patients. Treatment with dupilumab appears to be safe and well-tolerated with clinical benefit in recalcitrant prurigo nodularis. Larger randomized and controlled trials using validated outcome measures are needed before dupilumab could be applied in clinical settings.

### Dupilumab improves clinical manifestations, symptoms, and quality of life in adult patients with chronic nodular prurigo [^d7f58f8a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is a multifactorial skin disease characterized by itchy papules and nodules, usually resistant to standard treatment and associated with markedly impaired quality of life.

Objective

To describe dupilumab effectiveness and tolerability in treating adult patients with CNPG refractory to both topical and systemic therapies.

Methods

Retrospective, multicenter study including adult patients affected by CNPG, who were treated with dupilumab for at least 16 weeks.

Results

Twenty-seven CNPG patients showed clinical improvement in terms of skin lesions, itch, sleeplessness, and quality of life. A consistent proportion of patients (24/27; 88.9%) had at least 16-week continuous treatment and achieved Investigator Global Assessment score 1 (11/24; 45.8%). An increased number of patients achieved at least a 2-grade reduction in Investigator Global Assessment score (19/24; 79.2%). Numeric rating scale values for itch and sleeplessness decreased from 8.9 to 2.7 and from 8.2 to 1.7, respectively (P < .001) after 16-week therapy. Ten patients achieved 36 weeks of continuous treatment while maintaining clinical efficacy.

Limitations

Major limitations included lack of validated assessment tools at the initial data collection, a limited cohort of treated patients, and a short-term observation period.

Conclusion

Dupilumab was proven effective in reducing itch and improving CNPG skin lesions.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Dupilumab for atopic dermatitis — context and patient values indicate that dupilumab is approved for several conditions often comorbid with AD and benefits could include treating prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis, asthma, and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps; patients value stepping-up therapy based on severity, safe medications, relief and normalization of daily activities, a strong patient–provider relationship, and treatments that are odorless, nonvisible, and do not interfere with daily activities, and patients/caregivers may value one systemic therapy that treats multiple comorbidities; dupilumab is generally available and acceptable in North America, though biologics require coordination for obtaining, insurance paperwork, temperature control, and administration, are often self-administered, and when administered by a health care professional there may be added time and cost considerations.

### Patient perspectives on living with severe prurigo nodularis [^73fa9fe2]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This qualitative study supports the importance and impacts of itching, sleep disturbance, and other symptoms of PN for QoL in people with this condition. Emotional impact was the most important impact of PN. These findings can be used to guide the selection of end points for assessing patient-relevant outcomes in clinical trials and should help capture treatment benefits that are important to patients with PN. These findings may also be useful for patient-centric decision-making in clinical practice. We plan to build on the present findings by developing a conceptual disease model integrating the qualitative insights we have gained and phase 3 trial data.

### Effectiveness and safety of dupilumab for prurigo nodularis in China: a multicentric and observational study [^6a7c33f9]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Controversial findings have been reported on the efficacy of dupilumab in atopic versus non‐atopic PN. A systematic review of 45 patients reported that atopic patients responded slower and required a longer treatment duration than non‐atopic patients, while Li et al. found that atopic PN demonstrated a faster reduction in nodule number and significant improvements in IGA and DLQI compared with non‐atopic PN. Consistent with the findings of clinical trials, our study revealed that atopic status did not affect effectiveness outcomes, which may support PN as an independent entity, with its own pathophysiology in the form of nodular lesions distinct from typical AD lesions. Whether atopy can serve as a predictor of effectiveness needs further investigation. The results support the IL‐4 and IL‐13 as crucial players in the pathogenesis of different subtypes of PN in Chinese populations, and the targeting of the IL‐4/IL‐13 axis as a therapeutic paradigm for not only immunologic aspect but also other shared aspects in atopic and non‐atopic PN individuals, such as neural or fibrosis aspects.

As the phase 3 clinical trials only included patients aged 18–80 years, the effectiveness of dupilumab in children and adolescent is worth exploring. In clinical practice, age is one of the important considerations for drug selection and medication patterns. The results of our age‐specific subgroup analysis revealed that dupilumab could be effective in pediatric PN patients as in adults and elderly patients, which provides reference for clinical use in the pediatric subgroup. However, the small sample size of pediatric PN patients may limit the robustness of results, and need further confirmation.

The study was featured by the multicenter sampling, multiple time‐points of observation, which helped us to decode the clinical practice of dupilumab in Chinese PN. However, there were some limitations. First, as a real‐world observational study, it was limited by the potential selection bias. Second, a possible placebo effect cannot be completely excluded. Third, the limited number of recorded laboratory results and the different reporting reference ranges in different centers hindered analysis of the laboratory results. There is no 'one fits all' therapy, so not all PN patients show an optimal response to dupilumab. Therefore, predictors of response and mechanisms of dupilumab in PN await extensive exploration in the future.

### Efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in patients with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis: the OLYMPIA 1 randomized clinical phase 3 trial [^6b9edb8c]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic and debilitating skin condition, characterized by intense itch with multiple nodular lesions. Nemolizumab demonstrated significant improvements in itch and skin nodules in adults with moderate to severe PN in a previous 16-week phase 3 study (OLYMPIA 2).

Objective

To assess the efficacy and occurrence of adverse events in adults with moderate to severe PN treated with nemolizumab vs those receiving placebo.

Design, Setting, and Participants

OLYMPIA 1 was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomized clinical trial, conducted from August 2020 to March 2023 at 77 centers across 10 countries in adults with moderate to severe PN (at least 20 nodules and an Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score ≥ 3) and Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) score of at least 7.0; consisted of screening (up to 4 weeks), 24-week treatment, and 8-week follow-up periods.

Interventions

Patients were randomized (2:1) to nemolizumab monotherapy, 30 mg or 60 mg (depending on baseline weight of less than 90 kg vs 90 kg or greater, respectively), or matching placebo administered every 4 weeks for 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end points were the proportion of patients with itch response (≥ 4-point improvement from baseline in weekly average PP-NRS) and IGA success (score of 0/1 [clear/almost clear] and 2-grade or more improvement from baseline) at week 16.

Results

Of 286 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.5 [13.0] years; mean [SD] body weight, 85.0 [20.7] kg; 166 [58.0%] female), 190 were randomized to receive nemolizumab, and 96 were randomized to placebo. A significantly greater proportion of patients assigned to nemolizumab vs placebo achieved itch response (111/190 [58.4%] vs 16/96 [16.7%]; Δ, 40.1% [95% CI, 29.4%-50.8%]; P < .001) and IGA success (50/190 [26.3%] vs 7/96 [7.3%]; Δ, 14.6% [95% CI, 6.7%-22.6%]; P = 0.003) at week 16. At week 24, the proportion of patients with itch response was 58.3% vs 20.4% (Δ, 38.7% [95% CI, 27.5%-49.9%]) in the ad hoc analysis, and IGA success was 58/190 (30.5%) vs 9/96 (9.4%) (Δ, 19.2% [95% CI, 10.3%-28.1%]) in the nemolizumab-treated vs placebo group. During the treatment period, 134 patients (71.7%) receiving nemolizumab vs 62 patients (65.3%) receiving placebo had at least 1 adverse event; most events were of mild to moderate severity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, nemolizumab monotherapy led to clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in core signs and symptoms of PN.

### Effectiveness and safety of dupilumab for prurigo nodularis in China: a multicentric and observational study [^ba3eded1]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is an uncommon neuroinflammatory dermatosis, characterized by pruritus, repetitive scratching, nodular lesions lasting at least 6 weeks, posing a serious impact on quality of life. The prevalence of PN ranges from 0.01% to 8.2%, most commonly affecting individuals aged 50–60 years, with a predilection for women. PN is associated with increased incidence of psychiatric, endocrine, cardiovascular, and renal diseases, as well as malignancy. The burden of its systemic comorbidities exceeds that of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases. A variety of pruritogenic disorders can cause PN, among which atopic susceptibility is a major factor in nearly half of patients with PN. Based on the atopic status, PN is divided into atopic PN and non‐atopic PN.

The pathogenesis of PN has not been elucidated, and it is thought that imbalance of immune cells and crosstalk of neuroimmune play an important role. Recent transcriptomic studies of PN have shown that there are different degrees of activation of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th22 inflammatory cells in PN, and there may be ethnic differences in the activation, among which Th2 inflammation is overactivated in European and Asian patients.

PN holds a substantial challenge for management. The most frequently prescribed agents include topical treatments, UV light therapy, off‐label use of systemic immunosuppressive and neuromodulatory drugs. However, these therapies are limited by unsatisfactory effectiveness and potential side effects and toxicities. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin‐4Rα, has shown good efficacy and safety in clinical trials, becoming the first drug approved for PN. However, in the phase 3 clinical study of dupilumab for PN, only small number of Asian patients were included. Furthermore, the effectiveness and safety of dupilumab in the Chinese PN patients remains to be explored. Therefore, we aimed to address this gap by using real‐world multicenter data to evaluate its effectiveness and safety in Chinese patients with moderate‐to‐severe PN.

Dupilumab: Efficacy and Safety of the First Approved Biologic for CNPG

The monoclonal antibody dupilumab interferes with type 2 helper T-cell (Th2)-mediated inflammation by inhibiting the shared α subunit for IL-4 and IL-13 of the IL-4 receptor.

It was first approved in March 2017 for adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), insufficiently controlled with topical therapies. In Europe, dupilumab is approved for moderate-to-severe AD (patients aged ≥ 12 years), severe AD (patients aged ≥ 6 months), severe asthma (patients aged ≥ 6 years; add-on therapy), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (adult patients; add-on therapy), eosinophilic esophagitis (patients aged ≥ 12 years) and moderate-to-severe CNPG (adult patients).

### Efficacy of dupilumab in prurigo nodularis in elderly patient [^77844426]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disorder, affecting adults, with multiple nodules, typically on the limbs. The treatment is challenging, especially in elderly patients. An 85-year-old woman had developed in the last 3years itch with nodular lesions and erythematous scaly patches and excoriations. The extension of the lesions was evaluated by body surface area (BSA) score and the patient's itch and disease-related sleep disorders by a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and blood chemistry were performed before and during the therapy. At the baseline, the BSA score was 56%. Itch and disease-related sleep disorders were, respectively, NRS 10 and 5 and DLQI was 9. Total IgE count and lactate dehydrogenase were increased. After starting dupilumab, there was a rapid improvement, especially in pruritus. The patient reported the maximum peak of pruritus every day for 6 months. At this time, the itch almost disappeared and clinically only postinflammatory lesions appreciated, with normalization of the blood tests and without any side effects.

3.1 Dupilumab Markedly Improved Both Itch and Skin Lesions in

Significantly improvements in both itching and skin lesions were observed after dupilumab treatment, as shown primarily by the changes in PP‐NRS and IGA. Notably, 84.9% of patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement of ≥ 4 points in PP‐NRS (PP‐NRS4) at Week 12 (Figure 1). From an initial baseline of 20 to > 100 nodules, 37.0% and 46.6% of patients showed a reduction to ≤ 5 nodules, corresponding to a response of "clear" or "almost clear" skin at Week 12 and 16 (Figure 1). Moreover, patient‐reported quality of life outcomes showed substantial improvements, with decreasing from 16.6 ± 6.8 at baseline to 7.2 ± 4.9 at Week 12, 6.4 ± 4.5 at Week 16 (Figure 2).

### Efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus of unknown origin: a nonrandomized controlled trial [^7ad02c1e]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a phase 2, single-center, open-label nonrandomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in adult patients with moderate to severe PN or CPUO. We hypothesized a priori that treatment with abrocitinib would be associated with clinically significant improvement in itch and quality of life in both conditions. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. The Transparent Reporting of Evaluations With Nonrandomized Designs reporting guideline was followed.

Patients were recruited at outpatient dermatology clinics from September 2021 to March 2022 (Figure 1; see Supplement 1 for trial protocol). The option to enroll in this study was discussed with consecutive patients who met the inclusion criteria. Participants underwent a 4-week screening period, 12 weeks of treatment, and 4 weeks of posttreatment follow-up (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). There was no placebo group in this trial.

Figure 1.
Participant Flow Diagram

Five patients were screened but not enrolled in the study because of low white blood cell count, low estimated glomerular filtration rate, significant cardiac disease with reduced ejection fraction, significant risk of atherosclerosis with uncontrolled metabolic syndrome, or voluntary departure from the study. Two patients with CPUO were lost to follow-up after week 12 and did not complete the week 16 follow-up visit. CPUO indicates chronic pruritus of unknown origin; PN, prurigo nodularis.

Abrocitinib was made and supplied by Pfizer, Inc. Abrocitinib is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with AD. The higher available dose (200 mg daily) was chosen for this trial based on its potential effectiveness in a small cohort with moderate to severe disease and the existing phase 3 data demonstrating efficacy and safety in patients with AD.

### Dupilumab in dermatology: potential for uses beyond atopic dermatitis [^c91e389e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab inhibits the interleukin-4 receptor subunit α and is FDA approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It is a relatively new drug, and whether it is efficacious for other diseases in dermatology is an area of increasing interest. We searched the literature and ClinicalTrials.gov database for uses of dupilumab beyond atopic dermatitis in dermatology and for ongoing studies on new uses for dupilumab. Off-label reports identified described use of dupilumab for several different dermatologic conditions, including allergic contact dermatitis, hand dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, prurigo nodularis, and alopecia areata. Overall, there is limited but promising data for dupilumab use beyond atopic dermatitis in dermatology. The relatively safe adverse effect profile of dupilumab may make it an option for certain recalcitrant diseases in dermatology, but further studies will be needed to assess its efficacy and determine its best possible use.

### A patient with concurrent prurigo nodularis and squamous cell carcinomas of keratoacanthoma type: the role of aprepitant in diagnostic clarity [^a31d5c92]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PN is a challenging disorder to treat, and management primarily relies on multiple off-label treatments including topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, gabapentinoids, thalidomide, and naltrexone. Because our patient did not respond to multiple first- and second-line therapies, the NK1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, was trialed, as evidence suggested an improvement in pruritus severity in patients with PN and pruritus secondary to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, solid tumors, antitumoral immunotherapies. Recently, dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin receptor, was found to improve generalized PN; however, cost and administrative burdens may limit the accessibility of dupilumab in PN. Although aprepitant was used off label for pruritus in this case, the low overall dose (80 mg × 4 days) and infrequent dosing (every 3 months) made this an affordable option in this patient with refractory pruritus and PN.

Initial studies of aprepitant for chronic pruritus found a significant antipruritic effect in patients with PN; however, more recent phase II trials failed to replicate this antipruritic effect in PN. Animal studies, case series, and case reports of aprepitant for the use of chronic pruritus displayed promising results, suggesting that select patients may experience clinical responses, as in our case. Although the phase II data conflict with the significant clinical outcome of our case, exclusion criteria included infectious and chronic diseases, which may explain the difference in benefit in our patient compared with the study population. The discrepancy of clinical response between human and animal studies may occur, because aprepitant acts as an antagonist of mouse but not human Mrgprs isoforms. Future research may be directed at investigating NK1 antagonists with increased affinity for human Mrgprs. In contrast to aprepitant, the novel NK1 receptor antagonist serlopitant improved chronic pruritus in a recent phase II trial, indicating that other agents of the same drug class may be equally or more efficacious.

### Dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: a 5-year open-label extension study [^79c60df2]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Patients, and Treatment

The phase 3, international multicenter LIBERTY AD OLE study evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe AD. Detailed enrollment criteria and 3 interim analyses have been reported previously. Here, we report results from the entire study up to last patient visit date of June 27, 2022 (database lock August 11, 2022). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and local applicable regulatory requirements, including institutional review board approval. All patients provided written informed consent before any study procedures began. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Briefly, patients 18 years or older who had participated in a previous dupilumab AD study were eligible to enter the open-label extension study trial. Race data were self-reported at the screening visit for the parent study. Ineligibility criteria were adverse events (AEs) deemed related to dupilumab that led to treatment discontinuation or a serious AE related to dupilumab in the parent study. Patients enrolled at the start of the study (October 2013) initiated a subcutaneous regimen of dupilumab, 200 mg, weekly (400-mg loading dose). The protocol was later amended to a regimen of dupilumab, 300 mg, weekly (600-mg loading dose), then to a dose regimen of dupilumab, 300 mg, every 2 weeks starting from week 108 to align with the regimen approved by regulatory agencies, which affected dosing in 226 participants who were still receiving treatment. A complete list of protocol amendments and dosing regimens are provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. The open-label extension study was originally planned for up to 3 years of dupilumab treatment per patient and was later amended to a treatment period of up to 5 years, allowing patients to re-enter the study and resume dupilumab treatment.

Concomitant TCSs and TCIs, as well as other AD treatments, were permitted. Prior to Amendment 7, patients receiving rescue medication (including SCSs, nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressive medications, and phototherapy) were required to temporarily discontinue study treatment for the duration of rescue treatment plus 5 half-lives of the rescue treatment; patients could continue to receive dupilumab while receiving rescue treatment after this amendment. The extent of use of TCSs, TCIs, or both classes was not captured.

### Patient perspectives on living with severe prurigo nodularis [^0df5a72e]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prurigo nodularis (PN), also known as chronic prurigo, is a debilitating neuroimmune skin disease characterized by chronic pruritus and multiple symmetrically distributed pruriginous lesions. The intense itching and scratching that patients with PN experience exacerbates the lesions and leads to an intractable itch-scratch cycle, which has substantial implications for their quality of life (QoL).

When treating PN, the primary goal is to reduce pruritus and break the itch-scratch cycle, thereby allowing the skin to heal. However, treatment of PN is challenging. Indeed, there is only 1 approved treatment for PN, dupilumab, which received US Food and Drug Administration approval in September 2022. The difficulty in treating the disease is reflected in the range of empirical treatments described in the literature, including antihistamines, antidepressants, gabapentinoids, immunosuppressants, and phototherapy. However, a recent systematic literature review found that some immunosuppressants used to treat PN have poor safety profiles and that antidepressants show promise but lack robust evidence of effectiveness. Because of these limitations, people with PN often experience impaired QoL associated with inadequately controlled skin lesions and itching. In a prospective European observational study of 6 chronic pruritic skin diseases, PN was associated with the strongest pruritus intensity and worst QoL impairment.

A literature review for PN demonstrated a paucity of qualitative research (eg, qualitative interviews, focus group studies) on PN symptoms and QoL. The available literature collectively indicates that the most bothersome symptom in PN is chronic itch, which interferes with sleep, and is associated with anxiety and depression.

The main objective of this study was to conduct qualitative research to document the burden of illness in PN using direct patient input. The study was part of a larger project that also aimed to validate published patient-reported outcome measures using the peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS) score, the sleep disturbance NRS score, and Morning Sleep Diary in people with PN.

### The effectiveness and safety of dupilumab in the management of refractory prurigo nodularis in 45 Chinese patients: a real-life observational study [^1571a476]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease characterized by severe skin itching and hyperkeratotic nodules. The existing treatment options for PN are limited by severe adverse effects. Dupilumab is an approved biological agent for treating atopic dermatitis and other type 2 inflammatory diseases in adults, showing good efficacy and safety in clinical trials. Recently, dupilumab has shown remarkable effects in patients with PN, but the data on Chinese patients are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dupilumab to treat atopic and nonatopic PN in 45 Chinese patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort to date to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dupilumab to treat atopic and nonatopic PN. To achieve this, 45 patients with PN from the department of dermatology of several Grade A hospitals in Shenzhen, China, were treated with off-label prescription dupilumab. We followed-up the patients on weeks 8 and 16, and the pruritus symptoms, changes in lesion color and area, and the quality of sleep and life were evaluated before and after treatment using the Pruritus Peak Numeric Rating Scale (PP-NRS, 0–10), the Dermatology Life Quality Index/Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI/CDLQI, 0–30), and the Investigator's Global Assessment Scales for Stage and Activity (IGA/IGAa, 0–4) at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Total serum immunoglobin E and eosinophilic granulocyte levels were the main laboratory indices for patient evaluation. During treatment, the skin lesions and itching symptoms of these 45 patients were relieved remarkably within 2weeks. All the PP-NRS, DLQI/CDLQI, and IGA/IGAa scores significantly improved from the baseline to 16-week dupilumab treatment (P < 0.001 for all scores) and no adverse events were reported.

### Efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a pooled analysis of two phase 3 randomized trials (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and LIBERTY AD SOLO 2) [^c4e5cda2]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Two phase 3 trials with identical design, LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 (NCT02277743) and LIBERTY AD SOLO 2 (NCT02277769), confirmed dupilumab efficacy and safety versus placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

Objectives

To report a pooled analysis of these trials to further explore dupilumab's effects on AD clinical parameters, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), symptoms of anxiety/depression, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and safety.

Methods

A pooled analysis of two 16-week phase 3 studies in adults with moderate-to-severe AD (N = 1379) inadequately controlled with/inadvisable for topical medications, randomized to dupilumab 300mg once weekly (qw), every 2 weeks (q2w), or placebo.

Results

Dupilumab significantly improved all pre-specified efficacy endpoints versus placebo (P < 0.0001), including clinical severity outcomes and PROs, symptoms of anxiety/depression, and HRQoL, consistent with previously published results. In post-hoc analyses, among patients reporting at least some baseline pain/discomfort on the EuroQoL-5D, no pain/discomfort at Week 16 was reported by 43%/46%/14% of dupilumab qw/q2w/placebo-treated patients (P < 0.0001). The distribution of dupilumab-treated patients within pre-defined score categories on the Investigator's Global Assessment (0–1/2/3/4) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (≥ 90%/ ≥ 75- < 90%/ ≥ 50- < 75%/ < 50%) steadily and consistently improved over time versus marginal changes with placebo. Dupilumab significantly improved pruritus within 1–3 days of treatment initiation. No new safety signals were observed. Injection-site reactions and conjunctivitis were more common with dupilumab; AD exacerbation and non-herpetic skin infections more frequent with placebo.

Conclusions

Dupilumab versus placebo significantly improved objective AD signs, subjective PROs, symptoms of anxiety/depression, and HRQoL, with a favorable benefit-risk profile in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.

### Comorbidities in prurigo nodularis [^71f54287]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by intense pruritus and hyperkeratotic nodules commonly found on the trunk and extremities. The pathogenesis of PN involves neuroimmune dysregulation, mediated by various inflammatory cytokines and neuropeptides. PN significantly impacts patients' quality of life (QOL). There is greater disease severity, increased itch intensity, and more pronounced reduction in QOL in PN compared to other individuals with chronic pruritus. PN is associated with a range of systemic comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, HIV and tuberculosis infection, hepatic disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, PN is frequently accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, further complicating management. Sleep disturbances and neurological comorbidities, including neuropathic pain and central sensitization, are also common in PN patients. Diagnosis should include a comprehensive review of systems to assess for comorbidities and evaluate disease severity, guiding personalized treatment approaches. Management strategies aim to reduce itch severity and improve QOL, often involving immunosuppressants, neuromodulators, or emerging biologics such as dupilumab.

### Simultaneous treatment of samter triad and prurigo nodularis with dupilumab [^495d13a3]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The standard treatment approach for ST consists of a combination of interventions aimed at clinical symptoms, including inhaled and oral corticosteroids, steroid-sparing asthma therapies, leukotriene-modifying agents, aspirin avoidance or desensitization, and surgical removal of nasal polyps. Monoclonal antibodies (eg, omalizumab and mepolizumab) have also been used and are gaining popularity for treatment of this triad. However, ST is not primarily driven by increased immunoglobulin E despite its co-occurring allergic diseases such as AD or PN. Targeted blockade of Th2-derived signals rather than immunoglobulin E for the treatment of ST may represent a novel treatment strategy.

Off-label use of dupilumab is found to be effective for various other atopic and dermatologic conditions, including bullous pemphigoid and PN. There is only 1 other report describing the use of dupilumab for the treatment of ST. Ten patients were treated for 6 months and showed improvement in both SNOT and asthma measures. Several case reports and case series have also shown effectiveness of dupilumab for the treatment of PN. One study found that dupilumab treatment led to a reduction of the Numeric Rating Scale Itch Intensity to 0 in 4 patients with recalcitrant PN. No previous reports have described the simultaneous treatment of ST and PN using dupilumab.

### Therapeutic potential of biologics in prurigo nodularis [^503e1e8a]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prurigo nodularis (PN) or chronic prurigo of nodular type (CNPG) is a subtype of chronic prurigo with severe pruritus and neuroimmune underlying pathophysiology occurring in a plethora of dermatological, systemic, neurologic, and psychiatric conditions.

Areas Covered

We review the increasing repertoire of biologics in the treatment of CNPG focusing on those targeting interleukins 4, 13, 31, oncostatin M and IgE. Presented information is based on a database research on current clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov, European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), US clinical trial registry ICH-GCP) and a PubMed search for latest publications conducted with the combinations of the terms 'chronic prurigo', 'prurigo nodularis', 'pathophysiology', 'treatment', 'therapy', and 'biologics'.
Expert Opinion

CNPG gets more and more attention as new therapeutic targets have been revealed in recent years, thus allowing the use of targeted approaches. The off-label advent of dupilumab offered advanced insight into the pathogenesis of CNPG and showed an impressive relief of pruritus in the vast majority of patients. New therapies including biologics (e.g. nemolizumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab), small molecules (e.g. neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, janus kinase inhibitors) as well as mu-opioid receptor antagonists and nalbuphine, a μ-antagonist/κ-agonist, are in the pipeline and offer new hope for an improved future patient care.

### Therapeutic outcomes across Janus kinase inhibitors in prurigo nodularis [^de793f76]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a debilitating skin condition. When inadequate disease control is achieved or other systemic therapies are contraindicated, JAK inhibitors may be considered although real-world evidence remains limited.

Objective

To investigate clinical findings and treatment outcomes among patients diagnosed with PN and undergoing JAK inhibitors in real-world setting.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study across 23 Italian tertiary referral hospitals. PN Patients were eligible if aged ≥ 18 years and had received a JAK inhibitor with a minimum follow-up of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was defined as the proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 4 points from baseline in PP-NRS score. Key secondary outcomes included the rates of patients reaching a significant reduction in IGA PN-S and IGA PN-A scores.

Results

Seventy-one patients met the inclusion criteria. At week 16, the proportion of patients achieving the primary outcome was 94.5% for upadacitinib (n = 52/55; 95% CI, 87%-100%), 83.3% for abrocitinib (n = 10/12; 95% CI, 52%-98%), and 100% for baricitinib (n = 4/4; 95% CI, 40%-100%) with results sustained at week 24. IGA PN-A score of 0/1 was achieved in 90% of patients treated with upadacitinib and abrocitinib, and in 50% of those on baricitinib by week 24. Improvements were observed across all other secondary outcomes assessed, with no safety concerns reported.

Conclusions

This study suggests that JAK inhibitors achieve clinically meaningful outcomes in PN irrespective of atopic background, supporting their use across diverse patient profiles. Further research is warranted to validate these observations and explore their long-term effects.

### Prurigo nodularis: new insights into pathogenesis and novel therapeutics [^9d3fbd65]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is an inflammatory skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic nodules on the skin. Patients with PN suffer from an intractable itch-scratch cycle leading to impaired sleep, psychosocial distress and a significant disruption in quality of life. The pathogenesis of PN is associated with immune and neural dysregulation, mediated by inflammatory cytokines [such as interleukin (IL)-4, -13, -17, -22 and -31] and neuropeptides (such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide). There is a role for type 2 inflammation in PN in addition to T-helper (Th)17 and Th22-mediated inflammation. The neuroimmune feedback loop in PN involves neuropeptides released from nerve fibres that cause vasodilation and further recruitment of inflammatory cells. Inflammatory cells, particularly mast cells and eosinophils, degranulate and release neurotoxins, as well as nerve growth factor, which may contribute to the neuronal hyperplasia seen in the dermis of patients with PN and neural sensitization. Recent studies have also indicated underlying genetic susceptibility to PN in addition to environmental factors, the existence of various disease endotypes centred around degrees of type 2 inflammation or underlying myelopathy or spinal disc disease, and significant race and ethnicity-based differences, with African Americans having densely fibrotic skin lesions. Dupilumab became the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic for PN, and there are several other agents currently in development. The anti-IL-31 receptor A inhibitor nemolizumab is in late-stage development with positive phase III data reported. In addition, the oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitors, abrocitinib and povorcitinib, are in phase II trials while a topical JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, is in phase III studies.

### Dupilumab provides favourable long-term safety and efficacy in children aged ≥ 6 to… [^f3c665e7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

R668‐AD‐1434 (LIBERTY AD PED‐OLE; NCT02612454) is an ongoing, long‐term, OLE phase III study enrolling paediatric patients who participated in previous dupilumab AD trials, including the phase IIa study reported here and a phase III study in children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years (LIBERTY AD PEDS; R668‐AD‐1652) (Figure 1c) (long‐term safety and efficacy data were not available from the phase III study at the time of publication; the phase III study data will be reported in a future manuscript). 13 The aim of the OLE is to assess the long‐term safety and efficacy of dupilumab.

Children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years were included if they had participated in a previous dupilumab study and adequately completed the visits and assessments required per protocol in the previous study. Patients were excluded if they developed a serious adverse event (SAE) or an adverse event (AE) deemed related to dupilumab that presented an unreasonable risk for the patient during the previous study. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously reported. 14 In the OLE study, patients continued to receive their assigned treatment regimen as in the phase IIa study (2 or 4 mg kg −1 administered qw).

Low‐ and mid‐potency topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, or both were allowed at the discretion of the investigator in either study. The use of systemic treatments for AD (systemic immunosuppressants and corticosteroids) was prohibited. If required, rescue treatment could be considered, initially with higher‐potency TCS and then escalated to systemic treatment (corticosteroids or noncorticosteroid immunosuppressants; study treatment discontinuation was required during rescue treatment use). 14

The studies were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guideline and applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards/ethics committees at all study sites. An independent data monitoring committee monitored patient safety. For all patients, written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian and assent was obtained from the patient.

The phase IIa and OLE data presented here only include children aged ≥ 6 to < 12 years who participated in both studies. The OLE data is provided for 52 weeks of treatment.

### Recalcitrant prurigo nodularis treated successfully with dupilumab [^276ce613]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current therapies for PN aim to suppress the itch-scratch cycle and include a myriad of topical agents, such as steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and neuromodulators like capsaicin. Topical agents are frequently unsuccessful, and systemic agents are often needed, including intralesional steroids, antipruritic agents such as oral antihistamines, neuromodulators like gabapentin and pregabalin, and phototherapy. In more severe cases, immunosuppressive agents such as thalidomide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and methotrexate have been used with varying success and come with a host of undesirable side effects. Recently, substance P and various neuropeptides have been implicated in a neurogenic etiology of pruritus in PN, and have guided the use of neurokinin-1 antagonists (serlopitant and aprepitant) in these patients.

Associations with atopic dermatitis and PN have long been suggested, with PN being subcategorized into early-onset atopic and late-onset nonatopic forms that both involve chronic inflammation and itch. Studies find the role of T-helper type 2–associated cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, 13, and 31 as hallmark regulators of itch. One study found a 50-fold upregulation of IL-31 messenger RNA in PN biopsy samples. Blockade of these immunomodulatory axes have accordingly emerged as promising therapeutic approaches for chronic pruritic conditions. Nemolizumab and dupilumab, inhibitors of IL-31 and the IL-4/13 receptor, respectively, have proven to be efficacious in reducing pruritus in AD patients. Indeed, 2 recent case series describe the success of dupilumab in a total of 7 PN patients. The new wave of cytokine modulation in AD may be the key to providing dramatic relief for PN patients.

### Prurigo nodularis… [^ebe86440]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Prurigo nodularis is a bothersome skin condition characterized by raised, intensely itchy, often painful bumps on the arms, legs, and trunk. Facts This condition can occur in anyone, but is most common in middle-aged adults. Prurigo nodularis greatly affects a person's quality of life, including sleep disturbances and higher rates of anxiety and depression. Patients with severe PN have an increased amount of inflammation in their blood, and PN is commonly associated with other medical conditions. Symptoms Prurigo nodularis appears as thick, scaly, raised bumps on the skin that are very itchy and can be painful. Severe itch is characteristic of PN and leads to scratching, bleeding, and thickening of the nodules. The bumps can be anywhere on the body but are always within reach, with the arms and legs the most common areas.

Black patients with PN often have firmer, larger, and darker bumps that tend to leave dark spots that can take many months to years to fade. Once the itch starts to improve with treatment, the raised bumps gradually heal, frequently with scarring. Diagnosis and Testing A dermatologist can usually diagnose PN on clinical examination. Sometimes, a dermatologist will perform a skin biopsy to rule out other diagnoses. Prurigo nodularis is more common in patients with other medical conditions, including diabetes, liver, kidney, and thyroid problems, and certain infections. Physicians will often screen patients with PN for these medical issues. Treatment There is no cure for PN. The main treatment goal is decreasing itch because the bumps fade once the itch improves. The most common initial treatment for mild PN is topical steroid creams or ointments or local corticosteroid injections into the bumps to reduce inflammation.

Light therapy, a treatment with a special medical-grade light machine in the physician's office, is another treatment option. Because PN is usually widespread, most patients will need treatment with oral medications or injections to help improve itching. Some medications, such as gabapentin, are used to target the nerves that transmit itch from the skin to the brain. Patients with severe PN are often prescribed medications that lower the immune system to decrease inflammation.

### Dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroid treatment in adults with atopic dermatitis with an inadequate response or intolerance to ciclosporin A or when this treatment is medically inadvisable: a placebo-controlled, randomized phase III clinical trial (LIBERTY AD CAF é) [^cdaa04d5]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may require systemic therapy. Ciclosporin A (CsA) is a widely used, potent immunosuppressant but it is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis, and side-effects limit its use. Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin 4 receptor-alpha monoclonal antibody, inhibits signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, key drivers of Type 2/Th2-mediated inflammation, and is approved in the U.S. A. and the European Union for the treatment of inadequately-controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults.

Objectives

To evaluate efficacy and safety of dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS) in adults with atopic dermatitis with inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable.

Methods

In this 16-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, patients were randomized 1: 1: 1 to subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg weekly (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo. All received concomitant medium-potency TCS from Week -2 through Week 16; dosage could be tapered if lesions cleared, or stopped for adverse reactions to TCS.

Results

In total, 390 patients were screened, 325 were randomized, and 318 completed the trial. Treatment groups had similar baseline characteristics. Significantly more patients in the dupilumab qw + TCS and q2w + TCS groups achieved ≥ 75% improvement from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index at Week 16 vs. the placebo + TCS group (primary end point) (59·1% and 62·6% vs. 29·6%, respectively; P < 0·001 vs. placebo + TCS, both doses). Other clinical outcomes and atopic dermatitis symptoms were significantly improved in the dupilumab qw + TCS and q2w + TCS groups, including pruritus, pain, sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and quality of life (QoL). Treatment groups had similar overall rates of adverse events (qw + TCS, q2w + TCS and placebo + TCS groups: 69·1%, 72·0% and 69·4%, respectively) and serious adverse events (1·8%, 1·9% and 1·9%, respectively). Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab + TCS; skin infections were more frequent with placebo + TCS.

Conclusions

Dupilumab + TCS significantly improved signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis and QoL in adults with a history of inadequate response to/intolerance of CsA, or for whom CsA treatment was medically inadvisable. No new safety signals were identified.

### Dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis: a 5-year open-label extension study [^aa08bf50]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that often requires continuous long-term systemic management. Long-term safety and efficacy data for treatment options are critically important.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of dupilumab treatment for up to 5 years in adults with moderate to severe AD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The 5-year LIBERTY AD open-label extension study was conducted from September 2013 to June 2022 at 550 sites in 28 countries. The study enrolled adult patients with moderate to severe AD who had participated in previous dupilumab clinical trials. Data were analyzed from August 2022 to February 2023.

Exposures

At enrollment, patients initiated a regimen of subcutaneous dupilumab, 200 mg, weekly (400-mg loading dose). The regimen was amended in June 2014 to dupilumab, 300 mg, weekly (600-mg loading dose) based on a dose-ranging study and again in November 2019 to dupilumab, 300 mg, every 2 weeks to align with the regulatory regimen approvals.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end points were the incidence and rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Key secondary end points included incidence and rate of serious TEAEs and adverse events of special interest, proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear), and proportion of patients with 75% or more improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from the parent study baseline.

Results

A total of 2677 patients were enrolled and treated in the open-label extension study; 1611 (60.2%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 39.2 (13.4) years. A total of 334 patients (12.5%) completed treatment up to week 260. The most common reasons for withdrawal were due to regulatory approval of dupilumab in compliance with the study protocol (810 of 1380 [58.7%]), patient withdrawal (248 of 1380 [18.0%]), and adverse events (116 of 1380 [8.4%]). Exposure-adjusted rates of TEAEs were generally stable or declined throughout the study. Common TEAEs (incidence of 5% or greater) included nasopharyngitis, worsening AD, upper respiratory tract infection, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, headache, oral herpes, and injection-site reaction. At week 260, 220 of 326 patients (67.5%) achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 and 288 of 324 (88.9%) achieved 75% or greater improvement in the EASI. The mean (SD) EASI score was 16.39 (14.60) at baseline and 2.75 (5.62) at end of study.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, there was sustained safety and efficacy of continuous long-term dupilumab treatment for adults with moderate to severe AD.

### Practical approaches for diagnosis and management of prurigo nodularis: United States expert panel consensus [^95a4800b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intensely pruritic, raised, nodular lesions. Because there are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies specifically for PN, management is highly variable, and no consensus exists on treatment regimens.

Objective

To provide practical guidance to help United States dermatologists diagnose and effectively treat patients with PN.

Methods

We participated in a roundtable discussion to develop consensus recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of PN from a United States perspective.

Results

The core findings in PN are the presence of firm, nodular lesions; pruritus lasting at least 6 weeks; and a history or signs, or both, of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. The diagnostic workup involves a complete review of systems, considering potential systemic diseases, and assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity. Treatment should be selected based on a patient's clinical presentation, comorbidities, and response to prior treatments and should address both neural and immunologic components of pruritus.

Limitations

Data on PN are from anecdotal or small clinical trials, and all treatments are currently used off-label.

Conclusion

An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should be based on clinical judgment and tailored to the individual needs of the patient.

### Chronic prurigo including prurigo nodularis: new insights and treatments [^5eae43b3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic prurigo (CPG) is a neuroinflammatory, fibrotic dermatosis that is defined by the presence of chronic pruritus (itch lasting longer than 6 weeks), scratch-associated pruriginous skin lesions and history of repeated scratching. Patients with CPG experience a significant psychological burden and a notable impairment in their quality of life. Chronic prurigo of nodular type (CNPG; synonym: prurigo nodularis) represents the most common subtype of CPG. As CNPG is representative for all CPG subtypes, we refer in this review to both CNPG and CPG. We provide an overview of the clinical characteristics and assessment of CPG, the burden of disease and the underlying pathophysiology including associated therapeutic targets. The information provided results from a PubMed search for the latest publications and a database search for current clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register [European Medicines Agency]; using the following terms or combinations of terms: 'chronic prurigo', 'prurigo', 'prurigo nodularis', 'pathophysiology', 'therapy', 'biologics', 'treatment'). Dupilumab is the first authorized systemic therapy by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CNPG to date. Topical and systemic agents that are currently under investigation in clinical randomized, placebo-controlled phase II and III trials such as biologics (e.g. nemolizumab, vixarelimab/KPL-716, barzolvolimab/CDX-0159), small molecules (ruxolitinib cream, povorcitinib/INCB054707, abrocitinib) and the opioid modulator nalbuphine are highlighted. In the last past 15 years, several milestones have been reached regarding the disease understanding of CPG such as first transcriptomic analysis, first terminology, first guideline, and first therapy approval in 2022, which contributed to improved medical care of affected patients. The broad range of identified targets, current case observations and initiated trials offers the possibility of more drug approvals in the near future.

### Chronic prurigo including prurigo nodularis: new insights and treatments [^5714f121]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinician-Reported Outcomes

The Prurigo Activity and Severity Score (PAS) and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) were created to provide an objective and standardized way to document pruriginous lesions in all CPG subtypes. PAS captures information about the type, location and quantity of pruriginous lesions, including the percentage of active and healed lesions. The IGA stages comprise a simple rating system to evaluate the presence of pruriginous lesions based on four levels. The IGA also considers the scratch activity for the lesions. The classification of severity can be determined using the IGA or the PAS. These assessment tools are not only utilized to evaluate and track the progress of CPG during treatment but also to establish inclusion criteria and therapy success in clinical trials.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^027e43d1]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab

Dupilumab is a commercialized monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the IL-4 receptor-α (IL-4Rα) subunit, blocking IL-4 and IL-13 signaling. Several randomized trials have been performed on the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with moderate to severe AD, enabling its registration for this indication. All the studies confirmed the efficacy of dupilumab in terms of improvement of skin lesions and alleviation of pruritus. Dupilumab was generally well-tolerated and had a placebo-like safety profile. A representative phase III report recounted the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 trials (n = 671 and n = 708, respectively). At week 16, an improvement of at least 3–4 points in the peak pruritus NRS score was significantly more common among patients receiving dupilumab than patients receiving placebo (p < 0.001). A meta-analysis of 1505 patients with moderate to severe AD revealed that dupilumab started to unveil its antipruritic properties by days 2 and 5 in adults and adolescents, respectively. The response increased over time and was sustained until the end of the studies (up to 1 year). Recent papers have also reported on 31 patients receiving dupilumab due to chronic prurigo. The majority of patients experienced significant pruritus reduction starting to unfold within 4 weeks, followed by more gradual flattening or disappearance of lesions within several months of the initiation of therapy. Furthermore, dupilumab established its efficacy in case reports regarding patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP), chronic refractory pruritus and UP. Clinical trials on the use of dupilumab in chronic spontaneous and cholinergic urticaria are in progress.

### Phase 3 trial of nemolizumab in patients with prurigo nodularis [^3e064dc6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study OLYMPIA 2 was published by Shawn G Kwatra and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Prurigo nodularis and Pruritus. In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the trial question was: what is the role of nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31Ra monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis? In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the population was: 274 patients (168 female, 106 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis. The key exclusion criteria were chronic pruritus resulting from an active condition other than prurigo nodularis; neuropathic or psychogenic pruritus; active atopic dermatitis. In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the interventions were: n = 183 nemolizumab (subcutaneous loading dose of 60 mg, followed by 30 mg every 4 weeks for < 90 kg or 60 mg every 4 weeks for ≥ 90 kg for 16 weeks) n = 91 placebo (subcutaneous matching placebo every 4 weeks for 16 weeks). In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in improvement in itch response at week 16 (56.3% vs. 20.9%; AD 37.4%, 95% CI 26.3 to 48.5). In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Investigator's Global Assessment response at week 16 (37.7% vs. 11%; AD 28.5%, 95% CI 18.8 to 38.2) Significant increase in improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score at week 4 (41% vs. 7.7%; AD 33.4%, 95% CI 24.3 to 42.4) Significant increase in improvement in Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale score at week 16 (51.9% vs. 20.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 20.7 to 43.2). In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the OLYMPIA 2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis, nemolizumab was superior to placebo with respect to improvement in itch response at week 16.

### Effectiveness and safety of nemolizumab in patients with prurigo nodularis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b9b0cff1]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic, severely pruritic condition that markedly impairs quality of life. Existing treatments show limited efficacy, prompting investigation of nemolizumab, an IL-31 receptor antagonist. This meta-analysis evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nemolizumab with placebo in patients with PN. Effectiveness endpoints included a ≥ 4-point improvement in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4), a ≥ 2-point reduction in the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), and a ≥ 4-point improvement in the Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale (SD-NRS). Three RCTs involving 497 patients met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analyses showed nemolizumab significantly increased the likelihood of achieving PP-NRS4 response (OR = 6.92, 95% CI: 3.84–12.45, P < .00001), IGA reduction (OR = 7.59, 95% CI: 3.58–16.12, P < .00001), and SD-NRS improvement (OR = 3.99, 95% CI: 2.39–6.66, P < .00001). Safety outcomes did not differ significantly between nemolizumab and placebo for adverse events, serious adverse events, or other specific categories. In conclusion, while maintaining a favorable safety profile, nemolizumab demonstrates robust efficacy in reducing pruritus, lesion severity, and sleep disturbance in patients with PN. While these findings are promising, the small number of included studies and potential for publication bias warrant cautious interpretation and highlight the need for further research. These findings support its role as a promising option for individuals with PN who are unresponsive to standard therapies.

### Dupilumab provides favorable safety and sustained efficacy for up to 3 years in an open-label study of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^9691ed93]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Ethics

The study was conducted following ethical principles that derive from the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline, Good Clinical Practice, and local applicable regulatory requirements, including Institutional Review Board approval. All patients provided written informed consent prior to undertaking any study procedures.

Outcomes Assessed in This Analysis

The primary outcome was incidence and rate (events per patient-year [PY]) of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs). Key secondary outcomes included incidence and rate of serious TEAEs, percentage of patients with an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0/1, and percentage of patients with ≥ 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from baseline (EASI-75). Other secondary outcomes were change and percentage change from baseline in EASI, percentage of patients with ≥ 50% or ≥ 90% improvement in EASI from baseline (EASI-50 and EASI-90, respectively), change and percentage change from baseline in the weekly average Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), percentage of patients with ≥ 3-point improvement (reduction) in weekly average Pruritus NRS from baseline or with a value of 0, change from baseline in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and percentage of patients requiring rescue treatment. Post hoc outcomes included the percentage of patients with ≥ 2-point improvement from baseline IGA score and percentage of patients with a weekly average Pruritus NRS score ≤ 3 (mild itch). IGA and EASI assessments at the end of the treatment visit (week 148) were removed and subsequently restored from protocol Amendments 6 and 7, respectively.

### Chronic prurigo including prurigo nodularis: new insights and treatments [^daae8340]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

As we are in a highly innovative area with coverage of rare and neglected disease (such as hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and others), drugs already approved for other indications are also reported to be effective in CNPG. Tofacitinib and tralokinumab are recent examples. The broad range of identified targets, current case observations and initiated trials offers the possibility of more drug approvals in the near future.

However, a lot of research questions remain, such as the natural course of the disease and the molecular and treatment response differences between people of different ethnicities. Further research including international collaborations with initiation of registries and translational studies are needed. Fortunately, this seems to be already underway.

### Dupilumab provides important clinical benefits to patients with atopic dermatitis who do not achieve clear or almost clear skin according to the investigator's global assessment: a pooled analysis of data from two phase III trials [^15427c59]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the U.S. A., an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≤ 1 (clear or almost clear skin) has been the standard measure in regulatory outcomes for registration clinical trials in atopic dermatitis (AD), including those supporting the recent approval of dupilumab.

Objectives

To evaluate the treatment effect of dupilumab in patients with IGA > 1 at the end of treatment, using other validated outcome measures for AD signs, symptoms and quality of life.

Methods

LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and 2 were two 16-week, randomized, double-blind trials enrolling adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD (IGA ≥ 3) inadequately controlled with topical treatment. We performed a post hoc analysis in patients receiving dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo. Outcome measures in patients with IGA > 1 included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS), affected body surface area (BSA), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02277743 and NCT02277769.

Results

At week 16, 278 of 449 dupilumab q2w-treated patients (median age 36·0 years) and 396 of 443 placebo-treated patients had IGA > 1. Among patients with IGA > 1 at week 16, dupilumab significantly improved several outcome measures compared with placebo: EASI (-48·9% vs. -11·3%, P < 0·001), pruritus NRS (-35·2% vs. -9·1%, P < 0·001), affected BSA (-23·1% vs. -4·5%, P < 0·001), POEM score ≥ 4-point improvement (57·4% vs. 21·0%, P < 0·001) and DLQI score ≥ 4-point improvement (59·3% vs. 24·4%, P < 0·001).

Conclusions

In patients with IGA > 1 at week 16, dupilumab induced statistically significant benefits in multiple validated outcome measures compared with placebo. The IGA ≤ 1 end point significantly underestimates clinically relevant dupilumab treatment effects.

### The safety data of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate ‑ to ‑ severe atopic dermatitis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults [^dfdef3f0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Patients

This analysis includes data from six phase 3 RCTs of dupilumab for treatment of uncontrolled moderate-to-severe AD in patients aged from 6 months through to adults and two phase 3 OLE trials (Fig. 1 of the Electronic Supplementary Material [ESM]). Detailed methodology, baseline characteristics, efficacy, and safety results were reported previously; dose regimens and sample sizes are shown in Fig. 1 of the ESM.

Two OLEs were included in this analysis (Fig. 1 of the ESM). LIBERTY AD OLE (NCT01949311) enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 years) from all phase 1–3 trials of dupilumab for AD who had adequately completed the required parent study assessments or were screened for phase 3 studies but were not randomized owing to randomization closure. The present analyses included patients who participated for up to approximately 5 years of treatment (data cutoff: 27 June 2022). LIBERTY AD PED-OLE (NCT02612454) included pediatric patients who had participated in a prior dupilumab study for AD. The present analyses included two cohorts who participated for up to approximately 1 year: adolescents (aged 12–17 years) who had previously participated in R668-AD-1607 (NCT03050151), R668-AD-1412 (NCT02407756), or LIBERTY AD ADOL (NCT03054428) (PED-OLE data cutoff: 15 December 2018); and children (aged 6–11 years) who had previously participated in LIBERTY AD PEDS (NCT03345914) (PED-OLE data cutoff: 1 July 2020).

All trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guideline, and applicable regulatory requirements. Independent data and safety monitoring committees conducted blinded monitoring of patient safety data. The local institutional review boards or ethics committees at each study center oversaw trial conduct and documentation. For each trial, all patients or their parents/guardians provided written informed consent before participating in the trial. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and the patients' parents/guardians prior to commencement of any study treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of nemolizumab in patients with moderate to severe prurigo nodularis: the OLYMPIA 1 randomized clinical phase 3 trial [^a4ec3732]. JAMA Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

The study OLYMPIA 1 was published by Sonja Ständer and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Dermatol. This study is related to the following diseases: Prurigo nodularis and Pruritus. In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31Ra monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis? In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the population was: 286 patients (166 female, 120 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis. The key exclusion criteria were body weight < 30 kg; chronic pruritus resulting from another active condition other than prurigo nodularis; neuropathic/psychogenic pruritus; active atopic dermatitis; COPD, uncontrolled asthma, and/or chronic bronchitis. In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the interventions were: n = 190 nemolizumab (subcutaneous loading dose of 60 mg, followed by 30 mg every 4 weeks for < 90 kg or 60 mg every 4 weeks for ≥ 90 kg for 16 weeks) n = 96 placebo (subcutaneous matching placebo every 4 weeks for 16 weeks). In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in ≥ 4-point improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score at week 16 (58.4% vs. 16.7%; AD 40.1%, 95% CI 29.4 to 50.8). In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Investigator Global Assessment success at week 16 (26.3% vs. 7.3%; AD 14.6%, 95% CI 6.7 to 22.6) Significant increase in ≥ 4-point improvement in Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale score at week 16 (50% vs. 11.5%; AD 38%, 95% CI 27.8 to 48.2) Significant increase in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score < 2 at week 16 (34.2% vs. 4.2%; AD 30.5%, 95% CI 22.3 to 38.7). In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the OLYMPIA 1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis, nemolizumab was superior to placebo with respect to ≥ 4-point improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale score at week 16.

### Nemolizumab-ilto (Nemluvio) [^9ed16603]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Prurigo Nodularis

Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (OLYMPIA 1 [NCT04501666] and OLYMPIA 2 [NCT04501679]) enrolled a total of 560 adult subjects with prurigo nodularis (PN). Disease severity was defined using an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) in the overall assessment of prurigo nodularis nodules on a severity scale of 0 to 4. Subjects enrolled in these two trials had an IGA score ≥ 3, severe pruritus as defined by a weekly average of the peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS) score of ≥ 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, and greater than or equal to 20 nodular lesions. OLYMPIA 1 and OLYMPIA 2 assessed the effect of NEMLUVIO on the signs and symptoms of PN, targeting improvement in skin lesions and pruritus over 16 weeks. In OLYMPIA 1, subjects were extended up to 24 weeks of treatment.

Subjects weighing less than 90 kg in the NEMLUVIO group received subcutaneous injections of NEMLUVIO 60 mg at Week 0, followed by NEMLUVIO 30 mg injections every 4 weeks. Subjects weighing 90 kg or more in the NEMLUVIO group received subcutaneous injections of NEMLUVIO 60 mg at Week 0 and every 4 weeks.

### Severe pemphigoid nodularis successfully treated with dupilumab [^0364bfc9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab could act on other components of PN such as pruritus and nodule formation. Chronic itch is a complex neuroimmunological process dependent on neuronal IL‐4Ra signaling. IL‐4 and IL‐13 activate directly itch sensory neurons in mice and humans. A recent study revealed similarities between PN and prurigo in the expression patterns of a6‐ and b4‐integrin, suggesting a similar epidermal hyperproliferative condition. Thus, by analogy to prurigo, IL‐4 could be implicated in nodule formation in PN by stimulating keratinocyte proliferation.

We report a case of PN successfully treated with dupilumab. IL‐4 and IL‐13 inhibition could be a promising therapeutic option in different clinical types of bullous pemphigoid.

### Efficacy and safety of multiple dupilumab dose regimens after initial successful treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1b94c1d3]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Once AD clinical response is achieved, it is unknown whether control could be maintained with longer dosage intervals or even treatment withdrawal. Psoriasis studies suggest that intermittent administration of biologics can reduce their efficacy and increase risk of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) or of safety issues.

The objectives of Study to Confirm the Efficacy and Safety of Different Dupilumab Dose Regimens in Adults With Atopic Dermatitis (LIBERTY AD SOLO-CONTINUE, hereafter referred to as SOLO-CONTINUE) were to evaluate maintenance of clinical response and long-term safety of dupilumab monotherapy at the original (300 mg every week or every 2 weeks) or less frequent regimens or drug withdrawal for an additional 36 weeks in patients treated with dupilumab who achieved predefined treatment-success end points in SOLO 1 or 2.

### Laboratory safety of dupilumab in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: results from three phase III trials (LIBERTY AD SOLO 1, LIBERTY AD SOLO 2, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS) [^e41b2020]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, although transient reductions in neutrophils and platelets as well as transient increases in blood eosinophils were observed in a small number of dupilumab‐treated patients, they were not associated with any clinically significant AEs. The laboratory data described here, along with the efficacy and safety data provided in the previous reports of these studies, demonstrate that dupilumab results in a favourable risk/benefit ratio profile, further supporting the use of dupilumab as a systemic treatment for long‐term management of moderate‐to‐severe AD. 21, 22, 23 Consistent with clinical trial data, EU 20 and U.S. 19 prescribing information do not require routine laboratory monitoring in clinical practice before initiation or during treatment with dupilumab. Because patient exclusion criteria in the dupilumab trials may have limited the variability of the study population, real‐world evidence, including long‐term data beyond 52 weeks of treatment, will provide additional valuable information on the role of laboratory monitoring in dupilumab‐treated patients with AD.

### Efficacy and safety of abrocitinib in prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus of unknown origin: a nonrandomized controlled trial [^d661f6fe]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Primary End Point

The primary efficacy end point was the percent change in average weekly PP-NRS score from baseline to week 12. Patients used a daily diary to record their daily maximum itch intensity, ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable). Average weekly PP-NRS scores reflect patients' mean PP-NRS in the previous 7 days.

Secondary End Points

Secondary end points included percentage of participants achieving at least a 4-point reduction in weekly PP-NRS from baseline to week 12; percentage of participants achieving at least a 4-point reduction in weekly Sleep Disturbance Numerical Rating Scale (SD-NRS) from baseline to week 12; and change from baseline to week 12 in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), PN Investigator Global Assessment (PN-IGA), Prurigo Activity Score (PAS), 5-D Pruritus Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient-Reported Outcomes Information System Itch Questionnaire (PROMIS IQ), and EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) scores.

### Simultaneous treatment of samter triad and prurigo nodularis with dupilumab [^98437bcd]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 76-year-old man with a history of allergic rhinitis, ST (asthma, CRSwNP, and nonallergic hypersensitivity aspirin), and AD presented to dermatology with generalized pruritus and non healing skin lesions. He reported a history of a recalcitrant methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus skin infection of the left knee recently treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Clobetasol cream 0.05% applied twice daily for his skin lesions was ineffective, and over-the-counter antihistamines provided little relief for his itching. Of note, the patient also had a history of multiple sinus operations for his CRSwNP, as well as poorly controlled asthma and ineffective desensitization for his aspirin hypersensitivity. Endoscopy 7 months previously showed numerous prominent nasal polyps with a Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT) score of 8. The patient was already taking daily montelukast for his persistent asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Upon conducting physical examination, the patient had multiple erythematous, violaceous papules and nodules with central excoriations on his extremities and trunk sparing the mid-back (Figs 1 and 2). His exam revealed no evidence of active AD. A shave biopsy was performed on a nodule on the right medial thigh and was consistent with the clinical impression of PN. Omalizumab was not tried due to its lack of efficacy for the treatment of non-immunoglobulin E-related conditions, such as the patient's history of AD. Cyclosporine was contraindicated due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency. Dupilumab (600 mg subcutaneously followed by 300 mg every 2 weeks) was chosen as a preferred treatment given its approved indication for the patient's recalcitrant CRSwNP, asthma, and prior history of AD. The patient reported complete skin clearance within 4 weeks of treatment with dupilumab (Fig 3) with only minor pruritus that was responsive to cetirizine 10 mg. Three months after starting dupilumab, a routine follow-up visit with otolaryngology revealed good nasal airflow with only mild obstruction, reduction in the size of his nasal polyps, and an improved SNOT score of 5. He also indicated that he had resolution of his allergic rhinitis symptoms and a dramatic reduction in his need to use inhaled corticosteroids for asthma-related symptoms.

### Clinically meaningful responses to dupilumab in adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: post-hoc analyses from a randomized clinical trial [^3c8e9e61]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The response to dupilumab treatment observed in adolescents with AD is comparable to that observed in adults, a finding consistent with the type 2-driven pathophysiology of AD at various ages and clinical presentation of AD in young children and adults.

Because the signs and symptoms of AD are multidimensional, no single instrument captures the full burden of disease and benefit of treatment. The IGA was used for the primary endpoint of the LIBERTY AD ADOL trial because it provides an easy and accepted means to score disease severity; however, the IGA may not account for the multidimensional impact of treatment on AD signs, symptoms, and QoL in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Therefore, simply assessing the proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 after treatment may underestimate the holistic benefits of systemic therapy for moderate-to-severe AD, as recently demonstrated in adults. As observed in this study, patients receiving dupilumab monotherapy who did not achieve an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 16 nonetheless experienced clinically meaningful improvements in signs, symptoms, and QoL. Atopic dermatitis is a multidimensional disease and patients may have a response in one or more of these three domains, as demonstrated in Figs. 1 and 3 (percentages of patients having improvement in one or more of these domains); note that most dupilumab-treated patients had a response in at least one domain.

### Simultaneous treatment of samter triad and prurigo nodularis with dupilumab [^54cee6b2]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Samter triad (ST) is characterized by 3 clinical hallmarks: asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), and a nonallergic hypersensitivity reaction to aspirin. A fourth hallmark, chronic hyperplastic sinusitis, has also been described, making aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease the preferred name for certain clinicians.ST is linked to increased T-helper 2 (Th2) activity with increased circulating Interleukin 4 (IL-4), interferon gamma, and leukotrienes. Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a disease characterized by severely pruritic papules and nodules that result from an intense cycle of itching and scratching. While the exact pathophysiology of PN is not fully elucidated, Th2-derived cytokines (eg, IL-4 and IL-31) have been shown to be overexpressed in classical skin lesions. There are no approved therapies for PN, and treatment includes topical steroids in combination with reducing picking and scratching behaviors.

Dupilumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4Rα, resulting in dual inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13. Dupilumab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), CRSwNP, and asthma; however, it is not approved for ST or PN. The shared role of Th2-related cytokines in the pathogenesis of both ST and PN suggests that dupilumab may be an effective treatment for both conditions as underscored by recent publications. Here, we report the simultaneous improvement of ST and PN in a patient treated with dupilumab.

Efficacy outcomes

By week 2 of the phase IIa study, EASI decreased with a mean (± SD) percentage change from baseline of −37 (± 34) and −33 (± 28) after a single dose of dupilumab 2 mg kg −1 and 4 mg kg −1, respectively; improvements in EASI were maintained up to week 52 in the OLE [−92 (± 14) and −84 (± 17) in 2‐mg kg −1 and 4‐mg kg −1 groups, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3a, Figure S3 a; see Supporting Information)]. The proportions of patients achieving EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 at week 12 in the phase IIa study further increased until week 52 in the OLE. By week 12 of the phase IIa study, 56% and 47% of patients receiving dupilumab 2 mg kg −1 and 4 mg kg −1 achieved EASI 75, with proportions increasing to 94% and 75% at week 52 of the OLE, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3b). Similarly, by week 12 of the phase IIa study, 17% and 21% of patients receiving dupilumab 2 mg kg −1 and 4 mg kg −1 achieved IGA 0/1 with proportions further increasing to 76% and 25% at week 52 of the OLE, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3c).
