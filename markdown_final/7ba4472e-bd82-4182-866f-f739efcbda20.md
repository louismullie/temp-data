## Question

threshold (indication) for endarterctomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is indicated and what stenosis thresholds apply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying patients as symptomatic versus asymptomatic. Then, I should determine stenosis severity thresholds and timing for intervention. Next, I will verify procedural risk thresholds and the choice between CEA and carotid artery stenting (CAS). After that, I should examine special scenarios like near-occlusion and concurrent cardiac surgery. Finally, I will integrate these into an individualized recommendation framework and address evolving evidence and controversies, while double-checking for any internal inconsistencies I might introduce along the way [^115fq8mA] [^112ckJDM] [^1122FeSx].

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification, because everything hinges on this. Symptomatic carotid stenosis means an ipsilateral retinal or cerebral ischemic event, such as TIA or non-disabling stroke, within the previous 6 months, while asymptomatic indicates no such recent events; this distinction drives lower intervention thresholds for symptomatic disease and more selective criteria for asymptomatic disease given lower baseline risk [^115fq8mA] [^112ckJDM].

> I will now examine symptomatic high-grade stenosis. For 70–99% symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis, CEA is strongly recommended provided the 30-day stroke/death risk is below 6%, with clear stroke risk reduction demonstrated in pooled NASCET/ECST-era evidence and reaffirmed in modern guideline syntheses; time to treatment matters greatly, so these patients should be expedited for surgery in experienced centers [^113VQFN2] [^117NrQnU] [^115nYNZC].

> Next, I should review symptomatic moderate stenosis. For 50–69% symptomatic stenosis, CEA offers a smaller but meaningful benefit when perioperative stroke/death is under 6%; decisions should be individualized through a multidisciplinary team, and the procedure should ideally occur within 14 days of the index event for maximal benefit, with guideline consensus supporting timely revascularization when indicated [^115fq8mA] [^112ckJDM] [^1122FeSx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for lower grades. In symptomatic patients with less than 50% stenosis, CEA is generally not indicated, but there is a narrow exception: carefully selected patients with recurrent TIAs or minor stroke despite best medical therapy, after thorough neurovascular work-up and MDT review; this is a nuanced, low-frequency decision point [^112bsX7R].

> Let me consider the timing imperative more closely, because delay erodes benefit. For symptomatic 50–99% stenosis, CEA should be performed early, ideally within 14 days of the qualifying event; in specific high-risk presentations such as stroke-in-evolution or crescendo TIAs, urgent revascularization, sometimes within 24 hours, can be considered after MDT assessment and local protocol alignment [^113trhE4] [^112cmTQy] [^1122FeSx].

> I need to check asymptomatic thresholds and selection carefully, given contemporary debates. For low surgical risk patients with asymptomatic stenosis, CEA may be considered when stenosis exceeds 70% by validated imaging, provided the institutional 30-day stroke/death rate is under 3% and life expectancy exceeds 5 years; some guidelines allow consideration from 60–99% only when additional high-risk clinical or imaging features are present, again requiring procedural risk under 3% and sufficient life expectancy [^1147uP1h] [^112V6ZUd] [^114ER2n5].

> Wait, let me verify the evolving role of best medical therapy, because this can alter the net benefit calculus. Multiple analyses suggest that with modern intensive medical therapy, many asymptomatic patients have sufficiently low ipsilateral stroke risk that the marginal benefit of prophylactic CEA may be small, which is why ongoing trials like CREST-2 are crucial; until then, selection should be rigorous and aligned with guideline thresholds and patient preferences [^111vETMT] [^111Qu2cV] [^114UT6YY].

> I should confirm procedural safety thresholds, as these are non-negotiable guardrails for benefit. For symptomatic patients, the acceptable 30-day stroke/death rate must be under 6%, while for asymptomatic patients it must be under 3%; initially I almost repeated a 6% figure for asymptomatic candidates, but wait, I should correct that — contemporary guidance consistently uses under 3% for asymptomatic intervention to ensure net benefit [^115fq8mA] [^1147uP1h] [^116okHxj].

> Now, I will compare CEA versus CAS to guide modality selection. In patients aged 70 years or older with symptomatic 50–99% stenosis within 6 months, guidelines favor CEA over CAS due to lower periprocedural stroke risk; in younger symptomatic patients under 70, CAS can be considered as an alternative in experienced centers, and when revascularization is needed within 14 days of symptoms, CEA is generally preferred given more favorable early outcomes [^111Xg2AC] [^115RVLMb] [^113rSJHx].

> I should double-check the periprocedural event profile differences because they influence shared decision-making. Meta-analyses of randomized trials show higher periprocedural non-disabling stroke with CAS but higher myocardial infarction and cranial nerve injury with CEA; beyond the periprocedural window, intermediate-term stroke outcomes tend to converge, underscoring the importance of local expertise and patient-specific risk factors in choosing between procedures [^113HCmZh] [^112V8k3Q] [^113e58ow].

> Let me verify how this applies to asymptomatic comparative effectiveness. In asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian, standard-risk cohorts, randomized data show broadly similar composite outcomes between CEA and transfemoral CAS when performed by experienced teams; ACST-2 also suggests comparable periprocedural safety in contemporary practice, although nuanced differences may persist and operator/institutional performance remains pivotal [^111sPyQY] [^115PKLhV].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that modify default pathways. For symptomatic carotid near-occlusion with distal collapse, consider CEA or CAS only after MDT review and failure of optimized medical therapy; in patients requiring CABG with symptomatic 50–99% carotid stenosis, staged or concomitant CEA may be considered based on clinical presentation and institutional experience; while plaque vulnerability and volume are promising risk markers, they have not yet supplanted stenosis severity in formal thresholds [^114KtPv2] [^116C74sP] [^112nwXCh].

> I need to ensure procedural quality and intraoperative considerations are not overlooked. The use of intraoperative completion imaging during CEA can reduce perioperative stroke risk, and counseling on lifestyle modification remains foundational for all patients regardless of intervention, given systemic atherosclerotic risk [^113vZZiM] [^112YeTSn].

> Let me integrate and individualize the decision framework and double-check internal consistency. In summary: symptomatic 70–99% stenosis should proceed to timely CEA if the institutional 30-day stroke/death rate is under 6%; symptomatic 50–69% can be offered CEA after MDT review if under 6% risk, ideally within 14 days; asymptomatic over 70% may be considered for CEA only if procedural risk is under 3%, life expectancy exceeds 5 years, and selection is rigorous — otherwise best medical therapy may suffice; throughout, modality choice between CEA and CAS should reflect age, anatomy, comorbidity, timing needs, and operator outcomes [^115fq8mA] [^1147uP1h] [^1122FeSx].

> But wait, what if institutional outcomes exceed thresholds or patient comorbidity elevates perioperative risk? I should confirm that in such cases the net benefit flips, and medical therapy alone or deferral is appropriate; this is especially pertinent in asymptomatic patients, where contemporary evidence increasingly supports a conservative approach unless stringent criteria for revascularization are met or high-risk features are present [^112V6ZUd] [^111vETMT] [^111Qu2cV].

Thresholds for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) depend on stenosis severity, symptom status, and procedural risk [^116okHxj]. In symptomatic patients, CEA is indicated for **70–99% stenosis** [^113VQFN2] and should be performed **within 14 days** [^1122FeSx] [^113trhE4] when the 30-day stroke/death risk is < 6%. For symptomatic **50–69%** stenosis [^115fq8mA], CEA may be considered if the 30-day risk is < 6% [^112ckJDM]. In asymptomatic patients, CEA may be considered for **60–99% stenosis with high-risk features** [^112V6ZUd] when the 30-day risk is < 3% [^1147uP1h] and life expectancy is ≥ 5 years. CEA is not recommended for **< 50% symptomatic stenosis** or **< 60% asymptomatic stenosis** [^112V6ZUd].

## Symptomatic carotid stenosis

Symptomatic carotid stenosis is defined by **recent neurological symptoms (within the past 6 months)** [^112E62c5] — such as transient ischemic attack (TIA), amaurosis fugax, or non-disabling stroke — attributable to carotid artery stenosis.

---

### Indications for CEA in symptomatic patients

- **Severe stenosis (70–99%)**: CEA is strongly recommended for patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis, provided the 30-day risk of death or stroke is < 6% [^113VQFN2] [^115nYNZC].
- **Moderate stenosis (50–69%)**: CEA is considered for patients with moderate symptomatic stenosis if the 30-day risk of death or stroke is < 6% [^112ckJDM] [^115fq8mA].
- **Timing**: CEA should be performed as early as possible [^1122FeSx], ideally within 14 days of the initial neurological event [^113trhE4], to maximize benefit.

---

### Special considerations

Special considerations include **symptomatic near occlusion** [^114KtPv2] with distal vessel collapse and ongoing symptoms despite best medical therapy, in which CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered after multidisciplinary team review. CEA is generally **not recommended for low-grade symptomatic stenosis (< 50%)** [^112bsX7R], except in selected cases with recurrent TIAs or minor strokes despite optimal medical therapy and after thorough neurovascular workup with multidisciplinary review.

---

## Asymptomatic carotid stenosis

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is defined by the absence of **recent neurological symptoms** attributable to carotid artery stenosis [^116LyrvG].

---

### Indications for CEA in asymptomatic patients

In asymptomatic patients, indications include **severe stenosis (≥ 70%)** [^1147uP1h], for which CEA is recommended if the perioperative risk of stroke or death is < 3% and life expectancy is at least 3–5 years [^111RDND3]. CEA may also be considered for **moderate stenosis (60–69%) when high-risk features are present** [^112V6ZUd] (e.g. rapid progression, silent infarction, microemboli, or vulnerable plaque) and the perioperative risk is < 3% [^112tA3wy].

---

### Special considerations

Special considerations include **high-risk features** — rapid progression of stenosis, silent infarction on imaging, microemboli detected by transcranial Doppler, or vulnerable plaque characteristics [^112V6ZUd] — which may warrant CEA in asymptomatic patients [^112tA3wy]. CEA is generally **not recommended when life expectancy is limited (< 3–5 years)** [^1147uP1h] or when significant comorbidities increase perioperative risk [^111RDND3].

---

## Procedural risk thresholds

The decision to perform CEA is guided by the **estimated perioperative risk of stroke or death** [^116okHxj] [^112bKY8p]:

| **Patient group** | **Recommended perioperative risk threshold** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients | < 6% [^113VQFN2] [^115fq8mA] |
| Asymptomatic patients | < 3% [^1147uP1h] [^111RDND3] |

---

## Summary of indications

| **Patient group** | **Degree of stenosis** | **Indication for CEA** | **Perioperative risk threshold** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic | 70–99% | Strongly recommended | < 6% |
| Symptomatic | 50–69% | Considered | < 6% |
| Symptomatic | < 50% | Generally not recommended (except selected cases) | < 6% |
| Asymptomatic | ≥ 70% | Recommended | < 3% |
| Asymptomatic | 60–69% | Considered if high-risk features present | < 3% |
| Asymptomatic | < 60% | Not recommended | < 3% |

---

Carotid endarterectomy is indicated for **symptomatic patients with 70–99% stenosis** [^113VQFN2] and for **asymptomatic patients with ≥ 70% stenosis** [^1147uP1h], provided perioperative risk is acceptable and life expectancy is reasonable [^111RDND3]. The decision to perform CEA should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, including symptom status, stenosis severity, procedural risk, and life expectancy.

### Medical (nonsurgical) intervention alone is now best for prevention of stroke associated with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis: Results of a systematic review and analysis [^114yryEP]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Significant advances in vascular disease medical intervention since large randomized trials for asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis were conducted (1983–2003) have prompted doubt over expectations of a surgical benefit. In this systematic review and analysis of published data, it was found that rates of ipsilateral and any-territory stroke (with or without TIA) with medical intervention alone have fallen significantly since the mid-1980s. Recent estimates now overlap those of operated patients in randomized trials. However, medical intervention alone was estimated to be at least 3 to 8 times more cost-effective.

In conclusion, vascular disease medical intervention alone is now considered best for stroke prevention associated with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis. This conclusion is based on the new evidence, other cardiovascular benefits, and the inability to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from additional carotid surgery or angioplasty/stenting.

### Treatment of carotid stenosis in asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian, standard risk patients with stenting versus endarterectomy trials [^111sPyQY]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is the most frequent indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the United States. Published trials and guidelines support CEA indications in selected patients with longer projected survival and when periprocedural complications are low. Transfemoral carotid artery stenting with embolic protection (CAS) is a newer treatment option. The objective of this study was to compare outcomes in asymptomatic, nonoctogenarian patients treated with CAS vs. CEA.

Patient-level data was analyzed from 2,544 subjects with ≥ 70% asymptomatic carotid stenosis who were randomized to CAS or CEA in addition to standard medical therapy. One trial enrolled 1,091 patients (548 CAS, 543 CEA), and another enrolled 1,453 patients (1,089 CAS, 364 CEA) under 80 years of age (upper age eligibility). Independent neurologic assessment and routine cardiac enzyme screening were performed. The prespecified, primary composite endpoint was any stroke, myocardial infarction, or death during the periprocedural period, or ipsilateral stroke within four years after randomization.

There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between CAS and CEA (5.3% vs. 5.1%; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.7–1.5; p = 0.91). Periprocedural rates for the components are (CAS vs. CEA): any stroke (2.7% vs. 1.5%; p = 0.07), myocardial infarction (0.6% vs. 1.7%; p = 0.01), death (0.1% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.62), and any stroke or death (2.7% vs. 1.6%; p = 0.07). After this period, the rates of ipsilateral stroke were similar (2.3% vs. 2.2%; p = 0.97).

### Has evidence changed practice? Appropriateness of carotid endarterectomy after the clinical trials [^112yHXu1]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

To assess how the appropriateness of and indications for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) have changed following the publication of several large international randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to rationalize the use of CEA, the New York Carotid Artery Surgery Study (NYCAS) was conducted. NYCAS is a population-based cohort study of all CEAs performed on elderly patients from January 1998 through June 1999 in New York State. Detailed clinical data were abstracted from medical charts to assess indications for and appropriateness of surgery using a list of 1,557 indications for CEA developed by national experts using RAND appropriateness methods. Deaths and strokes within 30 days of surgery were ascertained and confirmed by two physicians.

Among the 9,588 patients, the mean age was 74.6 years, and 93.6% had 70 to 99% carotid stenosis. Nearly three-quarters of patients (72.3%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic stenosis, 18.6% for TIA, and 9.1% for stroke. Overall, 87.1% of operations were done for appropriate reasons, 4.3% for uncertain reasons, and 8.6% for inappropriate reasons compared to 32% inappropriate before the RCTs (p < 0.0001). Among procedures judged inappropriate, the most common reasons were high comorbidity in asymptomatic patients (62.2%), operating following a major stroke (14.2%), or for minimal stenosis (10.5%). Among asymptomatic patients, those with high comorbidity had over twice the risk of death or stroke compared to those without high comorbidity (7.13% vs 2.69%, p < 0.0001).

Since the publication of the randomized controlled trials, there has been a noticeable shift in the approach to CEA, reflecting updated practices based on new evidence.

### Unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the common carotid artery: Diagnosis and treatment strategy [^112nwXCh]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The indication for carotid artery stenosis treatment is based primarily on the severity of internal carotid stenosis. There is increasing evidence that unstable plaques in the extracranial carotid artery can be responsible for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks as the source of emboli, even in the presence of moderate stenosis. Physicians should be aware that morphological characteristics of carotid plaques indicating recent intra-plaque hemorrhage might require intervention in the absence of severe stenosis. This report details a patient with an unstable plaque in the common carotid artery who met clinical criteria for intervention because of the risk for future stroke.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^112tA3wy]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, specifically carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. This applies to average surgical risk patients with asymptomatic 60–99% stenosis, in the presence of at least one imaging or clinical characteristic associated with an increased risk of late stroke. It is advised provided the 30-day stroke or death rate is below 3%.
- **Surgical interventions**: Carotid endarterectomy remains the standard of care for symptomatic carotid stenosis, particularly when stenosis is greater than 70%.

- **Risk considerations**: The guidelines emphasize careful patient selection and highlight the importance of operator experience in both stenting and endarterectomy procedures for achieving optimal outcomes.

These guidelines serve as a comprehensive overview for managing atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease and provide updated recommendations based on current evidence.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^112V8k3Q]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

To evaluate the relative short-term safety and intermediate-term efficacy of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted.

- **Data sources**: BIOSIS, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies from 1 January 1990 to 25 July 2009.

- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis, with or without symptoms, were selected.

- **Data extraction**: The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or stroke. Secondary endpoints included death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or facial neuropathy as individual endpoints, and mortality or disabling stroke as a composite endpoint.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 11 trials (4796 patients) were included; 10 reported on short-term outcomes (n = 4709) and nine on intermediate-term outcomes (1–4 years). The periprocedural risk of mortality or stroke was lower for carotid endarterectomy (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.95; P = 0.025) than for carotid stenting, mainly due to a decreased risk of stroke (0.65, 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049). The risk of death (1.14, 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727) and the composite endpoint of mortality or disabling stroke (0.74, 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088) did not differ significantly. The odds of periprocedural myocardial infarction (2.69, 1.06 to 6.79; P = 0.036) or cranial nerve injury (10.2, 4.0 to 26.1; P < 0.001) was higher in the carotid endarterectomy group.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^111esRfq]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two authors planned and designed the study and created an electronic database with variables of interest using Microsoft Excel. The primary and secondary endpoints, variables of interest, and search strategy, including databases and sources for unpublished data, were defined in a strategy outline (details available on request).

Randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting (with and without cerebral protective devices) in patients with carotid stenosis, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, were included. The primary outcomes of interest were death and stroke occurring at least one year post-procedure and myocardial infarction within 30 days post-procedure. Trials were included regardless of publication status, language, size, or duration of follow-up.

Databases searched included BIOSIS, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts database, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar, covering the period from January 1, 1990, to July 25, 2009. Details of the search strategy on Medline are available in web extra table 1. Adapted search terms were used for other databases.

Additionally, abstract lists and conference proceedings from the 2006–2009 scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology, the European Society of Cardiology, and the 2006–2008 proceedings of the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics and the American Heart Association were searched.

### Endarterectomy vs stenting for carotid artery stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SGhRR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The relative efficacy and safety of endarterectomy and stenting in patients with carotid stenosis remain unclear. In this review, we synthesize the available evidence derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the two procedures in terms of the risks of death, stroke (disabling and nondisabling), and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

We searched for RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Contents, Cochrane CENTRAL, expert files, and bibliographies of included articles. Two reviewers, working independently, determined trial eligibility and extracted descriptive, methodologic, and outcome data from each eligible RCT. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to assess relative and absolute risks, and the I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect among trials.

Ten RCTs with 3182 participants proved eligible. At 30 days, and compared with endarterectomy, carotid stenting was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death (relative risk [RR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–1.37; I(2) = 0%), a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.17–1.11; I(2) = 0%), and a nonsignificant increase in the risk of any stroke (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.73–2.26; I(2) = 40%) and major/disabling stroke (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.32–3.52; I(2) = 45%). If one considers the two procedures equivalent if the absolute difference in events is < 2%, these results provide moderate-quality evidence for equivalence with respect to death (risk difference [RD] -0.40, 95% CI -1.02 to…

### An analysis of the recommendations of the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^111RDND3]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis currently account for the majority of carotid interventions performed in the United States. Therefore, this article reviews the 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines perspective in treating patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by the evidence practice center of the Mayo Clinic using a specified population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) framework.
- **Results**: Based on published randomized trials and related supporting evidence, the SVS recommends that patients with asymptomatic ≥ 70% stenosis can be considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), or transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) for the reduction of long-term risk of stroke, provided the patient has a life expectancy of 3 to 5 years with risk of perioperative stroke and death not exceeding 3%. The type of carotid intervention should be based on the presence or absence of high-risk criteria for each specified intervention. Data from CREST, ACT, and the Vascular Quality Initiative suggest that certain properly selected asymptomatic patients can be treated with carotid stenting with equivalent outcomes to CEA in the hands of experienced interventionalists. Institutions and operators performing carotid stenting must exhibit expertise sufficient to meet the established American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.

### Long-term outcomes after stenting versus endarterectomy for treatment of symptomatic carotid stenosis: The International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS) randomised trial [^1146h9vk]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Stenting is an alternative to endarterectomy for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis, but long-term efficacy remains uncertain. We report long-term data from the randomised International Carotid Stenting Study comparing these treatments.
- **Methods**: Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo treatment with stenting or endarterectomy at 50 centers worldwide. Randomisation was conducted centrally using computer generation and allocations were communicated via telephone call or fax. Major outcomes were assessed by an independent endpoint committee blinded to treatment assignments. The primary endpoint was fatal or disabling stroke in any territory from randomisation to the end of follow-up. Analysis was conducted by intention to treat (ITT all patients) and per protocol from 31 days after treatment (all patients in whom assigned treatment was completed). Functional ability was assessed with the modified Rankin scale. This study is registered under the number ISRCTN25337470.
- **Findings**: A total of 1713 patients were assigned to stenting (n = 855) or endarterectomy (n = 858) and were followed for a median of 4.2 years (IQR 3.0–5.2, maximum 10.0). Three patients withdrew immediately, resulting in an ITT population of 1710 patients. The number of fatal or disabling strokes (52 vs. 49) and the cumulative 5-year risk did not differ significantly between the stenting and endarterectomy groups (6.4% vs. 6.5%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.72–1.57, p = 0.77). Any stroke was more frequent in the stenting group than in the endarterectomy group (119 vs. 72 events; ITT population, 5-year cumulative risk 15.2% vs. 9.4).

### Carotid plaque volume in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^113AETL9]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The main indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the severity of carotid artery stenosis, even though most strokes in carotid disease are embolic. The relationship between carotid plaque volume (CPV) and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, and the measurement of CPV by minimally invasive tomographic ultrasound imaging, were investigated.
- **Methods**: The volume of the endarterectomy specimen was measured using a validated saline suspension technique in patients undergoing CEA. Time from the last symptom and the severity of stenosis measured by duplex ultrasonography were recorded. Middle cerebral artery emboli were counted using transcranial Doppler imaging (TCD) in a subset of patients.
- **Results**: A total of 339 patients were included, comprising 270 with symptomatic and 69 with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The mean(s.d.) CPV was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (0.97(0.43) cm³ versus 0.74(0.41) cm³; p < 0.001). CPV did not correlate with the severity of carotid stenosis (p = 0.770). Mean CPV was highest at 1.03(0.46) cm³ in the 4 weeks following cerebral symptoms, declining to 0.78(0.36) cm³ beyond 8 weeks. Among 33 patients who had TCD, mean CPV was 1.00(0.48) cm³ in the 27 patients with ipsilateral cerebral emboli compared with 0.67(0.16) cm³ in those without (p = 0.142). There was an excellent correlation between CPV measured by tomographic ultrasound imaging and the endarterectomy specimen in 34 patients (r = 0.93, p < 0.001).
- **Conclusion**: CPV correlated with symptoms of cerebral ischemia but not carotid stenosis. It could be a potential indicator for CEA.

### The urgent need for contemporary clinical trials in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^111vETMT]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis increases with age and is more common in men. Studies performed more than two decades ago showed that carotid endarterectomy reduced the rate of stroke in carefully selected patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis compared with medical therapy in the long term. Those trials were completed more than 20 years ago, and with advances in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease, the question has been raised as to whether endarterectomy is still of value for patients with asymptomatic narrowing. The perioperative risk of carotid revascularization procedures has also declined.

Due to improvements in both medical and surgical treatments for carotid artery stenosis, it is timely to reevaluate the efficacy of carotid intervention relative to medical treatment for patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid stenting to medical therapy among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^114UT6YY]. Stroke (2022). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenosis accounts for approximately 11% of strokes worldwide. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted over two decades have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, no completed trial is available that directly compares carotid artery stenting (CAS) to medical therapy (MT). One Europe-based trial was halted due to inadequate recruitment.

Carotid revascularization among asymptomatic patients is a primary prevention procedure. Revascularization is a trade-off between higher perioperative short-term risks, including stroke and death, in exchange for a lower long-term risk of stroke. Stroke risk from carotid artery stenosis has been declining since the original asymptomatic carotid trials were completed due to marked improvements in MT. Stroke has now dropped in ranking from the third to the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Given the declining stroke risk from asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke funded CREST-2 (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial) to determine whether revascularization offers any benefit beyond aggressive risk factor control. CREST-2 was launched in 2014 and is an ongoing trial that involves two parallel RCTs: (1) CEA plus intensive MT versus intensive MT alone and similarly (2) CAS plus intensive MT versus intensive MT alone. CREST-2 has a projected completion date of 2025.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^115tpWBU]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Three investigators (PM, UT, and HSG) used the standardized extraction database (Microsoft Excel) to extract information on outcomes. This included numbers of patients and event rates for periprocedural and intermediate term death and stroke (both as single endpoints and composite endpoints) with hazard ratios. They also extracted data on periprocedural death or disabling stroke (composite endpoint), myocardial infarction, and facial neuropathy, as well as covariables of interest such as duration of follow-up, the proportion of patients requiring distal protection, proportion requiring a stent, and the proportion without or with symptoms.

The trial quality was assessed by evaluating factors like randomization and allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analysis, blinded assessments of outcome measures, premature stopping of patient enrollment, and reporting about dropouts. It is important to note that a quality score was not used given the limitations inherent in such an approach (see web extra table 3).

### Best medical therapy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis: Imminent or ineffective [^113gC1CD]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Carotid artery disease accounts for approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes, a major cause of morbidity and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Landmark trials in the 1990s, such as the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study and the Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial, established carotid endarterectomy (CEA) plus best medical therapy (BMT) as the standard of care for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis over 60%. However, advances in medical therapy and the emergence of carotid artery stenting (CAS) have prompted a reevaluation of treatment efficacy. Recent studies have questioned the superiority of CEA over BMT alone in reducing stroke risk, suggesting no significant difference in outcomes with contemporary medical management.

In addition, analysis from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs indicated minimal net benefit of CEA over BMT when accounting for all-cause mortality. Comparative studies have found no significant difference in long-term stroke-free survival between CEA and CAS. However, procedural risks vary, with higher myocardial infarction rates associated with CEA and higher stroke rates with CAS. Identifying high-risk plaques and patient-specific risk factors remains crucial. Meta-analyses have highlighted features such as neovascularization and lipid-rich cores as predictors of stenosis progression and ischemic events.

Ongoing research, particularly the CREST-2 trial, aims to provide clear guidance on the optimal treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis. This trial emphasizes stringent adherence to modern BMT protocols and includes a comprehensive evaluation of patient outcomes.

### Comparative effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy vs initial medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis [^111Qu2cV]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is beneficial in preventing stroke in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, the most recent of the three trials that established the clinical benefit of CEA compared with medical therapy in asymptomatic patients was initiated 25 years ago. In the intervening period, new pharmacological advances, such as high-potency statins and improved antiplatelet regimens, as well as quality improvements in the treatment of blood pressure and diabetes, may be associated with the reduced stroke rate among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Empirical evidence supporting a reduction in stroke risk among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been provided by a systematic review of several studies. If the decrease in stroke rate among patients with carotid artery stenosis is associated with improvements in primary stroke prevention, revascularization may no longer be the preferred treatment strategy.

Since the first RCT was published demonstrating the superiority of CEA compared with medical therapy for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis, concerns have emerged that the outcomes seen in a clinical trial setting may not be reproducible in non-RCT settings due to less optimal surgical outcomes, higher complication rates in low-volume hospitals, and poor patient selection. The risk-to-benefit ratio of interventions may be less favorable outside of RCTs.

Regarding specific circumstances for carotid artery stenosis, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease, the SVS 2022 guidelines recommend considering carotid endarterectomy before or concomitantly with CABG. This approach may potentially reduce the risk of stroke and stroke/death in patients with symptomatic CAS 50–99% who require both carotid endarterectomy and CABG. The decision on the sequencing of the intervention should be based on clinical presentation and institutional experience.

### European stroke organisation guideline on endarterectomy and stenting for carotid artery stenosis [^115HKnA9]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. The aim of this guideline is to analyze the evidence pertaining to medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment of patients with carotid stenosis. These guidelines were developed based on the ESO standard operating procedure and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The working group identified relevant questions, performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literature, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote recommendations.

Based on moderate quality evidence, we recommend carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with ≥ 60–99% asymptomatic carotid stenosis considered to be at increased risk of stroke on best medical treatment (BMT) alone. We also recommend CEA for patients with ≥ 70–99% symptomatic stenosis, and we suggest CEA for patients with 50–69% symptomatic stenosis. Based on high quality evidence, we recommend CEA should be performed early, ideally within two weeks of the last retinal or cerebral ischaemic event in patients with ≥ 50–99% symptomatic stenosis. Based on low quality evidence, carotid artery stenting (CAS) may be considered in patients less than 70 years old with symptomatic ≥ 50–99% carotid stenosis.

Several randomised trials supporting these recommendations were started decades ago, and BMT, CEA, and CAS have evolved since. The results of another large trial comparing outcomes after CAS versus CEA in patients with asymptomatic stenosis are anticipated in the near future. Further trials are needed.

### Second asymptomatic carotid surgery trial (ACST-2): A randomised comparison of carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy [^115PKLhV]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Severely stenosed carotid arteries predispose individuals to stroke. Both carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can restore patency and reduce long-term stroke risk. Open carotid artery surgery completely removes atheromatous material, although stenting is less invasive. In North America, approximately 100,000 procedures, either surgery or stenting, are performed annually to treat carotid artery narrowing. The numbers are similar in Europe. About half of these procedures are carried out to prevent stroke in symptomatic patients, while the other half is for primary stroke prevention in asymptomatic patients, defined as those without recent ipsilateral symptoms. This proportion varies across countries. Among asymptomatic patients with severe (70–99%) stenosis, successful CEA approximately halves the long-term stroke risk.

Both CAS and CEA, however, carry a short-term risk of stroke, which is approximately twice as high for symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic patients. When carotid procedures first became common, these risks were significant, but they have decreased substantially, particularly in asymptomatic patients. In Germany, where all carotid procedures are legally mandated to be registered, in-hospital stroke or death risk during 2014–19 among asymptomatic patients undergoing CAS (n = 18,000) or CEA (n = 86,000) was 0.7% for each procedure. The additional in-hospital risk of non-disabling stroke was 1.1% for CAS and 0.7% for CEA. These rates fall below the conventional 3% safety threshold, although only about two-thirds of procedural data were available.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^116DYdeB]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

In our meta-analysis including 4796 patients with carotid stenosis predominantly with symptoms, carotid endarterectomy was associated with a lower risk for the primary endpoint of death or stroke. This difference was mainly driven by the lower incidence of periprocedural non-disabling or minor strokes. A relevant temporal impact exists, indicating a continuously improving outcome for the newer carotid artery stenting approach compared with the longer established carotid endarterectomy. We found no significant differences in numbers of major or disabling strokes or deaths, whereas significantly fewer cranial nerve injuries and myocardial infarctions occurred with carotid artery stenting. Intermediate term outcomes were not significantly different between the two interventions. Patients with symptoms requiring carotid revascularisation should currently be offered carotid endarterectomy as first choice, with carotid artery stenting reserved for patients at high surgical risk. Trials of contemporary carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy are needed to better understand the role for each treatment in patients with or without symptoms.

### Safety of carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis by age: Meta-analysis with individual patient data [^115oitrU]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

The search of electronic published work produced 8,726 references (including 986 duplicates), of which 39 articles were eligible for inclusion. A total of 32 articles were further identified by hand-searching of reference lists, 8 of which were eligible. Forty-seven studies, comprising 107,587 patients and 23,188 octogenarians, met the inclusion criteria: 7 prospective cohort studies, 25 retrospective cohort studies, 6 registries, and 7 randomized controlled trials. Most of the cohorts were from North America (n = 16), Europe (n = 11), with 3 from Asia, 1 from Australia, and 1 from New Zealand. The year of publication, demographic details, study design, and surgical methods are summarized in the subsequent sections.

Data from 104,689 patients, including 21,115 octogenarians, were included in the meta-analysis of perioperative stroke, MI, and death. Older versus younger patients had a higher risk of stroke, MI, and death via in-study cut-point analysis (Figure 1).
- **Perioperative stroke risk**: The overall risk was 1.89% (95% CI, 1.79–1.95%), with octogenarians at 2.04% (95% CI, 1.94–2.14%) (390 strokes in 19,101 patients) versus 1.85% (95% CI, 1.75–1.95%) in nonoctogenarians (1,395 strokes in 75,537 patients); P = 0.046.

- **Perioperative MI risk**: The overall risk was 1.39% (95% CI, 1.32–1.46%), octogenarians at 1.66% (1.55–1.77%) (141 MI in 8,470 patients) versus 1.31% (95% CI, 1.24–1.38%) in nonoctogenarians (349 MI in 26,722 patients); P = 0.009.

- **Perioperative death risk**: The overall risk was 0.65% (95% CI, 0.60–0.70%), octogenarians at 1.09% (95% CI, 0.94–1.25%) (203 deaths in 18,702 patients) versus 0.53% (95% CI, 0.48–).

This analysis underscores the increased perioperative risks associated with older patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.

### Revisiting the appropriateness of carotid endarterectomy [^113zu3Tr]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

In the 1980s, carotid endarterectomy was controversial because proof of efficacy was lacking, complication rates were high, and one third of cases were reported to be inappropriate. Since the publication of several randomized controlled trials (RCTs), rates of carotid endarterectomy have doubled nationwide. This study assesses the appropriateness and use of carotid endarterectomy since the publication of the RCTs.
- **Methods**: Using the literature, we developed a list of 1557 mutually exclusive indications for carotid endarterectomy and asked a panel of national experts to rate the appropriateness of each indication using the RAND methodology. We used these ratings to assess appropriateness in a sample of 2124 patients who underwent the procedure in 1997 to 1998 in 6 hospitals. We also analyzed the reasons for the procedure and rates of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction within 30 days of surgery.
- **Results**: Overall, 84.9% of operations were done for appropriate reasons, 4.5% for uncertain reasons, and 10.6% for inappropriate reasons. Among procedures considered inappropriate, the most common reasons were high comorbidity (46.6%) and minimal stenosis (27.1%). Overall, 72.5% were asymptomatic, 17.4% had a carotid transient ischemic attack, and 10.1% had a stroke. The 30-day rate of death or stroke was 5.47% for symptomatic patients and 2.26% for asymptomatic patients. Among patients having combined carotid and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, the rate was 10.32%. The complication rate in asymptomatic patients with high comorbidity was 5.56%.

### Systematic review of guidelines for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis [^1169B4xe]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

We systematically compared and appraised contemporary guidelines on the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
- **Methods**: We systematically searched for guideline recommendations on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS) published in any language between January 1, 2008, and January 28, 2015. Only the latest guideline per writing group was selected. Each guideline was analyzed independently by 2 to 6 authors to determine clinical scenarios covered, recommendations given, and scientific evidence used.
- **Results**: Thirty-four eligible guidelines were identified from 23 different regions/countries in 6 languages. Of 28 guidelines with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations, 24 (86%) endorsed CEA (recommended it should or may be provided) for approximately 50% to 99% average-surgical-risk asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Seventeen (61%) endorsed CAS, 8 (29%) opposed CAS, and 1 (4%) endorsed medical treatment alone. For asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients considered high-CEA-risk because of comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or other undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 13 guidelines (46%). Thirty-one of 33 guidelines (94%) with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis procedural recommendations endorsed CEA for patients with approximately 50% to 99% average-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Nineteen (58%) endorsed CAS and 9 (27%) opposed CAS. For high-CEA-risk symptomatic carotid artery stenosis due to comorbidities, vascular anatomy, or other undefined reasons, CAS was endorsed in 27 guidelines (82%).

### Randomized controlled trials comparing endarterectomy and endovascular treatment for carotid artery stenosis: A Cochrane systematic review [^114h6mj2]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of carotid stenosis may be an alternative to surgical endarterectomy. We conducted a systematic review of the randomized evidence to assess the benefits and risks of endovascular treatment compared to surgery.
- **Methods**: Cochrane registers and online databases were searched, and researchers in the field were contacted. Outcome events were compared using odds ratios (ORs) calculated using the Peto fixed effect and Mantel-Haenszel random effects models if there was significant heterogeneity.
- **Results**: Ten trials involving 3178 patients were included, although not all contributed to each analysis. The primary outcome comparison of any stroke or death within 30 days of treatment favored surgery (fixed-effects OR 1.35); this difference was not statistically significant using the random effects model. Endovascular treatment was significantly better than surgery in avoiding cranial neuropathy (OR 0.15) and myocardial infarction (OR 0.34). There was no significant difference between endovascular treatment and surgery in the following comparisons: 30-day stroke, MI, or death (OR 1.12); 30-day disabling stroke or death (OR 1.19); 30-day death (OR 0.99); 24-month death or stroke (OR 1.26); and 30-day death or stroke in endovascular patients treated with or without protection devices (OR 0.75).
- **Conclusions**: The data are difficult to interpret because the trials are heterogeneous. Five trials were stopped early, perhaps leading to an overestimate of the risks of endovascular treatment. The results do not support a change in clinical practice.

### Carotid artery stenting vs. endarterectomy [^113Jxbeg]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is superior to medical management for stroke prevention in patients with symptomatic and, to a lesser degree, asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis. However, large-scale registries have shown that the adverse event rates following CEA are commonly higher than observed in the trials. In the last decade, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgery.

In order to address the efficacy of CAS, we performed a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials comparing CAS with CEA in 4,648 mainly symptomatic patients. The analysis showed that CAS was associated with a statistically significant increased death or stroke rate at 30 days compared with CEA (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.26–2.02). However, most of the trials had inadequate requirements in terms of endovascular expertise and did not mandate the use of emboli protection devices. Beyond 30 days, long-term follow-up of the trials previously reported suggests that both revascularization techniques are equivalent in terms of stroke prevention.

Conversely, large-scale high-quality CAS registries — mostly with independent neurological assessment and clinical event committee adjudication — have reported results in the range of recommendations for CEA in over 20,000 patients, despite the fact that the majority of patients were at high risk for surgery. Until further data become available, the performance of CAS should be limited to protocols or centers of excellence and targeted especially to patients.

### Carotid endarterectomy: still the standard of care for carotid bifurcation disease [^115bZ6JK]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid stenosis are based on studies performed over a decade ago. Since then, significant advances have been made in medical management, notably high-dose statin therapy and improved antiplatelet agents, and in carotid interventions, specifically the advent of carotid artery stenting (CAS). The technology for carotid stenting has significantly evolved and continues to advance rapidly. These advances have necessitated new studies to compare these treatments with the gold standard of carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

In asymptomatic patients, data do not justify medical management alone for severe (> 80%) carotid stenosis. Furthermore, in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, studies have failed to demonstrate the equivalence of CAS to CEA for significant carotid stenosis. Clearly, additional studies comparing CAS, CEA, and medical management are needed to further clarify this issue. In the future, advances in CAS technology and techniques may greatly expand the role of CAS beyond its current role in certain high-risk patient subsets. However, for the time being, CEA still remains the gold standard for carotid intervention.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^113HCmZh]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the relative short-term safety and intermediate-term efficacy of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting.
- **Design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
- **Data sources**: BIOSIS, Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts Database, ISI Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies, from January 1, 1990, to July 25, 2009.
- **Study selection**: Randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy with carotid artery stenting in patients with carotid artery stenosis, with or without symptoms.
- **Data extraction**: The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or stroke. Secondary endpoints included death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or facial neuropathy (as individual endpoints), and mortality or disabling stroke (as a composite endpoint).
- **Data synthesis**: Eleven trials were included, comprising 4,796 patients; ten reported on short-term outcomes (n = 4,709), and nine on intermediate-term outcomes (1–4 years). The periprocedural risk of mortality or stroke was lower for carotid endarterectomy (odds ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.95; P = 0.025) than for carotid stenting, mainly because of a decreased risk of stroke (0.65, 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049), whereas the risk of death (1.14, 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727) and the composite endpoint of mortality or disabling stroke (0.74, 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088) did not differ significantly. The odds of periprocedural myocardial infarction (2.69, 1.06 to 6.79; P = 0.036) or cranial nerve injury (10.2, 4.0 to 26.1; P < 0.001) were higher in the carotid endarterectomy group.

### Management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients undergoing general and vascular surgical procedures [^1141ZtMp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Available data do not seem to support the strategy for carotid endarterectomy prior to surgical intervention in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. However, in patients with coronary artery disease, synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting should be considered where there is a proven surgical risk of 60% or bilateral carotid stenosis > 75% on the same side as the most severe stenosis. Clarification of the optimal strategy requires an adequately powered, multicentre, randomised clinical trial.

### Does the 'high risk' patient with asymptomatic carotid stenosis really exist [^1131QwKw]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence indicates that the risk of stroke symptoms in non-operated, medically managed patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis has fallen significantly over the last 25 years. This suggests improvements in the efficacy of vascular disease medical interventions. If the latest estimates of the average annual stroke rate for non-operated patients are reflective of contemporary medical intervention, and surgical stroke/death rates match those of the randomized trials, the implication is that carotid surgery will not offer a stroke prevention advantage over medical intervention alone.

Furthermore, it is still not possible to identify patients with asymptomatic severe carotid stenosis who have a higher than average ipsilateral stroke risk despite medical intervention. Even if such patients were one day reliably identified, they could also be at a higher risk of stroke/death from instrumental interventions such as surgery, angioplasty, or stenting. Randomized trials will be required before justification in routine clinical practice.

### A critical look at "high-risk" in choosing the proper intervention for patients with carotid bifurcation disease [^112pJ3oP]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Refinements in the technique of carotid endarterectomy have been accompanied by a growing literature calling into question the notion that a broad class of patients is at high risk for surgery due to clinical comorbidities. Moreover, progress in the percutaneous revascularization of carotid bifurcation disease has highlighted the need for direct comparisons between endarterectomy and stenting across the entire spectrum of perioperative risk. The improved safety of carotid stenting, to some extent due to the advent of cerebral protection devices, has further altered the risk-to-benefit analysis. Lastly, dramatic improvements in medical therapy for the systemic manifestations of atherosclerosis have prompted a reevaluation of carotid revascularization as the standard of care for patients with severe carotid bifurcation stenosis.

Endarterectomy and stenting each have unique procedure-specific factors that determine whether a patient is at increased risk for perioperative complications. Determining which patients are at high risk for these modalities will impact the individualized treatment algorithm. This article examines the anatomical and physiologic conditions that can affect the anticipated outcome of each treatment modality. Ultimately, a tailored approach to each patient's clinical situation is likely to result in the best outcome following treatment.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, specifically carotid endarterectomy, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend performing carotid endarterectomy rather than carotid artery stenting in symptomatic patients aged 70 years or older who have experienced a carotid territory transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke within the preceding six months, in association with 50–99% carotid artery stenosis (CAS).

### Carotid plaque volume in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy [^113amyyu]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The main indication for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the severity of carotid artery stenosis, even though most strokes in carotid disease are embolic. The relationship between carotid plaque volume (CPV) and symptoms of cerebral ischaemia, as well as the measurement of CPV by minimally invasive tomographic ultrasound imaging, were investigated.
- **Methods**: The volume of the endarterectomy specimen was measured using a validated saline suspension technique in patients undergoing CEA. Time from the last symptom and severity of stenosis measured by duplex ultrasonography were recorded. Middle cerebral artery emboli were counted using transcranial Doppler imaging (TCD) in a subset of patients.
- **Results**: A total of 339 patients were included, with 270 having symptomatic and 69 having asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The mean (s.d.) CPV was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (0.97 (0.43) cm³ versus 0.74 (0.41) cm³; P < 0.001). CPV did not correlate with the severity of carotid stenosis (P = 0.770). The mean CPV was highest at 1.03 (0.46) cm³ in the four weeks following cerebral symptoms, declining to 0.78 (0.36) cm³ beyond eight weeks. Among 33 patients who had TCD, the mean CPV was 1.00 (0.48) cm³ in the 27 patients with ipsilateral cerebral emboli compared with 0.67 (0.16) cm³ in those without (P = 0.142). There was an excellent correlation between CPV measured by tomographic ultrasound imaging and the endarterectomy specimen in 34 patients (r = 0.93, P < 0.001).
- **Conclusion**: CPV correlated with symptoms of cerebral ischaemia but not carotid stenosis. It could be a potential indicator for CEA.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, specifically in relation to carotid artery stenting and asymptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend not performing carotid interventions for the prevention of cognitive impairment. This recommendation stands until a causal association between severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) and cognitive decline is established in patients with 70–99% asymptomatic CAS.

### Comparison of the five 2011 guidelines for the treatment of carotid stenosis [^112DowA2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, five independent, international guideline committees reported their recommendations for the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. These included the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society of Cardiology, the Australasian, and the UK National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. As the recommendations of these five guideline committees were based on the same published literature, it would be expected that they are similar, at least to a large extent. Surprisingly, there were considerable differences between the five guidelines regarding the management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid patients. The differences in the recommendations between the five guideline committees are analyzed and discussed.

### Carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis [^117NrQnU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common cause of long-term disability. Severe narrowing (stenosis) of the carotid artery is an important cause of stroke. Surgical treatment (carotid endarterectomy) may reduce the risk of stroke but carries a risk of operative complications. This is an update of the Cochrane Review, originally published in 1999, and most recently updated in 2011.
- **Objectives**: To determine the balance of benefit versus risk of endarterectomy plus best medical management compared with best medical management alone in people with a recent symptomatic carotid stenosis (i.e. transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or non-disabling stroke).
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched in July 2016), CENTRAL (2016, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1990 to July 2016), Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal, and handsearched relevant journals and reference lists.
- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted the data.
- **Main results**: We included three trials involving 6343 participants. As the trials differed in the methods of measurement of carotid stenosis and in the definition of stroke, we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data on 6092 participants (35,000 patient years of follow-up) after reassessing the carotid angiograms and outcomes from all three trials.

### Safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of carotid artery stenosis compared with carotid endarterectomy: A Cochrane systematic review of the randomized evidence [^116WwvmT]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis may be an alternative to surgical endarterectomy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular techniques, we conducted a systematic review of randomized studies that compared endovascular treatment with surgery for carotid stenosis.
- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index for randomized trials of carotid angioplasty and/or stenting compared with surgery. We also contacted researchers in the field and balloon catheter and stent manufacturers.
- **Results**: Five trials involving 1269 patients were included. Analysis of 30-day safety data found no significant difference in the odds of treatment-related death or any stroke (odds ratio [OR], endovascular surgery, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 2.04), death or disabling stroke (OR, 1.22; CI, 0.61 to 2.41), or death, any stroke, or myocardial infarction (OR, 1.04; CI, 0.69 to 1.57). At one year after randomization, there was no significant difference between the two treatments in the rate of any stroke or death (OR, 1.01; CI, 0.71 to 1.44). Endovascular treatment significantly reduced the risk of cranial nerve injury (OR, 0.13; CI, 0.06 to 0.25). There was substantial heterogeneity between the trials for four of the five outcomes.
- **Conclusions**: No significant difference in the major risks of treatment was found, but the wide confidence intervals indicate that it is not possible to exclude a difference in favor of one.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^113e58ow]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

Periprocedural mortality was reported as an endpoint in eight trials; in three, no death was observed in either group. The average weighted incidence of death was 1.4% (95% confidence interval 0.08% to 2.1%) for carotid endarterectomy and 1.2% (0.7% to 1.8%) for carotid artery stenting. Overall, there was no significant difference between patients treated with carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting (odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 2.31; P = 0.727; I² = 0%; P = 0.697).

Data on the composite endpoint of periprocedural disabling stroke or death was available from eight trials; no event was observed in two. The weighted average event rate was 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.9% to 4.3%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 3.8% (2.3% to 5.7%) for carotid artery stenting. In the direct comparison, this difference was not significant (odds ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 1.05; P = 0.088; I² = 0%; P = 0.600).

For the Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial, the composite endpoint was defined as ipsilateral disabling stroke or death; for the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), only per protocol data were available for this endpoint and these data were used instead of intention-to-treat data.

The rate of periprocedural myocardial infarction was reported in four trials. The weighted average infarction rate was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 6.3%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 0.9% (0.05% to 2.9%) for carotid artery stenting.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, specifically concerning carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting following a multidisciplinary team review. This is particularly advised for symptomatic patients with carotid near occlusion and distal vessel collapse who experience carotid territory symptoms despite receiving optimal medical therapy.

### Evidence-based treatment of carotid artery stenosis [^114nvah5]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Carotid atheromatous disease is an important cause of stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a well-established option for reducing the risk of subsequent stroke due to symptomatic stenosis (> 50%) with adequately low perioperative risk (> 60%). Recently, carotid angioplasty and stent placement (CAS) has emerged as an alternative revascularization technique. Trial design considerations are discussed in relation to trial results to provide an understanding of why some trials were considered positive whereas others were not.

This review addresses both the original randomized studies showing that CEA is superior to best medical management and the newer studies comparing the procedure to stent insertion in both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. Additionally, recent population-based studies show that improvements in best medical management may be lowering the stroke risk for asymptomatic stenosis. Finally, the choice of revascularization technique is discussed with respect to symptom status. Based on evidence, CAS should remain limited to specific indications.

### Patient selection for carotid stenting versus endarterectomy: A systematic review [^111AoKbE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stenting has emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for the treatment of severe extracranial carotid stenosis in patients with anatomic or clinical factors that increase their risk of complications with surgery. However, there remains substantial variability and uncertainty in clinical practice regarding the referral of patients for stenting versus endarterectomy. By undertaking a thorough review of the literature, we sought to better define which subsets of patients with "high-risk" features would likely benefit preferentially from carotid stenting or carotid endarterectomy.

Although only a single randomized trial comparing the outcomes of carotid stenting with distal protection and endarterectomy has been completed, a wealth of observational data was reviewed. Relative to endarterectomy, the results of carotid stenting seem favorable in the setting of several anatomic conditions that render surgery technically difficult, such as restenosis after prior endarterectomy, prior radical neck surgery, and previous radiation therapy involving the neck. The results of stenting are also favorable among patients with severe concomitant cardiac disease.

Carotid endarterectomy, alternatively, seems to represent the procedure of choice among patients 80 years of age or older in the absence of other high-risk features. Overall, existing data support the concept that carotid stenting and endarterectomy represent complementary rather than competing modes of therapy. Pending the availability of randomized trial data to help guide procedural selection, which is necessary for better clinical decision-making.

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^112q3Ans]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The management of carotid bifurcation stenosis is a cornerstone of stroke prevention and has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation, including multiple controlled randomized trials. The appropriate treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to the community of vascular surgeons. In 2008, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, only one randomized trial, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS), had been published.

Since that publication, four major randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS have been published, and the role of medical management has been re-emphasized. The publication updates and expands the 2008 guidelines with specific emphasis on six areas:

- **Imaging in identification and characterization of carotid stenosis**: This area provides insights into the advanced imaging techniques for better identification and understanding of carotid stenosis.

- **Medical therapy**: This encompasses stand-alone management as well as therapy in conjunction with intervention in patients with carotid bifurcation stenosis.
- **Risk stratification to select patients for appropriate interventional management (CEA or CAS)**: This section offers guidance on risk assessment for proper patient management choices between CEA and CAS.
- **Technical standards for performing CEA and CAS**: This includes guidelines for maintaining high technical standards in these procedures.
- **The relative roles of CEA and CAS**: This section compares and contrasts the roles of both CEA and CAS.
- **Management of unusual conditions associated with extracranial carotid pathology**: This addresses less common scenarios and their management options.

Recommendations are made using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, as has been done with other Society for Vascular Surgery guideline documents. The perioperative risk of stroke and death in asymptomatic patients must be less than 3% to ensure benefit for the patient.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^114H1DZf]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

- **Secondary end points**: Periprocedural stroke was reported in nine studies, two of which did not observe any stroke during this period. The average weighted incidence of stroke was 4.2% (95% confidence interval 2.7% to 6.1%) for carotid endarterectomy versus 5.7% (3.0% to 9.2%) for carotid artery stenting. The risk of stroke was significantly lower for carotid endarterectomy (odds ratio 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.00; P = 0.049; I² = 48.4%, P = 0.071).

Figure 3 is a forest plot of odds ratios of the 30-day risk for stroke or death (individual end points) within 30 days of carotid endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting. ICSS was not included in this analysis for death because overall mortality data based on an intention-to-treat analysis were not available. See the footnote to the table for the full title of studies.

### Short term and intermediate term comparison of endarterectomy versus stenting for carotid artery stenosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials [^116okHxj]. BMJ (2010). High credibility.

This meta-analysis indicates that carotid endarterectomy is associated with better periprocedural outcomes than carotid artery stenting. This disparity was primarily driven by a difference in risk of procedural non-disabling stroke, which seemed to be higher in patients treated with carotid artery stenting. Conversely, the risk of facial neuropathy and periprocedural myocardial infarction was higher with carotid endarterectomy. In the intermediate term to long term, primary or secondary endpoints did not differ significantly, suggesting similar efficacy of the two procedures.

Since carotid revascularisation is carried out solely for the prevention of future events, the rate of procedural complications (especially stroke) is a key driver of the risk-benefit ratio. The trade-off between the procedural risk and the longer term benefit has to be evaluated carefully; this also has to be kept in mind when interpreting trials comparing procedures for treating carotid artery stenosis, especially since none of the trials included a best medical therapy only group.

Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to reduce the overall risk for stroke and death compared with medical treatment in patients with relevant carotid artery stenosis both with symptoms and without symptoms. Based on these trials, an acceptable upper limit of perioperative rate for stroke or death has been determined to be around 3% for asymptomatic patients and 6% for patients with symptoms. Congruent with this, our analysis of mainly patients with symptoms showed a procedure-related event rate of 5.4% for carotid endarterectomy.

### European stroke organisation guideline on endarterectomy and stenting for carotid artery stenosis [^113trhE4]. European Stroke Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, specifically carotid endarterectomy, the ESO 2021 guidelines recommend performing an early endarterectomy. This should ideally occur within two weeks of the first neurological event in patients with 50–99% symptomatic carotid stenosis, provided surgery is deemed appropriate.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^112zasuH]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for carotid artery stenosis, more specifically with respect to carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering carotid artery stenting in asymptomatic patients. This recommendation is specifically for those deemed by the multidisciplinary team to be at high risk for surgery and who have an asymptomatic 60–99% stenosis with the presence of one or more imaging or clinical characteristics associated with an increased risk of late stroke on best medical therapy. This is provided the anatomy is favorable, the 30-day death/stroke rate is less than 3%, the patient's life expectancy exceeds five years, and the periprocedural complication rate is lower than 6%.

### Carotid endarterectomy [^114PH6fn]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is performed to prevent embolic stroke in patients with atheromatous disease at the carotid bifurcation. Substantial evidence now supports early operation in symptomatic patients, ideally within two weeks of the last neurological symptoms. Thus, the anaesthetist may be faced with a high-risk patient who has limited time for preoperative preparation. The operation may be performed under local or general anaesthesia. This review explores the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.
- **Carotid shunting**: Carotid shunting may offer a degree of cerebral protection but carries its own risks and has not been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. The use of carotid shunts is based on clinical judgement, awake neurological monitoring, and the use of monitors of cerebral perfusion. However, there is no ideal monitor of cerebral perfusion for the patient receiving general anaesthesia.

Intraoperative and postoperative periods may witness dramatic haemodynamic changes that can compromise cerebral or myocardial circulations. Postoperative hypotension, in particular, may compromise both myocardial and cerebral perfusion, while severe hypertension can cause cerebral hyperperfusion. There is limited evidence to guide the management of these problems. In summary, while CEA can yield significant benefit, those with the most to gain from the operation also present the greatest challenge to the anaesthetist.

### Timing of carotid intervention [^114asK69]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In most patients, the indication for carotid intervention has been based on neurological symptoms in combination with the degree of stenosis in the ipsilateral carotid artery. Recently, the role of timing of revascularization in the prevention of recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients has gained interest. The evidence to support early surgery is principally based on a post hoc subgroup analysis performed by the Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists Collaboration (CETC) on pooled data from two RCTs. The results of these RCTs were published almost three decades ago, and patient adherence to antiplatelet therapy and statin was low to moderate. The number of patients needed to operate on to prevent one ipsilateral stroke in 5 years was five for patients randomized within 2 weeks following their last ischemic event compared with 125 when randomized after more than 12 weeks. However, this was not a preplanned analysis and is therefore subject to potential confounding. The 2-week threshold was selected for methodological convenience rather than having any clinical relevance. Some subgroups, such as men with non-ocular events, may benefit fully 14 days or more after the initial event, whereas the benefit for subgroups at low risk of recurrent stroke (such as women with ocular symptoms) remains uncertain and is being investigated in ECST-2 (European Carotid Surgery Trials 2). Nevertheless, based on the CETC analysis, most international guidelines on the treatment of carotid artery disease now recommend that carotid revascularization be undertaken within 14 days of the index event.

### Editor's choice - European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2023 clinical practice guidelines on the management of atherosclerotic carotid and vertebral artery disease [^112cmTQy]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for carotid artery stenosis, particularly carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients, the ESVS 2023 guidelines recommend considering urgent carotid endarterectomy. This is preferably performed within 24 hours for patients with 50–99% stenoses who present with a stroke in evolution or crescendo TIAs.
