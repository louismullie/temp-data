## Question

How should toenail onychomycosis be managed in a primary care setting?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage toenail onychomycosis in a primary care setting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should stratify severity to guide treatment selection. Next, I will compare oral versus topical options, verify dosing and safety monitoring, and decide when combination therapy is appropriate. After that, I should adapt for special populations, set follow-up and outcome expectations, outline referral triggers, and close with recurrence prevention and the real-world practice gap.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump straight to treatment, because clinical appearance alone is unreliable and roughly half of dystrophic nails are not fungal, which risks unnecessary cost and harm if I treat empirically without proof, especially with systemic agents [^112cyXJs]. I should obtain KOH microscopy and, if needed, culture or PAS histology to document fungus before oral therapy, while noting there is a cost-effectiveness debate where some models suggest empiric terbinafine could be less expensive at very high pretest probability, but guidelines still prioritize confirmation in routine care, so I need to balance prevalence, patient risk, and access to testing before deciding [^112cyXJs] [^115rAxDM].

> Next, I should assess severity and prognostic features to tailor therapy and set expectations, but wait, I should verify what cutoffs the evidence actually used because there is no universally accepted severity scale and studies have varied inclusion criteria [^112pHtES]. In practice, I consider mild to moderate disease when 20–50% of the nail plate is involved without matrix disease and severe disease when greater than 50%, multiple nails, matrix involvement, or dermatophytoma are present, recognizing that features like thick nails, lateral disease, and "yellow spikes" correlate with lower response rates and may push me toward combination therapy or referral sooner [^112pHtES] [^112dVcoD].

> For most adults with dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis, oral terbinafine is first-line given higher mycologic cure and durability compared with topicals or azoles, so I will prescribe terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12–16 weeks for toenails, with the understanding that continuous dosing outperforms pulse regimens in head-to-head trials and that long-term follow-up shows fewer relapses than with itraconazole, which I should discuss during shared decision-making [^114oMws9] [^1158mkjV] [^111DaRFd] [^112D9kKM] [^116mFGYf].

> I need to ensure safety screening is appropriate before systemic therapy, and here I have to be careful not to over-test or under-test; initially I thought I should always obtain LFTs and a CBC in all adults and especially everyone older than 65, but wait, let me verify the guideline language because I might be overgeneralizing [^114oMws9]. The BAD guideline recommends baseline LFTs and CBC in adults with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematologic abnormalities or other specific risk factors, not purely based on age, so I should individualize labs and avoid reflex testing unless risk is present, while still counseling about rare hepatotoxicity and checking drug interactions, noting terbinafine has fewer CYP interactions than azoles and is generally well tolerated in dermatophyte disease [^114oMws9] [^116mFGYf].

> When oral therapy is contraindicated or declined, I should consider topical efinaconazole 10% solution once daily for 48 weeks for mild to moderate disease, with realistic expectations that complete cure rates are lower than oral therapy but clinically meaningful improvement and mycologic cure are achievable, particularly if started earlier in disease course and maintained through the full application period, and I need to confirm that debridement is not required for efficacy with this agent unlike some older lacquers [^115bUy8N] [^1127Qx9o] [^115uG4C3].

> I should double-check how much efinaconazole to prescribe each month, and the data suggest the number of affected nails, not BMI or sex, is the primary driver of monthly usage, so for multiple-nail disease I will ensure sufficient volume to avoid underdosing and adherence barriers during the long treatment window [^115GBGAt].

> If efinaconazole is unavailable or unsuitable, I can consider alternative topicals such as amorolfine 5% once or twice weekly or ciclopirox 8% daily for prolonged courses, but I should counsel that efficacy is generally lower than oral terbinafine and typically reserved for superficial or distal mild disease or when systemic therapy is not an option, aligning with guideline recommendations and Cochrane data on relative performance of topicals [^117FtDr9] [^114q5VLm] [^1127Qx9o].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to combination therapy rather than switching agents sequentially, because severe disease and poor prognostic features benefit from multimodal treatment; the BAD guideline supports combination when topical monotherapy is likely inadequate, and evidence including an RCT of avulsion plus topical azole and pharmacoeconomic analyses supports combining oral and topical or surgical plus topical approaches to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness in selected patients [^1147QjSw] [^112jTDPo] [^117Ab1H3]. I will continue topical therapy to complete a full 48-week course even after finishing an oral course, since nail growth is slow and combination strategies capitalize on dual delivery pathways, with counseling that toenail regrowth can take 12–18 months to fully clear [^115MkSxK].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics, and I should confirm pediatric regimens because adult protocols do not translate directly; BAD guidelines recommend itraconazole pulse dosing at 5 mg/kg/day for 1 week per month for 2 pulses for fingernails and 3 pulses for toenails as a first-line option, or weight-based terbinafine as an alternative, with griseofulvin or fluconazole reserved when first-line agents are contraindicated, and I will obtain baseline labs in children at risk or if therapy is prolonged [^117PE5sZ] [^117WMPBu] [^1113KGt4] [^114K4GYx]. For adults with liver disease, I should avoid systemic therapy and use topicals, and in patients with significant polypharmacy, terbinafine is often safer than azoles due to fewer interactions, though I need to check each medication list carefully [^114oMws9] [^116mFGYf].

> I will now examine monitoring and outcome expectations, and I need to ensure I set realistic endpoints to avoid premature discontinuation; I will reassess every 12 weeks for adherence, adverse effects, and clinical progress, aiming for mycologic cure defined by negative KOH or culture and, ultimately, complete cure defined by a normal-appearing nail plus negative mycology, recognizing that with efinaconazole about a 31% complete cure and roughly 57% treatment success by week 72 are typical in long-term studies and that improvement accrues slowly with nail growth, with early disease responding better than long-standing disease [^1127Qx9o] [^112n8UzX] [^1116pzTv] [^115fZRgk]. For terbinafine, I will monitor clinically and repeat labs only if baseline risks or symptoms arise, and if there is no meaningful improvement by 24 weeks in an adherent patient with confirmed dermatophyte infection, I will reconsider organism, severity, adherence, and possibly escalate to combination therapy or refer [^114oMws9].

> Patient counseling is critical, and I should double-check that I address quality-of-life improvements and prevention; toenails grow slowly, so visible improvement may take many months, adherence to daily topical application or to the full oral course is essential, and concurrent tinea pedis should be treated with shoe and sock hygiene to reduce reinoculation, while acknowledging that evidence for prophylactic powders is limited, with a small RCT of miconazole showing no significant prevention benefit, and that overall QoL gains tend to be greater with oral therapy than with topical therapy [^115MkSxK] [^113Qb8BK] [^111B3Tnp].

> I should confirm referral thresholds so I do not delay specialty input; I will refer when there is diagnostic uncertainty with negative tests but persistent suspicion, severe or matrix-involved disease, suspected non-dermatophyte molds, immunosuppression or diabetes with complications, failure after appropriate therapy, or when considering surgical avulsion, and I will avoid recommending lasers or photodynamic therapies given guideline conclusions of insufficient evidence for these device-based approaches and the recommendation against debridement alone as definitive treatment [^115XwZqP] [^1172Y3Lp] [^116yweLU].

> But wait, what about practice patterns and cost realities, because these often drive choices in primary care; large datasets show a persistent gap between guideline-preferred oral therapy and real-world prescribing with many visits resulting in no treatment or preferential topical use in older adults, underscoring the need for diagnostic confirmation, evidence-based selection of oral therapy when appropriate, and counseling about safety and cost-effectiveness, with network meta-analyses reinforcing oral terbinafine's superior mycologic cure versus topical monotherapy [^114Atcth] [^117JT8Nm] [^1165yS17] [^115E7KY2] [^1158mkjV]. I should therefore proactively address misconceptions about oral antifungal risks, align treatment with disease severity and patient values, and implement prevention strategies to reduce relapse and reinfection in routine primary care practice [^115MkSxK].

In primary care, **confirm onychomycosis with KOH, culture, or PAS before treatment** [^112cyXJs] [^115rAxDM]. For dermatophyte toenail disease, **terbinafine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks** is first-line; check baseline LFTs and CBC in adults with liver or hematologic risk, and monitor LFTs if high-risk or on prolonged therapy [^114oMws9] [^111DaRFd]. Use **topical efinaconazole 10% once daily** for 48 weeks in mild disease or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^115bUy8N]. Combine oral and topical therapy for severe or refractory cases [^1147QjSw], and **educate on adherence, foot hygiene, and recurrence prevention**; refer to dermatology for severe, refractory, or atypical cases [^111Aifqk] [^117UpkWy].

---

## Diagnosis and confirmation

Accurate **diagnosis** is essential before initiating treatment. Clinical diagnosis alone is insufficient because it can mimic conditions such as psoriasis, lichen planus, or traumatic nail dystrophy. Therefore, confirmatory laboratory testing is recommended [^112cyXJs] [^115rAxDM]:

- **Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation**: Rapid, inexpensive, and widely available in primary care settings [^112cyXJs].

- **Fungal culture**: Gold standard for identifying the specific fungal organism, though results may take several weeks [^1127Qx9o].

- **Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain**: Highly sensitive histological method, particularly useful when KOH or culture results are inconclusive [^115rAxDM].

Confirmatory testing is particularly important before initiating **systemic therapy** to avoid unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects and drug interactions [^112cyXJs] [^115rAxDM].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment selection depends on the **severity of nail involvement**, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences. The primary options include systemic antifungal therapy, topical antifungal therapy, and combination therapy [^116mFGYf].

---

### Systemic antifungal therapy

Systemic antifungal agents are the **cornerstone of treatment** for moderate to severe onychomycosis, particularly with multiple nails or significant nail matrix involvement [^1158mkjV].

- **Terbinafine**: First-line systemic therapy for dermatophyte onychomycosis. Recommended dosage is 250 mg daily for 12 weeks for toenail infections [^114oMws9] [^111DaRFd]. Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and complete blood count (CBC) are recommended, particularly in patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities [^117BnDuN].

- **Itraconazole**: Alternative systemic therapy, particularly useful for non-dermatophyte molds or yeast infections. Recommended dosage is 200 mg daily for 12 weeks or pulse therapy (400 mg daily for 1 week per month, repeated for three pulses) [^112CywgH] [^113xB3gx].

- **Fluconazole**: Considered in patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. Dosage is 150–450 mg weekly for at least 6 months [^117BnDuN].

Systemic therapy requires **careful monitoring** for potential adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^114oMws9] [^117BnDuN].

---

### Topical antifungal therapy

Topical antifungal agents are suitable for **mild to moderate onychomycosis**, particularly when systemic therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated [^1127Qx9o] [^115uG4C3]. **Efinaconazole 10% solution** applied once daily for 48 weeks is recommended for mild to moderate distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO) [^115bUy8N] [^112pHtES]. **Ciclopirox 8% lacquer** is applied once daily for up to 48 weeks and is recommended when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^117FtDr9] [^114q5VLm]. Additionally, **topical therapy requires patient adherence** and regular nail debridement to enhance drug penetration [^115GBGAt] [^117UpkWy].

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy (systemic plus topical) is recommended for **severe or refractory cases**, particularly when response to topical monotherapy is likely to be poor [^1147QjSw]. It may improve cure rates and reduce recurrence [^112D9kKM].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patient education is critical to ensure **adherence to prolonged treatment regimens** and to prevent recurrence [^111nUh1S]. Key educational points include:

- **Importance of adherence**: Emphasize the need for consistent medication use and regular follow-up visits [^115GBGAt].

- **Foot hygiene**: Encourage regular washing and drying of feet, use of antifungal powders, and avoidance of shared footwear [^117UpkWy].

- **Recurrence prevention**: Educate patients on the chronic nature of onychomycosis and the importance of ongoing preventive measures [^111Aifqk] [^113Qb8BK].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **follow-up visits** are essential to monitor treatment response, adherence, and potential adverse effects [^111Aifqk]. Clinical and mycological cure should be confirmed through follow-up testing [^112cyXJs]. Recurrence rates are high, necessitating ongoing monitoring and preventive measures [^112dVcoD].

---

## Referral to dermatology

Referral to dermatology is indicated for **severe or refractory cases** with extensive nail involvement, failure of initial therapy, or dermatophytoma [^117UpkWy]. Referral is also appropriate for atypical presentations (e.g. suspected non-dermatophyte molds, yeast infections, or atypical nail dystrophy) and for immunocompromised patients with significant immunosuppression or complex comorbidities [^111Aifqk].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies, such as laser and photodynamic therapy, are currently **not recommended** because evidence for their efficacy and safety remains insufficient [^115XwZqP] [^1172Y3Lp] [^1127Qx9o] [^113CScMT].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommended agents** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Systemic therapy | Moderate to severe onychomycosis | Terbinafine 250 mg daily; Itraconazole 200 mg daily or pulse; Fluconazole 150–450 mg weekly | 12 weeks (terbinafine, itraconazole); ≥ 6 months (fluconazole) |
| Topical therapy | Mild to moderate onychomycosis | Efinaconazole 10% daily; Ciclopirox 8% daily | 48 weeks |
| Combination therapy | Severe or refractory cases | Systemic + topical therapy | 12–48 weeks |

---

Effective management of **toenail onychomycosis** in primary care involves accurate diagnosis, appropriate choice of systemic or topical therapy, patient education, and regular follow-up [^112cyXJs]. Systemic antifungal therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for moderate to severe cases, while topical therapy is suitable for mild cases or when systemic therapy is contraindicated [^116mFGYf]. Combination therapy is recommended for severe or refractory cases [^1147QjSw].

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis [^112pHtES]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains a difficult disorder to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents; not all patients are cured. Clinical experience suggests that several host-related factors can affect the chance of cure; however, supporting studies are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly those focused on topical agents, rely on severity classification when selecting patients for inclusion, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. Additionally, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

- **Objective**: To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

- **Methods**: Post hoc pooled analysis of two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in 1655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week post-treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement), moderate (30%-39%).

### Pilot study to evaluate a plasma device for the treatment of onychomycosis [^116P8zSy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit and is the most common of the nail disorders. Therapies for onychomycosis often have less than ideal efficacy and potential for adverse effects. Previous studies have shown that nonthermal plasma inhibits the in vitro growth of Trichophyton rubrum. Therefore, we conducted a pilot study on 19 participants with toenail onychomycosis to evaluate this treatment.

- **Primary endpoint**: The primary endpoint was the safety of the device. All but one patient met the safety endpoint, and there were no long-term sequelae.
- **Secondary outcome measures**: These included clinical efficacy and mycological cure. The overall clinical cure rate was 53.8%, and the mycological cure rate was 15.4%.
- **Patient satisfaction**: Satisfaction was measured using questionnaires upon study completion. The majority of patients reported being satisfied with the treatment.

Our conclusions are that nonthermal plasma is a safe treatment and may have a beneficial effect on toenail onychomycosis.

### Combination of surgical avulsion and topical therapy for single nail onychomycosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112jTDPo]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). High credibility.

Conventional therapy of onychomycosis is prolonged and often frustrating, which is why combination therapy involving topical, oral, and surgical measures has been advocated as the treatment of choice. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of nail avulsion followed by topical antifungal therapy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of combined surgical and topical therapy for onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: Forty patients with single nail onychomycosis — 28 with distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis, seven with total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO), and five with proximal subungual onychomycosis — were randomly assigned to four treatment groups. Each group received avulsion of the involved nail, followed by ketoconazole 2% cream without (group I) or with occlusion (group II), or oxiconazole 1% cream without (group III) or with occlusion (group IV). Topical therapies were applied twice daily. The patients were reviewed monthly and treatment was continued until the regrowth of completely normal nail (mycologically negative). In cured cases, further monthly review was carried out for at least 6 months without any form of therapy. At each visit, direct microscopic examination was repeated.

- **Results**: There was a high dropout rate, with seven patients (group I), six patients (group II), six patients (group III), and eight patients (group IV) completing the treatment protocol. Out of these, mycological cure was achieved in three (43%) patients in group I, four (67%) in group II, two (33%) in group III, and six (75%) in group IV. All the cases of TDO failed to respond to treatment.

### Toenail onychomycosis: current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

The dosage of itraconazole PO for the treatment of onychomycosis in adults is 200 mg PO daily for up to 12 weeks.

---

### Combination therapy for onychomycosis [^112D9kKM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Combination therapy is one way of improving the cure rate of onychomycosis. The LION study examined the efficacies of terbinafine and itraconazole. The Icelandic cohort of the study reported that after five years, only 46% of the terbinafine-treated patients and 13% of the itraconazole-treated patients were still disease-free, suggesting that relapses and reinfections were common in the long-term treatment of onychomycosis with monotherapy. Combination therapy is a well-established principle in mycology. The strategy involves the combination of oral and topical antifungal treatments.

A number of specific drug combinations have proved to be useful in the treatment of onychomycosis: tioconazole and griseofulvin, amorolfine and griseofulvin, amorolfine and terbinafine, and amorolfine and itraconazole. However, comparison of the combination trials can be difficult because of the short duration of some of the studies and variation in global cure rates. Although it is necessary to consider these factors, it is clear that combination therapy offers advantages when compared with monotherapy.

- **Administration methods**: Combination therapy can be administered sequentially or in parallel. Parallel therapy is recommended for patients who are likely to fail therapy (e.g. patients with diabetes), whereas sequential therapy is recommended for patients who show a poor response to initial treatment.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: A nationwide claims database study [^115E7KY2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

The preference of topical medications among some practitioners may lie in the misconception (by both patients and physicians) that oral medications are dangerous. Recently, studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole in older patients, a population with a higher prevalence of onychomycosis and often considered at higher risk for adverse effects. These data consistently support the idea that oral medications, particularly with agents such as terbinafine and fosravuconazole, are significantly more cost-effective than topical medications for the treatment of onychomycosis with an acceptable safety profile. While topical medications may have a role in certain cases, the evidence supports oral medications as the first-line treatment for onychomycosis from both efficacy and cost-effectiveness perspectives.

This study had some limitations. First, the NDB Open Data Japan does not link prescription data with diagnoses, which may have led to the inclusion of prescriptions for indications other than onychomycosis, therefore we focused on antifungal medications specifically indicated for onychomycosis treatment, such as efinaconazole, luliconazole (i.e. Luconac®), and fosravuconazole. Second, the lack of information on disease severity and treatment outcomes in the NDB Open Data Japan limits the interpretation of the appropriateness of the prescribing patterns of topical and oral medications. Thus, data from this study should be interpreted in conjunction with other studies that incorporate clinical data from electronic health records or surveys.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: A nationwide claims database study [^1165yS17]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, this study highlights the dynamic shifts in prescription patterns for onychomycosis treatment, particularly the rapid introduction of new antifungal medications, such as efinaconazole and fosravuconazole, which have significantly altered treatment approaches. Despite the guideline recommendations for oral medications, the predominance of topical treatments in older adults suggests a potential gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. Furthermore, the substantial economic impact of onychomycosis treatments, particularly newer antifungal medications, necessitates the assessment of their cost-effectiveness.

### Monotherapy for toenail onychomycosis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1158mkjV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds, accounting for approximately 50% of all nail-related diseases.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy and combination treatments for toenail onychomycosis using a network meta-analysis (NMA).

- **Methods**: Quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane-compliant rules and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using a random-effects NMA to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of direct and indirect comparisons among oral and topical treatments (PROSPERO 2015: CRD42018086912). There were not enough eligible combination and device-based therapy trials to include in the NMA.

- **Results**: Of 77 randomized controlled trials, 26 were included in the ORs (8136 patients). There were no significant inconsistencies between the direct and indirect evidence. Relative effects show that the odds of mycological cure with continuous terbinafine 250 mg or continuous itraconazole 200 mg are significantly greater than topical treatments. Fluconazole, pulse regimens of terbinafine and itraconazole, and topical treatments did not differ significantly in the odds of achieving mycological cure. The ORs of adverse events occurring with oral or topical treatments were not significantly different from each other. For mycological cure, evidence was of moderate or high quality, while evidence ranged from very low to high quality for adverse events.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^117PE5sZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend offering itraconazole (pulse therapy, 5 mg/kg/day for 1 week per month: 2 pulses for fingernail infection and 3 pulses for toenail infection) as first-line therapy in pediatric patients (aged 1–12 years) with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is important to monitor hepatic function tests in patients with pre-existing deranged results, those receiving continuous therapy for more than 1 month, or those using concomitant hepatotoxic drugs.

### Number of affected nails is the primary determinant of efinaconazole 10% solution usage for onychomycosis [^115GBGAt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Good adherence to treatment is necessary for the successful treatment of onychomycosis and requires that an appropriate amount of medication be prescribed. Most prescriptions for efinaconazole 10% solution, a topical azole antifungal, are for 4 mL per month, but there are no data on patient factors or disease characteristics that impact how much medication is needed. Data from two phase 3 studies of efinaconazole 10% solution for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis were pooled and analyzed to determine monthly medication usage based on the number of affected toenails, percent involvement of the target toenail, body mass index (BMI), and sex.

Participants with two or more affected nails required, on average, > 4 mL of efinaconazole per month, with increasing amounts needed based on the number of nails with onychomycosis (mean: 4.39 mL for 2 nails; 6.36 mL for 6 nails). In contrast, usage was not greatly impacted by target toenail involvement, BMI, or sex. Together, these data indicate that the number of affected nails should be the major consideration when determining the monthly efinaconazole quantity to prescribe.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^1116pzTv]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in the complete cure rate in the full analysis set were confirmed to increase over time until week 72 after starting efinaconazole application, achieving 31.1% at the final assessment. The complete cure rate in both patient populations with clinical involvements of 20–50% and more than 50% also increased over time, reaching 34.5% and 25.0%, respectively.

- **Secondary end-points**: Changes in the secondary end-points are discussed below.

	- **Complete cure rates**: Changes are shown according to severity from the start of efinaconazole 10% solution application to the final assessment. Complete cure was defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target nail, with a negative potassium hydroxide examination result. Complete cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.

	- **Mycological cure rate**: Changes in mycological cure rate are shown according to severity from the start of application to the final assessment. Mycological cure was defined as the negative result in the potassium hydroxide examination of the target nail. The mycological cure rate showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.

	- **Changes in clinical involvement over time**: Changes are shown according to severity from the start of application to the final assessment. The changes in clinical involvement showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.

	- **Decrease rate of clinical involvement**: Changes in the decrease rate of clinical involvement for each patient group showed a trend of improvement over time regardless of severity.

This study demonstrates the efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in improving both complete and mycological cure rates, as well as reducing clinical involvement in patients with onychomycosis.

### A review of lasers and light for the treatment of onychomycosis [^113CScMT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common fungal infection that affects many individuals. Systemic therapies are effective but are limited by their side effects and potential for hepatotoxicity. Topical therapies have less serious side effects yet provide only limited efficacy due to their inability to penetrate the nail plate. These limitations have led to the investigation of laser and light-based modalities as alternative treatment options for onychomycosis. This article provides an overview and critical assessment of the field of laser and other energy-based treatments for onychomycosis.

- **Study design/materials and methods**: A literature search was conducted on laser and light-based treatments for onychomycosis.

- **Results**: Early data are promising; however, many of these studies are small or poorly designed.

- **Conclusion**: Further evaluation and larger studies are needed to determine the optimal light source, pulse duration, and treatment schedule for long-term success.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^117BJe2v]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study clarifies the new efficacy of Efinaconazole (EFCZ) in subjects with onychomycosis and warrants higher safety. These properties may expand the potential of EFCZ as a treatment option for patients with various lesions and backgrounds. However, some patients resist treatment with EFCZ, suggesting that combination therapy with oral drugs or surgical treatments should be considered. Reports have shown improved cure rates after using a topical preparation in combination with an oral drug or nail debridement and that EFCZ combined with laser therapy enhances therapeutic efficacy. Further studies on these cases are expected. Topical treatment of onychomycosis may currently be at a turning point worldwide, and from the results of this study, EFCZ is predicted to become a practical option for treating onychomycosis.

### Therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis in the US [^115MkSxK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis affects around 14% of individuals in North America and Europe and is undertreated. Treatment is challenging as toenail growth can take 12–18 months, the nail plate may prevent drug penetration, and disease recurrence is common. National guidelines and consensus documents on onychomycosis diagnosis and treatment were last published more than five years ago, indicating that updated medical guidance is needed.

- **Methods**: This document aims to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of toenail onychomycosis following a roundtable discussion with a panel of dermatologists, podiatrists, and a microbiologist specializing in nail disease.

- **Results**: There was a general consensus on several topics regarding onychomycosis diagnosis, confirmatory laboratory testing, and medications. Onychomycosis should be assessed clinically and confirmed with microscopy, histology, and/or culture. Terbinafine is the primary choice for oral treatment and efinaconazole 10% for topical treatment. Efinaconazole can also be considered for off-label use for maintenance to prevent recurrences. For optimal outcomes, patients should be counseled regarding treatment expectations as well as follow-up care and maintenance post-treatment.

- **Conclusions**: This article provides important updates to previous guidelines and consensus documents to assist dermatologists and podiatrists in the diagnosis and treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

### Onychomycosis: Treatment and prevention of recurrence [^111Aifqk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions.

The epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series. In this article, we review the prognosis and response to onychomycosis treatment, medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and off-label therapies and devices. Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and emerging therapies are also described.

### Pulse versus continuous terbinafine for onychomycosis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^111DaRFd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). High credibility.

Effective treatments for onychomycosis are expensive. Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Objective**: Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse), was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail, and complete cure of all 10 toenails.

- **Results**: Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs. 58.7% [84/143]; p = 0.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs. 29.3% [42/143]; p = 0.007, RR = 1.52).

### Topical therapy for toenail onychomycosis: An evidence-based review [^115uG4C3]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing toenail onychomycosis with topical treatments is challenging. It is difficult for topical medication to penetrate the nail plate, and this is reflected in lower cure rates with topical treatment than with oral treatment. However, oral medications may not be suitable for some patients because of drug interactions; therefore, topical treatments are critical in managing the disease in certain patient populations.

- **Objective**: This paper reviews the quality and content of the scientific literature on topical treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Ovid (Medline and Embase), Scopus, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched for original clinical reports of topical monotherapy for microscopy and/or culture-confirmed toenail onychomycosis in adults. Studies were evaluated using an onychomycosis study quality scale, which was based on the CONSORT guidelines.

- **Results**: Twenty-five publications (28 studies) were identified and met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies scored high ratings on the quality scale; these were randomized controlled trials or randomized comparative trials. Low-quality studies were nonrandomized, open studies that prevented statistical analysis. Most studies reported clinical and mycological cure. The most variation was observed with reporting outcomes of clinical improvement. Amorolfine, ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole produced clinical and mycological cure in patients with mild to moderate toenail onychomycosis (< 50–65% nail involvement), with efinaconazole showing the highest rates.

In the specific context of onychomycosis, particularly concerning pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend offering terbinafine (62.5 mg/day for a 40 kg weight; for 6 weeks for fingernail infection and 12 weeks for toenail infection) as first-line therapy in pediatric patients aged 1–12 years with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is advised to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and complete blood counts (CBC) before commencing treatment.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^115Hr4QH]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

As described earlier, the results of our study suggest solutions for the two issues with EFCZ therapy: longer application for over 1 year and application to severe cases with more than 50% affected area.

- **Guidelines related to treatment**: In guidelines related to the treatment of onychomycosis, the use of topical drugs at the early stage of DLSO or SWO is recommended. Although oral therapy is recommended for severe cases, it is difficult to apply to patients with severe onychomycosis who are much older or with underlying diseases that are typically associated with drug interactions and polypharmacy. Consequently, in clinical practice, topical drugs are often administered to severe cases. Our study outcomes prove the possibility of EFCZ as a new treatment option available for severe cases.

- **Analysis by clinical type**: In our study, analysis by clinical type was also performed. Unlike DLSO, where the fungus enters underneath the distal part, the causative fungus grows on the surface layer of the nails in SWO; thus, topical treatment on the nail surface has a higher efficacy rate in SWO cases than in DLSO cases. In SWO, where the fungus locally exists on the surface layer of the nail, it is estimated that localization of fungus is more likely affected by the topical application of EFCZ. However, efinaconazole was developed based on the concept that it permeates the nail plate, a property that facilitates its action, and for its application on nails. In this study, like in SWO, a high efficacy rate was also observed in DLSO, indicating the high permeability of EFCZ in the nail plate.

### Pharmacoeconomic issues in onychomycosis [^117Ab1H3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The importance of health economics, which involves the application of economics to healthcare and medicine, has grown significantly in recent years as the need to maximize the use of limited healthcare resources has increased. Pharmacoeconomics, a branch of health economics applied to pharmaceuticals, evaluates outcomes and costs of treatment simultaneously, aiding better decision-making. However, there remains some uncertainty within the medical community about the usefulness of pharmacoeconomic data. Reasons for this include a poor understanding of the purpose and outcome of pharmacoeconomic studies, inconsistent use of terminology, and a perception that the freedom of choice for prescriptions is restricted.

To optimize the medical management of patients with severe onychomycosis, two pharmacoeconomic evaluations of amorolfine were undertaken. In a comparison of topical amorolfine combined with oral terbinafine versus oral terbinafine alone, treatment with the topical/oral combination for up to 12 weeks resulted in an improved outcome compared with the oral drug alone. A second study with topical amorolfine combined with oral itraconazole showed that treatment for a period of 6 weeks was the preferred cost-effective treatment option. While combination therapy might seem more costly, pharmacoeconomic studies have clearly shown that treatment of onychomycosis with amorolfine, in combination with either oral terbinafine or oral itraconazole, is both cost-saving and cost-effective compared with oral treatment alone.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^112reb1J]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

In our study, the treatment success rate in terms of the primary end-point (≤ 10% clinical involvement) was 56.6% in the eligible patients after applying EFCZ for up to 72 weeks. In the multinational phase III study for EFCZ in subjects with onychomycosis who had 20–50% area of nail involvement, the treatment success rate was defined as the percentage of subjects with less than 10% area of nail involvement.

The treatment success rate was 31.0%, and in the subgroup analysis in the Japanese population, this rate was 46.7% (48 weeks of application and assessed at week 52). Considering that the definitions of treatment success are slightly different in a precise sense and that our study included not only patients with DLSO but also those with SWO, an equable comparison is not possible. However, when comparing only with the population with an affected area of 20–50%, a similar trend of 57.6% (at week 48) was obtained in our study.

### Validity of self-reported nail counts in patients with onychomycosis: A retrospective pilot analysis [^111bjDG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails, is common and affects up to 8% of the general population. Telephone and mailed surveys conducted to study this disease are usually completed via patient self-report. However, the validity of the counts of diseased nails reported by patients in these surveys has not been established.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to assess the interrater agreement between patient and health care professional (HCP) counts of affected nails in patients with onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: Patient and HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails corresponding to a total of 567 patients originating from 3 different clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed. All these patients were initially classified as mycologically positive for toenail onychomycosis, and all three trials used identical self-administered questions regarding counts of infected toenails and fingernails. The level of agreement between patient versus HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails (based on collapsed and uncollapsed counts) was measured using the quadratically weighted kappa statistic.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight percent (213 out of 554, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 43%) of the 554 patients with self-reported and HCP counts of infected toenails had exact agreement; for these 554 patients, the quadratically weighted kappa was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.54). The highest agreement rates — 79%, 62%, and 50% — corresponded to the patients with HCP counts of affected toenails equaling 1, 2, and 10, respectively; that is, HCP counts at the extremes.

### Are boosters or supplementation of antifungal drugs of any use for treating onychomycosis [^1113EWYk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that there is a finite failure rate when treating onychomycosis. A case report from the author serves as an example of multiple failures following treatments of varying duration and combinations, including oral-local and then oral-oral therapies. This article discusses the results obtained by authors who have varied the standard duration of therapy, increased the dosage of the oral antifungal agents, or used two oral drugs in treating this condition.

### Onychomycosis treatment prescribed at only twenty percent of visits: A cross-sectional analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 2007 to 2016 [^114Atcth]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis represents the highest proportion of nail disorders seen in clinical practice. Onychomycosis management may differ amongst specialties, impacting patient outcomes and quality of life (QoL).

- **Objective**: We aimed to characterize onychomycosis treatment across specialties, accounting for patient demographics, to assess potential onychomycosis practice gaps.

- **Materials/Methods**: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional analysis using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 2007 to 2016.

- **Results**: Overall, 71.6% of onychomycosis visits were with general practitioners (GPs), 25.8% with dermatologists, and 2.58% with pediatricians. No onychomycosis treatment was prescribed at 82.0% of dermatology visits and 78.9% of GP visits. Dermatologists (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.27 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): [2.14–2.41]; P < 0.0001) and GPs (OR: 2.32 [2.21–2.44]; P < 0.0001) were more likely than pediatricians to prescribe treatment versus no treatment. Dermatologists were more likely than GPs to prescribe both no treatment versus treatment and topical versus oral antifungals (OR: 1.33 [1.16–1.52]; P < 0.0001 and OR: 4.20 [3.80–4.65]; P < 0.0001), respectively.

- **Discussion**: Our study showed that there is a low treatment rate for onychomycosis, with treatment prescribed at only 20% of visits. Untreated onychomycosis might result in secondary infection, pain, and negative QoL impact. Although dermatologists are specialists in nail disease management, they saw only about 25% of onychomycosis visits. Future efforts should be made to address these gaps in practice.

### Individual article: Updated review of topical pharmaceuticals and complementary and alternative medications for the treatment of onychomycosis in both general and special populations in the United States [^117SAvvE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a prevalent condition affecting both the United States and the global population. Treatment options are limited, with only three topical anti-fungal medications approved in the US in the last 25 years: ciclopirox, tavaborole, and efinaconazole. The economic impact and the quality of life burden due to onychomycosis are significant.

This article provides an up-to-date review of all approved topical anti-fungal therapies for toenail onychomycosis. It discusses treatment efficacies, pharmacology, and use in special populations, as well as evidence for complementary and alternative medicine.

### Clinical effectiveness of efinaconazole 10% solution for treatment of onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes [^116XJ4mL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a widespread condition in medical practice, affecting approximately 10% of the population in Japan. According to Japanese guidelines, the disease types are classified based on the fungal entry route into the following five categories: (i) distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO), (ii) superficial white onychomycosis, (iii) proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), (iv) endonyx onychomycosis, and (v) total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO). In addition, specific disease types such as onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes (characterized by yellow or white linear affected areas) or onychomycosis with dermatophytoma (identified by a round circumscribed yellow or white patch in the nail plate) may also be present.

Recently, DLSO with a V-shaped affected area at the tip of the nail is referred to as "wedge shape" in Japan. However, this is a normal manifestation of DLSO and differs from longitudinal spikes.

In clinical practice, oral antifungal drugs are effective for many cases. However, longitudinal spikes or dermatophytoma have been reported to be resistant to these oral treatments. Consequently, these disease types were typically excluded from previous clinical trials for onychomycosis. After the introduction of 10% efinaconazole solution (EFCZ) as the first topical treatment for onychomycosis in Japan, some cases with longitudinal spikes showed a positive response to EFCZ.

Utilizing the data from the study by Iozumi et al, where longitudinal spikes were not excluded, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to assess the efficacy of EFCZ in treating onychomycosis with longitudinal spikes.

### Impact of new antifungal medications on onychomycosis prescriptions and costs in Japan: A nationwide claims database study [^117JT8Nm]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Two recent studies have reported web-based surveys of prescription preferences of dermatologists for onychomycosis. Both studies showed an increase in the appropriate use of oral medications, yet also indicated that a considerable number of topical medications continue to be prescribed for patients with onychomycosis who are suitable for oral medications. Despite these valuable insights, no study has examined nationwide prescription trends in Japan, where primary care physicians manage a significant number of patients with dermatological disorders.

This study aimed to address the gap between the recommended antifungal treatments for onychomycosis and actual prescriptions in Japan. Using data from the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB), this study analyzed prescription trends of antifungal treatments for onychomycosis from fiscal years 2014 to 2021. By examining the prescription patterns of both topical and oral antifungal medications, we investigated the impact of newly introduced medications on the trends, assessed the alignment of treatments with guidelines, and evaluated the associated medical costs.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^115AppQy]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The statistical analyses for this study were conducted on specific populations. The **full analysis set** included participants who met the inclusion criteria and had positive fungus cultures, excluding those without evaluation data after efinaconazole application. The **per protocol set** comprised target subjects abiding by the clinical study protocol provisions.

For analysis methods, the primary examination utilized the full analysis set, while the per protocol set was used for supplemental analysis. The final assessment point was defined as the time of the last observation, including any discontinuations. Subgroup analyses, based on patient background such as sex, age, type of onychomycosis, clinical involvement, and causative fungal species, were predetermined. However, hypothesis testing was not conducted due to the single-group nature of the trial.

Continuous data were summarized using statistical measures like the number of subjects, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum/median/maximum values, and a 95% confidence interval. Categorical data were presented by the number of subjects and proportions. Missing values, excluding quality of life scores, were addressed using the last observation carried forward method; quality of life scores were not supplemented.

Outcome and discussion data are detailed as mean ± standard deviation unless specified otherwise. Safety analysis was not carried out. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS ® System Release 9.4.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, particularly in pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day for patients aged ≥ 1 month, with a maximum dose of 500 mg) as a second-line therapy. This recommendation applies if itraconazole and terbinafine are contraindicated or not tolerated. It is advised to take griseofulvin with fatty food to enhance absorption.

### Efinaconazole topical solution, 10%: The benefits of treating onychomycosis early [^115fZRgk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in onychomycosis patients with early and long-standing disease.

- **Methods**: An analysis of 1,655 patients, aged 18–70 years, randomized to receive efinaconazole topical solution, 10% or vehicle from two identical multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 48-week studies evaluating safety and efficacy. The primary endpoint was complete cure rate (0% clinical involvement of target toenail, and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture) at Week 52. Three groups were compared: those with early disease (< 1 year), intermediate disease (1–5 years), and long-standing disease (> 5 years).

- **Results**: The majority of patients had long-standing disease and were older, male, and white. While nail involvement of the target toenail did not differ noticeably amongst the three groups, the number of nails involved increased progressively with disease duration. Differences were seen in terms of infecting pathogens in early disease, which might have important treatment implications. Efinaconazole was more effective in treating early disease; however, more than 40% of patients with long-standing disease were considered treatment successes.

- **Limitations**: A period of 52 weeks may be too brief to evaluate a clinical cure in onychomycosis.

- **Conclusions**: Treating onychomycosis early to avoid disease progression to other toenails is important. Once daily efinaconazole topical solution, 10% is particularly effective in these patients.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: How to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates.

- **Patient factors**: Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely.

- **Organism, treatment, and environmental factors**: Organism factors, treatment factors, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective.

Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### Managing assessments and expectations: Patient responses following therapy with efinaconazole topical solution, 10% [^111nUh1S]. Journal of drugs in dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Successful treatment of onychomycosis is both a clinical and therapeutic challenge. Effective patient education and reassurance are critical. This post hoc analysis aims to provide some guidance to physicians based on initial disease severity and influencing factors.

- **Methods**: A post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in mild to moderate onychomycosis. Outcomes were assessed based on baseline severity (20%-29%, 30%-39%, 40%-49%, and ≥ 50% affected target toenail).

- **Results**: Overall, the mean percent affected toenail following efinaconazole treatment decreased from 36.4% to 20.6% (a 43% reduction). The percent reduction in mean percent affected toenail (range, 43.6% to 59.8%) with efinaconazole was similar irrespective of baseline severity. Improvement was only seen in the very mildest patients with vehicle and not before week 36. Improvement was influenced by gender (females did better) and disease duration (long-standing disease responding less well).

- **Conclusions**: Our onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole might expect a 50% improvement in their disease within a year, and this will be seen as significant by many, especially those who have suffered for many years. Many will do better, but they will need to be reminded of the slow growth of the toenail.

### Efficacy and safety of fosravuconazole L-lysine ethanolate, a novel oral triazole antifungal agent, for the treatment of onychomycosis: A multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III study [^111AVDyZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The main inclusion criteria for patients were as follows: (i) 20 years or older but less than 75 years of age; (ii) clinical involvement in either the left or right great toenail; (iii) positive potassium hydroxide examination results under direct microscopy and confirmed detection of Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes by loop‐mediated isothermal amplification, a method proven to have a high correlation with fungal culture in the identification of T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes prior to this study (Dr. Shinichi Watanabe, 2013, unpublished data); (iv) clinical involvement affecting 25% or more of the toenail; and (v) provision of written informed consent.

The main exclusion criteria applied to patients were as follows: (i) use of any oral or injectable antifungal agent or topical antifungal agent for nails within 36 weeks before the first administration of the study drug; (ii) longitudinal streaks or a spike in the toenail with clinical involvement to be evaluated (target toenail); (iii) clinical involvement reaching the proximal nail fold of the target toenail; (iv) dermatophytes detected only on the nail surface (superficial white onychomycosis); and (v) significant nail thickening or deformity due to onychogryphosis or other conditions.

During the study period, subjects were prohibited from using any oral or topical antifungal agent other than the study drug or other therapies for onychomycosis, such as surgical removal of an affected nail. No drugs were prohibited from concomitant use from the viewpoint of drug interactions.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^115RVFiD]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, efinaconazole (EFCZ) may be used in cases exceeding the study criteria, namely more severe cases with more than 50% clinical involvement or with long-term use for over one year. Therefore, it is meaningful to obtain information on the efficacy and safety of EFCZ when used in severe cases or applied for over 48 weeks, to provide findings for clinical medicine.

Our study was conducted to examine the efficacy of EFCZ by daily application for up to 72 weeks in patients with onychomycosis with 20% or more clinical involvement of the nails, including severe cases. Regarding the impact of EFCZ on patient quality of life (QOL), only one report so far has used OnyCOE-tTM, a QOL questionnaire regarding onychomycosis. No similar study has been conducted in the Japanese population, so we included this aim in our study.

### Topical and device-based treatments for fungal infections of the toenails [^1127Qx9o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Onychomycosis refers to fungal infections of the nail apparatus that may cause pain, discomfort, and disfigurement. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007; a substantial amount of new research warrants a review exclusively on toenails.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical and mycological effects of topical drugs and device-based therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trial registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomized controlled trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of topical and device-based therapies for onychomycosis in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by positive cultures, direct microscopy, or histological nail examination. Eligible comparators were placebo, vehicle, no treatment, or an active topical or device-based treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were complete cure rate (normal-looking nail plus fungus elimination, determined with laboratory methods) and the number of participants reporting treatment-related adverse events.

- **Main results**: We included 56 studies (12,501 participants, average age: 27 to 68 years), with mainly mild-to-moderate onychomycosis without matrix involvement (where reported). Participants had more than one toenail affected. Most studies lasted 48 weeks.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^111gxmVu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Our study was an open-label, single-arm study. A simple comparison in terms of efficacy with the multinational phase III study, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group study, may cause misjudgment, thus caution is necessary. However, the evaluation parameters for efficacy in our study had similar results as those in the Japanese group in the multinational phase III study. For the subgroup analysis, data from the full analysis set were categorized according to patient background. Their uniformity and appropriateness were not examined; thus, the interpretation of the results should be made carefully.

As no control group was included in our study, objective information on the incidence of adverse drug reactions was not obtainable. However, the incidence of adverse drug reactions was low. Compared with the multinational phase III study, our study had a higher proportion of elderly patients. Therefore, we consider that the findings obtained in this study were comparable with those in the actual clinical setting.

### Update: Medical treatment of onychomycosis [^113JgRFT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be made clinically and mycologically: clinically, by one of seven subtypes of onychomycosis, and mycologically, by evidence of dermatophytes or verified presence of molds and/or yeasts. Dermatophytes are usually considered pathogens, whereas non-dermatophyte molds and yeasts are saprophytes. Basic anamnesis and close inspection should be performed to eliminate combined diseases (e.g. onychomycosis and trauma).

The gold standard treatment for onychomycosis is systemic.

- **Combination with topical agents**: Such as nail lacquer and/or chemical nail avulsion, this approach produces better results than systemic treatment alone. Topical treatment as monotherapy is not efficient, excluding minor cases.

- **Terbinafine vs. itraconazole**: Terbinafine is superior for dermatophyte onychomycosis.

Evaluation of the outcome of clinical cure, mycological cure, and total cure should be based on well-defined worldwide criteria. Otherwise, comparison of results is impossible due to lack of uniformity in different studies. In case of treatment failure, the reasons for each failure should be carefully considered.

### Effect of onychomycosis and treatment on patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes: A systematic review [^111B3Tnp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common nail disorder, often causing physical, emotional, and aesthetic consequences. The effect of both the condition itself and its treatment on quality of life has not been well studied. The objectives of this study were to systematically review the available literature describing the effect of onychomycosis and treatment on quality of life.

Methods involved performing a search of the onychomycosis literature published before April 13, 2020. Articles were included in the review if primary data were presented, patient-reported outcome measures were used, and onychomycosis was specifically examined.

- **Results**: Thirty studies were included in the final analysis. The poorest quality-of-life scores were associated with women and fingernail involvement. Quality-of-life scores improved from baseline with all treatment types; there were greater improvements reported with oral treatments compared with topical ones.

- **Conclusions**: This review affirms that onychomycosis significantly influences quality of life, warranting effective treatment. All treatments resulted in quality-of-life improvements; however, studies on oral and topical therapies were of higher quality than those evaluating devices. Increased efforts are needed to understand the effect of the disease and therapy as assessed by validated, nail-specific outcome measures that accurately assess patients' cosmetic, physical, and social difficulties.

### Long-term follow-up of onychomycosis patients treated with efinaconazole [^113uW4Rd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains difficult to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents. Clinical trials on efinaconazole and tavaborole included 48 weeks' daily treatment regimens with a 4-week follow-up. It has been suggested that either a longer treatment regimen or a longer follow-up would lead to improved results, mainly due to the time taken for the diseased nail to grow out, especially in patients with more severe disease.

- **Objective**: To investigate the impact of a longer follow-up period on the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution in patients with moderate-to-severe onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: A single-center, open-labeled study was conducted with 23 subjects aged 18–80 years, all with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of moderate-to-severe dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (40–75% clinical involvement). Subjects were treated with efinaconazole 10% solution once daily for 48 weeks, with two 12-week post-treatment follow-ups (at weeks 60 and 72). The primary efficacy endpoint was the complete cure rate, defined as 0% clinical involvement of the target toenail and both negative potassium hydroxide examination and fungal culture. Secondary endpoints included mycologic cure rates and treatment success, defined as at least a 50% improvement in the affected toenail from baseline.

- **Results**: Twenty-two subjects completed the study. The mean baseline age was 59.4 years (range 37–77), with a predominance of male subjects (73.9%). The median baseline severity showed 50% affected target toenail. At week 72, two subjects were complete cures, and 56.5% of subjects achieved significant improvement.

### Drug synergies and the potential for combination therapy in onychomycosis [^115R2qjp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Synergy between antifungal drugs is well recognized. However, combinations of antifungals are yet to be widely adopted to treat onychomycosis. The rationale for the combination of topical and oral therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis is that the systemic antifungal reaches the infection area via the nail bed, and the topical agent is absorbed through the nail surface. The combination of antifungals used should ideally be synergistic in their mode of action. Synergy between amorolfine and other antifungals has been demonstrated in vitro. This is presumably due to differences in the precise point of action of the drugs on the fungal cell membrane, where they inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol.

Thus, combinations can result in increased antifungal activity at lower concentrations of both drugs. The potential exists, therefore, for combinations of antifungals to achieve higher cure rates in onychomycosis in a shorter time than is currently possible. This approach warrants further investigation.

### Onychomycosis diagnosis and management: Perspectives from a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable [^117UpkWy]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis prevalence is expected to rise as the population ages and the prevalence of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and other significant risk factors increase. Until recently, treatment options were limited due to safety concerns with oral antifungals and low efficacy with available topical agents. Efinaconazole and tavaborole were approved by the FDA in 2014 for onychomycosis treatment, providing additional effective topical treatment options for patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Dermatologists and podiatrists both regularly treat onychomycosis, yet there are striking differences between specialties in approach to diagnosis and treatment.

To explore these differences, a joint dermatology-podiatry roundtable of onychomycosis experts was convened. Although it has little effect on mycologic cure, debridement may be a valuable adjunct to oral or topical antifungal therapy, especially in patients with a greater symptom burden. However, few dermatologists incorporate debridement into their treatment plans, and referral to podiatry may be appropriate for some of these patients. Furthermore, podiatrists may be better equipped to manage patients with concurrent diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and elderly patients who are unable to maintain proper foot hygiene. Once a cure is achieved, lifestyle and hygiene practices, maintenance/prophylactic onychomycosis treatment, and proactive tinea pedis treatment in patients and family members may help maintain patients' cured status.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^117BnDuN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, particularly with systemic antifungals, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months for fingernail infections and at least 6 months for toenail infections) as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. It is advised to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). Monitoring of LFTs is recommended during high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to the use of concomitant hepatotoxic drugs.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^116VEnk3]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases. Of the 605 subjects who consented to participate, 223 with positive fungal cultures were enrolled. Excluding four subjects who lacked post-EFCZ application data, 219 subjects were included in the full analysis set. Forty subjects (18.3%) discontinued the study due to various reasons: consent withdrawal in 17 (7.8%), adverse events in 11 (5.0%), loss to follow-up in six (2.7%), worsening of the primary disease in two (0.9%), and other reasons in four (1.8%).

- **Subjects**: The study's baseline characteristics in the full analysis set included 153 male (69.9%) and 66 female (30.1%) participants, with a mean age of 64.3 ± 12.01 years. A total of 101 subjects (46.1%) were aged less than 65 years, and 118 subjects (53.9%) were aged 65 years or more. Regarding the type of onychomycosis, 203 subjects (92.7%) had distal lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO), with 139 (63.5%) having clinical involvements of 50% or less and 80 (36.5%) having more than 50% involvement. The most common causative fungal species was Trichophyton rubrum (157 subjects, 71.7%), followed by T. interdigitale (T. mentagrophytes) (27 subjects, 12.3%), Trichophyton species (34 subjects, 15.5%), and a combination of T. rubrum + T. interdigitale (T. mentagrophytes) in one subject (0.5%).

### Cost-effectiveness of confirmatory testing before treatment of onychomycosis [^115rAxDM]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common disease of the nail in adults. International guidelines urge health care professionals to perform confirmatory diagnostic testing before initiating systemic therapy. This approach was determined to be cost-effective in studies from the late 1990s but has not been evaluated more recently. The effect of testing on the costs of efinaconazole, 10%, topical solution treatment is unknown.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the cost and potential harm associated with three approaches to onychomycosis evaluation before treatment with oral terbinafine or efinaconazole, 10%.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A decision analysis compared the costs of three onychomycosis management algorithms based on recently published data of test statistics, disease prevalence, and relevant costs:
	1. Empirical therapy without confirmatory testing.
	2. Pretreatment confirmatory testing with potassium hydroxide (KOH) stain, followed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) evaluation if KOH testing is negative.
	3. Pretreatment testing with PAS. There was no direct patient evaluation. Selection of included studies was based on outcome variables and the quality of study design. The study was conducted from April 1, 2014, to September 1, 2015.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Primary outcomes included direct cost of onychomycosis testing and therapy and cost to avoid harm when treating patients with oral terbinafine.

At a disease prevalence of 75%, per-patient cost savings of empirical terbinafine therapy without confirmatory testing was $47 compared with the KOH screening.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^114K4GYx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines suggest offering fluconazole (3–6 mg/kg once weekly for 12–16 weeks for fingernail infection and 18–26 weeks for toenail infection) as second-line therapy. This is suggested if itraconazole and terbinafine are contraindicated or not tolerated in pediatric patients (aged 1–12 years) with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is advised to obtain baseline LFTs and CBC, and to monitor LFTs in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy, especially in patients at risk due to concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

Regarding medical management for onychomycosis, more specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2014 guidelines recommend offering itraconazole as first-line therapy for patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. The recommended dosage is 200 mg/day for 12 weeks continuously, or alternatively, as pulse therapy at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 week per month. Two pulses are recommended for fingernails and three pulses for toenails.

### Long-term follow-up study of onychomycosis: Cure rate and dropout rate with oral antifungal treatments [^115eu4nG]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

The "complete cure" of onychomycosis requires long-term treatment with a systemic antifungal agent, meaning a long follow-up is essential to properly assess an antifungal agent's effects. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated with griseofulvin (GRF) from 1962 to 1992 and a clinical study comparing the long-term effects of GRF with a new oral antifungal agent, itraconazole (ITCZ), for those treated from 1992 to 1995.

For the retrospective study, 281 patients were microscopically diagnosed with onychomycosis at the Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo. These patients received GRF administration in 1962, 1972, 1982, and 1992 and were evaluated for cure and dropout rates. The total cure rate was 29.2%, but it increased to 68.8% for patients who continued their medication for more than one year.

For the comparative study, 139 patients treated at the same institution between 1992 and 1995 were evaluated. The cure and dropout rates for GRF were 23.8% (23/97) and 52.6% (51/97), respectively. For ITCZ, the cure and dropout rates were 50.0% (21/42) and 38.1% (15/42). When comparing the long-term effects of the two treatments, we found that most patients treated with ITCZ were cured within three years, whereas about 30% of those treated with GRF remained uncured even after long-term administration. Furthermore, from a multiple regression analysis, the GRF/ITCZ administration required further evaluation to determine its long-term efficacy and patient adherence rates.

### Oral therapy for onychomycosis: An evidence-based review [^116mFGYf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Onychomycosis is a very common fungal infection of the nail apparatus; however, it is challenging to treat even when the causative agent is identified, and it usually requires prolonged systemic antifungal therapy. Until the 1990s, oral treatment options included only griseofulvin and ketoconazole, with very low cure rates. New generations of antimycotics, such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine, have improved treatment success.

- **Methods**: Literature was identified by performing a PubMed Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) search. Prospective and randomized clinical trials were chosen for inclusion in this review, with forty-six trials included.

- **Results**: Fluconazole, itraconazole, and terbinafine are effective in treating onychomycosis and have a good safety profile. When a dermatophyte is the pathogen, terbinafine produces the best results. For Candida and nondermatophyte infections, the azoles, mainly itraconazole, are the recommended therapy.

- **Conclusion**: In the majority of the studies, terbinafine treatment showed a higher cure ratio than the other drugs for dermatophyte onychomycosis.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^112Lk9vQ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The changes in quality of life (QOL) scores at the end of treatment or upon discontinuation were assessed using the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire for onychomycosis. The results were tallied and used as QOL scores. Changes in the QOL score were calculated with the following formula:

- **Changes in QOL score**: QOL score at the end of treatment minus QOL score at study baseline.

The OnyCOE‐t questionnaire was self‐administered by patients at enrollment (baseline) and at the final assessment. It comprised 33 items, grouped into multi‐ or single‐item scales as follows:

- **Toenail symptom assessment**: Comprising both symptom frequency and symptom bothersomeness scales.
- **Appearance problems scale**
- **Physical activities problems scale**
- **Overall problem scale**
- **Stigma scale**
- **Treatment satisfaction scale**

All items in the OnyCOE‐t questionnaire were transformed to a 0–100 scale; higher scores indicated better functioning.

For the subjects who had positive fungus cultures, adverse events (all developed during study participation) were assessed.

### Onychomycosis therapy: past, present, future [^116NHpM1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods to treat onychomycosis are varied, utilizing therapies that can be categorized as topical, oral, or device-related. Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With recent research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest, as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration.

New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance. In cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: factors contributing to recurrence [^112dVcoD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years, and many patients can now expect a complete and lasting cure. However, for up to 25% of patients, persistent disease remains a problem, thus presenting a particular challenge to the clinician. For these patients, it is obviously important to ensure that a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis has been made, as misdiagnosis will inevitably jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumors, vascular disorders, and inflammatory diseases.

Predisposing factors that contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy include the presence of a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease, and yellow spikes. Poor penetration of systemic agents to the center of infection, or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below, probably contributes to this. Other factors contributing to recurrence may be related to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle, or underlying physiology. In addition, patients with concomitant disease (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60% and increases with age.

### Efficacy of long-term treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution in patients with onychomycosis, including severe cases: A multicenter, single-arm study [^112n8UzX]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of efinaconazole 10% topical solution for long-term use, up to 72 weeks, in treating onychomycosis, including severe cases. Among 605 participants, 219 patients diagnosed with onychomycosis were evaluated for the efficacy of efinaconazole.

- **Treatment success rate**: The success rate (\ < 10% clinical involvement of the target toenail) at the final assessment point was 56.6%. The complete cure rate was 31.1%, and the mycological cure rate was 61.6%. All rates increased over time, demonstrating that continuous application contributed to an improved cure rate.

- **Efficacy in severe cases**: Even in severe cases, a reduction in the affected nail area was observed, indicating the potential efficacy of the treatment.

- **Quality of life improvement**: Responses to a quality of life questionnaire, OnyCOE-t, suggested that efinaconazole treatment improved patients' quality of life.

- **Adverse drug reactions**: The incidence of adverse drug reactions in patients eligible for the assessment was 6.3%, occurring only at the administration site. No systemic adverse events were observed, and no increase in adverse reactions due to long-term use was found.

Efinaconazole therapy demonstrated an excellent balance between efficacy and safety, potentially serving as a useful treatment option for onychomycosis.
