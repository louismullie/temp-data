## Question

Cause of atelectasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of atelectasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental pathophysiology and competing forces that govern alveolar stability. Then, I should classify the major etiologic mechanisms. Next, I will examine perioperative and critical care contexts that amplify risk. After that, I need to consider special forms like rounded atelectasis and pediatric patterns. Finally, I will integrate how these mechanisms translate into clinical consequences and prevention strategies, verifying each claim against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology. Atelectasis reflects a failure of alveolar expansion when collapsing forces outweigh expanding forces; collapsing forces include positive pleural pressure, surface tension, and loss of parenchymal tethering, whereas expanding forces include alveolar pressure and parenchymal interdependence, so the balance is delicate and easily tipped in disease states or during anesthesia and mechanical ventilation [^112raTnz] [^115vFCiv].

> I will now examine the principal mechanisms, starting with resorption (obstructive) atelectasis. Wait, let me verify the classic teaching: complete airway obstruction leads to gas absorption and alveolar collapse; this is well established historically and remains foundational, with contemporary reviews reaffirming that mucus plugs, foreign bodies, tumors, or endobronchial lesions can precipitate this sequence, and that high inspired oxygen accelerates absorption once flow is interrupted [^117YFBtm] [^115hM45f] [^117Wucv6].

> Next, I should review compression atelectasis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; compression can be extrinsic from pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or elevated intra-abdominal pressure, or intrinsic from the weight of edematous lung in dependent regions, all of which reduce transmural pressure and promote collapse, particularly in the dorsal lung when supine or in obesity where abdominal mass and diaphragmatic cephalad shift reduce FRC and increase dependent compression [^115hM45f] [^115vFCiv] [^116kJNhj].

> Let me consider adhesive atelectasis. I need to ensure I separate surfactant dysfunction from simple compression; surfactant depletion or inactivation increases surface tension, destabilizes alveoli, and raises the opening pressure required for reinflation, a process amplified by shallow ventilation, high FiO2, and loss of sighs during anesthesia, and it can persist even after apparent re-expansion, predisposing to recurrence [^112raTnz] [^112d7xdC] [^117LrXcw].

> I should confirm the role of airway closure, which is distinct from classic atelectasis but functionally convergent. Airway closure at low lung volumes, especially in dependent regions, can be continuous or cyclically opening/closing; this creates pendelluft, heterogeneous ventilation, and effectively produces airless units with shunt physiology, and it is accentuated by age, obesity, anesthesia, and ARDS, with opening pressures often in the 6–20 cm H2O range and not corrected by prolonging expiration alone [^1117guj1] [^111wMvaU] [^117Wucv6].

> Now, perioperative dynamics deserve a careful look. Induction of anesthesia reduces FRC and respiratory muscle tone, promotes dependent airway closure, and permits cephalad diaphragmatic displacement; high FiO2 during induction accelerates absorption atelectasis, and neuromuscular blockade with fixed tidal ventilation eliminates sighs, worsening surfactant dysfunction; these effects are detectable within minutes and persist beyond 24 hours in many patients, particularly with obesity or abdominal surgery [^112ba44A] [^1121epj7] [^116kJNhj].

> But wait, what if the oxygen fraction is only moderate; does FiO2 60% behave like 100%? Randomized trials comparing 30% vs 60% FiO2 without recruitment maneuvers have not shown a reduction in postoperative atelectasis with the lower FiO2, suggesting that at moderate levels, compression, airway closure, and surfactant effects may dominate over pure absorption kinetics, although the literature remains mixed and context dependent [^111jwmZh] [^112KnimW] [^111Er7tD].

> Next, I should review critical illness and ARDS, where multiple mechanisms converge. Inflammatory edema increases lung weight and compresses dependent regions, proteinaceous exudate consolidates units, high FiO2 promotes absorption in poorly ventilated areas, and surfactant abnormalities destabilize alveoli; importantly, atelectasis in ARDS correlates with severity and outcomes, and the extent of collapse guides recruitability and ventilator strategy selection [^1151Ldwa] [^115vFCiv].

> Let me consider special forms, starting with rounded atelectasis. I should double-check the pathogenesis: pleural thickening and fibrosis cause infolding of visceral pleura with adjacent parenchymal collapse, classically in the lower lobes and often associated with asbestos exposure; radiographically it can mimic malignancy, but serial imaging frequently shows stability or regression, supporting a benign, compressive-pleural mechanism rather than primary parenchymal disease [^113gVAuJ] [^112i4PTh] [^113qZdTV].

> Pediatric patterns require separate attention. Children have higher chest wall compliance and relatively smaller airways, making them particularly vulnerable to mucus plugging and airway closure; middle lobe syndrome and plastic bronchitis are classic pediatric presentations, and refractory atelectasis after viral infections can evolve to bronchiolitis obliterans, sometimes necessitating surgical resection when medical therapy fails [^117HXXA3] [^117Uz3YE] [^112m5rxs].

> I should confirm the bidirectional relationship between atelectasis and infection. Atelectasis impairs local immune defenses, mucociliary clearance, and antibiotic penetration, and is associated with a higher risk of postoperative pneumonia, while infections themselves can cause mucus plugging and inflammatory airway edema leading to atelectasis; distinguishing atelectasis from pneumonia on imaging relies on dynamic air bronchograms and clinical correlation, with lung ultrasound outperforming portable CXR in the ICU [^1165HMPN] [^114Scbde] [^115hzLdP].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanical injury implications. Atelectasis and airway closure create stress concentrators at interfaces between aerated and nonaerated regions, amplifying regional strain and promoting ventilator-induced lung injury; intriguingly, experimental data suggest alveolar injury may localize to nonatelectatic regions while distal airway injury is more diffuse, reinforcing the clinical priority of minimizing cyclic opening/closing and achieving stable recruitment [^114qKvqg] [^113cuvaf] [^116odsK4].

> Let me reconsider prevention and management touchpoints briefly, since mechanism informs therapy. Strategies that counter the specific drivers — recruitment maneuvers and adequate PEEP to overcome opening pressures, avoidance of unnecessary hyperoxia, secretion clearance for obstruction, and optimization of body position and abdominal mechanics — are logical and supported by physiologic rationale and perioperative data, though high-quality outcome evidence remains heterogeneous and patient-specific factors must guide intensity [^111BvJ6G] [^115g8eQN] [^115hM45f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal framework remains explicit: atelectasis arises when airway obstruction, extrinsic or intrinsic compression, surfactant dysfunction, and airway closure individually or in combination overwhelm alveolar expanding forces; perioperative anesthesia, obesity, critical illness, and certain disease-specific entities like asbestos-related pleural disease or pediatric mucus plugging modify both the likelihood and the morphology of collapse, and these mechanisms collectively explain the clinical spectrum and guide targeted prevention and treatment [^112raTnz] [^112ScTdo] [^115vFCiv].

Atelectasis is caused by **airway obstruction** (mucus plugs, tumors, foreign bodies) [^115hM45f], **compression** (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, abdominal distension, obesity) [^116xw1oy], and **loss of surfactant** (prematurity, ARDS, prolonged ventilation) [^117LrXcw]. Additional contributors include shallow breathing, anesthesia, sedation, and high inspired oxygen [^112raTnz] [^111Er7tD]. Management targets the cause: relieve obstruction, reduce compression, restore surfactant, and use recruitment maneuvers with PEEP [^111BvJ6G] [^115g8eQN].

---

## Airway obstruction

Obstruction of the airway is a **common cause of atelectasis**, preventing air from reaching the alveoli and leading to collapse [^117YFBtm].

- **Mucus plugs**: Commonly occur in patients with chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or asthma, leading to blockage of bronchi [^notfound].

- **Tumors**: Endobronchial tumors can obstruct airways, causing atelectasis [^115hM45f].

- **Foreign bodies**: Particularly common in children, foreign objects lodged in the airway can cause obstruction [^notfound].

- **Asthma**: Bronchospasm and mucus plugging during asthma attacks can lead to atelectasis [^116hhrUA].

---

## Compression of lung tissue

External pressure on the lung can **compress lung tissue**, reducing its volume and causing collapse [^115hM45f].

- **Pleural effusion**: Accumulation of fluid in the pleural space can compress the lung, leading to atelectasis [^115hM45f].

- **Pneumothorax**: Presence of air in the pleural space can cause lung collapse [^115hM45f].

- **Abdominal distension**: Conditions such as ascites, obesity, or pregnancy can elevate the diaphragm, compressing the lung bases [^116xw1oy].

- **Tumors or masses**: External compression from tumors or lymphadenopathy can cause atelectasis [^115hM45f].

---

## Loss of surfactant

Surfactant reduces surface tension within alveoli, stabilizing them and preventing collapse. Loss or inactivation of surfactant **increases the risk of atelectasis**.

- **Prematurity**: Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) is characterized by surfactant deficiency, leading to widespread atelectasis.

- **Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)**: Inflammation and injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane can inactivate surfactant, causing atelectasis [^1151Ldwa].

- **Prolonged mechanical ventilation**: High oxygen concentrations and mechanical ventilation can lead to surfactant dysfunction [^117LrXcw].

---

## Shallow breathing and inadequate ventilation

Shallow breathing or inadequate ventilation can **reduce lung volumes**, particularly functional residual capacity (FRC), leading to atelectasis [^112ba44A].

- **General anesthesia**: Anesthesia-induced muscle relaxation and reduced respiratory drive can cause shallow breathing, promoting atelectasis [^112ba44A].

- **Sedation**: Similar to anesthesia, sedation can reduce respiratory drive and muscle tone, leading to atelectasis [^111CJ2To].

- **Pain**: Postoperative pain can limit deep breathing and coughing, contributing to atelectasis [^116erdgm].

---

## High inspired oxygen concentration

High concentrations of inspired oxygen can **accelerate absorption of gas from obstructed alveoli**, leading to absorption atelectasis [^117Wucv6].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Atelectasis can cause **significant clinical consequences**, including hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and increased risk of infection [^112raTnz]. Management strategies include:

- **Relief of obstruction**: Bronchoscopy, airway clearance techniques, and mucolytics [^115hM45f].

- **Reduction of compression**: Treatment of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or abdominal distension [^115hM45f].

- **Restoration of surfactant**: Exogenous surfactant administration in neonates and patients with ARDS [^notfound].

- **Recruitment maneuvers and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)**: Mechanical ventilation strategies to reopen collapsed alveoli [^115g8eQN].

---

Atelectasis is caused by **airway obstruction, compression of lung tissue, loss of surfactant, shallow breathing, and high inspired oxygen concentrations**. Effective management requires addressing the underlying cause and implementing appropriate therapeutic interventions.

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a pathogenic perioperative entity [^1162M4jH]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Atelectasis occurs in the dependent parts of the lungs of most patients who are anesthetized. Development of atelectasis is associated with decreased lung compliance, impairment of oxygenation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and development of lung injury. The adverse effects of atelectasis persist into the postoperative period and can impact patient recovery. This review article focuses on the causes, nature, and diagnosis of atelectasis. The authors discuss the effects and implications of atelectasis in the perioperative period and illustrate how preventive measures may impact outcome. In addition, they examine the impact of atelectasis and its prevention in acute lung injury.

### Acute lobar atelectasis [^112ScTdo]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Lobar atelectasis (or collapse) is an exceedingly common, rather predictable, and potentially pathogenic companion to many forms of acute illness, postoperative care, and chronic debility. Readily diagnosed by using routine chest imaging and bedside ultrasound, the consequences from lobar collapse may be minor or serious, depending on extent, mechanism, patient vulnerability, abruptness of onset, effectiveness of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and compensatory reserves. Measures taken to reduce secretion burden, assure adequate secretion clearance, maintain upright positioning, reverse lung compression, and sustain lung expansion accord with a logical physiologic rationale. Both classification and logical approaches to prophylaxis and treatment of lobar atelectasis derive from a sound mechanistic knowledge of its causation.

### Perioperative pulmonary atelectasis: part I. biology and mechanisms [^112raTnz]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary atelectasis is common in the perioperative period. Physiologically, it is produced when collapsing forces derived from positive pleural pressure and surface tension overcome expanding forces from alveolar pressure and parenchymal tethering. Atelectasis impairs blood oxygenation and reduces lung compliance. It is increasingly recognized that it can also induce local tissue biologic responses, such as inflammation, local immune dysfunction, and damage of the alveolar-capillary barrier, with potential loss of lung fluid clearance, increased lung protein permeability, and susceptibility to infection, factors that can initiate or exaggerate lung injury. Mechanical ventilation of a heterogeneously aerated lung (e.g., in the presence of atelectatic lung tissue) involves biomechanical processes that may precipitate further lung damage: concentration of mechanical forces, propagation of gas-liquid interfaces, and remote overdistension. Knowledge of such pathophysiologic mechanisms of atelectasis and their consequences in the healthy and diseased lung should guide optimal clinical management.

### Airway closure, more harmful than atelectasis in intensive care? [^111wMvaU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Since the mid-1980s, atelectasis has been demonstrated during anesthesia in lung healthy subjects and in intensive care patients suffering from acute respiratory failure and requiring ventilator support. In the latter case, there are additional causes of airless lung tissues, such as alveolar fluid filling and consolidation. The airless tissue is still perfused, causing a shunt with impairment of the oxygenation of blood. Moreover, cyclic opening and closing of alveolar units may harm the tissue and trigger an inflammatory reaction. This is well known and has been considered a major morphological disturbance in the mechanically ventilated subject. However, there are indirect observations of another morphological disturbance, some airways that are either continuously closed or cyclically opening and closing during the ventilation. This airway closure is a normal phenomenon, although of small magnitude and seldom continuous, in awake, spontaneously breathing healthy subjects. It begins in dependent lung regions and spreads out to include additional airways during the continuing expiration. However, during anesthesia and in acute respiratory failure airway closure is much more marked and may be of similar importance as alveolar airlessness in impeding lung function, and promoting inflammation.

### The role of ventilation-induced surfactant dysfunction and atelectasis in causing acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117LrXcw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This Pulmonary Perspective describes a new pathophysiologic scenario by which the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might develop, summarizes the literature on which this new scenario is based, and discusses the resulting implications with respect to patient management. Rather than ARDS occurring as a result of the inflammatory response associated with predisposing risk factors, the proposed scenario theorizes that the initiating problem is atelectasis that develops as a result of a surfactant abnormality that is caused by spontaneous or mechanical ventilation, together with our current approaches to patient positioning and sedation. The proposed pathophysiology implies that ventilation-induced lung injury occurs before, and causes, ARDS (rather than developing after the fact and only serving to magnify the existing injury) and that some instances of ARDS are iatrogenic. If the proposed scenario is correct, it also implies that at least some instances of ARDS might be prevented by implementing a number of simple, safe modifications in patient care.

### Debunking a mythology: atelectasis is not a cause of postoperative fever [^115v7ysn]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Most physicians appreciate that practicing medicine is a commitment to continuous learning. However, "learning" can be mistakenly understood as simply the acquisition of facts and new knowledge. But learning also necessitates the constant re-examination and challenging of one's existing body of knowledge, as misinformation persists when one's beliefs are not challenged or questioned in the light of new information. One example is the pervasive belief that postoperative atelectasis causes fever despite ample evidence to the contrary. Herein we examine the imaging characteristics of atelectasis, and the means of differentiation of atelectasis from consolidation. We also explore the history of this persistent myth and review the existing literature on the actual causes of postoperative fever.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^1165HMPN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Atelectasis may play a substantial role in the development of pneumonia. However, pneumonia has never been evaluated as an outcome of atelectasis in surgical patients. We aimed to determine whether atelectasis is related to an increased risk of postoperative pneumonia, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hospital length of stay (LOS).

Methods

The electronic medical records of adult patients who underwent elective non-cardiothoracic surgery under general anesthesia between October 2019 and August 2020 were reviewed. They were divided into two groups: one who developed postoperative atelectasis (atelectasis group) and the other who did not (non-atelectasis group). The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia within 30 days after the surgery. The secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate and postoperative LOS.

Results

Patients in the atelectasis group were more likely to have risk factors for postoperative pneumonia including age, body mass index, a history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus and duration of surgery, compared with those in the non-atelectasis. Among 1,941 patients, 63 (3.2%) developed postoperative pneumonia; 5.1% in the atelectasis group and 2.8% in the non-atelectasis (P = 0.025). In multivariable analysis, atelectasis was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.33; 95% CI: 1.24–4.38; P = 0.008). Median postoperative LOS was significantly longer in the atelectasis group (7 [interquartile range: 5–10 days]) than in the non-atelectasis (6 [3–8] days) (P < 0.001). Adjusted median duration was also 2.19 days longer in the atelectasis group (β, 2.19; 95% CI: 0.821–2.834; P < 0.001). ICU admission rate was higher in the atelectasis group (12.1% vs. 6.5%; P < 0.001), but it did not differ between the groups after adjustment for confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52; 95% CI: 0.88–2.62; P = 0.134).

Conclusion

Among patients undergoing elective non-cardiothoracic surgery, patients with postoperative atelectasis were associated with a 2.33-fold higher incidence of pneumonia and a longer LOS than those without atelectasis. This finding alerts the need for careful management of perioperative atelectasis to prevent or reduce the adverse events including pneumonia and the burden of hospitalizations.

### Treatment of atelectasis: where is the evidence? [^112ppore]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lobar atelectasis is a common problem caused by a variety of mechanisms including resorption atelectasis due to airway obstruction, passive atelectasis from hypoventilation, compressive atelectsis from abdominal distension and adhesive atelectasis due to increased surface tension. However, evidence-based studies on the management of lobar atelectasis are lacking. Examination of air-bronchograms on a chest radiograph may be helpful to determine whether proximal or distal airway obstruction is involved. Chest physiotherapy, nebulised DNase and possibly fibreoptic bronchoscopy might be helpful in patients with mucous plugging of the airways. In passive and adhesive atelectasis, positive end-expiratory pressure might be a useful adjunct to treatment.

### Perioperative pulmonary atelectasis: part II. clinical implications [^111BvJ6G]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The development of pulmonary atelectasis is common in the surgical patient. Pulmonary atelectasis can cause various degrees of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics impairment during and after surgery. In its most serious presentations, lung collapse could contribute to postoperative respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, and worse overall clinical outcomes. A specific risk assessment is critical to allow clinicians to optimally choose the anesthetic technique, prepare appropriate monitoring, adapt the perioperative plan, and ensure the patient's safety. Bedside diagnosis and management have benefited from recent imaging advancements such as lung ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography, and monitoring such as esophageal manometry. Therapeutic management includes a broad range of interventions aimed at promoting lung recruitment. During general anesthesia, these strategies have consistently demonstrated their effectiveness in improving intraoperative oxygenation and respiratory compliance. Yet these same intraoperative strategies may fail to affect additional postoperative pulmonary outcomes. Specific attention to the postoperative period may be key for such outcome impact of lung expansion. Interventions such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilatory support may be beneficial in specific patients at high risk for pulmonary atelectasis (e.g., obese) or those with clinical presentations consistent with lung collapse (e.g., postoperative hypoxemia after abdominal and cardiothoracic surgeries). Preoperative interventions may open new opportunities to minimize perioperative lung collapse and prevent pulmonary complications. Knowledge of pathophysiologic mechanisms of atelectasis and their consequences in the healthy and diseased lung should provide the basis for current practice and help to stratify and match the intensity of selected interventions to clinical conditions.

### Rounded atelectasis of the lung [^113tnrqk]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Rounded atelectasis of the lung (RA) is a lesion well described in the medical literature, yet often very difficult to diagnose. In recent years, the widespread use of high-resolution imaging modalities employed in the struggle against cancer, coinciding with the peak of the asbestos epidemic, have boosted the detection frequency of RA. However, its differential diagnosis still poses a challenge to the pulmonary specialist and the radiologist, as little is known about its pathogenesis. Furthermore, the multifactorial etiology of RA and its occasional coexistence with lung cancer make the task of confidently ruling out malignancy sometimes daunting. This article attempts to provide an update on RA's etiology, radiological evaluation, clinical management, and prognosis based on recent advances in broadly available diagnostic modalities and minimally invasive interventional procedures. An exemplary case of post-tuberculous RA is illustrated, as RA often presents as an unusual finding of a fairly common disease.

### Airway closure, more harmful than atelectasis in intensive care? [^117Wucv6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

There are at least four major consequences of airway closure. Firstly, a continuously closed or briefly open airway will promote atelectasis because of absent or poor ventilation, alveolar gas being sucked up by the capillary blood. Indeed, the atelectasis during anesthesia is almost always caused by airway closure. The use of high inspired oxygen concentration speeds up the atelectasis formation because of rapid absorption of oxygen in the alveoli, whereas nitrogen in the alveoli will prevent or slow down atelectasis formation.

Secondly, the impaired ventilation by cyclic airway closure causes a ventilation/perfusion mismatch with impairment of oxygenation of blood. In addition, continuous airway closure promotes alveolar collapse, as said above, that causes a shunt and impairment of arterial oxygenation.

Thirdly, there are animal experiments suggesting that the beginning of an inflammatory reaction in the lung is not in dependent, collapsed/airless regions, nor in the uppermost, possibly over-aerated regions, but in a zone somewhere in the middle of the lung. This zone is mostly poorly aerated, suggesting cyclic airway closure. Such cyclic closure results in a physical stress to the airway wall, opening and closing where surface forces have to be overcome and where the wall may suffer from damage. Importantly, whereas atelectasis results in alveolar injury mostly in aerated regions, the repetitive opening and closing of distal airways occur also in lung regions that are atelectatic.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^113gVAuJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Rounded atelectasis — synonyms, causes, pathology, and clinical considerations are outlined: Rounded atelectasis, also known as shrinking pleuritis, contracted pleurisy, pseudotumor, Blesovsky's syndrome, or folded lung, presents radiographically as a mass and may be mistaken for a tumor. The condition may result from infolding of thickened visceral pleura with collapse of the underlying lung parenchyma, and histologic examination shows folded and fibrotic visceral pleura with atelectasis and variable amounts of interstitial fibrosis in the adjacent lung parenchyma. Clinical experience suggests that it is more likely to occur today as a result of asbestos exposure than other causes, the sudden appearance of rounded atelectasis may follow acute pleuritis with effusion, it may be unilateral and bilateral, and asbestos bodies and/or evidence of asbestos should be carefully sought because it is frequently removed surgically as a suspected peripheral lung cancer.

### Vital capacity manoeuvre in general anaesthesia: useful or useless? [^111rCHvN]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

As atelectasis occurs in most patients during general anaesthesia and may be one of the major causes for the development of hypoxaemia and nosocomial pneumonia, its prevention may be considered as an important objective in perioperative management. The major causative mechanisms are the loss of respiratory muscle tone, compression and gas absorption. Vital capacity manoeuvres have been proposed as a means to eliminate atelectasis in the vast majority of patients and restore normal pulmonary gas exchange during general anaesthesia. In this review we describe the pathogenesis of atelectasis in the perioperative period and discuss in the light of recent published investigations the suitability of the vital capacity manoeuvre as a tool during general anaesthesia. Reviewing the current literature, a vital capacity manoeuvre during general anaesthesia may only be useful under specific circumstances when mechanical ventilation with a high inspiratory fraction of oxygen is required or during cardiac surgery at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass to reduce the amount of atelectasis and to maintain adequate gas exchange.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^114Scbde]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated that patients with postoperative atelectasis had a 2.33-fold higher risk of postoperative pneumonia compared with those without. The atelectasis was also associated with an extended LOS. However, it was not related to ICU admission rate after adjustment for confounders.

We found that patients with atelectasis were at increased risk of postoperative pneumonia but were also predisposed by independent risk factors to postoperative pneumonia including age, BMI, a history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus and duration of surgery in our study. Nevertheless, adjustment for these risk factors still revealed direct association between the postoperative atelectasis and the risk of postoperative pneumonia. Our findings are important as the postoperative pneumonia might be preventable, at least in part, by reducing or reversing atelectasis in the perioperative period. In fact, intraoperative atelectasis during general anesthesia is known to be prevented by limiting the fraction of inspired oxygen ("absorption atelectasis") and by promoting alveolar recruitment with PEEP and recruitment maneuvers. In addition, postoperative atelectasis has been reduced by using individual PEEP settings, and by maintaining a consistent positive pressure at the airway with pressure support and PEEP during emergence from general anesthesia as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to strongly suggest postoperative atelectasis as a risk factor for pneumonia in surgical patients.

It has been known that atelectasis may induce local immune dysfunction and inflammation, thereby increasing the susceptibility to infection. In addition, perioperative changes in lung mechanics and breathing patterns due to general anesthesia and surgery and/or consequent atelectasis are known to weaken the lung defense system, compromising both cough and mucociliary clearance against pathogens distal to the obstruction. Local depletion or dysfunction of surfactant due to a significant atelectasis, the use of anesthetic agents, and/or prolonged mechanical ventilation also compromise the protective response against infection because surfactant has direct antimicrobial properties. Taken together, compromised local immune system, impaired mucociliary clearance, and surfactant dysfunction appears to be responsible for some of the increased risk of pneumonia in post-surgical patients with atelectasis. Furthermore, atelectasis was shown to reduce the penetration of antibiotics into the affected lung, making it difficult to obtain the correct drug concentrations to fight against potential pathogens.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^111HASnG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The incidence of pneumonia that occurred within the first 30 days following surgery was evaluated as the primary outcome, as recommended as a follow-up period for the occurrence of adverse events in perioperative medicine. The secondary outcomes were ICU admission rate and postoperative LOS. Atelectasis was defined as lung opacification with a shift of the mediastinum, hilum, or hemidiaphragm toward the affected area, and compensatory overinflation in the adjacent non-atelectatic lung on CXR obtained within the first 7 postoperative days. Radiological diagnoses were reported by the attending radiologists independent of the study. Preoperative CXR is a routine evaluation in every department while postoperative CXR is routinely obtained in a few departments or as required when a patient have fever, or develops respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, shortness of breath, cough and sputum, or decrease of oxygen saturation in our hospital.

Postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed by respiratory physicians as consulted by the clinicians in charge of the patients based on the US Centers for Disease Control definition of pneumonia with two or more serial CXR showing at least one of the following findings: (i) new or progressive and persistent infiltrates, (ii) consolidation, and (iii) cavitation (one radiograph is sufficient for patients with no underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease). They also should have at least one of the following signs: (i) fever (> 38℃) with no other recognized cause; (ii) leukopenia (white cell count < 4 × 10⁹/L) or leukocytosis (white cell count > 12 × 10⁹/L), (iii) altered mental status with no other recognized cause for adults > 70 years old; and at least two of the following: (i) new onset of purulent sputum or change in character of sputum, or increased respiratory secretions, or increased suctioning requirements, (ii) new onset or worsening cough, dyspnea, or tachypnea, (iii) rales or bronchial breath sounds, and (iv) worsening gas exchange (hypoxemia, increased oxygen requirement, increased ventilator demand).

### Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during anaesthesia for prevention of mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications [^115g8eQN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

General anaesthesia causes atelectasis, which can lead to impaired respiratory function. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a mechanical manoeuvre that increases functional residual capacity (FRC) and prevents collapse of the airways, thereby reducing atelectasis. It is not known whether intraoperative PEEP alters the risks of postoperative mortality and pulmonary complications. This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of intraoperative PEEP in terms of postoperative mortality and pulmonary outcomes in all adult surgical patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 10, part of The Cochrane Library, as well as MEDLINE (via Ovid) (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (via Ovid) (1980 to October 2013), CINAHL (via EBSCOhost) (1982 to October 2013), ISI Web of Science (1945 to October 2013) and LILACS (via BIREME interface) (1982 to October 2010). The original search was performed in January 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of PEEP versus no PEEP during general anaesthesia on postoperative mortality and postoperative respiratory complications in adults, 16 years of age and older.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected papers, assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to ask for additional information, when necessary. We calculated the number of additional participants needed (information size) to make reliable conclusions.

Main Results

This updated review includes two new randomized trials. In total, 10 randomized trials with 432 participants and four comparisons are included in this review. One trial had a low risk of bias. No differences were demonstrated in mortality, with risk ratio (RR) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 4.59; P value 0.97; 268 participants, six trials, very low quality of evidence (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE)), and in pneumonia, with RR of 0.40 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.39; P value 0.15; 120 participants, three trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)). Statistically significant results included the following: The PEEP group had higher arterial oxygen pressure (PaO₂)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) on day one postoperatively, with a mean difference of 22.98 (95% CI 4.40 to 41.55; P value 0.02; 80 participants, two trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)), and postoperative atelectasis (defined as an area of collapsed lung, quantified by computerized tomography scan) was less in the PEEP group (standard mean difference -1.2, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.79; P value 0.00001; 88 participants, two trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)). No adverse events were reported in the three trials that adequately measured these outcomes (barotrauma and cardiac complications). Using information size calculations, we estimated that a further 21,200 participants would have to be randomly assigned to allow a reliable conclusion about PEEP and mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is currently insufficient to permit conclusions about whether intraoperative PEEP alters risks of postoperative mortality and respiratory complications among undifferentiated surgical patients.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^113dsa93]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that a high inspired oxygen fraction (versus a low inspired oxygen fraction) had no effect on the incidence of pneumonia despite the increased incidence of postoperative atelectasis in patients undergoing non-thoracic surgery under general anesthesia. Three possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the atelectasis: resorption of alveolar air (i.e. absorption atelectasis), direct compression of lung tissue (i.e. compression atelectasis), and surfactant impairment. The atelectasis was mainly attributed to absorption of alveolar air that spontaneously resolves within 24 to 48 h in a previous study. On the other hand, upper abdominal surgery, which favors the development of compression atelectasis, was more frequent and the duration of general anesthesia eliciting both forms of atelectasis (i.e. surfactant dysfunction and compression) was longer in the atelectasis group than in the non-atelectasis in our study. The discrepancy between the studies may be accounted for by different pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of atelectasis.

The reported incidence of postoperative pneumonia varies widely by the site and type of surgery performed from 0.5% to 28.9%. The incidence in our study (3.2%) was higher than that (1.8%) in ASA status III patients undergoing non-cardiothoracic predominantly abdominal and pelvic surgery. The subjects were limited to 7-day postoperative follow-up in their study, whereas ours were to 30-day. In addition, 38.0% of postoperative CXRs were obtained from patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases including fever, shortness of breath, and cough. It has been reported that atelectasis itself does not complicate pneumonia, but may contribute to the development of pneumonia when exposed to infectious agents. Since the fever that accompanies atelectasis is related to infection distal to the obstructed airway, atelectasis may have progressed to pneumonia in some patients with postoperative CXR. Alternatively, it is also possible that pneumonia might have led to atelectasis because the presence of fever may reflect infectious complications rather than atelectasis. A longer follow-up period and bias in patient selection may explain why the incidence of pneumonia in our study was higher than that in a previous one.

### Anesthesia considerations to reduce motion and atelectasis during advanced guided bronchoscopy [^116aoVKd]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Atelectasis is common during advanced guided bronchoscopic biopsy and can cause CT-to-body divergence, interfering with the ability to obtain diagnostic tissue. The anesthesia techniques proposed in this paper are designed to stabilize dependent areas of the lung, reduce atelectasis, minimize motion artifact, and provide more accurate localization during guided bronchoscopy. Future randomized studies are needed to prospectively compare bronchoscopy procedures with and without optimized ventilation strategies.

### Lung protective strategies in anaesthesia [^1153zaV9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Patients are at risk for several types of lung injury in the perioperative period including atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Anaesthetic management can cause, exacerbate, or ameliorate these injuries. This review examines the effects of perioperative mechanical ventilation and its role in ventilator-induced lung injury. Lung protective ventilatory strategies to specific clinical situations such as cardiopulmonary bypass and one-lung ventilation along with newer novel lung protective strategies are discussed.

### Atelectasis causes alveolar injury in nonatelectatic lung regions [^114qKvqg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Many authors have suggested that the mechanism by which atelectasis contributes to injury is through the repetitive opening and closing of distal airways in lung regions that are atelectatic. However, neither the topographic nor mechanistic relationships between atelectasis and distribution of lung injury are known.

Objectives

To investigate how atelectasis contributes to ventilator-induced lung injury.

Methods

Surfactant depletion was performed in anesthetized rats that were then allocated to noninjurious or injurious ventilation for 90 min.

Measurements

Lung injury was quantified by gas exchange, compliance, histology, wet-to-dry weight, and cytokine expression, and its distribution by histology, stereology, cytokine mRNA expression, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. Functional residual capacity, percent atelectasis, and injury-induced lung water accumulation were measured using gravimetric and volumetric techniques.

Main Results

Atelectasis occurred in the dependent lung regions. Injurious ventilation was associated with alveolar and distal airway injury, while noninjurious ventilation was not. With injurious ventilation, alveolar injury (i.e., histology, myeloperoxidase protein expression, quantification, and localization of cytokine mRNA expression) was maximal in nondependent regions, whereas distal airway injury was equivalent in atelectatic and nonatelectatic regions.

Conclusions

These data support the notion that lung injury associated with atelectasis involves trauma to the distal airways. We provide topographic and biochemical evidence that such distal airway injury is not localized solely to atelectatic areas, but is instead generalized in both atelectatic and nonatelectatic lung regions. In contrast, alveolar injury associated with atelectasis does not occur in those areas that are atelectatic but occurs instead in remote nonatelectatic alveoli.

### Risk prediction model for long-term atelectasis in children with pneumonia [^115irWHL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atelectasis is defined as the reduction of volume or air content of one or more lung tissues due to a variety of reasons, resulting in functional tissue collapse or atrophy, alveolar hypoxia and pulmonary vasoconstriction, improper ventilation-perfusion matching; all of these ultimately affect lung function. The most common cause of atelectasis is infection. However, the pathogens and lesion sites are different in children with atelectasis. Bronchoscopy is an important treatment option for atelectasis in children. It can help directly observe the pathological changes of the local bronchial surface, and promote the recovery of atelectasis through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and etiological examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), greatly improving the diagnosis and treatment of atelectasis in children. Studies have shown that bronchoscope interventional therapy can improve the overall effective rate of treatment, shorten the length of hospital stay, and promote the imaging resolution of pulmonary lesions in children with atelectasis. However, some atelectasis cannot be cleared with medical treatment alone and a single BAL, resulting in long-term atelectasis. And long-term atelectasis easily leads to recurrent infection, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and lung necrosis. Considering the above factors, this study retrospectively analyzed 532 children with atelectasis to identify the pulmonary location of lesions, bronchoscopic changes, and etiological differences in children with atelectasis, and attempted to explore the risk factors of long-term atelectasis and develop a clinical prediction model to provide a basis for clinicians to prevent and treat long-term atelectasis.

Data source

In this study, clinical data of 532 children with pneumonia associated with atelectasis were collected from the Respiratory Center of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from February 2017 to March 2020. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Due to the retrospective design of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived, and all patient information were processed anonymously.

### Postoperative pulmonary complications: pneumonia and acute respiratory failure [^112bqnSi]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Postoperative pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory failure) are common, particularly after abdominal and thoracic surgery, pneumonia and atelectasis being the most common. Postoperative pneumonia is associated with increased morbidity, length of hospital stay, and costs. Few institutions have pneumonia prevention programs for surgical patients, and these should be strongly considered. Acute respiratory failure is a life-threatening pulmonary complication that requires institution of mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit, and is associated with increased risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. This article discusses epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these pulmonary complications in surgical patients.

### Causative factors, imaging findings, and CT course of round atelectasis [^112i4PTh]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess causative factors, associated imaging findings, and CT course of round atelectasis (RA).

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed CT reports for "round" or "rounded atelectasis" over a 5-year time frame. Patients with at least 2 CT scans a minimum of 6 months apart were included. Electronic medical records and clinical and imaging follow-up was reviewed for all cases.

Results

Study population included 50 individuals with mean age of 63 years, and 59 unique instances of RA. The most commonly associated etiologies were hepatic hydrothorax (26%, n = 13) and asbestos exposure (26%), followed by post-infectious pleural inflammation (22%), congestive heart failure (12%), and end stage renal disease (8%). RA was found in the right lower lobe in over half of cases (n = 30). Association with one or more pleural abnormality was identified in all cases, including thickening (88%), fluid (60%), or calcification (40%). Nearly one third (n = 19) demonstrated intra-lesional calcification. In those who underwent PET/CT (20%), lesions demonstrated an average SUV of 2.2 (range 0–7.8). CT course over mean follow up of 32 months (range 6–126 months), demonstrated RA to remain stable (n = 26) or decrease (n = 26) in size in the majority (88%) of cases.

Conclusion

Round atelectasis may arise from diverse etiologies beyond asbestos, and will most often decrease or remain stable in size over serial exams. Accurate identification may obviate the need for added diagnostic interventions.

Table 1
Demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with or without atelectasis

Values are presented as mean ± standard deviation or median [interquartile range], for continuous variables and as total numbers (percentage) for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using univariate logistic regression, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate

BMI Body mass index, COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, CXR Chest radiography, ASA American society of anesthesiologists, LOS Length of hospital stay, ICU Intensive care unit

Pneumonia occurred in 63 cases (3.2%) within the first 30 days after the surgery: 19 of 373 patients in the atelectasis group (5.1%) and 44 of 1,568 patients in the non-atelectasis (2.8%) (P = 0.025). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that atelectasis (atelectasis vs. non-atelectasis) was an independent predictor for pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–4.38; P = 0.008) (Table 2). Among the 1,941 patients, 145 (7.5%) were admitted to ICU after the surgery, with a rate significantly higher in the atelectasis group than in the non-atelectasis (12.1 vs. 6.5%, P < 0.001). However, after adjustment for confounders, no increase in ICU admission risk was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI: 0.99–2.86; P = 0.054). The duration of postoperative LOS was significantly longer in the atelectasis group than in the non-atelectasis (median, 7 [IQR, 5–10] days vs 6 days; P < 0.001). Adjusted median duration was 2.19 days longer in the atelectasis group (unstandardized regression coefficient, 2.19; 95% CI: 0.821–2.834; P < 0.001). Five patients died within 30 days after the surgery: 0 in the atelectasis group and 5 in the non-atelectasis group (P = 0.275).

### Rounded atelectasis in an asbestos exposed worker [^112K2ao6]. Occupational Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The case history is presented of a 51-year-old electrical power worker with a history of asbestos exposure presenting with rounded atelectasis. No other radiological markers of asbestos exposure were present. A documented history of asbestos exposure and exclusion of other causes of rounded atelectasis led to the diagnosis of asbestos related rounded atelectasis. It is important to understand that rounded atelectasis can be an isolated finding due to asbestos exposure. This facilitates investigation of lung masses of unknown etiology and initiation of appropriate follow up of patients at risk for future development of more debilitating asbestos related pathology.

### Prevalence and clinical consequences of atelectasis in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a computed tomography retrospective cohort study [^115MS1NR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, atelectasis might appear in up to 24% of patients and the presence of larger amount of atelectasis is associated with worse oxygenation and clinical outcome. Patients with larger atelectasis requires more intensive surveillance and might benefit of open lung techniques.

### Rounded atelectasis with atypical computed tomography findings [^112mL3K7]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Rounded atelectasis is atelectasis of the peripheral part of the lung, typically in contact with thickened pleura, featuring characteristic computed tomography findings. In this case, a 61-year-old man with history of asbestos exposure presented with a right-middle-lobe nodule on chest radiograph, with computed tomography findings suspicious for neoplasm. The patient underwent surgical resection, which revealed rounded atelectasis. Our case raises a question about the sensitivity of radiographic criteria used in identifying rounded atelectasis, and it emphasizes the need to keep rounded atelectasis in the differential diagnosis of a single pulmonary nodule in a patient with a history of asbestos exposure.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during anaesthesia for the prevention of mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications [^1133wCRP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

General anaesthesia causes atelectasis which can lead to impaired respiratory function. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a mechanical manoeuvre which increases functional residual capacity (FRC) and prevents collapse of the airways thereby reducing atelectasis. It is not known whether intra-operative PEEP alters the risk of postoperative mortality and pulmonary complications.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of intraoperative PEEP, for all adult surgical patients, on postoperative mortality and pulmonary outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 4), MEDLINE (via Ovid) (1966 to January 2010), EMBASE (via Ovid) (1980 to January 2010), CINAHL (via EBSCOhost) (1982 to January 2010), ISI Web of Science (1945 to January 2010) and LILACS (via BIREME interface) (1982 to January 2010).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effect of PEEP versus no PEEP, during general anaesthesia, on postoperative mortality and postoperative respiratory complications. We included studies irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators independently selected papers, extracted data that fulfilled our outcome criteria and assessed the quality of all included trials. We undertook pooled analyses, where appropriate. For our primary outcome (mortality) and two secondary outcomes (respiratory failure and pneumonia), we calculated the number of further patients needed (information size) in order to make reliable conclusions.

Main Results

We included eight randomized trials with a total of 330 patients. Two trials had a low risk of bias. There was no difference demonstrated for mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.39). Two statistically significant results were found: the PEEP group had a higher PaO₂/FiO₂ on day 1 postoperatively (mean difference (MD) 22.98, 95% CI 4.40 to 41.55) and postoperative atelectasis (defined as an area of collapsed lung, quantified by computerized tomography (CT) scan) was less in the PEEP group (SMD -1.2, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.79). There were no adverse events reported in the three trials that adequately measured these outcomes (barotrauma and cardiac complications). Using information size calculations, we estimated that a further 21,200 patients would need to be randomized in order to make a reliable conclusion about PEEP and mortality.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to make conclusions about whether intraoperative PEEP alters the risk of postoperative mortality and respiratory complications among undifferentiated surgical patients.

### Is atelectasis related to the development of postoperative pneumonia? a retrospective single center study [^116Jp16z]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, it is a single center study, and there may be a lack of representativeness of the entire population. Second, being a retrospective study, it is not free from bias in patient selection and treatment. Not all covariates were controlled, nor were demographic and clinical characteristics. Third, the intraoperative use of high oxygen concentration or no PEEP is known to be associated with increased severity of atelectasis. However, anesthetic management during the surgery was not harmonized among patients, and every patient followed routine anesthetic management in our hospital. Fourth, CXR, an inexpensive and the most frequently ordered radiological test, was used to determine atelectasis, resulting in some under-estimation of actual atelectasis cases. Chest CT scans have shown greater diagnostic sensitivity in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery compared with CXR and remains the accepted standard when measuring atelectasis. In addition, lung ultrasound was shown to be superior to CXR in diagnosing PPCs following cardiothoracic surgery. It has been widely used since it is portable, dynamic, and free of radiation. Finally, we did not control for baseline lung function and did not report on the specific interventions used to manage postoperative atelectasis, which limits the ability to make specific recommendations for clinical practice.

In conclusion, our retrospective study demonstrated that patients with postoperative atelectasis had a 2.33-fold higher risk of postoperative pneumonia than those without. Moreover, the development of postoperative atelectasis was associated with a prolonged LOS, while not being with ICU admission. Clinicians should try to prevent or treat postoperative atelectasis to reduce devastating adverse events including postoperative pneumonia, and to decrease resource utilization and healthcare expenditure in patients undergoing elective non-cardiothoracic surgery. Atelectasis as a risk factor for pneumonia warrants further investigation.

### Assessment of recruitment from CT to the bedside: challenges and future directions [^115vFCiv]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Recruitability (atelectasis) distribution

To model the ARDS lung, it is helpful to view it as a mixture of pulmonary units with different physical status and characteristics (Fig. 4).
Some lung units, which are the core of the "baby lung" concept, have a nearly normal inflation status and are primarily located in the non-dependent regions of the lung (ventral in the supine position and dorsal in the prone position). The opening pressure of these units may be considered close to 0 cmH₂O, as they remain open at atmospheric pressure.
Compressive ("loose") atelectasis. These are caused by small airway collapse, which may leave some residual gas into the pulmonary units. These atelectasis are primarily caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure due to the increase in lung weight. The affected lung units follow a spatial orientation which follows the gravitational axis from the non-dependent to the dependent lung. Across an iso-gravitational plane, not all the lung units have the same inflation status (all open or all closed), but the gas content varies due to the interaction between contiguous units (alveolar interdependence). The unit collapsing at end-expiration remains "loose" if they reopen during the next inspiration, being the opening pressure around 10–20 cmH₂O, otherwise the complete obstruction and reabsorption of gas will require higher pressures to reopen.
Obstructive (resorptive, "sticky") atelectasis. These are due to the complete reabsorption of gas from the pulmonary unit, which occurs when the airway remains closed for the entire respiratory cycle. This atelectasis are mostly distributed in the dependent regions, where the compressive forces are higher. Reabsorption atelectasis develops over time when regional gas uptake exceeds delivery, which depends on the F I O 2, regional ventilation/perfusion ratio, and likely the end-expiratory volume of the pulmonary units. Once no gas remains in these units, the transmural pressure required for reopening can reach 30–35 cm H₂O, corresponding to a plateau pressure exceeding 60 cm H₂O. It must be noted that the number of collapsed units is a determinant of the increase of the lung weight (i.e. the increase of the superimposed pressure).
The disease leading to ARDS may also cause a proportion of pulmonary units to be "consolidated". In this model consolidation refers to pulmonary units which are not only gasless, but their volume is occupied by liquid or solid material (e.g. as intra-alveolar edema, blood, cellular debris). In these units, the opening pressure is close to infinity, as no pressure will be able to increase the gas content. The distribution of consolidated units depends on the nature of the disease, and it is not predictable.

### Effects of 30% vs. 60% inspired oxygen fraction during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis: a randomised controlled trial [^111Er7tD]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative atelectasis diagnosed by CT occurs in 60–90% of patients with mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia. The postoperative atelectasis is associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital costs, and increased postoperative 90-day mortality. Therefore, prevention of postoperative atelectasis is important for perioperative management, especially in patients undergoing major surgery.

Mechanical ventilation provides the necessary oxygen supply for patients under general anesthesia during surgery, however, the optimal inspired oxygen fraction (FiO₂) during mechanical ventilation remains controversial. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends high FiO 2 to reduce the risk of postoperative surgical site infections in patients undergoing general anesthesia. However, this recommendation has sparked debate on the benefits and harms of hyperoxia. High oxygen concentrations have been reported to be associated with postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), especially atelectasis. Kim et al. found that postoperative atelectasis occurred more frequently with 100% FiO₂ than with 40% FiO₂. And a meta-analysis found that the extent of postoperative atelectasis was more severe in the high intraoperative FiO 2 group compared with the low FiO 2 group. Conversely, two randomised controlled trials have shown no differences in the incidence of PPCs, including atelectasis, between 80% and 30% FiO₂.

### Alveolar recruitment in acute lung injury [^116EyfrV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Alveolar recruitment is one of the primary goals of respiratory care for acute lung injury. It is aimed at improving pulmonary gas exchange and, even more important, at protecting the lungs from ventilator-induced trauma. This review addresses the concept of alveolar recruitment for lung protection in acute lung injury. It provides reasons for why atelectasis and atelectrauma should be avoided; it analyses current and future approaches on how to achieve and preserve alveolar recruitment; and it discusses the possibilities of detecting alveolar recruitment and derecruitment. The latter is of particular clinical relevance because interventions aimed at lung recruitment are often undertaken without simultaneous verification of their effectiveness.

### Preoperative atelectasis in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery: a cross-sectional study [^116kJNhj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: What is the prevalence of preoperative atelectasis in patients undergoing bariatric surgery and are changes in the preoperative peripheral saturation of oxygen (Sp 2) at room air in the seated position explained by the extent of atelectasis coverage on chest computed tomography (CT) in the supine position?
Findings: Preoperative atelectasis were highly prevalent (32.6%, 95% confidence interval, 27.0–38.9) in patients with obesity. A body mass index (BMI) > 45 kg/m² was associated with a higher relative prevalence and atelectasis percentage coverage, the latter of which alone explained 70.2% of the variation in Sp 2, with 81.5% (95% CI, 56.0–100) of the effect of BMI on Sp 2 < 96% mediated through atelectasis.
Meaning: Pulmonary atelectasis is detectable before surgery in obese patients and largely explains decreased preoperative Sp 2 values, which could be an important factor to consider when interpreting postoperative atelectasis and for deciding perioperative ventilation strategies.

North American countries have a high prevalence of obesity in adults: United States,41.9%; Canada,30.0%; and Mexico,36.9%. People living with obesity are more susceptible to complications during the perioperative period due to factors such as reduced functional residual capacity, cephalic displacement of the diaphragm, and increased adipose tissue in the chest wall and abdomen. Increasing body mass index (BMI) is associated with a greater decline in lung vital capacity during anesthesia.

Obesity is an important risk factor for lung complications (ie, atelectasis) in patients undergoing anesthesia, as these patients suffer from mechanical compression (leading to airway narrowing and closure), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Perioperative atelectasis is more common in patients with obesity compared to patients with a normal BMI, with the former experiencing persistence of atelectasis 24 hours after surgery. Although attention has focused on postoperative atelectasis, Lagier et alrecently highlighted that "the direct impact of intraoperative pulmonary atelectasis on postoperative outcomes is still unclear".

### Pneumothorax: clearing the air on the pressure-dependent airleak hypothesis [^111sS3sa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

However, pleural pressures are also likely to be influenced by the condition of the lung (e.g. atelectasis or gas trapping). There is also a vertical gradient of pleural pressure, proposed to arise from various forces including hydrostatic pressure, compression by the heart and abdomen, and viscous flow of pleural fluid. Air in the pleural space is actively absorbed, which could significantly alter the intrapleural pressures, a factor not included in most literature. Any physiologic model will need to incorporate the complex interactions of these (and other) forces.

Once a "dry" academic topic, the physiology of pneumothorax is now a vibrant and clinically relevant subject given new clinical approaches. Our current understanding of the pathophysiology is sketchy, and the hypothesis put forward by Walker and colleagues provides excellent focal points for debate and hopefully a platform for further studies and deliberation that lead to clearer understanding of the disease process.

### Applying positive end-expiratory pressure to facemask ventilation improves post-induction lung atelectasis: a three-arm randomized controlled trial [^1121epj7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Induction of general anesthesia is consistently associated with rapid formation of pulmonary atelectasis, occurring in 85–90% of patients within minutes following anesthetic administration. This pathophysiological change increases intrapulmonary shunt fraction and impairs oxygenation, even in patients with previously healthy lungs. The clinical significance of anesthesia-induced atelectasis extends beyond transient hypoxemia. Emerging evidence indicates that alveolar collapse triggers localized biological responses characterized by inflammatory activation, immune dysregulation, and compromised alveolar-capillary barrier integrity. These alterations may predispose patients to impaired pulmonary fluid clearance, increased protein permeability and risk of infection, potentially leading to postoperative pulmonary complications.

The severity of atelectasis is determined by the patient characteristics and perioperative management. Obesity and high inspired oxygen concentration (FiO₂) have been identified as significant risk amplifiers. Importantly, effective atelectasis prevention during induction of general anesthesia may enhance patient safety through improved oxygenation reserves, particularly in challenging airway scenarios requiring prolonged intubation attempts.

The application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to facemask ventilation during induction of general anesthesia has demonstrated potential to mitigate alveolar collapse, even when using high FiO 2. Current guidelines recommend maintaining intraoperative PEEP at 5 cmH₂O during mechanical ventilation, however, the optimal PEEP level used for facemask ventilation remains controversial. Low PEEP levels may inadequately prevent dorsal lung region collapse, whereas high PEEP strategies (≥ 10 cmH₂O) may compromise hemodynamic stability, induce gastric insufflation and alveolar overdistension during facemask ventilation. This safety-efficacy dilemma creates critical knowledge gaps in respiratory management during induction of general anesthesia.

This study aimed to validate whether applying 10 cmH₂O PEEP to facemask ventilation could reduce post-induction lung atelectasis without adverse effects compared to use of lower PEEP levels.

### Atelectasis and lung recruitment in pediatric anesthesia: an educational review [^115Vn8jh]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

General anesthesia is associated with development of pulmonary atelectasis. Children are more vulnerable to the development and adverse effects of atelectasis. We review the physiology and risk factors for the development of atelectasis in pediatric patients under general anesthesia. We discuss the clinical significance of atelectasis, the use and value of recruitment maneuvers, and other techniques available to minimize lung collapse. This review demonstrates the value of a recruitment maneuver, maintaining positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) until extubation and lowering FiO 2 where possible in the daily practice of the pediatric anesthetist.

### Middle lobe syndrome in children today [^117HXXA3]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Middle lobe syndrome in children is a distinct clinical and radiographic entity that has been well described in the pediatric literature. However, issues regarding its etiology, clinical presentation, and management continue to puzzle the clinical practitioner. Pathophysiologically, there are two forms of middle lobe syndrome, namely obstructive and nonobstructive. Middle lobe syndrome may present as symptomatic or asymptomatic, as persistent or recurrent atelectasis, or as pneumonitis or bronchiectasis of the middle lobe and/or lingula. A lower threshold of performing a chest radiograph is warranted in children with persistent or recurrent nonspecific respiratory symptoms, particularly if there is clinical deterioration, in order to detect middle lobe syndrome and to initiate a further diagnostic and therapeutic workup.

### Alveolar collapse as a threat to mechanically ventilated lungs [^1151Ldwa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Alveolar collapse is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with multiple causative mechanisms. First, the initial inflammation triggers extravasation of proteinaceous exudate and recruitment of inflammatory cells with occupation of the alveolar airspace; second, inflammatory edema increases lung weight, which compresses the alveoli in the gravitationally dependent regions; third, reabsorption atelectasis due to high inspired oxygen fraction develops in hypo- or nonventilated lung regions (e.g. in the presence of bronchial occlusion due to secretions or airway closure); and fourth, reduced surfactant activity facilitates a loss of lung aeration.

From a clinical perspective, the extent of alveolar collapse has long been recognized as a key feature of ARDS severity. Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray have been included in the clinical definition of ARDS since its very first version. The number of quadrants involved on chest X-ray was part of the 1988 lung injury score, and its prognostic value has recently been confirmed. Later, quantitative analysis of chest computed tomography scan confirmed that higher lung weight (and higher recruitability) is associated with worse outcome.

### Volutrauma and atelectrauma: which is worse? [^116odsK4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Atelectrauma

Stress and strain amplify at interfaces between regions with different elasticity; these junctions act as "stress risers". For injured lungs, the stress multiplier (which varies with PL) may exceed 2.0. One consequence of microatelectasis is the generation of these stress risers, which encourage shearing stresses and also amplify the consequences of applied power to the 'baby lung'. Apart from opening and closing, these too are relevant forms of 'atelectrauma'.

Another important but often neglected physical amplifier of stress and strain ('drop-out') is rather intuitive. Let us assume that a load of 10 kg is sustained by 10 parallel and interconnected elastic cords that suspend it. Each supports 1000 g (stress) and undergoes similar elongation from its resting baseline (strain). If three of the ten cords do not elongate (in analogy to atelectasis), the remaining seven will support ~ 1430 g each (an increase in stress) and will be proportionally more stretched (an increase in strain).

### Comparative outcomes of inpatients with lung collapse managed by bronchoscopic or conservative means [^115hM45f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Atelectatic lung collapse is a common occurrence in the inpatient setting, although the exact incidence is unknown, and represents a management dilemma for physicians. Complete collapse acutely reduces lung volume and may incite or worsen hypoxaemia through shunting and introduce a risk of nosocomial pneumonia.

Lung collapse may be broadly attributed to obstructive or non-obstructive insults. Obstructive phenomena (ie, mucous plugs, endobronchial lesions and foreign bodies) disrupt alveolar-airway continuity, eventuating in resorption of trapped distal gas and subsequent atelectasis. Non-obstructive collapse may be further characterised as extrapulmonary or intrapulmonary. Pleural diseases (ie, effusions or pneumothorax) and chest wall masses are extrapulmonary disorders that produce atelectasis via direct lung compression, whereas non-obstructive intrapulmonary atelectasis may result from surfactant deficiency or infiltrative parenchymal disease.

At present, there are no standard guidelines for the management of lung collapse, which typically is focused on addressing specific underlying conditions. If obstruction is suspected, the various techniques used to relieve atelectasis/lung collapse include airway suction, chest physiotherapy (with percussion), vibration vests, postural drainage, mucolytic agents and flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FFB).

The intent of this study was to evaluate outcomes of patients with complete or near-complete lung collapse, comparing the interventional FFB management with a solely conservative approach.

### Computed tomographic assessment of lung weights in trauma patients with early posttraumatic lung dysfunction [^114Cnszy]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Calculation of M lung and parameters such as the excess lung tissue or weight by performing qCT can help to distinguish atelectasis from consolidation due to more significant lung damage. It could be argued that atelectasis may also be distinguished visually from contusion or edema on the basis of typical topographical distributions. Analysis of qCT, however, can still assess M lung in the presence of pleural fluid or when atelectasis is obscuring edema or pulmonary contusions. When lung aeration is impaired without a concomitant increase in M lung, atelectasis is the most likely explanation. Accordingly, atelectasis was the most plausible cause of lung dysfunction in 59% of our ALI patients (Table 3). Interestingly, atelectasis patients also had significantly lower V lung values than consolidation patients (Table 3). Although V lung was not controlled in our study, the latter observation is compatible with the concept of atelectasis: V lung is reduced by collapse, while consolidation of the lung does not necessarily decrease V lung. The identification of trauma patients in whom atelectasis mimics ALI could be helpful in decision making and individualization of care (that is, early definitive stabilization rather than damage control surgery). Atelectasis may persist into the posttraumatic period, promote bacterial growth and nosocomial pneumonia and affect patient outcome. Therefore, more aggressive ventilatory management, early definitive surgical treatment and timely weaning from mechanical ventilation could shorten the ICU treatment and reduce the incidence of infections in patients with atelectasis.

### Alveolar collapse is a threat in injured lungs, but what about the airway opening pressure? [^112F1M2T]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

It may be postulated that animals in the low overdistension group had PEEP set below the airway opening pressure, resulting in repeated opening and closing of the distal airways, causing absorption atelectasis; alveolar collapse; and resultant ventilation perfusion mismatch, shunt, and right ventricular failure. Finally, although the authors measured intrinsic PEEP, failure to account for airway closure will lead to erroneous estimates of mean alveolar pressure and driving pressure.

Reporting airway opening pressure in the article and studies that explore PEEP in lung injury would help resolve these concerns.

### Prevalence and clinical consequences of atelectasis in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a computed tomography retrospective cohort study [^112JHcLc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations to be addressed. First, this is a retrospective study, but in a situation of healthcare collapse, it was impossible to carry out prospective studies which need more time for approval and organization. However, our hospital has all the computerized medical history data, making data collection very reliable. We do recognize that a number of patients that were included in the study did not have a specific medical record (it was even, in a number of cases, the first time to come to the hospital). Second, we selected all the chest CT scans in the period with the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in our hospital, with high clinical suspicion of PE. Additionally, the scale we used to measure the severity of the pulmonary affection in chest CT (, shown in Additional file 1), based on the findings of Wong KT et al. takes into account the percentage of lobar infiltration and even pleural effusion, which could be logically associated with worst outcome. However, there were no differences between the large atelectasis group and the other groups in this scale. Regarding atelectasis, the same radiologist carried out a visual quantification by lobes for every scan in order to reduce heterogeneity between various radiologists. Third, the group without atelectasis might not be considered as a standard control group but a group of patients with significant oxygenation impairment due to several causes (including PE), hence introducing a possible selection bias as patients without atelectasis and mild infection would not be represented. However, this makes our study's findings even more relevant in relation to the differences between the group of large atelectasis (which indeed is composed by a reduced number of patients, 8) and its relationships with outcome compared with the other groups. We did not evaluate complications occurring during the hospital stay, but we do know that there are several differences between the groups regarding oxygenation, oxygen-therapy needs, ICU admission and days of hospitalization. Whether if these differences are associated directly or indirectly to atelectasis has to be determined on further studies.

### Prevalence and clinical consequences of atelectasis in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a computed tomography retrospective cohort study [^116Y2Tio]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study we found that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia the prevalence of atelectasis was 24%. Among them, 19% of the patients showed small atelectasis and 5% of the patients showed large atelectasis. Patients with larger compared to smaller atelectasis showed less SatO₂/FiO₂ ratio, higher rate of ICU admission and longer length of in-hospital stay. Among the few published studies investigating atelectasis in chest CT in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, our study includes the largest number of patients (237 patients screened, of whom 155 patients met all entry criteria). In our study, the prevalence of atelectasis was 24% which is higher than the previously reported (around 5%). However, previous studies did not focus on atelectasis but generally describing the most frequently patterns at chest CT scans. Furthermore, the greatest prevalence of atelectasis was mostly composed by mild, segmental or subsegmental atelectasis. No previous study separated smaller and larger atelectasis associated with the clinical outcome. We made this distinction based on proposed pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and its relationship with oxygenation: it has been suggested that the progression of the disease would be associated with more severe hypoxia. Currently and from anatomopathological studies carried out on patients with ARDS, we know that in addition to diffuse alveolar injury and hyaline membrane formation (typical of all ARDS and VILI), there are areas of dead space that worsen gas exchange even more. Moreover, the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reflex (Euler-Liljestrand mechanism) may further worsen ischemic and thrombotic phenomena in the lung. Patients with large atelectasis showed a tendency to a greater involvement of lung tissue by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia than in those without and small atelectasis. In fact, they required a higher ICU admission rate, with greater need of intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition, patients with larger atelectasis showed worse oxygenation ratios (SatO₂/FiO₂) during admission and had a longer in-hospital stay (nearly the double than in patients with small or no atelectasis). Previous studies reported a lower incidence of atelectasis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Our data suggest that the presence of large atelectasis may be a factor affecting progressive evolution to the ARDS. The SatO₂/FiO₂ ratio and atelectasis detection by chest CT might be two valuable tools for the lung function assessment of these patients and hence might be helpful to predict those patients who will need mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and prolonged length of in-hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was not different among patients with no, small or large atelectasis. This can be explained by the fact that mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is not only related to pulmonary injury, but also to development of multiple organ failures. The development of significant atelectasis favors more chances of respiratory complications and a higher morbidity with greater risk of ICU admission and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The establishment of an early treatment with non-invasive respiratory ventilation to reverse atelectasis or prevent their progression, together with intensive surveillance or in intermediate care, could prevent a progression of lung injury with a worse outcome in patients in which this condition is detected.

### Case report: refractory atelectasis after infection of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an immunocompetent patient [^115BWHaY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atelectasis is a condition characterized by the reduction of volume or air content of one or more lung tissues due to a variety of reasons, resulting in functional tissue collapse or atrophy, alveolar hypoxia, pulmonary vasoconstriction and improper ventilation-perfusion matching. Atelectasis can occur through various mechanisms, including airway obstruction (such as mucous plug, plastic bronchitis), compression by extrathoracic or intrathoracic factors, and alterations in surface tension within the alveoli. The most common cause of atelectasis is infection. Descriptive categorization of atelectasis includes subsegmental, segmental, lobar, or whole lung involvement. Most atelectasis can be cleared after removing the cause of disease, anti-infection, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), physical therapy and so on, but some atelectasis cannot through above treatments, described as refractory atelectasis, also meant long-term atelectasis. At present, there are few studies on refractory atelectasis or long-term atelectasis, and most of the refractory atelectasis reported in children were cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, immunodeficiency and complicated with neuromuscular diseases. It is unusual for a previously healthy and immunocompetent child to present with refractory atelectasis.

Human adenovirus (HAdV) and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae (MP) both are important pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children, both of them are the common pathogenes leading to atelectasis. Children sometimes get co-infected with both HAdV and MP. As we all know, HAdV infection to be a remarkably strong post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO) -associated etiological agent in children. The common imaging findings of PIBO are Mosaic sign, while long-term atelectasis is rare. Currently, there is a lack of study suggested an association between infection of HAdV or MP and refractory atelectasis. In our case, a previously healthy child developed long-term atelectasis of her left lung needing lobectomy after HAdV and MP infection. What puzzled us was why our patient present with refractory atelectasis.

### The effectiveness of postoperative rehabilitation interventions that include breathing exercises to prevent pulmonary atelectasis in lung cancer resection patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1165sRCm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis

To determine intervention effects for different types of atelectasis, we intended to perform a subgroup analysis. However, the retrieved studies did not provide us with enough information about the types of atelectasis observed. Thus, the subgroup analysis was discontinued.

Sensitivity analysis

In this systematic review, we intended to conduct sensitivity analyses by excluding articles with a high risk of bias, which often has some different characteristics. In this way, we could use the random-effects model rather than the fixed-effects model. Alternatively, each study was excluded one by one, and the remaining studies were pooled to determine whether the results varied significantly.

### Non-lobar atelectasis generates inflammation and structural alveolar injury in the surrounding healthy tissue during mechanical ventilation [^117D8tqK]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study we used a novel model of non-lobar atelectasis through non-selective bronchial blocking in rats, and investigated its effects on the atelectatic area as well as on the surrounding healthy lung tissue during injurious mechanical ventilation. The atelectasis model was reliable and greater histological evidence of hyperinflation and inflammation was observed in the PeriAT region.

Most of the experimental studies on the relationships between atelectasis, mechanical ventilation and VILI have the starting point of surfactant depletion and/or some type of acute lung-insult. For instance, surfactant depletion is usually produced by saline lavage and results in decrease in lung compliance and hypoxemia. When saline lavage is followed by mechanical ventilation with high volumes and low PEEP, a type of lung injury results that is very similar to ARDS in humans. These models invariably contain, from the very beginning, unstable airspaces and a consequent gravitational gradient of collapse. In contrast, our experimental model was designated in such a way that the starting point was, as much as possible, only the primary interaction between collapsed and aerated regions, that is, before any surfactant dysfunction and/or another potential VILI mechanism could become involved. Accordingly, our model initially presented lung parenchyma homogeneously aerated with an isolated peripheral inhomogeneity. In this way we can focus on the true interaction between collapse and healthy alveoli during the mechanical ventilation.

VILI has been thought to predominate in the collapse-dependent regions and/or in the over-distended non-dependent regions. Tsuchida et al. demonstrated that in a model of alveolar collapse and surfactant depletion the atelectasis regions per se were protected from alveolar damage, whereas alveoli from the aerated regions were more affected. Very recently, Cereda et al. used magnetic resonance imaging to provide in vivo imaging evidence of airspace expansion in a surfactant-depleted model. Their data suggest that atelectasis could contribute to VILI by reciprocal increases in airspace size and that lung injury could be minimized through alveolar recruitment and adequate PEEP. This suggestion is supported by morphometric and clinical data and contrasts with previous reports suggesting an increase of VILI in the atelectasis during MV. Adding another point of view for the pressing question on the localization of the regional onset of lung inflammation, other recent findings suggest that the interface between the collapsed and aerated tissue may play an important role in lung injury.

### Airway closure, more harmful than atelectasis in intensive care? [^1117guj1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Airway closure increases with increasing age, a consequence of loss of elastic tissue in the lung that may produce a positive pleural pressure in dependent regions. Decrease in resting lung volume, functional residual capacity (FRC), promotes airway closure. Factors that in combination reduce FRC, like anesthesia, age, obesity and head down positions for surgery will all increase likelihood for airway closure. Recently, complete airway closure has been suggested in ARDS. In these patients, lung inflation starts when airway pressure reaches a critical level of opening pressure. This has been mistaken in the past as being a lower inflection point indicating recruitment of a collapsed lung. This phenomenon may be due to collapse of airways at end-expiration. The mechanism and actual location of this collapse is unknown and may not be identical to the classic airway closure that is related to transpulmonary pressure and, thus, is gravitationally oriented. One possible, still speculative, mechanism is that the trachea is compressed by surrounding tissue that may be increased in obesity and/or displaced by body position, and by relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle. Surfactant depletion may add to both central and peripheral airway instability and cause widespread closure and injury, also in distal airways. As a consequence, alveoli remain inflated at end-expiration. A recent study of ARDS found one-third of patients depicting complete airway closure with reopening anywhere between 6 and 20 cm H₂O. Complete airway closure has also been reported in 22% of obese anesthetized patients with normal lungs. In patients with ARDS, obesity increases the incidence of airway closure (more than 65% of patients with BMI > 39 kg/m²). Interestingly while auto-PEEP (or intrinsic PEEP) is easily eliminated by prolonging expiratory time, the level of airway opening pressure is not influenced by the duration of expiration and remains at a very reproducible level. The absence of ventilation below this airway opening pressure has been visualized by electric impedance tomography.

### Computed tomographic assessment of lung weights in trauma patients with early posttraumatic lung dysfunction [^111CjVC6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Diagnosis, management and further study of ALI in trauma patients may be hampered by uncertainties about the fulfillment of the criteria for ALI proposed by the AECC.

- Differentiation between atelectasis and consolidation of the lung by qCT may help to identify patients with different etiologies of posttraumatic lung dysfunction.

- In our study, atelectasis was the most likely cause of early posttraumatic lung dysfunction in more than half of patients, and only 20% of patients had M lung values in the range previously reported for ALI.

- Trauma patients with atelectasis may require shorter periods of mechanical ventilation and treatment in the ICU.

- In the future, information from qCT could aid in managing patients with early posttraumatic lung dysfunction.

### Risk assessment for and strategies to reduce perioperative pulmonary complications for patients undergoing noncardiothoracic surgery: a guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117VrHM5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Postoperative pulmonary complications play an important role in the risk for patients undergoing noncardiothoracic surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications are as prevalent as cardiac complications and contribute similarly to morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. Pulmonary complications may even be more likely than cardiac complications to predict long-term mortality after surgery. The purpose of this guideline is to provide guidance to clinicians on clinical and laboratory predictors of perioperative pulmonary risk before noncardiothoracic surgery. It also evaluates strategies to reduce the perioperative pulmonary risk and focuses on atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The target audience for this guideline is general internists or other clinicians involved in perioperative management of surgical patients. The target patient population is all adult persons undergoing noncardiothoracic surgery.

### Early postoperative fever and atelectasis in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery [^114g5qRr]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Atelectasis is a common complication after upper abdominal surgery and considered as a cause of early postoperative fever (EPF) within 48 hours after surgery. However, the pathophysiologic mechanism of how atelectasis causes fever remains unclear.

Study Design

Data for adult patients who underwent elective major upper abdominal surgery under general anesthesia at Seoul National University Hospital between January and December of 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was the association between fever and atelectasis within 2 days after surgery.

Results

Of 1,624 patients, 810 patients (49.9%) developed EPF. The incidence of atelectasis was similar between the fever group and the no-fever group (51.6% vs 53.9%, p = 0.348). Multivariate analysis showed no significant association between atelectasis and EPF. Culture tests (21.7% vs 8.8%, p < 0.001) and prolonged use of antibiotics (25.9% vs 13.9%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in the fever group compared to the no-fever group. However, the frequency of bacterial growth on culture tests and postoperative pulmonary complications within 7 days were similar between the two groups.

Conclusions

EPF after major upper abdominal surgery was not associated with radiologically detected atelectasis. EPF also was not associated with the increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, bacterial growth on culture studies, or prolonged length of hospital stay.

### Ventilator induced lung injury: a case for a larger umbrella? [^111H46CV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

VILI pathogenesis

In healthy lungs

In Fig. 1, we summarize two, not-mutually exclusive, pathways resulting from ventilation with injurious MP. The first leads to a structural modification of the lung parenchyma (alveolar ruptures and extracellular matrix fragmentation), with secondary inflammation, increased capillary permeability and edema, increased lung weight and formation of compression atelectasis. The second results from an increase in pleural pressure and hemodynamic depressions which leads to fluid administration, water retention, positive fluid balance, increased lung weight and compression atelectasis.

Fig. 1
Potential mechanisms associated with the structural and functional injury. Panel A (healthy lung). Direct damage: high strain leads to structural changes such as alveolar ruptures, with consequent inflammation and increased permeability. Indirect damage: hemodynamic impact due to positive pressure ventilation leads to an increase of fluids administration and a kidney response which retains water and sodium. Both direct and indirect paths lead to lung water retention and oedema with the consequent formation of compression atelectasis. Panel B (injured lung). In acute respiratory distress syndrome lung where inflammation, increased lung weight and compression atelectasis, are already present, the increased mechanical power amplifies them

In injured lungs

Inflammatory edema and pulmonary hypertension characterize ARDS. VILI induces similar alterations, making impossible to discriminate between the natural history of ARDS and the contribution of harmful MV. A possible simplified schema is presented in Fig. 1, Panel B. As shown, VILI enhances the pathological features of ARDS and adds the structural changes to the lung parenchyma due to the ventilation of smaller and inhomogeneous lungs (baby lung).

### Effects of 30% vs. 60% inspired oxygen fraction during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis: a randomised controlled trial [^114Si614]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have provided conflicting results; thus the effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis requires further investigation. Additionally, several issues in such research should be noted and improved upon. First, most of the previous studies usually compared the effects of extremely high FiO₂ (80–100%) and low FiO₂ (30–40%) on atelectasis. In clinical practice, a moderate FiO 2 of 50–60% is more conventionally used. However, the effect of low (30%) versus moderate (60%) FiO 2 on atelectasis remains unclear. Second, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers have often been used in studies to investigate the effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis. As PEEP and recruitment maneuvers could reduce the incidence and extent of atelectasis, the independent effect of FiO 2 on atelectasis remains to be investigated. Third, although lung ultrasound was used in previous studies to diagnose atelectasis, it cannot measure the volume of atelectasis. Computed tomography (CT) is the current gold standard for diagnosing atelectasis and it can accurately measure the volume of different aeration regions.

Therefore, we conducted a randomised controlled study to investigate the effects of 30% versus 60% FiO 2 without PEEP and recruitment maneuvers on postoperative atelectasis volume measured by CT scans. We tested the hypothesis that 30% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation could reduce postoperative atelectasis volume compared with 60% FiO 2.

### Case report: refractory atelectasis after infection of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in an immunocompetent patient [^112m5rxs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Atelectasis is defined as collapse of alveolar spaces due to a variety of reasons. Most atelectasis could improve after removing the cause by chest physiotherapy, medical treatment, therapeutic bronchoscopy and so on. However, some atelectasis cannot be cleared with above treatments, resulting in long-term atelectasis, also called as refractory atelectasis. It easily leads to recurrent infection, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and lung necrosis. So, it is important to identify causal mechanism of refractory atelectasis, which may contribute to explore effective approach and reducing complications.

Case Presentation

We present the case of a 4-years-old girl admitted to hospital with fever and cough for 6 days, who had pulmonary consolidation in left lower lobe due to human adenovirus-7 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Although the patient did not have inborn errors of immunity, neuromuscular disease or inherited metabolic diseases through medical history and laboratory examination, the consolidation of the left lower lung still existed after a series of treatments, including mechanical ventilation, intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic corticosteroid, azithromycin and bronchoalveolar lavage. Even, chest HRCT showed left lung atelectasis one month after discharge. In the follow-up 1 years, she was hospitalized for respiratory infections and wheezing 4 times. In consideration of refractory atelectasis and recurrent infections, left lung was resected by thoracoscopy and postoperative pathology confirmed bronchiolitis obliterans. Specific antibodies was utilized to identify type I and II alveolar epithelial cells, club cells, ionocytes and ciliated cells respectively, which show a selective reduction in type I alveolar epithelial cells.

Conclusion

It is rare that a previously healthy child developed to refractory atelectasis after an infection which ultimately resulted in a lobectomy. The cellular analysis of the atrophic lung tissue showed a selective reduction in type I alveolar epithelial cells.

### Effects of 30% vs. 60% inspired oxygen fraction during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis: a randomised controlled trial [^111jwmZh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomised study, we found no significant differences in the percentage of postoperative atelectasis volume in patients ventilated with 30% FiO 2 and 60% FiO 2. In addition, there were also no significant differences in the secondary outcomes, including the different aeration region volumes, incidence of clinically significant atelectasis, and oxygenation index at the end of surgery between the two groups. Taken together, these results suggest that 30% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation does not improve postoperative atelectasis compared to 60% FiO 2.

Recently, a large number of clinical trials have compared the effects of high FiO 2 (80–100%) versus low FiO 2 (30–40%) on postoperative atelectasis in patients with mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia, observing a higher incidence of atelectasis in the high FiO2 group. However, it is noteworthy that a moderate FiO 2 of 50–60% is more conventionally used in clinical practice, while only a few trials have compared moderate FiO 2 with low FiO 2. In 2021, Park et al. reported a higher incidence of postoperative atelectasis (39%) in the 60% FiO 2 group compared with the incidence of atelectasis (20%) in the 35% FiO 2 group. Whereas in our study, no statistically significant differences in postoperative atelectasis volume were observed between patients applying 30% and 60% FiO 2. There are several reasons for the contradictory results. First, the FiO 2 during the postoperative period in the PACU was different between the two studies. Park et al. increased FiO 2 when patients arrived at the PACU. It has been demonstrated that the use of a high FiO 2 during the immediate postoperative period in the PACU may carry the potential risk of developing atelectasis. Therefore, we maintained the same FiO 2 in the PACU as that administered during the intraoperative period. Second, differences in the inclusion population may also have contributed to the differences in the atelectasis between the two groups. The trial by Park et al. included patients undergoing abdominal surgery, most of whom underwent open procedures and were more vulnerable to PPCs. Abdominal surgery may induce elevation of the diaphragm, which may affect pulmonary aeration postoperatively. The neurosurgery included in this study could exclude the effect of surgical operation on atelectasis. Third and most importantly, the results may be affected by different detection methods of atelectasis. In the study by Park et al. using lung ultrasound, atelectasis after surgery was detected in 29.7% of the patients. In the present study, we used chest CT to detect atelectasis because it can accurately measure the volume of atelectasis. We found that atelectasis with more than 1% lung volume, which is considered as clinically significant, was detected in 83.2% of patients after surgery. The results were consistent with those of the study by Akca et al. They found that 70% of patients, who received mechanical ventilation during general anesthesia, had postoperative atelectasis with more than 1% lung volume.

### Wheeze in the time of COVID-19: overcoming obstacles to an unusual diagnosis [^113B2Ghu]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

This case is an example of a rare cause of a common clinical presentation (persistent lobar collapse with wheeze). We describe patient management from primary care through to a national thoracic referral centre. We highlight the importance of objective testing to support an asthma diagnosis and the need to consider alternative or additional diagnoses if a patient does not respond to treatment or the clinical course is unexpected. We highlight the importance of follow-up X-ray to determine whether atelectasis has resolved, which was significantly delayed in this case due to COVID-19 restrictions. Though rare, an endobronchial tumour should be considered if atelectasis persists and when planning endoscopy for a presumed foreign body, especially if the clinical history and patient factors make a foreign body less likely. Greater awareness of this as a differential may expedite diagnoses for patients in future. We show how virtual, multicentre, multidisciplinary meetings can aid rapid diagnosis, surgical planning and coordination of follow-up across centres.

Postoperative pulmonary complications and atelectasis — role of ACT: The use of ACT in the setting of atelectasis without retained airway secretions does not appear to be effective, particularly after upper abdominal and thoracic incisions where performing these maneuvers is likely to increase pain, which further impairs lung function and cough; time-honored therapies without sufficient evidence should be abandoned in favor of multi-faceted approaches that include patient education, collaborative care, and early ambulation.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: effectiveness of pharmacologic airway clearance therapies in hospitalized patients [^111J95d4]. Respiratory Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Postoperative adult and pediatric patients — atelectasis risk and N-acetylcysteine (N-acetylcysteine) trials are summarized as follows. The incidence of postoperative atelectasis is higher for thoracic surgery at 19–59% than for upper abdominal surgery at 16–20% or lower abdominal surgery at 0–5%, and atelectasis has been reported to occur in up to 90% of anesthetized subjects. Only 2 low-quality reports were found in this population, both involving N-acetylcysteine; a Danish randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing preoperative oral and postoperative intravenous N-acetylcysteine versus saline placebo in elective upper laparotomy found no difference in pulmonary function or atelectasis. In a second report's first study of abdominal surgery, intratracheal N-acetylcysteine every 2 h versus saline placebo yielded atelectasis incidence of 45% (9/20) in the placebo group versus 10% (2/20) in the study group.

Breath-hold for image acquisition

Timing the breath-hold

A breath-hold is required to reduce motion artifact and provide clearer, more accurate images during certain image-guided bronchoscopy procedures (e.g. fluoroscopic navigation, CBCT). These procedures require a complete lack of movement beyond cardiac pulsations; therefore, a carefully timed breath-hold is essential. The breath-hold should be performed at peak inspiration, not at end-expiration. This does not require a vital capacity maneuver, rather, it should occur at the end of a normal inspiratory breath (Fig. 4).

### Postoperative pulmonary complications [^112ba44A]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common, costly, and increase patient mortality. Changes to the respiratory system occur immediately on induction of general anaesthesia: respiratory drive and muscle function are altered, lung volumes reduced, and atelectasis develops in > 75% of patients receiving a neuromuscular blocking drug. The respiratory system may take 6 weeks to return to its preoperative state after general anaesthesia for major surgery. Risk factors for PPC development are numerous, and clinicians should be aware of non-modifiable and modifiable factors in order to recognize those at risk and optimize their care. Many validated risk prediction models are described. These have been useful for improving our understanding of PPC development, but there remains inadequate consensus for them to be useful clinically. Preventative measures include preoperative optimization of co-morbidities, smoking cessation, and correction of anaemia, in addition to intraoperative protective ventilation strategies and appropriate management of neuromuscular blocking drugs. Protective ventilation includes low tidal volumes, which must be calculated according to the patient's ideal body weight. Further evidence for the most beneficial level of PEEP is required, and on-going randomized trials will hopefully provide more information. When PEEP is used, it may be useful to precede this with a recruitment manoeuvre if atelectasis is suspected. For high-risk patients, surgical time should be minimized. After surgery, nasogastric tubes should be avoided and analgesia optimized. A postoperative mobilization, chest physiotherapy, and oral hygiene bundle reduces PPCs.

### Total unilateral pulmonary collapse secondary to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a case series of an unusual cause of complete atelectasis [^115U8NzP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this context, the diagnosis of ABPA may be supported by the presence of typical radiologic findings. The most common CT-scan findings are mucoid impactions and bronchiectasis predominantly involving the segmental and subsegmental bronchi of the upper lobes, with centrilobular nodules. In case of total unilateral lung collapse, these imaging findings should be investigated in the contralateral lung. A CT scan was performed in three of our patients. Unfortunately, only one had imaging findings consistent with ABPA in the contralateral lung that could have guided the diagnosis. In the other cases, bronchoscopy was first performed rather than a CT scan because the clinical and biological findings strongly suggested the diagnosis of ABPA, especially in the two patients with a history of ABPA.

The diagnosis of ABPA is always challenging in patients with total lung collapse, in the absence of a preexisting respiratory condition and other characteristic findings on the CT scan. Many criteria have been proposed over the years with different diagnostic algorithms but there is a lack of consensus for standardized criteria. When a patient present with total lung collapse associated with clinical and biological findings consistent with ABPA, we recommend to use the 10-component diagnostic criteria for ABPA/ABPM proposed by Asano et al. Flexible bronchoscopy should be considered when lung collapse is associated with respiratory distress, with the objective of removing obstructive mucus plugs. Besides, the endoscopic aspect of the mucus may be helpful for the diagnosis, and Asano et al. have retained this criterion in their recent criteria for ABPA/ABPM. Interestingly, the use of a cryoprobe may increase the likelihood of successfully removing the plugs, as shown here in one patient.

### Official American Thoracic Society technical standards: flexible airway endoscopy in children [^112YzFtc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Flexible airway endoscopy (FAE) in children — atelectasis: FAE can safely be performed in infants and children with atelectasis in a variety of settings, and when atelectasis is not resolving and is problematic, FAE should be considered. Reports suggest FAE utility in the diagnosis of the etiology of atelectasis in 62 to 100% of cases. Therapeutically, FAE has been used to relieve atelectasis in diseases including hyaline membrane disease, pneumonia, CF, and plastic bronchitis, with variable success; the use of sterile saline washes is standard practice, and although case reports describe bronchoscopically instilled mucolytics and other agents, the efficacy of these techniques over standard approaches has not been demonstrated. Flexible bronchoscopy can be performed for atelectasis when it is persistent, recurrent, and physiologically important or when the etiology of the atelectasis is in question.

### Effect of sigh in lateral position on postoperative atelectasis in adults assessed by lung ultrasound: a randomized, controlled trial [^112rQJbt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective randomized controlled trial, all patients presented varying degrees of aeration modification or atelectasis under general anesthesia lasting for 2 h or longer. Atelectasis is usually associated with decreased lung compliance, impaired oxygenation, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and lung injury. Therefore, improvement of oxygenation, lung compliance and aeration also correlates well with reopening of atelectatic alveoli. Our study showed that sigh in lateral position could improve gas exchange, lung compliance and aeration with no severe complications. However, there is no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between groups.

Mechanisms contributing to postoperative atelectasis

If general anesthesia does induce atelectasis, then what happens when a patient with normal lungs is placed in a supine position, is anesthetized with anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers, is intubated and ventilated with high concentration oxygen and fixed tidal volume? Three of the most agreed-on mechanisms are dyskinesis, prolonged exposure to high-concentrated oxygen, and ablation of sigh breaths. The neuromuscular blockade could induce paralysis of respiratory muscles and cephalad shift of diaphragm in recumbent human subjects, which allows subsequent compression of lower lobe exerted by lungs' own weight and abdominal pressure. Compression atelectasis has been demonstrated in both anesthetized children and adults. During the induction of general anesthesia, high fraction oxygen could be rapidly absorbed, leading to absorption atelectasis. A study showed that atelectasis was significant in patients receiving 100% oxygen, but it was not obvious and virtually absent in patients receiving 80% and 60% oxygen, respectively. Sigh, a deep inspiration characterized by large volumetric fluctuations, could promote the release and distribution of surfactant on the alveolar surface and distal airways, decrease ventilation heterogeneity, and improve lung elastance. During general anesthesia, muscle paralysis and fixed tidal volume ventilation would result in an interruption of sigh breath, thus leading to surfactant depletion, alveolar instability, and loss-of-surfactant atelectasis.

### Reexpansion of atelectasis caused by use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before radiation therapy (RT) [^115FqVZA]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The use of CPAP caused reexpansion of atelectasis resulting from malignant bronchial obstruction. Lung reexpansion improved treatment planning by allowing for better identification and targeting of the obstructing lesion, sparing of normal lung tissue from radiation exposure, and reducing the need for replanning treatment. Further study to assess the use of CPAP for reexpansion of atelectasis resulting from malignant bronchial obstruction is indicated.

### Continuous intra-abdominal pressure: is it ready for prime time? [^116xw1oy]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

There are four factors affecting IAP: gravity, uniformity of compression, shear stress and deformation, and presence of abdominal muscle contraction. However, in the critically ill patient the abdomen often behaves as a hydraulic system. Raised IAP affects multiple organ systems within and outside the abdominal cavity and understanding the pathophysiology can prevent impending ACS and guide treatment. The kidneys are very vulnerable to raised IAP and some suggest they are the canary in the coalmine for IAH and elevated renal parenchymal and venous pressures are the main causes for AKI. Subsequently, raised IAP decreases chest wall compliance and in combination with the cranial shift of the diaphragm this results in reduced lung volumes causing compression atelectasis, hypoxia and hypercarbia. In addition, the negative effects of increased IAP on the cardiovascular system are explained by significant changes in preload, afterload, and contractility. As a result, reduced cardiac output leads to low blood pressure followed by poor organ perfusion and eventually worsening of IAH. A summary of the effects of raised IAP on other end-organs are shown in Fig. 1 Panel A.

### Pulmonary atelectasis after sedation with propofol vs propofol-ketamine for magnetic resonance imaging in children: a randomized clinical trial [^111CJ2To]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Various mechanisms, including absorption atelectasis, tissue compression, and decreased surfactant function, have been proposed to explain the development of anesthesia-induced atelectasis. One possible explanation for absorption atelectasis is shallow breathing induced by anesthetics administration. The use of anesthetics causes a loss of muscle tone and a decrease in functional residual capacity, leading to absorption atelectasis. Another potential mechanism underlying absorption atelectasis is upper airway obstruction. Even at subhypnotic doses, propofol is associated with an increase in upper airway collapsibility in a dose-dependent manner in healthy volunteers, whereas ketamine maintains upper airway patency and elicits a compensatory respiratory response. Although atelectasis occurred frequently in the propofol group, we did not find any differences in diaphragmatic excursion between both groups. This finding suggests that the occurrence of atelectasis may be attributed to differences in upper airway patency rather than to differences in shallow breathing. However, in our study, we could not confirm whether atelectasis was due to upper airway obstruction because the degree of obstruction was not measured.

### Role of total lung stress on the progression of early COVID-19 pneumonia [^116sf2K4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia associated to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered a form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when it meets ARDS criteria (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio below 300 mmHg at PEEP of 5 cmH₂O or more associated with bilateral X-ray infiltrates). Accordingly, many hospitalized patients are classified as COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS). However, frequent discrepancies between the severity of oxygenation impairment, the relatively maintained lung mechanics, together with atypical lung imaging raises the question whether the CARDS pathophysiology is really similar to that of ARDS from other etiologies. To select appropriate treatment, in particular the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), understanding the characteristics of the underlying pathology is crucial. Indeed, in heavy and edematous lungs PEEP usually facilitates better oxygenation by maintaining open those unstable lung units, therefore, preventing atelectasis. Such features and mechanisms have been well-known characteristics of typical ARDS since its original description. However, the undelaying pathophysiology of CARDS is fundamentally different, particularly during the early clinical stages, because CARDS lacks extensive edema and atelectasis. Consequently, customary levels of PEEP may simply increase the stress applied to the lung. During spontaneous breathing, total lung stress is the sum of the transpulmonary pressures generated by the patient and by the end-expiratory airway pressure. Acting together during vigorous breathing, these components may promote patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI). Indeed, the level of total lung stress per cycle, the breathing frequency and the total time of its application have the potential to cause further lung deterioration.

In the current study, our aim was to answer the following questions: (1) Is the degree of hypoxemia determined by the same mechanisms as in typical ARDS (i.e. edema and atelectasis)? (2) Is total lung stress a contributing factor of clinical progression in spontaneously breathing patients?

To address these questions, we evaluated the anatomical features of the lung using quantitative computed tomography (CT) and determined total lung stress by estimating transpulmonary pressure.

### Anesthesia strategies to minimize lung atelectasis in peripheral bronchoscopy [^1151psdP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Peripheral bronchoscopy has become a widely adopted, minimally invasive modality for the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. However, its diagnostic yield remains limited in part due to intra-procedural atelectasis - a frequently overlooked phenomenon that obscures lesions and exacerbates computed tomography (CT)-to-body divergence. This review highlights the prevalence and clinical impact of atelectasis during navigational bronchoscopy and presents anesthesia and ventilation strategies to mitigate its occurrence.

Recent Findings

Emerging data from trials such as I-LOCATE, ventilatory strategy to prevent atelectasis (VESPA), and lung navigation ventilation protocol (LNVP) studies show that atelectasis develops early and frequently during bronchoscopy, particularly in dependent lung zones and patients with high BMI. Strategies to reduce atelectasis include high tidal volumes, optimized positive end-expiratory pressure, reduced FiO2, and recruitment maneuvers. Dedicated ventilation protocols like VESPA and LNVP have significantly reduced both incidence and severity of atelectasis, improved lesion visibility, and demonstrated safety. Apneic breath-hold techniques further enhance image quality and lesion targeting.

Summary

Atelectasis is a modifiable barrier to diagnostic success in peripheral bronchoscopy. Proactive pre and intra-procedural planning, implementation of structured ventilation protocols, and close collaboration with anesthesia are essential. Future research should focus on protocol standardization, novel imaging synchronization techniques, and validation of atelectasis grading tools.

### Preoperative atelectasis in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery: a cross-sectional study [^112zwNff]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Showing that atelectasis in the supine position can explain Sp 2 in the seated position challenges the notion that atelectasis in lung-dependent regions are merely postural with often little clinical relevance, or artifacts expected to solve by performing chest CT in the prone position. Furthermore, the presence of atelectasis with consequences in Sp 2 of obese patients before elective surgery strengthens our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity, possibly implying that chronic hypoxemia in patients with obesity could be largely explained by mechanisms leading to atelectasisand potentially related to development of chronic dyspnea, intolerance to exercise, or pulmonary hypertension through hypoxic vasoconstriction.

The prediction plots showed that only the curves for Sp 2 values between 89% and 96% are well represented. While it would not be possible to extend the y -axis to values < 0% to predict Sp 2 > 96%, it would be possible to extend the y -axis to higher atelectasis percentage values, meaning that Sp 2 values < 88% could likely be predicted. We found these results encouraging since they show that predicting preoperative atelectasis without the need of performing a chest CT is possible and could be attempted in future studies. As this is a proof-of-concept, we advise against immediate implementation and we instead encourage researchers to develop and validate a prediction model of atelectasis percentage coverage on large-scale, sufficiently powered, and representative studies. Prediction models of preoperative atelectasis could be used to plan and guide optimal intraoperative ventilation parameters since individualized ventilation strategies have shown to be promising for preventing postoperative atelectasis, while also allowing to estimate the extent to which postoperative atelectasis are clinically relevant with respect to atelectasis that were already present before surgery.

### Lung ultrasound vs chest radiography for pneumonia diagnosis in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and Bayesian network diagnostic meta-analysis [^115hzLdP]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the ICU, diagnostic imaging is constrained by patient instability and limited access to advanced scanners. Bedside CXR is usually restricted to a single supine projection, resulting in sub-optimal sensitivity, whereas transporting patients receiving mechanical ventilation to CT carries logistic cost, radiation exposure, and a well-documented risk of cardiorespiratory deterioration. LUS can be performed at the bedside in minutes, requires no ionising radiation, and provides dynamic, repeatable information that is immediately actionable. Our findings therefore suggest that LUS may be considered the preferred first-line imaging test when pneumonia is suspected in critically ill adults, reserving CT for equivocal or complex cases.

Hansell and colleagues performed a meta-analysis in ICU patients that compared LUS and CXR for the generic finding of lung consolidation, irrespective of aetiology. Their pooled estimates (sensitivity 0.91 and specificity 0.77) are numerically close to the values we report, but the two reviews draw on mutually exclusive primary studies because of different eligibility criteria. We included only studies in which pneumonia was clinically adjudicated and CT-confirmed, whereas Hansell et al. accepted any parenchymal consolidation. Owing to this definitional gap, their dataset is not shown in Figure S13, which is limited to pneumonia-specific evidence. Nonetheless, both reviews converge on the same message: bedside LUS is substantially more sensitive than portable CXR in the intensive-care setting, emphasising the need to interpret imaging findings within the clinical context.

Despite the well-defined sonographic features of pneumonia, real-time recognition can be challenging for less experienced operators. Mechanically ventilated patients have a high incidence of atelectasis, which is both frequent and multifactorial. Extrinsic compression caused by prolonged supine positioning or obstructive causes like mucus plugging or impaired bronchial clearance can cause atelectasis. The distinction between pneumonia and atelectasis is based on the presence of dynamic air bronchograms (associated with alveolar filling) vs static or fluid bronchograms (more indicative of passive collapse or obstruction). This distinction, though diagnostically critical, may be subtle and technically demanding, and it requires sufficient skill in acquiring and interpreting LUS images. The importance of thorough scanning, including dorsal lung zones, and interpretative expertise cannot be underestimated when LUS findings can resemble pneumonia. This is necessary to avoid false positives, which could result in unnecessary antibiotic treatment or delayed recognition of other causes of respiratory failure.

### Effects of 30% vs. 60% inspired oxygen fraction during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis: a randomised controlled trial [^112KnimW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is the ongoing debate over the effect of inspired oxygen fraction (FiO 2) during mechanical ventilation on postoperative atelectasis. We aimed to compare the effects of low (30%) and moderate (60%) FiO 2 on postoperative atelectasis. The hypothesis of the study was that 30% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation could reduce postoperative atelectasis volume compared with 60% FiO 2.

Methods

We performed a randomized controlled trial with 120 patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 30% or 60% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the percentage of postoperative atelectasis volume in the total lung measured using chest CT within 30 min after extubation. The secondary outcomes included different aeration region volumes, incidence of clinically significant atelectasis, and oxygenation index.

Results

In total, 113 subjects completed the trial, including 55 and 58 subjects in the 30% and 60% FiO 2 groups, respectively. The percentage of the postoperative atelectasis volume in the 30% FiO 2 group did not differ from that in the 60% FiO 2 group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the atelectasis volume between the two groups after the missing data were imputed by multiple imputation. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the volumes of the over-aeration, normal-aeration, and poor-aeration regions between the groups. No significant differences in the incidence of clinically significant atelectasis or oxygenation index at the end of surgery were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Compared with 60% FiO 2, the use of 30% FiO 2 during mechanical ventilation does not reduce the postoperative atelectasis volume.

### Asbestos-related lung disease: a pictorial review [^113PysLw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Asbestos exposure can lead to a variety of adverse effects in the thorax. Although currently in the western world, levels of exposure are kept in check by strict regulations, history of previous asbestos exposure continues to have an effect on many, owing to the latent nature of the pathophysiological response of the body to the inhaled fibers. The adverse effects of asbestos generally fall under 3 categories: pleural disease, lung parenchymal disease, and neoplastic disease. Effects on the pleura include pleural effusions, plaques, and diffuse pleural thickening. In the parenchyma, rounded atelectasis, fibrotic bands, and asbestosis are observed. Differentiating asbestosis from other forms of interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usual interstitial pneumonia, smoking-related lung disease, and mixed interstitial lung diseases, is important because the prognosis, course of disease, and management of the patient should be tailored based on the specific etiology of the disease. In this review, imaging findings specific to asbestosis are discussed. Finally, exposure to asbestos can lead to neoplastic disease such as pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal mesothelioma, and bronchogenic carcinoma. The purpose of this article is to review the effects of asbestos exposure in the thorax, pathophysiology of these responses, and disease course. Particular emphasis is placed on the radiographic appearance of the disease, discussion of various imaging modalities and their utility, and the role of imaging in the management of patients with previous asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pulmonary disease.

### Reexpansion of atelectasis caused by use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before radiation therapy (RT) [^1162pFik]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atelectasis from endobronchial obstruction or external bronchial compression may cause respiratory distress and obstructive pneumonia. Rapid initiation of treatment is important to open the obstruction and relieve symptoms. Endobronchial lesions respond well to treatment with invasive bronchoscopic techniques such as laser ablation, cryotherapy, and stent placement and, if treated early, patients will often experience rapid lung reexpansion.

When atelectasis is from external bronchial compression or if invasive bronchoscopic techniques are unavailable, obstructing tumors are often treated with radiation therapy (RT). Accurate placement of radiation fields is challenging because of difficulty in differentiating between tumor and atelectatic lung on computed tomography (CT) images alone. In addition, lung reexpansion during the course of treatment may shift the location of the tumor and normal structures away from their original positions. Replanning of the radiation fields to account for changing organ position resulting from lung reexpansion is essential to ensure treatment accuracy. We hypothesized that facilitating lung reexpansion before initiation of RT would improve treatment accuracy and reduce the need for replanning radiation treatments.

We report the occurrence of reexpansion of right upper lobe (RUL) atelectasis in a patient with small cell lung cancer caused by use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during RT treatment planning.

### Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure / recruitment manoeuvres compared with zero end-expiratory pressure on atelectasis in children: a randomised clinical trial [^115X7Vwz]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Atelectasis is a common postoperative complication. Peri-operative lung protection can reduce atelectasis; however, it is not clear whether this persists into the postoperative period.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate to what extent lung-protective ventilation reduces peri-operative atelectasis in children undergoing nonabdominal surgery.

DESIGN

Randomised, controlled, double-blind study.

SETTING

Single tertiary hospital, 25 July 2019 to 18 January 2020.

PATIENTS

A total of 60 patients aged 1 to 6 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2, planned for nonabdominal surgery under general anaesthesia (≤ 2 h) with mechanical ventilation.

INTERVENTIONS

The patients were assigned randomly into either the lung-protective or zero end-expiratory pressure with no recruitment manoeuvres (control) group. Lung protection entailed 5 cmH₂O positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment manoeuvres every 30 min. Both groups received volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL kg⁻¹ body weight. Lung ultrasound was conducted before anaesthesia induction, immediately after induction, surgery and tracheal extubation, and 15 min, 3 h, 12 h and 24 h after extubation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

The difference in lung ultrasound score between groups at each interval. A higher score indicates worse lung aeration.

RESULTS

Patients in the lung-protective group exhibited lower median [IQR] ultrasound scores compared with the control group immediately after surgery, 4 [4 to 5] vs. 8 [4 to 6], (95% confidence interval for the difference between group values −4 to −4, Z = -6.324) and after extubation 3 [3 to 4] vs. 4 [4 to 4], 95% CI −1 to 0, Z = −3.161. This did not persist from 15 min after extubation onwards. Lung aeration returned to normal in both groups 3 h after extubation.

CONCLUSIONS

The reduced atelectasis provided by lung-protective ventilation does not persist from 15 min after extubation onwards. Further studies are needed to determine if it yields better results in other types of surgery.

In addition, in the no atelectasis group and in the small atelectasis group, the need for Intensive Care Unit admission rate was lower compared to large atelectasis group (p < 0.01). In this sense, in the group of patients without atelectasis 18 patients (15%) needed to be admitted in the ICU, compared to 2 patients (7%) in the group of small atelectasis (p = 0.37) and to 6 patients (75%) in the group of larger atelectasis (p < 0.01). Indeed, ICU admission rate was lower in patients with small atelectasis compared to large atelectasis (p < 0.01).

The length of in-hospital stay was different among groups (p = 0.01). Patients with no atelectasis required 15 (7 to 23) days of in-hospital admission, compared to 14 (6 to 23) days in patients with small atelectasis (p = 0.99) and to 40 (17 to 54) days in patients with large atelectasis (p = 0.02) (Fig. 4). The length of in-hospital stay was longer in patients with large compared to small atelectasis (p = 0.01).

Postoperative adult and pediatric patients — postoperative pulmonary complications occur in approximately 7% of patients with normal preoperative lung function, and more than 70% of those with increased risk factors, with upper abdominal and thoracic surgeries associated with the highest complication rates. Although atelectasis is the most common complication, pneumonia is considered to be the main cause of increased mortality, and these can co-exist, and shallow breathing and weak cough lead to retained secretions and are thought to be a primary contributor.

### Reexpansion of atelectasis caused by use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before radiation therapy (RT) [^1134y2tg]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case describing use of CPAP for reexpansion of obstructive atelectasis from malignancy before RT. CPAP has been long used as a treatment for sleep apnea and more recently as a prophylactic therapy and treatment for postoperative atelectasis. In this case, the intent of CPAP was to reduce respiratory motion and preserve normal lung function. Reexpansion of the RUL atelectasis was an unexpected benefit that persisted throughout the course of RT.

When atelectasis is present, functional imaging studies such as PET-CT provide improved discrimination between collapsed lung and tumor and are useful for planning RT. However, use of PET-CT in treatment planning is often limited because studies obtained before developing atelectasis may not provide an accurate representation of the tumor location once atelectasis occurs. Scans obtained when atelectasis is present may lose usefulness as the atelectatic lung reexpands. Furthermore, there may be insufficient time to obtain PET-CT imaging before initiating RT in patients who present with rapid onset of symptoms.

### Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure / recruitment manoeuvres compared with zero end-expiratory pressure on atelectasis in children: a randomised clinical trial [^114nuub1]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common in adult patients undergoing surgery, with an incidence of 11 to 59%, and it leads to prolonged hospitalisation, lower long-term survival and even death. – In recent years, in order to accelerate the rehabilitation of surgical patients, the concept of intra-operative lung-protective ventilation has attracted increasing attention. However, it has yielded inconsistent results. It is not clear whether the temporary gains in either lung mechanics or oxygenation using lung-protective ventilation persist into the postoperative period, even when performed shortly before extubation.

In adults, lung recruitment ventilation has been demonstrated as effective in reducing pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery, surgery in obese patients, and endoscopic surgery, as well as in increasing oxygenation, However, adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was demonstrated as sufficient to minimise atelectasis in patients undergoing nonabdominal surgery without the need for lung recruitment. Additionally, compared with low PEEP (≤ 2 cm H₂O), high PEEP (12 cm H₂O) combined with lung recruitment during open abdominal surgery does not protect against PPCs. In one study, an increase in driving pressure resulting from increased PEEP was related to a greater degree of PPCs.

It remains controversial whether lung-protective ventilation is protective against PPCs in healthy American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 or 2 paediatric patients; this constitutes the core of the debate on the utility of intra-operative protective ventilation.

In paediatrics, lung-protective ventilation has been proved useful in improving oxygenationas well as reducing the incidence of anaesthesia-induced atelectasis. – However, its beneficial effects on postoperative atelectasis remain unclear.

Although computed tomography (CT) of the chest has become the gold standard for lung examination, it is not optimal for routine examination of critically ill patients due to risks posed by the radiation and the required transportation of patients. Compared with chest radiography and CT, lung ultrasound is simple, noninvasive and time- and cost-effective, making it suitable for monitoring changes in lung ventilation. In this trial, the efficacy of lung-protective ventilation in children at low risk of atelectasis was evaluated by monitoring the changes in lung aeration during both the intra-operative and postoperative periods. The primary outcome of our study was lung ultrasound score (LUS) after extubation. The secondary outcomes were other respiratory complications, systemic complications and a failure to recover sufficiently to be discharged from hospital after 2 days.

### Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure / recruitment manoeuvres compared with zero end-expiratory pressure on atelectasis in children: a randomised clinical trial [^116KbyWw]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Atelectasis is a common postoperative complication. Peri-operative lung protection can reduce atelectasis; however, it is not clear whether this persists into the postoperative period.

Objective

To evaluate to what extent lung-protective ventilation reduces peri-operative atelectasis in children undergoing nonabdominal surgery.

Design

Randomised, controlled, double-blind study.

Setting

Single tertiary hospital, 25 July 2019 to 18 January 2020.

Patients

A total of 60 patients aged 1 to 6years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2, planned for nonabdominal surgery under general anaesthesia (≤ 2h) with mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

The patients were assigned randomly into either the lung-protective or zero end-expiratory pressure with no recruitment manoeuvres (control) group. Lung protection entailed 5cmH₂O positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment manoeuvres every 30min. Both groups received volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 6mlkg⁻¹ body weight. Lung ultrasound was conducted before anaesthesia induction, immediately after induction, surgery and tracheal extubation, and 15min, 3h, 12h and 24h after extubation.

Main Outcome Measures

The difference in lung ultrasound score between groups at each interval. A higher score indicates worse lung aeration.

Results

Patients in the lung-protective group exhibited lower median [IQR] ultrasound scores compared with the control group immediately after surgery, 4 [4 to 5] vs. 8 [4 to 6], (95% confidence interval for the difference between group values -4 to -4, Z = -6.324) and after extubation 3 [3 to 4] vs. 4 [4 to 4], 95% CI -1 to 0, Z = -3.161. This did not persist from 15min after extubation onwards. Lung aeration returned to normal in both groups 3h after extubation.

Conclusions

The reduced atelectasis provided by lung-protective ventilation does not persist from 15min after extubation onwards. Further studies are needed to determine if it yields better results in other types of surgery.

### Prevalence and clinical consequences of atelectasis in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a computed tomography retrospective cohort study [^112DHRAm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Flowchart of the patients included in the study

After the analysis of the CT study, the patients were classified into three groups (Figs. 1, 2): (a) those who did not present atelectasis, (b) those who presented small atelectasi s (laminar, subsegmentary or segmentary atelectasis with estimated size of less than 5% of the forecasted lung volume) (small atelectasis hereinafter) and (c) those with significant atelectasis (atelectasis with estimated size of more than 5% of the forecasted lung volume) or a complete lobe collapse (large atelectasis hereinafter). In this sense, one radiologist specialized in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia performed a visual assessment based on the single slice in the CT with the largest atelectasis size and compared it to the estimated lung volume, classifying the patients into these three groups. We choose the 5% of lung surface as a cut-off point according to our capacity to detect and quantitate the % of lung with atelectasis. Table 1 shows basal characteristics of the patients that accomplished the inclusion criteria (including time from the beginning of symptoms).

### Incidence and location of atelectasis developed during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia: the I-LOCATE trial [^111EPTng]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the many advances in peripheral bronchoscopy, its diagnostic yield remains suboptimal. With the use of cone-beam CT imaging we have found atelectasis mimicking lung tumors or obscuring them when using radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS), but its incidence remains unknown.

Research Question

What are the incidence, anatomic location, and risk factors for developing atelectasis during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia?

Study Design and Methods

We performed a prospective observational study in which patients undergoing peripheral bronchoscopy under general anesthesia were subject to an atelectasis survey carried out by RP-EBUS under fluoroscopic guidance. The following dependent segments were evaluated: right bronchus 2 (RB2), RB6, RB9, and RB10; and left bronchus 2 (LB2), LB6, LB9, and LB10. Images were categorized either as aerated lung ("snowstorm" pattern) or as having a nonaerated/atelectatic pattern. Categorization was performed by three independent readers.

Results

Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. The overall intraclass correlation agreement among readers was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.71–0.89). Median time from anesthesia induction to atelectasis survey was 33 min (range, 3–94 min). Fifty-one patients (89%; 95% CI, 78%-96%) had atelectasis in at least one of the eight evaluated segments, 45 patients (79%) had atelectasis in at least three, 41 patients (72%) had atelectasis in at least four, 33 patients (58%) had atelectasis in at least five, and 18 patients (32%) had atelectasis in at least six segments. Right and left B6, B9, and B10 segments showed atelectasis in > 50% of patients. BMI and time to atelectasis survey were associated with increased odds of having more atelectatic segments (BMI: OR, 1.13 per unit change; 95% CI, 1.034–1.235; p = 0.007; time to survey: OR, 1.064 per minute; 95% CI, 1.025–1.105; p = 0.001).

Interpretation

The incidence of atelectasis developing during bronchoscopy under general anesthesia in dependent lung zones is high, and the number of atelectatic segments is greater with higher BMI and with longer time under anesthesia.

### Effects of laryngeal mask ventilation on postoperative atelectasis in children undergoing day surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^112d7xdC]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Atelectasis is a common postoperative pulmonary complication, which can increase intrapulmonary shunt, lead to hypoxemia, increase the risk of postoperative pneumonia in children, and affect the safety of children during the perioperative period. At present, there are no large-sample, multi-center clinical studies explaining whether it's necessary to treatment postoperative atelectasis in individuals who have healthy preoperative lungs. Zeng C reported that the presence of atelectasis can increase respiratory resistance and reduce lung compliance, and this effect persists even after the patient's atelectasis recovers. According to Nakos G. et al. the phospholipid content of surfactant in the region of atelectasis was decreased and remained low even after lung reopening. This decrease in phospholipid content harmed the lung's capacity to fight infection and raised the likelihood of lung infection following surgery. Regarding the retention time of postoperative atelectasis in the body, Strandberg A et al. used CT scans for patients undergoing hernia surgery and found that 90% of the patients had atelectasis within 1 h after surgery, and atelectasis is still present in 50% of patients after 24 h after surgery. A retrospective analysis reviewed the postoperative CT imaging features of 944 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and found that 539 (57%) patients developed pulmonary atelectasis, of which 57 of these patients showing little sign of improvement by day 3 postoperative, which indicating that postoperative pulmonary atelectasis persists for a long time in the body. In addition, the formation of atelectasis leads to an increase in inflammatory factors such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor in the body, raising the risk of lung injury, and the amount of inflammatory factors were correlated with the duration of atelectasis in the body. These all suggest that atelectasis has an immediate and severe impact on patients undergoing general anesthesia, and that it lasts a long time in the body. As a result, it is especially crucial to reduce the incidence of atelectasis in the perioperative period.

### Simultaneous atelectasis in human bocavirus infected monozygotic twins: was it plastic bronchitis? [^117Uz3YE]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The presented cases are the first to describe two simultaneously affected monozygotic twins and substantiate the hypothesis of a contributing genetic factor in the pathophysiology of this disease. In this second report related to HBoV1, we show additional evidence that this condition can be triggered by a simple respiratory tract infection in previously healthy infants. Different initial therapeutic strategies when facing a child with atelectasis and suspected plastic bronchitis include immediate bronchoscopy as well as mucolytic, anti-inflammatory, and fibrinolytic treatments depending on the underlying condition, the clinical and radiographic extent of the disease and the histopathologic type of airway cast.

Consent

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

### Prevalence and clinical consequences of atelectasis in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a computed tomography retrospective cohort study [^111Yqrr2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of atelectasis assessed with computer tomography (CT) in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the relationship between the amount of atelectasis with oxygenation impairment, Intensive Care Unit admission rate and the length of in-hospital stay.

Patients and methods

Two-hundred thirty-seven patients admitted to the hospital with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed by clinical, radiology and molecular tests in the nasopharyngeal swab who underwent a chest computed tomography because of a respiratory worsening from Apr 1 to Apr 30, 2020 were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the presence and amount of atelectasis at the computed tomography: no atelectasis, small atelectasis (< 5% of the estimated lung volume) or large atelectasis (> 5% of the estimated lung volume). In all patients, clinical severity, oxygen-therapy need, Intensive Care Unit admission rate, the length of in-hospital stay and in-hospital mortality data were collected.

Results

Thirty patients (19%) showed small atelectasis while eight patients (5%) showed large atelectasis. One hundred and seventeen patients (76%) did not show atelectasis. Patients with large atelectasis compared to patients with small atelectasis had lower SatO₂/FiO₂ (182 vs 411 respectively, p = 0.01), needed more days of oxygen therapy (20 vs 5 days respectively, p = 0,02), more frequently Intensive Care Unit admission (75% vs 7% respectively, p < 0.01) and a longer period of hospitalization (40 vs 14 days respectively p < 0.01).

Conclusion

In patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, atelectasis might appear in up to 24% of patients and the presence of larger amount of atelectasis is associated with worse oxygenation and clinical outcome.

### Pulmonary atelectasis: a frequent alternative diagnosis in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected pulmonary embolism [^111vYgB9]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of atelectasis as an alternative diagnosis in patients who underwent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), and to contrast the pathophysiology of pulmonary atelectasis and PE, both of which are associated with dyspnea and hypoxemia. We retrospectively identified 144 consecutive emergency department patients (n = 49) and inpatients (n = 95) admitted between July 2001 and June 2002 who were evaluated with CT-PA for suspected PE. There were 98 women and 46 men with a mean age of 58 years (range 27–95 years). Each CT report was reviewed for PE, the words "atelectasis", "collapse", and/or "volume loss", findings known to predispose to atelectasis, and alternative diagnoses. CT scans of those with PE and those with atelectasis were reviewed. Each case was categorized into one of three groups, as follows: group 1, PE; group 2, atelectasis of three or more segments and no PE; group 3, neither PE nor atelectasis. PaO₂ was documented, when available (n = 115), with PaO₂ > 100 mmHg recorded as 100 mmHg. Reports for group 3 were reviewed for alternative diagnoses. Thirteen percent of the study population (19/144, group 1) had PE, and two of them had concomitant atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 69 mmHg (range 38–100 mmHg). Nineteen percent of the study population (27/144, group 2) had atelectasis of three or more segments without PE; mean PaO2 was 73 mmHg (range 45–100 mmHg). Sixty-eight percent of the study population (98/144, group 3) had neither PE nor atelectasis; mean PaO2 was 79 mmHg (range 36–100 mmHg). There was a significant difference in the PaO2 between groups 1 and 3 (Student's t-test), with group 2 intermediate. Seventy percent of group 2 (19/27) had at least one finding predisposing to atelectasis: central bronchial abnormality (n = 6), moderate or larger pleural effusion (n = 11), pleural mass, pneumothorax, elevated hemidiaphragm, and severe kyphosis (the last four all n = 1 each), versus 16% (3/19) of group 1 (P < 0.05). Sixty-three percent of group 3 (62/98) had one or more alternative diagnoses on CT that explained the patient's symptoms as follows: pneumonia (28%, 27/98), other lung disease (18%, 18/98), congestive heart failure (13%, 13/98), and malignancy (13%, 13/98). Pulmonary atelectasis was common in patients undergoing CT-PA for suspected PE, equaling pneumonia as the most common alternative diagnosis. Most patients with atelectasis had predisposing findings on CT. Pulmonary atelectasis and PE cause similar symptoms by different mechanisms of ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

### Atelectasis in pulmonary tuberculosis… [^117YFBtm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The relation of bronchial obstruction to atelectasis has been known since 1844, when Legendre and Bailly1 found that in infants long enfeebled the lungs after death usually contain many consolidated airless lobules. This, they maintained, may occur in the absence of any inflammatory pulmonary process, and develops as a result of bronchial catarrh. Experimental proof of these views was not long in coming, for Mendelsohn2 in 1845 and Traube3 one year later produced atelectasis by plugging the bronchi with shot, paper and acacia. Lichtheim4 gave the most conclusive proof of the dominant rôle played by bronchial obstruction in this condition when in 1879 he produced atelectasis by plugging the bronchi with laminaria sticks. However, it was Coryllos and Birnbaum5 who in a series of epoch-making publications brought forth incontrovertible proof that the determining cause of atelectasis in any pulmonary area is the complete obstruction of STIVELMAN BP.

### Reflex pulmonary atelectasis… [^1137er9E]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary atelectasis has important surgical, medical and roentgenologic implications. While there are many theories regarding the production of atelectasis, it is generally agreed that its essential cause is the obstruction of a bronchus with massive secretion. 1 The weakened respiratory force and the accumulation of bronchial mucus, owing to insufficient movement of cilia together with a suppressed cough reflex, are sufficient causes to explain postoperative atelectasis in the opinion of most observers.
2. But ever since the first descriptions of this interesting postoperative or post-traumatic complication, the suggestion has been made that reflex nervous stimuli play a part in the initiation of bronchial obstruction. In fact, three different reflex mechanisms were proposed: that of the diaphragmatic splint, 3 vasodilation with bronchial edema4 and bronchoconstriction. 5 All three theories were discussed and discounted by Coryllos and Birnbaum.

### Role of allergy in atelectasis in children… [^116hhrUA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Atelectasis has been defined by Van Allen and Lindskog1 as "an airless state of the lungs with collapse of the alveoli. No reference is implied to consolidation by replacement of air with exudate, transudate or other substance. " Atelectasis, other than that which is congenital, is due to obstruction to the passage of air, with subsequent absorption of the retained air and collapse of the alveoli. The extent of the collapse of the lung depends first on the location of the obstruction in the bronchial tree and secondly on the duration of the occlusion.
2. Massive atelectasis due to the occlusion of a main bronchus has been described as having occurred during an asthmatic attack by various observers. The first recorded case of this type was that reported by Sante, 3 in 1928. He described a case of massive collapse of the right lung which occurred during an asthmatic attack.
