## Question

Frostbite imaging for face

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about imaging for facial frostbite, including which modalities to choose, when to obtain them, how to interpret results, and how imaging integrates with treatment decisions and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why facial frostbite differs from extremity frostbite. Then, I should verify which imaging modalities are supported by guidelines and what their strengths and limitations are. Next, I will examine timing and indications for imaging, including early versus delayed presentations. After that, I need to check how imaging informs thrombolytic decisions and surgical planning. Finally, I will consider special considerations for the face, practical implementation, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why imaging matters here. Facial frostbite commonly involves the nose, ears, and cheeks, where thin soft tissues and prominent cartilaginous structures complicate clinical assessment of depth and viability, and where cosmetic and functional outcomes hinge on precise delineation of necrosis and perfusion deficits, so objective imaging can reduce unnecessary tissue loss and guide timely intervention [^notfound].

> I need to check which imaging modalities are actually recommended and how strong the evidence is. The Wilderness Medical Society and American Burn Association endorse angiography, technetium-99m bone scintigraphy, MRI/MRA, and SPECT/CT to assess tissue viability and guide surgical margins, acknowledging that evidence quality is low but consensus supports selective use when available [^ba26ab58] [^526f90fa] [^8246a848]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify comparative strengths: angiography shows macrovascular patency and is useful for thrombolytic guidance, bone scintigraphy detects microvascular perfusion and correlates with amputation level, MRI/MRA offers soft-tissue detail without radiation, and SPECT/CT fuses functional and anatomic data to localize necrosis before it is clinically obvious [^150510b6] [^14f891ec] [^8246a848].

> Next, I should review timing and indications. For delayed presentation, roughly 4–24 hours after thawing, noninvasive imaging with technetium pyrophosphate or MRA can predict tissue viability and amputation level, and SPECT/CT has improved surgical planning in small series, so early imaging is reasonable when it will change management [^92e6478b] [^8246a848]. Wait, let me verify the role of repeat imaging; some guidance suggests serial angiography every 12–24 hours to track response, but that pertains to deep extremity injuries and may not translate directly to the face, so I should be cautious about extrapolating that cadence to facial frostbite without local expertise input [^ca0dbcc9].

> I will now examine how imaging integrates with thrombolytic decisions. The ABA issues no recommendation to require vascular imaging before tPA because delays can worsen warm ischemia, and a meaningful fraction of clinically severe cases show no perfusion deficit on formal imaging, so imaging should not delay indicated thrombolysis if the clinical picture supports it [^90db456b] [^856a8520]. But wait, what if imaging could refine selection? Observational data suggest pre-treatment Tc-99m perfusion scoring correlates with response and that earlier tPA associates with better outcomes, so I should frame imaging as adjunctive rather than gatekeeping in time-sensitive scenarios [^0973b430] [^4991b1f0].

> Let me consider surgical planning, since that is where imaging often adds the most value. Bone scintigraphy correlates with eventual amputation level, and SPECT/CT has matched surgical levels without revision in small cohorts, supporting its use to plan definitive procedures once demarcation is evolving; importantly, amputation should still be delayed until clear demarcation unless sepsis intervenes, with imaging informing level selection rather than timing alone [^14f891ec] [^bc8faf8e] [^1edbb5da]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to the face; while most data are extremity-based, the pathophysiology and need to preserve length and function justify applying the same principles to nasal, auricular, and cheek injuries with experienced surgical input [^notfound].

> Now, I need to ensure I address facial-specific considerations. The face has thin soft tissues, cartilage, and cosmetic zones where millimeters matter, so high-resolution anatomic localization is crucial; SPECT/CT and MRI can map necrosis and perfusion deficits with greater spatial precision than planar bone scans, which is particularly relevant for nasal ala, helical rim, and eyelid margins where salvage of viable tissue changes form and function [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether ultrasound helps; high-frequency ultrasound can measure skin and subcutaneous thickness and may assist in mapping edema or demarcation, but there is no robust frostbite-specific validation for prognostication, so I should not overstate its role here [^0de5aff6].

> Next, I should review practical implementation and logistics. Many centers use a multimodality approach: obtain a baseline modality such as bone scintigraphy or MRA within 24–48 hours when imaging will change management, escalate to SPECT/CT if precise anatomic mapping is needed, and reserve angiography for cases where endovascular therapy is contemplated or diagnostic uncertainty persists; telemedicine consultation with frostbite-experienced surgeons can guide modality selection and interpretation when local expertise is limited [^8246a848] [^84d3d88c]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline language; yes, WMS advises using appropriate imaging if available to assess viability and guide timing and extent of surgery, which fits this tiered approach [^526f90fa].

> I will now synthesize a decision framework, but let me verify each branch against the evidence. If the injury is superficial with expected minimal tissue loss, imaging is generally unnecessary and clinical observation suffices; if deep injury is suspected or confirmed, obtain imaging early to establish baseline perfusion and guide expectations, repeating or upgrading modality if surgical planning is imminent or if initial studies are inconclusive; if considering thrombolytics, do not delay tPA for imaging in clinically severe cases, but use pre- and post-treatment perfusion imaging to document response when feasible; if planning surgery, prioritize SPECT/CT or MRI for anatomic precision and coordinate with an experienced frostbite surgeon to set timing and level [^8ad7776c] [^90db456b] [^8246a848] [^1edbb5da]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that imaging alone dictates amputation level; I should correct that — imaging informs but does not replace surgical judgment, and demarcation must be integrated with clinical evolution and patient factors before definitive procedures [^1edbb5da].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and actionable. For facial frostbite, use imaging selectively to answer specific questions: Is there a perfusion deficit amenable to thrombolysis? What is the likely level of tissue loss for counseling and planning? Where exactly should surgical margins be placed to maximize salvage? Bone scintigraphy, MRA, and SPECT/CT are reasonable first-line options depending on availability and question, with angiography reserved for intervention or diagnostic uncertainty, and imaging should be obtained early when it will change management while avoiding delays to time-sensitive therapies like tPA [^ba26ab58] [^8246a848] [^90db456b]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both WMS and ABA positions; yes, both endorse appropriate imaging to assess viability and guide surgery, and both caution against letting imaging delay indicated interventions, which supports this balanced, question-driven approach for the face [^526f90fa] [^90db456b].

---

For facial frostbite, **imaging is indicated when tissue viability is uncertain** or to guide surgical planning [^526f90fa]. The most useful modalities are **technetium-99m bone scintigraphy** (triple-phase or SPECT/CT) [^150510b6] and **MRI/MRA**, which can detect perfusion deficits and demarcate necrosis earlier than clinical exam [^92e6478b] [^8246a848]. Angiography is reserved for cases where endovascular therapy is considered [^150510b6]. Early imaging (within 24–48 hours) is preferred for deep injuries, but **clinical judgment remains paramount** [^92e6478b] [^8246a848].

---

## Indications for imaging in facial frostbite

Imaging is **not routine for all cases**; it is indicated when:

- **Tissue viability is uncertain**: Clinical exam cannot reliably distinguish superficial from deep injury [^b72058c7].
- **Surgical planning is needed**: To determine amputation level or extent of debridement [^1edbb5da].
- **Deep injury is suspected**: Involving bone, cartilage, or muscle [^e337db4d].

---

## Recommended imaging modalities

| **Modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy (triple-phase or SPECT/CT) | - Deep injury <br/> - Surgical planning | - Detects perfusion deficits <br/> - Predicts amputation level [^14f891ec] <br/> - SPECT/CT provides precise anatomic localization [^bc8faf8e] | - Limited availability <br/> - False positives/negatives [^90db456b] |
| MRI/MRA | - Soft tissue assessment <br/> - Vascular evaluation | - No radiation <br/> - Detailed soft tissue and vascular mapping [^notfound] | - Limited availability <br/> - Motion artifacts |
| Angiography | - Endovascular therapy considered | - Direct visualization of vessels <br/> - Therapeutic potential [^150510b6] | - Invasive <br/> - Radiation exposure |

---

## Timing of imaging

Early imaging within **24–48 hours** after thawing is preferred for deep injuries to guide timely intervention [^92e6478b] [^8246a848]. Delayed imaging may be used if early imaging is unavailable or if clinical evolution warrants reassessment [^8246a848].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **WMS 2024**: Recommends appropriate imaging to assess tissue viability and guide surgical planning [^526f90fa] [^8246a848].
- **ABA 2024**: Notes imaging correlates with amputation level but insufficient evidence that imaging reduces amputations; use with clinical judgment [^3a0a9b76] [^14f891ec].
- **ACCP 2014**: Recommends angiography and/or technetium-99m bone scan for deep injuries to guide therapy and prognosis [^c0b7ee79].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Limited evidence**: Most data are from extremity injuries; facial-specific evidence is sparse [^notfound].
- **Resource availability**: Advanced imaging may not be available in all settings [^notfound].
- **Interpretation variability**: Results depend on operator expertise and timing [^notfound].

---

## Integration with clinical management

Imaging complements, but does not replace, **clinical assessment**. Decisions should integrate imaging with exam, patient factors, and local expertise [^1edbb5da]. Early imaging can expedite surgical planning and potentially reduce unnecessary tissue loss [^bc8faf8e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Use imaging** when tissue viability is uncertain or surgical planning is needed [^526f90fa].
- **Prefer technetium-99m bone scintigraphy** (triple-phase or SPECT/CT) or MRI/MRA for deep injuries [^150510b6] [^92e6478b].
- **Obtain imaging early** (within 24–48 hours) when possible [^92e6478b] [^8246a848].
- **Reserve angiography** for cases where endovascular therapy is considered [^150510b6].
- **Integrate imaging** with clinical judgment and local expertise [^1edbb5da].

---

Imaging is a **valuable adjunct** in facial frostbite, particularly for deep injuries or when surgical planning is required. Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy and MRI/MRA are the preferred modalities, with angiography reserved for select cases. Early imaging, when feasible, can improve outcomes, but clinical judgment remains essential.

Key Points for Practice
- To prevent worsening tissue damage, a frostbitten extremity should be rewarmed only if there is no risk of refreezing.
- Rapid rewarming via water bath immersion and intravenous low-molecular-weight dextran leads to improved outcomes in frostbite.
- To limit tissue loss, oral ibuprofen should be started as soon as available and continued until surgery or complete healing.
- Tissue plasminogen activator improves outcomes for deep frostbite extending to proximal interphalangeal joints if given within 24 hours. From the AFP Editors. Frostbite is divided into four overlapping phases: prefreeze, freeze-thaw, vascular stasis, and late ischemic. The prefreeze phase consists of tissue cooling, which leads to vasoconstriction and ischemia without ice crystal formation. In the freeze-thaw phase, ice crystals form intracellularly during rapid-onset freezing or extracellularly during a slower freeze. First-degree frostbite causes numbness, erythema, and often edema.

White or yellow, slightly raised plaque develops over injured areas. Second-degree frostbite causes erythema, edema, and superficial skin blisters. Third-degree frostbite causes deeper hemorrhagic blisters, indicating that the injury has extended into the reticular dermis and beneath the dermal vascular plexus. Fourth-degree frostbite extends completely through the dermis and involves comparatively avascular subcutaneous tissues, with necrosis extending into muscle and bone. Frostnip is a superficial nonfreezing cold injury associated with intense vasoconstriction in exposed skin, usually the cheeks, ears, or nose. Ice crystals can form on skin surfaces, but not within the tissue. Numbness and pallor resolve quickly after warming, and no long-term damage occurs. Oxygen supplementation via face mask or nasal cannula should be considered for patients who are hypoxic or at high altitude. Hyperoxemia will lead to peripheral vasoconstriction that can slow healing.

Noninvasive imaging with technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy or magnetic resonance angiography can predict the level of tissue viability in patients presenting to a hospital four to 24 hours after tissue thawing. For patients who have frostbite injury extending at least to the proximal interphalangeal joints, intravenous or intra-arterial administration of tissue plasminogen activator may help salvage tissue if given within 24 hours of thawing.

Frostbite imaging — delayed presentation and modality selection: In patients with delayed presentation (4–24 h from the time of the frostbite thawing), noninvasive imaging with technetium pyrophosphate or magnetic resonance angiography can be used at an early stage to predict likely levels of tissue viability for amputation, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) combines anatomic precision with functional vascular information; use in 7 patients improved surgical planning and multiphase [Tc99m]-MDP bone scintigraphy with SPECT/CT after severe frostbite has been described. If available, appropriate imaging should be used to assess tissue viability and guide timing and extent of amputation. Recommendation: Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Other potentially useful techniques include Doppler ultrasound, triple phase technetium, indocyanine green microangiography, and thermal imaging, although further studies are required to determine their exact role.

Purpose

This article reviews the pathological mechanisms and progress of imaging of severe frostbite to assist in the search for targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment of severe frostbite. This review also aims to provide strong evidence for clinical diagnosis and treatment of deep frostbite.

Methods

The review was based on the summary and analysis of the existing literature, and explored the pathological mechanism of deep frostbite and the advantages and disadvantages of imaging diagnostic methods.

Results

According to the depth of tissue involvement, frostbite is divided into 4 levels. Severe frostbite includes Grade 3 and Grade 4 frostbite. Clinical performance evaluation and imaging diagnostic research have always been the mainstream of severe frostbite diagnosis. Imaging methods focus on vascular patency and tissue vitality. This article introduces angiography, SETCT/CT and MRA, and we summarize the advantages and disadvantages of these imaging methods. We recommend corresponding imaging modalities according to the state of frostbite patients.

Conclusions

Imaging examination, especially angiography and bone scans, provide useful information for determining the diagnosis and prognosis of severe frostbite. In order to obtain a good clinical prognosis, clinicians should first perform SPECT/CT. MRA does not burden the patient's body, but the balance between cost and benefit must be considered. Angiography provides a good feedback on the changes in blood vessel status before and after treatment, which is helpful for discovering the response of limbs to treatment.

Frostbite surgical treatment or amputation — complete demarcation of tissue necrosis may take 1 to 3 mo; angiography, technetium-99 bone scan, or magnetic resonance imaging may be used with clinical findings to assist determination of surgical margins; if the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of sepsis attributed to infected frostbite tissue, amputation should be performed expeditiously, otherwise amputation should be delayed until definitive demarcation occurs; because morbidity may result from unnecessary or premature intervention, an experienced frostbite surgeon should assess the need and timing of any amputation (Recommendation Grade: 1C).

### Frostbite of the hand [^b72058c7]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Frostbite is damage caused by the freezing of tissue owing to exposure to extreme cold. Clinically, it is often difficult to identify the severity of frostbite injury. There may be a wide discrepancy between the extent of damage to the skin versus that to the deeper structures. The initial clinical impression is usually worse than actual tissue damage. In addition to physical examination, diagnostic imaging, especially triple-phase bone scan, has been proposed to help differentiate between superficial and deep damage. Principles of treatment involve rapid rewarming to thaw the tissues and halt direct cellular damage, methods to minimize progressive dermal ischemia, and active wound care to promote timely healing. Pharmacological adjuncts, such as fibrinolytics, have been proposed to minimize tissue damage. Surgical therapy is postponed until there is clear demarcation between healthy and necrotic tissue.

Severe frostbite — pathophysiology and treatment principles: Frostbite injury involves ischemia, inflammation, and coagulation, and frostbite‑related tissue damage occurs in two phases with a reperfusion injury upon rewarming characterized by inflammatory and prothrombotic mediator release. Diminishing the toxic triad of ischemia, inflammation, and coagulation and restoring blood flow to prevent irreversible ischemia is the goal of treatment. Most treatment algorithms focus on rapid rewarming, and surgical treatment is guided by diagnostic imaging after the traditional teaching of watchful waiting for clinical demarcation prior to definitive surgery; ideally, successful treatment preserves limb length and soft tissue to decrease sequela and reduce disability.

Limitations and future directions

This study has several limitations. As a single-center retrospective cohort study, the findings may not be generalizable to all frostbite populations. Future studies could include multicenter collaborations with standardized protocols to validate these findings across diverse patient populations. Additionally, the absence of a control group limits our ability to directly attribute observed outcomes to thrombolytic treatment. Moreover, prospective research incorporating advanced imaging modalities could provide deeper insights into tissue perfusion and healing dynamics.

Severe frostbite imaging for surgical planning reports that bone scintigraphy performed at 2 and 8 days after injury in a larger cohort of 88 patients showed sensitivity (0.65), specificity (0.99), and positive predictive value (0.92) for absence of bone-phase uptake correlating with eventual amputation level, with predictive value increased when a second scan was performed at day 8; in a study comparing imaging cohorts (N = 130: 82 scintigraphy, 26 scintigraphy plus MA, 22 MA alone), bone scintigraphy more strongly correlated with final amputation while MA had a slightly stronger predictive correlation with amputation level, and the study did not address the impact of imaging on the number, level, or timing of amputations; SPECT/CT in 7 patients and 19 extremities matched amputation level predictions in all seven with no revision surgery, with time to imaging 12 days (4–27 days) and time to surgery 17.7 days (5–30 days).

American Burn Association severe frostbite — vascular imaging to guide thrombolytic therapy (tPA): The guideline evaluates whether vascular imaging studies (e.g., digital subtraction angiography [DSA], bone scintigraphy, SPECT/CT, microangiography, magnetic resonance angiography [MRA]) affect the use or timing of thrombolytic therapy, but issues a "No recommendation", citing insufficient scientific evidence to determine whether imaging should guide thrombolytic use. Rationale notes that formal imaging may show no perfusion deficit in a subset of clinically severe cases (4.3% to 33%), and weighs risks of false-positive and false-negative imaging outcomes; given the low reported complication risk with thrombolytics and limb salvage reported in single-center studies, "imaging prior to thrombolytics may not be beneficial especially if it extends the warm ischemia time".

Severe frostbite — guideline methods and key PICO questions: For the creation of this guideline, the committee met virtually and communicated electronically, identified clinically important questions on the "treatment of severe frostbite injury", and designed questions using a PICO approach. Key questions include whether rapid rewarming in a 38 to 42°C water bath compared with not using rapid rewarming reduces amputations or allows a more distal level of amputation, and whether use of vascular imaging studies compared with not using them affects the use or timing of thrombolytic therapy.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of severe frostbite [^4128798a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). High credibility.

American Burn Association clinical practice guideline — reporting standards and registry dataset for severe frostbite emphasize outcome reporting and standardized variables. We would recommend a minimum report including per person amputation and an overall salvage rate, and severity of injury should be obtained by imaging or bedside perfusion test after rewarming, with reporting of the timing of rewarming, time to post-rewarming testing, and post-rewarming treatment; additionally, delayed imaging may be used as an alternative outcome measure. To address research priorities, implementation of a standard frostbite dataset for registries could significantly improve research and outcomes and could be best achieved through the ABA, and these variables should include: measure of severity of frostbite injury after rewarming and documentation of method of measurement; documentation of use or non-use of rapid rewarming in a water bath; description of any use of thrombolytics and method of delivery; recorded time from admission to thrombolysis; documentation of use of any continued anticoagulation and the length of time it was used; and time to surgical management on primary admission or subsequent admissions.

Frostbite is a localized cold thermal injury that results from tissue freezing. Frostbite injuries can have a substantial effect on long-term limb function and mobility if not promptly evaluated and treated. Imaging plays a critical role in initial evaluation of frostbite injuries and in monitoring response to treatment. A multimodality approach involving radiography, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and/or multiphase bone scintigraphy with hybrid single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) is often necessary for optimal guidance of frostbite care. Radiographs serve as an initial survey of the affected limb and may demonstrate characteristic findings, depending on the time course and severity of injury. DSA is used to evaluate perfusion of affected soft tissues and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Angiography-directed thrombolysis plays an essential role in tissue preservation and salvage in deep frostbite injuries. Multiphase bone scintigraphy with technetium 99m-labeled diphosphonate provides valuable information regarding the status of tissue viability after initial treatment. The addition of SPECT/CT to multiphase bone scintigraphy enables precise anatomic localization of the level and depth of tissue necrosis before its appearance at physical examination and can help uncover subtle findings that may remain occult at scintigraphy alone. Multiphase bone scintigraphy with SPECT/CT is the modality of choice for prognostication and planning of definitive surgical care of affected limbs. Appropriate use of imaging to direct frostbite care can help limit the effects that these injuries have on limb function and mobility. © RSNA, 2016.

### American Burn Association clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of severe frostbite [^bd09e962]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Medium credibility.

This Clinical Practice Guideline addresses severe frostbite treatment. We defined severe frostbite as atmospheric cooling that results in a perfusion deficit to the extremities. We limited our review to adults and excluded cold contact or rapid freeze injuries that resulted in isolated devitalized tissue. After developing population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions, a comprehensive literature search was conducted with the help of a professional medical librarian. Available literature was reviewed and systematically evaluated. Recommendations based on the available scientific evidence were formulated through consensus of a multidisciplinary committee. We conditionally recommend the use of rapid rewarming in a 38 to 42°C water bath and the use of thrombolytics for fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. We conditionally recommend the use of "early" administration of thrombolytics (≤ 12 hours from rewarming) compared to "later" administration of thrombolytics for fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of vascular imaging studies to determine the use of and/or the time to initiate thrombolytic therapy. No recommendation could be formed on the use of intravenous thrombolytics compared to the use of intra-arterial thrombolytics on fewer amputations and/or a more distal level of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of iloprost resulting in fewer amputations and/or more distal levels of amputation. No recommendation could be formed on the use of diagnostic imaging modalities for surgical planning on fewer amputations, a more distal level of amputation, or earlier timing of amputation.

### Time to thrombolytics and tissue salvage: assessing response following severe frostbite injury [^6d99c533]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This study underscores the importance of early thrombolytic administration in severe frostbite injuries while highlighting the value of pre- and post-treatment imaging for response assessment. Stratifying patients into full, partial, and nonresponder categories allowed for a more nuanced evaluation of thrombolytic efficacy and revealed critical predictors of treatment outcomes, such as time to thrombolytics, initial tissue perfusion deficits, and infection. Nearly 95% of severe frostbite patients treated with thrombolytics saw improvement. By providing a novel framework for assessing treatment response, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting thrombolytic therapy as a cornerstone of frostbite management. These results advocate for ongoing refinement of clinical protocols to optimize outcomes for frostbite patients, even in challenging and resource-limited settings. The increasing occurrence of extreme cold weather in previously temperate regions underscores the necessity for a deeper understanding of the outcomes associated with frostbite treatment in the United States.

Bone scintigraphy is an excellent tool to assess bone viability. The functional information provided is crucial in several clinical settings, like the detection of avascular necrosis, septic embolism, frostbite lesions and osteonecrosis, and to evaluate the results of surgical treatment in cases of avascular necrosis. Mechanisms to obtain molecular images, as well as different kind of techniques, are detailed. Comparative and multimodality imaging to focus on any clinical problem and a review of the clinical indications reflect the multidisciplinary approach with close collaboration between orthopaedists, radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians. Finally, an effort has been made to list the most important points of imaging of bone viability in children.

### Time to thrombolytics and tissue salvage: assessing response following severe frostbite injury [^a9824980]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies assessing the severity of frostbite injury are highly variable and use different scales (ie grade, severe vs superficial, and degree). Most international frostbite publications do not utilize early perfusion imaging of the injury and rely on visual assessment using a grading system developed by Cauchy et al. based on his experience treating mountaineering-related frostbite injuries in France. This visual grade stratifies the risk of amputation-based cyanosis in the digits, with the grade increasing as the injury becomes more proximal in the digits. Most centers in the United States use perfusion testing to evaluate the presence or absence of a post-rewarming perfusion deficit and categorize injuries into severe (presence of a post-rewarming perfusion deficit) or superficial (absence of post-rewarming perfusion deficit). This system was largely developed to balance the risks of using thrombolytics in patients with severe injury. However, this results in variability when comparing outcomes based on the definition of "severe" injury across manuscripts.

In addition to varying scales to evaluate frostbite, hospitals vary in their standard practices related to initial and follow-up pharmacological interventions. Initial interventions frequently include intravenous or intraarterial thrombolytics and/or intravenous iloprost. The benefit of iloprost has yet to be demonstrated in a US frostbite population but has shown benefits in Europe and Canada. Follow-up interventions typically include some combination of anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications, however, the literature on this is very limited and will require future multicenter studies.

Our findings have several implications for clinical practice. First, timely administration of thrombolytics remains paramount. Protocols should prioritize early rewarming, rapid imaging, and streamlined thrombolytic administration to optimize outcomes. Second, pre-treatment Tc99 scans provide critical information regarding the extent of tissue compromise and can guide patient counseling and management decisions. Third, the stratification of response categories offers a more refined framework for evaluating thrombolytic efficacy, which could inform future clinical guidelines and research. Finally, the observation that isolated hand frostbite was associated with better imaging, but not surgical outcomes introduce an intriguing area for further investigation. Differences in frostbite response, possibly due to the vascular architecture or more aggressive treatment, could inform targeted interventions for specific injury patterns.

### Microangiography: an alternative tool for assessing severe frostbite injury [^d477ecaf]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Assessment of frostbite injury typically relies on computed tomography, angiography, or nuclear medicine studies to detect perfusion deficits prior to thrombolytic therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a novel imaging method, microangiography, in the assessment of severe frostbite injury. Patients with severe frostbite were included if they received a post-thrombolytic Technetium 99 (Tc99) bone scan, a Tc99 bone scan without thrombolytic therapy, and/or post-thrombolytic microangiography (MA) study. We included all patients from the years 2006 to 2018 with severe frostbite injury who had received appropriate imaging for diagnosis: Tc99 scan alone (N = 82), microangiography alone (N = 22), and both Tc99 and microangiography (N = 26). The majority of patients received thrombolytic therapy (76.2%), and the average time to thrombolytics was 6.9 hours. Tc99 scans showed strong correlation with amputation level (r = .836, P < .001), and microangiography showed a slightly stronger positive correlation with amputation level (r = .870, P < .001). In the subset who received both Tc99 scan and microangiography (N = 26), we observed significant differences in the mean scores of perfusion deficit (z = 3.20, P < .001). In this subset, a moderate correlation was found between level of perfusion deficit on Tc99 bone scan and amputation level (r = .525, P = 0.006). A very strong positive correlation was found between the microangiography studies and the amputation level (r = .890, P < .001). These results demonstrate that microangiography is a reliable alternative method of assessing severe frostbite injury and predicting amputation level.

Objectives

Frostbite refers to the freezing of body tissue which is caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures and results in tissue destruction. Tissue damage is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. A detailed treatment plan based on the current UpToDate literature is needed to decrease morbidity and mortality rates.

Methods

The United States National Library of Medicine (PubMed/Medline), EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify publications relevant to this review.

Conclusion

In this review, we present the current knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of frostbite injuries. We then provide an extended and detailed treatment plan, from first aid in the field to treatment of short and long-term complications.

Frostbite surgical treatment or amputation — timing and indications: After frostbite occurs, complete demarcation of tissue necrosis may take 1 to 3 mo, and angiography, technetium-99 bone scan, or magnetic resonance imaging may be used to assist determination of surgical margins in conjunction with clinical findings. If the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of sepsis attributed to infected frostbite tissue, amputation should be performed expeditiously; otherwise, amputation should be delayed until definitive demarcation occurs. The affected limb is often insensate, footwear and orthotics are essential to provide optimal function, early involvement of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team produces better long-term functional results, and telemedicine or electronic consultation with a surgical frostbite expert or guide local surgeons should be considered when no local expert is available.

### Frostbite in the pediatric population: a comprehensive review and a prospective Canadian survey [^8a183b45]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frostbite in the pediatric population, where skeletal maturity has not been achieved, can have important repercussions on subsequent growth. Yet, the optimal management of frostbite injuries in children remains vague. This review aims to summarize the current evidence for frostbite management in children and understand Canadian practice trends on this topic.

Methods

A review using Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature was performed to identify relevant literature on the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, and treatment options in pediatric frostbite. An online survey was sent to plastic surgeons through the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons (CSPS) mailing list to further identify national practices and trends for pediatric frostbite management.

Results

A total of 109 articles were reviewed. No article provided a specific algorithm for pediatric frostbite, with existing recommendations suggesting the use of adult guidelines for treating children. Our survey yielded 9 responses and highlighted the rarity of pediatric frostbite cases, with no responder treating more than 10 cases per year. Most (55.6%) do not use a pediatric-specific treatment algorithm, whereas 30% apply adult guidelines. A conservative approach focusing on rewarming (55.6%), limb elevation (50%), and tetanus status verification (66.7%) was predominant. Imaging and surgical interventions seem to be reserved for severe cases.

Conclusions

The current literature for pediatric frostbite management lacks specificity. Canadian practices vary, with a trend toward a conservative approach. The limited evidence and rarity of experience highlight the need for further research, ideally in a collaborative multicentric manner, to create a consensus for pediatric frostbite care.

### Time to thrombolytics and tissue salvage: assessing response following severe frostbite injury [^8b17dd89]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Infection and cellulitis were strongly associated with poor outcomes, consistent with previous studies highlighting the detrimental impact of infection on frostbite healing and salvage rates. Interestingly, while psychosocial factors such as housing insecurity and substance use are known to complicate frostbite recovery, these were not significantly associated with treatment response in our study. This could reflect limitations in sample size or differences in practice, as our burn clinic operates 7 days a week for dressing changes.

The discrepancies observed between surgical and imaging outcome measures highlight the potential advantages of using imaging or an immediate post-discharge assessment as a primary outcome in frostbite treatment. Imaging outcomes were less influenced by confounding factors such as infection, which played a significant role in the surgical outcome analysis. This distinction emphasizes the value of post-thrombolytics Tc99 imaging as an objective and reproducible measure of treatment response, a method previously utilized by Cauchy et al. Other methodologies to evaluate perfusion in severe frostbite injury include angiography, microangiography (indocyanine green (ICG) angiography), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). While the literature is lagging, many high-volume frostbite centers in the US have implemented ICG angiography for perfusion assessments to evaluate eligibility for thrombolytics. The benefits of ICG angiography are the ease of use in the emergency setting without the need for specialized medical personnel to conduct the test and interpret the results and no radiation exposure. Use of SPECT to guide treatment decisions is limited to case reports, however, this technology may be highly useful for surgical planning. Ultimately, the correspondence between imaging and eventual amputation needs more formal evaluation.

INTRODUCTION

Frostbite injuries present a unique challenge in both diagnosis and treatment. The severity of tissue damage varies significantly based on factors such as exposure duration, environmental conditions, and underlying health conditions of the patient. Despite advancements in medical interventions, frostbite often leads to permanent tissue damage and limb amputation. Early and accurate assessment of tissue perfusion is essential for guiding treatment decisions, particularly when considering thrombolytic therapy, and predicting patient outcomes. However, a number of urban-specific confounding factors, such as post-discharge housing insecurity and lack of wound care, may complicate the recovery process and ultimately influence healing and amputation outcomes.,

Administration of thrombolytic therapy to restore blood flow to the affected tissues is standard practice at many centers. Thrombolytics aid in the breakdown of microvascular clots caused by frostbite, facilitating tissue reperfusion and preventing ischemia. To minimize the risks of bleeding complications, standard protocols for the management of severe frostbite injury include screening for absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolytic therapy; however, this must be done swiftly due to the risk of limb loss in patients with these injuries. The impact of post-rewarming delays in treatment (warm ischemia time) on frostbite outcomes has been well-established by numerous research groups. Previous research has demonstrated the utility of various imaging and clinical assessments in determining the extent of frostbite injury. Nevertheless, there remains a gap in standardized reporting of treatment response to thrombolytic therapy, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in real-world settings.

The aim of this study was to evaluate thrombolytic treatment response in a cohort of severe frostbite-injured patients. To achieve this, we evaluated data from a prospectively maintained, single-institution frostbite database over 7 winters. We categorized responses to thrombolytic treatment into 3 groups: full responder, partial responder, and nonresponder. These groups were generated based on 2 outcome measures: post-thrombolytic perfusion assessment by Tc99 scan (imaging outcome measure) and final amputation level (surgical outcome measure). Outcome measures were created by comparing the specified outcome to the pre-thrombolytic perfusion assessment (Tc99 scan) to generate the 3 responder categories. This classification allows for a more nuanced evaluation of treatment efficacy.

DISCUSSION

This study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of severe frostbite injury. To our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study to date evaluating thrombolytic outcomes following severe frostbite injuries using both surgical and imaging outcomes to define response categories. The classification of patients into full, partial, and nonresponder groups based on these outcome measures allowed for a more nuanced evaluation of thrombolytics efficacy, emphasizing the role of timely intervention and the burden of initial perfusion deficits in shaping outcomes.

Administration of thrombolytic therapy to restore blood flow to the affected tissues is standard practice at many centers. Our findings confirm that earlier administration of thrombolytics is associated with better outcomes, consistent with prior literature emphasizing the critical role of minimizing warm ischemia time in frostbite management. Specifically, full responders exhibited shorter median times to thrombolytic administration compared to partial and nonresponders across both surgical and imaging outcome measures. This underscores the importance of rapid clinical decision-making and having an established protocol to expedite frostbite care. While the standard treatment window for thrombolytic is typically narrow (most IV thrombolytic protocols range from 8 to 12 h post-rewarming), our data demonstrate that meaningful responses can still be achieved even in patients treated outside the standard timeframe. These findings suggest that strict adherence to traditional treatment windows may warrant reevaluation, particularly in the context of frostbite, where treatment delays are often unavoidable due to logistical challenges.

The amount of tissue impacted by frostbite, as quantified by the Hennepin Frostbite Score on pre-thrombolytic Tc99 scans, was another critical predictor of response. Patients with larger perfusion deficits were more likely to be partial or nonresponders, reflecting the challenge of restoring perfusion to severely compromised tissues. This highlights the potential utility of pre-treatment imaging, not only as a diagnostic tool but also as a prognostic indicator of patient outcomes, warranting further study. Cauchy et al. using clinical evaluation and Tc99 scans showed higher proportions of amputation with more proximal injury. While the reported sensitivity was high, the specificity was very low. Additionally, the prognostic sensitivity and specificity of visual assessment compared to formal imaging or amputation level have yet to be elucidated. In our study, full responders had both timely administration of thrombolytics and manageable initial perfusion deficits.

### What interventional radiologists need to know about managing severe frostbite: a meta-analysis of thrombolytic therapy [^121e1e68]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to review the various techniques and clinical management paradigms using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat severe frostbite injuries, which are relevant to the interventional radiologist. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A literature search yielded 157 citations, which were manually screened for inclusion criteria of case reports, case series, cohort studies, and randomized prospective studies that reported the use of tPA to treat severe frostbite injuries, of which 16 qualified for review. Data extracted from the studies included authors, journal, year of publication, initial assessment and management of severe frostbite injuries, inclusion and exclusion criteria for tPA therapy, treatment and control group size, different imaging modalities used in evaluation of severe frostbite injuries, tPA treatment protocols, outcomes, and side effects or complications. RESULTS. The analyzed series included 209 patients with 1109 digits at risk of amputation who were treated with intraarterial (IA) or IV tPA (116 and 77 patients, respectively). A total of 926 digits at risk were treated with IA tPA and resulted in amputation of 222 digits, for a salvage rate of 76%. Twenty-four of 63 patients underwent amputation after IV tPA, resulting in a salvage rate of 62%. Both digital subtraction angiography and triple-phase bone scan were used for initial imaging evaluation. Additional concurrent treatment included therapeutic heparin, warfarin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, pain management, and light dressings with topical antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION. Severe frostbite injuries can lead to devastating outcomes with loss of limbs and digits, yet clinical management continues to consist primarily of tissue rewarming, prolonged watchful waiting, and often delayed amputation. Recent studies have shown promising results using both IA and IV tPA to reduce amputation after severe frostbite injuries. Through a meta-analysis of thrombolytic therapy in the management of severe frostbite, this article provides a useful guideline for interventional radiologists including a suggested protocol, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and potential complications.

### SPECT / CT in the evaluation of frostbite [^bc8faf8e]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Frostbite remains a challenging clinical scenario with multiple treatment algorithms and variable results. Currently, frostbite management often follows a conservative approach with rewarming followed by wound care and delayed amputation. We review seven patients where single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) fused with conventional computed tomography was used to evaluate tissue viability for earlier directed debridement and limb salvage. The goal of this report is to evaluate SPECT/CT as an appropriate modality for the screening of necrotic bone for earlier amputation in patients with frostbite. We retrospectively analyzed the records of seven patients (19 extremities) with frostbite who received SPECT/CT scans to evaluate deep tissue necrosis before digit amputation. All patients who presented within the first 24hr following their injury without contraindications were initially treated with tissue plasminogen activator. Three patients met criteria and were treated with tissue plasminogen activator. Of the seven patients analyzed, none required revision amputation beyond the level predicted on SPECT/CT scan. No patients had viable tissue distal to the most distal extent of bone perfusion. In six of the patients, the SPECT/CT scan led to more distal amputation with proximal debridement of soft tissues thus maintaining extremity length. Frostbite remains a challenging clinical scenario for which there are a wide number of clinical algorithms. SPECT/CT appears to be valuable in the evaluation of frostbite to determine the need for amputation. Fusion of the nuclear images with the CT allows for more exact delineation of the level of amputation than a bone scan alone.

### Time to thrombolytics and tissue salvage: assessing response following severe frostbite injury [^0973b430]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Approximately 30% of severe frostbite injuries result in amputation. Thrombolytic therapy is used to reduce tissue loss following severe frostbite injury. This study evaluates factors impacting effectiveness of thrombolytics using post-treatment perfusion imaging and amputation level as outcome measures. We hypothesize that categorizing thrombolytic-treated patients into full, partial, and non-responders enables a nuanced evaluation of treatment effectiveness. A prospectively maintained frostbite database was reviewed for patients with post-rewarming perfusion deficits measured by Tc99 scans who received IV thrombolytics. Of 131 patients, 71% were full responders, 23.7% partial responders, and 5.3% non-responders for surgical outcome. The median time to thrombolytics was 5.5 hours (range 1–14.5) for full responder; 7 hours (range 3.5–14) for partial responder; and 10 hours (range 1.5–11.5) for non-responders. Full responders exhibited smaller initial perfusion deficits. Psychosocial or comorbid factors were not significantly different across groups. Non-response was associated with longer time to thrombolytics, larger perfusion deficits, and cellulitis/infection. Using imaging outcomes to reduce confounding by infection, 93 patients were evaluated: 28% were full responders, 57% partial responders, and 15% non-responders. Full responders for imaging outcome corresponded with surgical outcomes and had no amputations, while 37.7% of partial responders and 42.9% of non-responders on imaging outcome had amputations. This study is the largest to evaluate thrombolytic outcomes in severe frostbite injured patients, proving new insight into thrombolytics responses and a novel assessment of thrombolytic treatment efficacy. These findings underscore the importance of timely thrombolytic administration and demonstrate benefits for patients treated outside the standard thrombolytics treatment windows.

Systemic antibiotics — Frostbite is not an inherently infection-prone injury and antibiotic administration specifically for preventing infection during or after frostbite injury is not supported by evidence; systemic antibiotics, either oral or parenteral, should be administered to patients with significant trauma, other potential infectious sources, or signs and symptoms of cellulitis or sepsis. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published June 8, 2022 Given a paucity of high-quality data, including data about thrombolytic agents, the practitioner and patient are left with difficult, time-sensitive decisions to make regarding the management of frostbite on the basis of the physical examination, estimated ischemia time, and risk assessment after thorough rewarming. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Q: Describe the pathophysiology of cold injury. A: The pathophysiology of cold injury is a combination of direct cellular damage from freezing and cellular ischemia from vasospasm and small-vessel thrombosis. Direct cellular damage results from ice-crystal formation and resulting injury to the cell membrane, combined with intracellular metabolic derangements. Ischemic cellular damage follows endothelial disruption of the microcirculation, with vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and poorly characterized inflammatory effects on reperfusion.

A: An important component of the initial evaluation is identifying patients who have potentially reversible, ongoing, clinically important soft-tissue necrosis that may be ameliorated with thrombolytic intervention. After full rewarming, perfusion can be checked by a physical examination for capillary refill, by detection of Doppler signals in the distal pulp, and by transmission pulse oximetry of the distal digits. Patients with intact distal perfusion should be treated conservatively. Such treatment consists of elevation of the injured extremity, pain control, topical wound care, selective removal or decompression of blisters, avoidance of smoking and repeat cold exposure, excision of clearly necrotic tissue, wound closure by a variety of means, and rehabilitation. If small-vessel flow is absent despite full rewarming, a thoughtful risk–benefit analysis should be promptly undertaken to determine whether angiography and thrombolysis are appropriate.

Thrombolytic therapy may ameliorate the terrible long-term burden of frostbite to some extent, although its use must be tempered by the possibility of serious hemorrhagic complications. An intravenous form delivered by pump infusion is available outside the United States. Since vasospasm may play a role in frostbite injury by reducing flow and facilitating the thrombotic process, early trials have evaluated iloprost for the initial treatment of frostbite in otherwise healthy patients. Intravenous iloprost is not available in the United States at present.

### Patient and treatment characteristics that predict symptom resolution and limb amputation in patients with frostbite [^98b92126]. Burns (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe imaging and treatment received by frostbite patients and determine characteristics that predict symptom resolution and limb amputation.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study included 174 adult patients with acute frostbite at a single institution from May 1, 2004, to August 31, 2019. Demographics, frostbite classification, symptoms present and imaging received at presentation, treatment received, and dates of symptom resolution, were collected.

Results

Patients most commonly received no imaging (60.3%), followed by x-ray (28.7%). The most common treatments were debridement (53.4%), none (24.1%), other (15.5%), antibiotics (12.6%), and tPA (8.0%). Of 17 who had a limb amputated, the number of affected extremities (p = 0.003), frostbite degree (p = 0.004), and baseline symptoms of abnormal skin color change (p = 0.028), absence of pulse (p = 0.021), swelling (p = 0.010), and necrosis/gangrene (p = 0.002) significantly increased the risk of limb amputation. tPA lowered the risk of limb amputation with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.193 (p = 0.003).

Discussion

Patients received a variety of treatments and imaging for frostbite. tPA was not often used in this study but could play a larger role in the treatment of frostbite since it was shown to lower the risk of limb amputation.

Deep frostbite is a thermal injury associated with significant morbidity. Historically, this has been associated with military personnel; however, increasingly it is becoming an injury that afflicts the civilian population. The use of intravenous iloprost or intra-arterial thrombolytics has led to promising tissue salvage. This article provides an up-to-date understanding of frostbite pathophysiology, classification, prevention, and management. It also highlights the role of telemedicine in optimizing patient outcomes. To further the understanding of optimal frostbite management, larger, likely multicenter, high-quality trials are required. An international frostbite register would facilitate data gathering.

Frostbite post-rewarming management — after rewarming, edema and clear or hemorrhagic blisters may form, and hemorrhagic bullae or cyanosis without blister formation imply deep tissue infarction, so appearance helps guide evacuation and advanced imaging and treatment decisions. Clean, dress, and pad injuries to protect against mechanical trauma, placing dressings loosely in anticipation of further tissue swelling. Treatment with anti-inflammatory doses of ibuprofen (400 mg, twice daily) and aloe vera ointment or gel may be useful; in most cases, antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging guide treatment and predict need for surgery and extent of tissue loss for patients with 3rd or 4th degree injuries. Some advanced care settings employ protocols for the administration of thrombolytic agents or iloprost (approved by the FDA in February 2024 for use in frostbite), but their use requires treatment within 48–72 hours of tissue thawing. Consultation with a clinician with experience treating frostbite optimizes outcomes in management of deep frostbite injury.

The model evaluating the surgical outcome in the multinomial logistic regression analysis with full responder as the base outcome revealed several associations between predictors and responder status (Table 2). The amount of tissue impacted by frostbite injury (at risk), time to thrombolytics, and presence of infection or cellulitis were associated with partial and nonresponse. Other variables, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, social factors, and the presence of comorbidities were not statistically significant predictors of treatment response.

Imaging outcome

The imaging response cohort to evaluate pre and post-Tc99 scans for thrombolytics response was also categorized into full responders (N = 26, 28%), partial responders (N = 53, 57%), and nonresponders (N = 14, 15%). The mean age, sex, or race and ethnicity did not significantly differ across the groups. The median LOS was longer for nonresponders (10 days) compared to partial responders (7 days) and full responders (5 days), though this was not statistically significant (Table 1). Time to thrombolytics administration did not differ significantly across responder categories, with full responders having the shortest median time of 5.3 h, partial responders median of 6 h, and nonresponders exhibiting the largest median of 6.7 h (Figure 3 and Table 1). The presence of at risk tissue as assessed by Tc99 scans varied significantly between the groups (Figure 3 and Table 1). Full responders (Figure 3B) had the least amount of tissue impacted by frostbite (median 3.5), while partial responders (Figure 3A) had a significantly higher median first at risk Tc99 scan score (median 12) and nonresponders (Figure 3C) (median 10) (Figure 3 and Table 1).

RESULTS

Over the 7 winters, 131 patients were included in the surgical outcome analysis and 93 had both pre- and post-thrombolytics imaging for inclusion in the imaging outcome analysis (Figure 1). The majority of patients in the surgical outcomes cohort were full responders (N = 93, 71%), 31 were partial responders (23.7%), and 7 were nonresponders (Figure 1). Patients lacking post-thrombolytics imaging (N = 38) were excluded from the imaging outcome cohort resulting in a total of 93 patients: full responder (N = 26), partial responder (N = 53), and nonresponder (N = 14) (Figure 1). The median age was 37 years and the majority (87%) were male (Table 1). A majority of the race and ethnicity identification was non-Hispanic White (59.5%), followed by non-Hispanic Black (25.2%).

### Imaging assessment of penetrating injury of the neck and face [^66fe6f7a]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Penetrating trauma of the neck and face is a frequent presentation to acute emergency, trauma and critical care units. There remains a steady incidence of both gunshot penetrating injury to the neck and face as well as non-missile penetrating injury — largely, but not solely, knife-related. Optimal imaging assessment of such injuries therefore remains an on-going requirement of the general and specialised radiologist.

Methods

The anatomy of the neck and face — in particular, vascular, pharyngo-oesophageal, laryngo-tracheal and neural anatomy — demands a more specialised and selective management plan which incorporates specific imaging techniques.

Results

The current treatment protocol of injuries of the neck and face has seen a radical shift away from expectant surgical exploration in the management of such injuries, largely as a result of advances in the diagnostic capabilities of multi-detector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA), which is now the first-line imaging modality of choice in such cases.

Conclusion

This review aims to highlight ballistic considerations, differing imaging modalities, including MDCTA, that might be utilised to assist in the accurate assessment of these injuries as well as the specific radiological features and patterns of specific organ-system injuries that should be considered and communicated to surgical and critical care teams.

Teaching points

- MDCTA is the first-line imaging modality in penetrating trauma of the neck and, often, of the face

- The inherent deformability of a bullet is a significant factor in its tissue-damaging capabilities

- MDCTA can provide accurate assessment of visceral injury of the neck as well as vascular injury

- Penetrating facial trauma warrants radiological assessment of key adjacent anatomical structures

- In-driven fragments of native bone potentiate tissue damage in projectile penetrating facial trauma

### Thermovision: a new diagnostic method for orofacial pain? [^f10f42f5]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Infrared quantitative thermography in medical applications

Thermography is used in various medical applications, eg, diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, internal injuries, and tumor diseases.–It can also be used to monitor implant healing, demarcation of burns and frostbite, vascular dysfunctions, and skin diseases. In ophthalmology, thermography is used to detect changes in the thermal field of the eyes and for monitoring corneal temperature during an operation. Thermography can similarly be used to monitor physiotherapy. When monitoring acute and chronic pain syndromes in the orofacial region, thermography can be used eg, to help diagnose odontalgia, sinusitis, temporomandibular joint disorders, and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Using an analysis of thermal fields, information regarding the course of pathologies associated with an increase or decrease of skin temperature can be obtained. Inflammatory processes (hyper-perfusion) manifest on thermograms as areas with elevated temperature, while hypo-perfusion shows up as areas with lower temperatures. Therefore, we can, with high specificity and sensitivity, detect eg, changes in the vasospastic reaction to cold (using cold water) in patients with Raynaud phenomenon or disorders of vascular adaptation resulting from abnormal autonomous nervous system function, or delayed reactions to thermal changes in patients with complex regional pain syndrome. The duration and reduction of inflammation have been objectively monitored, by studies focused on the effects of corticosteroids on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, by observing thermal changes on the skin surface over inflamed joints. A correlation between thermographic examinations and the severity of knee osteoarthritis, diagnosed using skiagraphy, has also been established. It is always necessary to assess which thermal deviations are pathological. In muscle spasms, elbow bursitis, tendovaginitis, fibromyalgia, and in acute muscle injuries, elevated temperature are detected, while in chronic tissue damage, scars, and paretic muscles, lower temperatures are measured. Thermography is also a sensitive method for detection and localization of skin thermal changes of nervous origin. When assessing the effect of therapy, it is important to remember the potential of a placebo effect in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Skin temperature is influenced by blood circulation, which is controlled by the autonomous nervous system. Central control mechanisms of skin temperature, under physiological conditions, affect both sides of the body evenly. This presents as a symmetry of thermal gradients around the body's central axis. An analysis of thermal pictures can reveal changes in thermal distribution patterns and differences between similar areas on the right and left side of the body.

### Diagnosis, characterisation and evaluation of treatment response of frostbite using pertechnetate scintigraphy: a prospective study [^7f59cd3b]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

No large prospective study is available on use of a radionuclide method to assess frostbite and its response to conservative treatment. Recently, a large retrospective study using two-phase bone scintigraphy suggested that non-uptake (or low uptake) in frostbite lesions in the blood pool or bone phase had a strong correlation with the subsequent need for amputation. In the present study, we performed early blood pool scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate in 20 patients (10–180 days after frostbite injury; 71 clinical lesions) referred for a topical treatment protocol for mild to moderately severe frostbite, and in 22 asymptomatic controls. The aims of the study were to define the "normal" microcirculation of the hands and feet, to characterise the appearances of frostbite lesions on scintigraphy and correlate these with the clinical presentation, and to evaluate the usefulness of scintigraphy for assessing the treatment response. Six patients were "fresh", 12 had been undergoing conservative treatment (topical homeopathic) for several weeks and two had permanent fibrotic hand phalanges. Nine patients on treatment underwent serial scintigraphy a total of 22 times. Eleven patients were imaged only once, including the two with permanent fixed defects. Three distinct physiological microcirculation patterns were evident in control hands or feet: right- or left-handedness (seven subjects), subclinical inflammatory foci correlating with callosity or pressure points (36 lesions) and distinctly increased pooling of radiotracer at the thenar or hypothenar region (eight subjects). In frostbite patients, 128 lesions (48 inflammatory, 80 ischaemic) were seen on the scan. This number included all 71 lesions identified clinically, the rest being subclinical. Subclinical frostbite lesion as an entity has not been described previously. Microvasculature of normal muscle groups (in the hands, elbow or feet) was shown on scintigraphy to improve after topical treatment. The treatment resulted in improved or normalised perfusion scan in 25 of 45 ischaemic segments with matching clinical improvement, and reduction or normalisation of uptake in inflammatory lesions (n = 30). The data confirm the vasodilator and anti-inflammatory action of the topical preparation, and the sensitivity of the radionuclide method in monitoring treatment response. In contrast to the previous findings that non-uptake on a scan performed 2 or more weeks after exposure correlates with the need for amputation, none of the 80 ischaemic lesions in our series required amputation while 60% showed improvement or normalisation in microvascular blood flow even though they were 10–180 days old. Our findings suggest that moderate to severe frostbite lesion can be classified as having infarcted, ischaemic or hibernating (viable) tissue, similar to the classification employed when using myocardial scintigraphy. Absence of uptake even after the initial 10 days does not necessarily indicate infarction and the need for amputation as many such lesions retain potential for vasodilation and recovery.

### Utility of a high-resolution superficial diagnostic ultrasound system for assessing skin thickness: a cross-sectional study [^0de5aff6]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Compared with other imaging modalities, ultrasound is relatively deeply penetrating and can be used to evaluate deep dermal and subcutaneous structures.

Objective

Image skin thickness of the face and neck using high-frequency diagnostic ultrasound devices.

Materials and Methods

Skin overlying 20 different predesignated face and neck anatomic sites in 32 individuals was imaged using 2 commercially available high-frequency diagnostic ultrasound devices, a dedicated imaging device and a diagnostic device bundled with a therapeutic device. At each site, the subcutaneous and combined epidermal and dermal layer thicknesses were assessed by blinded expert raters.

Results

Similar skin thickness measurements were obtained. Notably, subcutaneous fat depth was measured to be 0.2 cm at the forehead; 0.5 cm at the mental eminence; and 0.6 cm at the submental, supraglenoid, and temporal regions. The combined epidermal and dermal thickness was approximately 0.1 cm at the zygomatic process, suborbital area, inferior malar region, gonion, supraglenoid area, and nasolabial-buccal, and nasolabial fold regions.

Conclusion

This is the first study using high-resolution superficial diagnostic ultrasound to map skin thickness of the face and neck at standard anatomic locations. Ultrasound is an inexpensive, noninvasive, and convenient means to monitor dermatologic conditions and guide their treatment.
