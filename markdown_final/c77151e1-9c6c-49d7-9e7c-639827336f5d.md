## Question

does mupirocin have coverage for staph aureus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mupirocin has coverage for Staphylococcus aureus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of "coverage" and if it applies to both MSSA and MRSA. Then, I should verify mupirocin's mechanism and spectrum from authoritative sources. Next, I will check FDA-approved indications directly relevant to S. aureus. After that, I need to examine in vitro and clinical activity including decolonization data. I should then assess resistance mechanisms and prevalence because "coverage" is contingent on susceptibility. Finally, I will synthesize clinical effectiveness, limitations, and provide a balanced conclusion with practical implications and references to guidelines or high-quality trials [^115dtGUL] [^115iuBGL].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't overstate anything. By "coverage", I mean demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus that is clinically relevant, recognizing that activity is limited to topical or intranasal sites where the drug achieves bactericidal concentrations, and that efficacy is contingent on isolate susceptibility and local resistance patterns, including among MRSA strains [^115dtGUL] [^113brbdA].

> I will now examine the mechanism of action and general spectrum, since this frames the plausibility of S. aureus coverage. Mupirocin reversibly and specifically inhibits bacterial isoleucyl‑tRNA synthetase, a unique target with no cross‑resistance to other antibiotic classes, and is bactericidal at concentrations achieved with topical administration, which supports activity at skin and nasal sites where it is applied [^115dtGUL] [^113brbdA] [^115okW1v].

> Next, I should review FDA-approved indications tied to S. aureus to ground this in labeled use. Mupirocin ointment is indicated for impetigo caused by susceptible S. aureus, and mupirocin cream is indicated for secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions due to susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, with clinical trials demonstrating high pathogen eradication rates against S. aureus in impetigo, which supports clinically meaningful "coverage" when isolates are susceptible [^116yDAXB] [^114XWAh4] [^111h1fVi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about MRSA; I need to check whether mupirocin's activity extends to MRSA in the settings where it is used. FDA labeling for intranasal mupirocin indicates activity against most MRSA strains in vitro and clinical utility for nasal eradication as part of outbreak control, and randomized and controlled studies show substantial short‑term decolonization efficacy in carriers, which reinforces antistaphylococcal activity inclusive of many MRSA strains, albeit dependent on susceptibility [^113brbdA] [^113Qas9N] [^114ect3m].

> I should confirm resistance mechanisms and their clinical implications because "coverage" is only as good as local susceptibility. High‑level mupirocin resistance is typically plasmid‑encoded via mupA and confers decolonization failure risk, whereas low‑level resistance arises from ileS mutations and can be induced under selective pressure; prevalence varies by setting, with resistance more common in MRSA than MSSA and reported to be higher in some NICU cohorts, which can erode effective coverage in those contexts [^112pBGpg] [^113brbdA] [^111XJ2ta] [^112gN2jN] [^115BGci1] [^116YXn88].

> Let me review clinical effectiveness for decolonization to see how in vitro activity translates at the bedside. In infants and NICU settings, intranasal plus topical mupirocin achieves very high initial eradication rates of S. aureus carriage, though recolonization can occur and repeat courses may be needed, while adult long‑term care residents also show high eradication rates after treatment, consistent with robust activity when strains are susceptible [^114Lj83t] [^114ect3m] [^113Qas9N].

> But wait, what about prevention of infections rather than just carriage? In surgical S. aureus carriers, perioperative intranasal mupirocin significantly reduces nosocomial S. aureus infections compared with placebo, whereas in nonsurgical inpatients the overall infection rate reduction is not significant, and in ICU or burn ICU universal decolonization bundles including mupirocin have reduced MRSA infections, highlighting population‑specific effectiveness that still depends on susceptibility and adherence [^115iuBGL] [^1135ZTp9] [^112oEPDw].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied systemic coverage — let me correct that. Mupirocin has minimal systemic absorption and is intended for topical or intranasal use only, with product‑specific restrictions such as the standard ointment not for intranasal use, and its high protein binding and uncertain impact of secretions can affect local activity in wounds; effectiveness is lower against resistant strains and may hinge on protocol adherence, which must be verified and reinforced during decolonization efforts [^116o4usB] [^116i6Bku] [^115okW1v] [^11234n6w] [^114VnL4p].

> Synthesis and clinical take: Yes, mupirocin provides reliable topical and intranasal coverage against susceptible S. aureus, including many MSSA and MRSA isolates, supported by FDA‑labeled skin indications and strong decolonization efficacy data; however, its real‑world performance is contingent on isolate susceptibility and local resistance pressure, and where resistance prevalence is elevated, alternatives or adjuncts may be needed, with ICU data suggesting mupirocin remains preferable to iodophor for nasal decolonization, and stewardship with targeted use and susceptibility monitoring is prudent, especially in high‑use settings [^116yDAXB] [^114XWAh4] [^113brbdA] [^115PNY2C].

---

Yes — mupirocin is active against Staphylococcus aureus, including **methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA)** [^115okW1v], and is indicated for topical treatment of impetigo [^116yDAXB] and secondarily infected skin lesions due to susceptible S. aureus [^114XWAh4]. It is also used for **nasal decolonization** of S. aureus, particularly MRSA [^115iuBGL], to reduce infection risk in healthcare settings [^113brbdA]. However, **resistance can occur** [^112pBGpg], especially with prolonged or repeated use, so susceptibility testing and judicious use are recommended [^111XJ2ta] [^113iPQc9].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Mupirocin is indicated for topical treatment of **impetigo** [^116yDAXB] and secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions caused by susceptible S. aureus [^114XWAh4]. Clinical trials show high efficacy in eradicating S. aureus from skin lesions and nasal colonization sites. In **impetigo** [^111h1fVi], mupirocin ointment achieved clinical efficacy rates of 71% compared with 35% for placebo, and pathogen eradication rates of 94% with mupirocin versus 62% with placebo. For **nasal decolonization** [^113brbdA], mupirocin nasal ointment effectively eradicates nasal colonization of S. aureus, including MRSA [^115iuBGL], reducing the risk of subsequent infections in healthcare settings.

---

## Spectrum of activity against staphylococcus aureus

Mupirocin exhibits **potent activity** against both methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Its unique mechanism of action — inhibiting bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase — results in bactericidal activity at topical concentrations [^115dtGUL]. **MSSA coverage** is strong: mupirocin is highly effective against MSSA, making it a first-line topical agent for mild skin infections caused by this organism [^116yDAXB]. **MRSA coverage** is also robust: mupirocin is effective against most MRSA strains, making it valuable for nasal decolonization [^115iuBGL] and topical treatment of MRSA-related skin infections.

---

## Resistance considerations

Despite its efficacy, **resistance to mupirocin** can develop, particularly with prolonged or repeated use [^112pBGpg]. Resistance mechanisms include mutations in the ileS gene encoding isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase [^115DkWQV] and acquisition of plasmid-mediated resistance genes such as mupA.

- **Low-level resistance**: Typically results from point mutations in the native ileS gene, leading to MICs of 8–256 µg/mL. The clinical significance of low-level resistance remains unclear [^112pBGpg] [^112xUTjP].

- **High-level resistance**: Mediated by plasmid-encoded mupA gene, resulting in MICs ≥ 512 µg/mL. High-level resistance is clinically significant and associated with decolonization failure [^112pBGpg] [^115dtGUL].

- **Prevalence**: Resistance rates vary geographically and by clinical setting [^112gN2jN]. Studies report resistance rates ranging from 3.4% to 25% among MRSA isolates, with higher rates observed in healthcare settings with frequent mupirocin use [^116YXn88].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **judicious use** of mupirocin to minimize resistance [^112pBGpg]; susceptibility testing is recommended, particularly in settings with known resistance or frequent mupirocin use. **Decolonization protocols** recommend mupirocin for nasal decolonization of MRSA carriers [^115iuBGL], particularly in healthcare settings, to reduce the risk of subsequent infections [^113brbdA] [^116qJv5Q]. **Alternative agents** such as retapamulin or fusidic acid may be considered when mupirocin resistance is present, although resistance to these agents can also develop [^114e23VP] [^115hAp63].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Clinical studies consistently demonstrate the **effectiveness** of mupirocin in reducing S. aureus colonization and infection rates. **Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)** have experienced significant reductions in S. aureus colonization and infection rates among neonates [^113kW7ZM] with mupirocin-based decolonization [^114Lj83t]. For **surgical site infections**, preoperative nasal mupirocin decolonization [^115iuBGL] reduced the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infections in orthopedic and cardiac surgery patients [^112nhKDx] [^113iPQc9].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While mupirocin is effective, several **limitations** must be considered:

- **Resistance development**: Prolonged or repeated use can lead to resistance, necessitating careful monitoring and susceptibility testing [^112pBGpg] [^113iPQc9].

- **Limited systemic absorption**: Mupirocin is not suitable for systemic infections due to minimal systemic absorption.

- **Adverse reactions**: Localized adverse reactions such as application site burning, itching, and rash may occur [^112XesTA].

---

Overall, mupirocin is **effective against Staphylococcus aureus**, including MRSA [^115okW1v], and is indicated for topical treatment [^116yDAXB] and nasal decolonization [^115iuBGL]. Because resistance can develop, susceptibility testing and judicious use are recommended [^112pBGpg].

### Mupirocin-induced mutations in ileS in various genetic backgrounds of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^111XJ2ta]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical mupirocin is widely used for the decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers. We evaluated the capacity of various MRSA clonotypes to develop mutations in the ileS gene associated with low-level mupirocin resistance. Twenty-four mupirocin-sensitive MRSA isolates from a variety of genotypes (determined by a multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat assay) were selected. Mupirocin MICs were determined by Etest. The isolates were then incubated in sub-inhibitory concentrations of mupirocin for 7 to 14 days. Repeat MIC determinations and sequencing of the ileS gene were then performed. Doubling times of isolates exposed to mupirocin and of unexposed isolates were compared.

We found that exposure to mupirocin led to rapid induction of low-level resistance (MICs of 8 to 24 μg/ml) in 11 of 24 (46%) MRSA isolates. This phenomenon was observed in strains with diverse genetic backgrounds. Various mutations were detected in 18 of 24 (75%) MRSA isolates. Acquisition of mutations appeared to be a stepwise process during prolonged incubation with the drug. Among the five isolates exhibiting low-level resistance and the highest MICs, four tested sensitive after incubation in the absence of mupirocin, but there was no reversion to the susceptible wild-type primary sequence. Resistance was not associated with significant fitness cost, suggesting that MRSA strains with low-level mupirocin resistance may have a selective advantage in facilities where mupirocin is commonly used. Our findings emphasize the importance of the judicious use of this topical agent.

### Mupirocin resistance [^112pBGpg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

With increasing pressure to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, it is possible that there will be increased use of mupirocin for the nasal decolonization of MRSA. Understanding the mechanisms, clinical significance, and epidemiology of mupirocin resistance is important for predicting how changes in mupirocin use may affect bacterial populations and MRSA control. High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus is mediated by a plasmid-encoded mupA gene, which can be found on conjugative plasmids that carry multiple resistance determinants for other classes of antimicrobial agents. High-level resistance has been associated with decolonization failure, and increased resistance rates have been associated with increased mupirocin use.

Low-level mupirocin resistance is mediated via mutation in the native ileS gene, and the clinical significance of this resistance is unclear. Laboratory tests to detect and distinguish between these types of resistance have been described but are not widely available in the United States. Institutions that are considering the implementation of widespread mupirocin use should consider these resistance issues and develop strategies to monitor the impact of mupirocin use.

---

### Bactroban [^113brbdA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this mode of action, mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

When mupirocin resistance does occur, it appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC > 1,024 mcg/mL) has been reported in some strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved topically by intranasal administration. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant intranasal pathogens is generally 8-fold to 30-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Additionally, mupirocin is highly protein bound (> 97%), and the effect of nasal secretions on the MICs of intranasally applied mupirocin has not been determined.

Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, both in vitro and in clinical studies of the eradication of nasal colonization. Bactroban nasal only has established clinical utility in nasal eradication as part of a comprehensive program to curtail institutional outbreaks of infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

- **In vitro data**: Mupirocin exhibits further in vitro activity, but its clinical significance is unknown.

### Comprehensive strategy including prophylactic mupirocin to reduce Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection in high-risk neonates [^113kW7ZM]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

To examine the use of long-term prophylactic mupirocin as part of a comprehensive strategy in reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a study was conducted involving the application of mupirocin twice daily to all infants admitted to the NICU throughout their hospitalization starting in 2004. Staphylococcus aureus surveillance began in 2008, and the effectiveness of these practices was assessed through a retrospective review of infants admitted from 2004 to 2010 found to be colonized or infected with Staphylococcus aureus.

During the study period, 66 of 6283 NICU infants experienced a Staphylococcus aureus infection, with 67% exhibiting methicillin resistance. There were three distinct Staphylococcus aureus outbreaks, the first characterized by a methicillin-resistant strain in July 2004. Following the implementation of daily mupirocin, the outbreak was eradicated, and the rate of Staphylococcus aureus infection significantly decreased from 1.82 to 0.40 per 1000 patient-days at risk (P = 0.0049). Mupirocin was discontinued in March 2005, which was followed by a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus outbreak in November 2005. In December 2005, mupirocin was reintroduced and has been used continuously until the present, significantly reducing Staphylococcus aureus infections from 1.42 to 0.33 per 1000 patient-days at risk (P < 0.0001) with zero isolates resistant to mupirocin. In the pre-mupirocin period, Staphylococcus aureus colonization was above 60%, now maintaining rates typically below 5%. Staphylococcus aureus colonization was a strong predictor of later invasive infection (P < 0.0001).

Although controversial, prophylactic mupirocin in all NICU infants has acted as a barrier to colonization and markedly decreased Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### Antibiotic hyper-resistance in a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase with altered active site signature motif [^115DkWQV]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The mechanism of mupirocin resistance has not yet been fully understood. The structural basis was indecisive because a comparison of the mupirocin-bound structures of *T. thermophilus* IleRS2 and *S. aureus* IleRS1 is not straightforward, considering that the IleRS1 structure, besides mupirocin, also contains the tRNA. This may promote conformational changes in the active site loops. To address this issue, we solved the structures of IleRS1 (sensitive) and IleRS2 (resistant) from *P. megaterium* bound to mupirocin only. The structures provide important progress in understanding the resistance mechanism by identifying that the closed conformation of the active site KMSKS loop in IleRS2 precludes H-bonding stabilization of the mupirocin's carboxylate. Because H-bonding to a charged group has been shown to be a powerful mechanism to ensure a high level of specificity in molecular recognition and may strongly contribute to the binding of mupirocin to IleRS1, the loss of this interaction in IleRS2 may have been adopted as an efficient resistance mechanism during evolution. In accordance, no H-bonding to the mupirocin's carboxylate was observed in the TtIleRS2:mupirocin structure or a model of mupirocin bound to eukaryotic IleRS2. The structural data are also consistent with the finding that monic acid A alone cannot act as an inhibitor.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^115PNY2C]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Despite data showing that universal ICU decolonization with daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing and nasal mupirocin reduces the rates of MRSA infections in ICUs, there is hesitancy to adopt mupirocin decolonization given concerns about selecting for mupirocin resistance. Iodophor (povidone-iodine) has been suggested as an acceptable alternative to mupirocin for nasal decolonization. In a large RCT, over 800,000 patients across 137 US hospitals were randomized at the hospital level to receive either 5 days of twice-daily iodophor nasal decolonization or 5 days of twice-daily mupirocin decolonization, in addition to receiving daily chlorhexidine gluconate bathing. This study found that during the intervention period, there was a significantly increased risk of recovering S. aureus in a clinical culture, attributable to a patient's ICU stay, in the patients who underwent nasal decolonization with iodophor. There were no differences, however, in the secondary outcome of all-cause bloodstream infections. Despite concerns for the potential development of mupirocin resistance, mupirocin is still the preferred option for S. aureus decolonization in ICUs based on the results of this study.

### Molecular characterization of resistance to mupirocin in methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus from nasal samples [^115BGci1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 15 out of 101 (14.8%) nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates exhibited mupirocin resistance (Mup(r)), compared with 1 of 154 (0.6%) methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates. A total of 14 (93%) isolates exhibiting high-level Mup(r) belonged to a single clone. Horizontal plasmid transfer and transmission of Mup(r) strains contribute to a high incidence of Mup(r) MRSA at our institution.

### Acquisition of high-level mupirocin resistance and its fitness cost among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains with low-level mupirocin resistance [^1143a6vk]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

We investigated whether methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates with low-level mupirocin resistance can serve as recipients of a pSK41-like plasmid conferring high-level mupirocin resistance without substantial fitness cost. Our results suggest that acquisition of the plasmid conferring high-level mupirocin resistance was not necessarily associated with fitness cost in some MRSA recipients with low-level mupirocin resistance.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^112EtcuM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Mupirocin treatment lowers Staphylococcus burden on lesional skin. We next determined the impact of mupirocin or vehicle treatment on the microbial diversity and abundance of Staphylococcus on CLE lesions. Before treatment, the targeted lesion was swabbed, and a second swab was collected in the same location after one week of vehicle or mupirocin treatment. Paired nasal swabs were also collected. Staphylococcus abundance and cutaneous and nasal microbial diversity were assessed before and after topical treatment of the active CLE lesion.

CLE lesional skin and nasal swab samples were assayed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The relative abundance of bacterial genera colonizing CLE lesions was largely unaltered by mupirocin treatment, except for Staphylococcus, whereas vehicle treatment did not significantly change lesional microbiota composition [Figure 3A depicts the pre‐ and post-treatment mean alpha diversities of each patient; intraindividual diversity is shown in Supplemental Figure 1A]. Mupirocin reduced Staphylococcus burden on CLE lesions (P = 0.0352; Figure 3B) without altering overall microbial diversity (P = 0.2812; Figure 3C) or levels of other Gram‐positive bacteria, such as species within the Streptococcus genus (P = 0.1095; Supplemental Figure 1B). Taken together, these data demonstrate compliance with topical therapy and the desired specificity of S. aureus as the target microbe for treatment.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^114kf8aU]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Treatment with mupirocin resulted in the down-regulation of pathways involved in mitosis and cell division. This could reflect normalization of keratinocyte proliferation. The presence of epidermal scale is considered an indicator of disease in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Discoid lupus erythematosus lesions, in particular, show hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, manifesting clinically as hyperkeratosis and follicular plugging from keratin. Here, treatment with mupirocin resulted in the down-regulation of pathways involved in mitosis and cell division, along with increased keratinization, which could reflect normalization of keratinocyte maturation. Thus, mupirocin treatment may offer benefit in this regard. Longer-term studies are needed to assess the clinical response.

Type I IFN-related gene changes were observed to be correlated with decreased monocytes and activated dendritic cells after mupirocin treatment. PLSCR1 is an IFN-inducible phospholipid scramblase family member known to be involved in immune responses and antiviral activity. Monocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have enhanced PLSCR1 gene expression. PLSCRs are important for lipid metabolism and contribute to inflammation, which is also modulated by mupirocin treatment. PLSCR1 negatively regulates Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis during macrophage differentiation from precursors such as monocytes. Furthermore, PLSCR1 may play a role in the antiviral response of IFN by amplifying and enhancing the IFN response through increased expression of select subsets of potent antiviral genes.

### Mupirocin for decolonization of infants in neonatal intensive care units [^114Lj83t]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Media-1vid110.1542/5849573989001PEDS-VA_2018–1565 Video Abstract

- **Background and objectives**: Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is the second leading cause of late-onset sepsis among infants in the NICU. Because colonization of nasal mucosa and/or skin frequently precedes invasive infection, decolonization strategies such as mupirocin application have been attempted to prevent clinical infection. However, data supporting this approach in infants are limited. We conducted a phase 2 multicenter, open-label, randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of intranasal plus topical mupirocin in eradicating SA colonization in critically ill infants.

- **Methods**: Between April 2014 and May 2016, infants < 24 months old in the NICU at eight study centers underwent serial screening for nasal SA. Colonized infants who met eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive 5 days of mupirocin versus no mupirocin applied to intranasal, periumbilical, and perianal areas. Mupirocin effects on primary (day 8) and persistent (day 22) decolonization at all three body sites were assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 155 infants were randomly assigned. Mupirocin was generally well tolerated, but rashes (usually mild and perianal) occurred significantly more often in treated versus untreated infants. Primary decolonization occurred in 62 of 66 (93.9%) treated infants and 3 of 64 (4.7%) control infants (P < .001). Twenty-one of 46 (45.7%) treated infants were persistently decolonized compared with 1 of 48 (2.1%) controls (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Application of mupirocin to multiple body sites was safe and effective.

### Mupirocin [^116o4usB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Dosage and administration**: For topical use only. Apply a small amount of mupirocin ointment with a cotton swab or gauze pad to the affected area three times daily for up to 10 days. Cover the treated area with gauze dressing if desired. Re-evaluate patients not showing a clinical response within 3 to 5 days. Mupirocin ointment is not for intranasal, ophthalmic, or other mucosal use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.6)]. Do not apply mupirocin ointment concurrently with any other lotions, creams, or ointments [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prophylactic treatment of chronic renal disease in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and colonized by Staphylococcus aureus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hAp63]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Another contraindication to mupirocin is bacterial resistance to this agent. In cases involving a mupirocin-resistant agent, the possibility of endogenous recolonization is high after 4 weeks of treatment. However, resistance to mupirocin is still considered low. In this review, we found only one study that reported resistance to mupirocin in one isolated case.

Gentamicin and cefazolin were used together, and this combination provided effective results to reduce infection rates at the exit site of the PD catheter (0.23 vs. 0.09 episode per patient per year; p < 0.005) and peritonitis (0.33 vs. 0.10 episodes per patient per year; p < 0.005).

Fusidic acid was evaluated separately and exhibited statistically significant results (p < 0.01) for S. aureus eradication in colonized patients. However, it is widely contraindicated as monotherapy for decolonization and is indicated only as a supportive treatment or enhancer to the use of systemic rifamycin. It did not show statistically significant results in reducing MRSA infections. Instead, it increased the emergence of bacterial resistance, which reinforces the idea of not using this drug alone for eradication of S. aureus in colonized patients.

Only one study compared the effectiveness of nasal neomycin sulfate ointment three times a day for 7 days with that of nasal mupirocin ointment daily for 7 days and reported that mupirocin is more effective than neomycin sulfate for elimination of S. aureus nasal colonization in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory PD.

In this meta-analysis, the antibiotic group exhibited a 56% low.

### Efficacy of nasal Staphylococcus aureus eradication by topical nasal mupirocin in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis [^111DiUiZ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) colonization is frequent in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). Mupirocin has well-recognized antistaphylococcal activity, and its nasal formulation is approved for the eradication of SA nasal colonization.

- **Objective**: To investigate the frequency of SA nasal carriage, its possible influence on AR severity, and nasal mupirocin's role on AR clinical severity.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients, aged 5 to 60 years, with AR were included, and 55 healthy individuals served as a control group. Nasal smear specimens were drawn from both nares. A skin prick test to inhalational allergens and a score-graded clinical evaluation of AR were performed. Carriers of SA were treated with topical nasal mupirocin.

- **Results**: The SA carrier (SAC) state was found in 23 (38%) of the patients with AR and in 8 (15%) of the healthy controls (P = .004). Comparing SACs with AR SA noncarriers, nasal symptom scores (SSs) tended to be higher in the SAC group (mean [SD], 11.09 [2.16] vs. 8.86 [1.43]; P < .005). Treatment with topical nasal mupirocin diminished the SAC state to 10% (P = .009) but did not change AR clinical severity, as assessed by the SS.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with PAR, the SAC state is more prevalent compared with the healthy population. Topical nasal mupirocin reduces the SAC state but fails to clinically improve PAR, as assessed by the SS.

### Chlorhexidine and mupirocin susceptibility of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the REDUCE-MRSA trial [^115WiHgM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Whether targeted or universal decolonization strategies for the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) select for resistance to decolonizing agents is unresolved. The REDUCE-MRSA trial (ClinicalTrials registration no. NCT00980980) provided an opportunity to investigate this question. This was a 3-arm, cluster-randomized trial of either screening and isolation without decolonization, targeted decolonization with chlorhexidine and mupirocin, or universal decolonization without screening to prevent MRSA infection in intensive-care unit (ICU) patients.

Isolates from the baseline and intervention periods were collected and tested for susceptibility to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) by microtiter dilution; mupirocin susceptibility was tested by Etest. The presence of the qacA or qacB gene was determined by PCR and DNA sequence analysis. A total of 3,173 isolates were analyzed; 2 were nonsusceptible to CHG (MICs, 8 μg/ml), and 5/814 (0.6%) carried qacA or qacB. At baseline, 7.1% of MRSA isolates expressed low-level mupirocin resistance, and 7.5% expressed high-level mupirocin resistance.

In a mixed-effects generalized logistic regression model, the odds of mupirocin resistance among clinical MRSA isolates or MRSA isolates acquired in an ICU in intervention versus baseline periods did not differ across arms, although estimates were imprecise due to small numbers. Reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine and carriage of qacA or qacB were rare among MRSA isolates in the REDUCE-MRSA trial. The odds of mupirocin resistance were no different in the intervention.

### A high prevalence of mupirocin and macrolide resistance determinant among Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from burnt patients [^111xD7o8]. Burns (2012). Low credibility.

Infections due to Staphylococcus aureus have become increasingly common among burn patients. This study investigated the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus isolates and inducible resistance against clindamycin. The presence of the mecA gene, mupA gene, and macrolide resistance genes were detected using PCR and multiplex-PCR. The resistance rates to methicillin, erythromycin, and mupirocin were 58.5%, 58%, and 40%, respectively.

The prevalence of constitutive and inducible resistance among macrolide-resistant isolates was 75% and 25%, respectively. Ninety-five percent of the isolates were positive for one or more erm genes. The most common genes were ermA (75%), ermC (72%), and ermB (69%), respectively. The ermA gene predominated in strains with the inducible phenotype, while ermC was more common in isolates with the constitutive phenotype. The msrA gene was found only in one MRSA isolate with the constitutive phenotype. A total of 27 isolates (25%) carried the mupA gene.

All the mupirocin-resistant isolates and almost all the erythromycin-resistant isolates were also resistant to methicillin, which may indicate an outbreak of MRSA isolates with high-level mupirocin and erythromycin resistance in the burn unit assessed.

### Mupirocin ointment for preventing Staphylococcus aureus infections in nasal carriers [^112fMWcn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pathogen in hospitals worldwide. Traditionally, control of S. aureus has focused on preventing cross-infection between patients. However, it has been repeatedly shown that a large proportion of nosocomial S. aureus infections originate from the patient's own flora. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is now considered a well-defined risk factor for subsequent infection in various patient groups. Local antibiotic treatment with mupirocin ointment is often used to eradicate nasal S. aureus.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether the use of mupirocin nasal ointment in patients with identified S. aureus nasal carriage reduced S. aureus infection rates.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (May 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2008), EMBASE (1980 to May 2008), and CINAHL (1982 to May 2008). To identify unpublished trials, abstract books from major scientific meetings (ICAAC, ESCMID, and SHEA) were hand-searched, researchers and manufacturers of mupirocin were contacted, and other electronic databases were searched (SIGLE, ASLIB Index, mRCT, USA Clinical Trials).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal mupirocin with no treatment or placebo or alternative nasal treatment in the prevention of S. aureus infections in nasal S. aureus carriers were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles of studies retrieved.

### Mupirocin resistance related to increasing mupirocin use in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a pediatric population [^1121N63u]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2010). Low credibility.

We investigated the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from pediatric patients demonstrating mupirocin resistance related to mupirocin use at our institution. No mupirocin resistance was found in 98% of isolates, whereas mupirocin prescriptions increased by 110%. Resistance rates remained low despite the increasing use of mupirocin.

### Decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin [^113i6Q9s]. Clinical microbiology and infection (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of a short course of oral vancomycin and intranasal mupirocin ointment in the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization. During an outbreak of MRSA, the colonized subjects received oral vancomycin and topical mupirocin. They were screened for MRSA 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after decolonization. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the side effects of oral vancomycin. Thirty-five subjects were treated. Clearance was achieved in all cases, in 24 (69%) subjects after one course of therapy. Twenty-eight (80%) subjects experienced some side effects, including six (17%) who did not tolerate oral vancomycin. Although oral vancomycin, in combination with topical mupirocin, is effective in the elimination of MRSA colonization, there is a need for further studies to confirm our results and to evaluate the safety of oral vancomycin.

### Bactroban [^115okW1v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011).

Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is active against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It is also effective against certain gram-negative bacteria. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase. Due to this unique mode of action, mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

Resistance occurs rarely; however, when mupirocin resistance does occur, it appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC > 1024 mcg/mL) has been reported in some strains of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.

Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical application. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against relevant pathogens is generally 8-fold to 30-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In addition, mupirocin is highly protein bound (> 97%), and the effect of wound secretions on the MICs of mupirocin has not been determined.

Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, both in vitro and in clinical studies. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Mupirocin is active against most strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus species.

### Mupirocin-based decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus carriers in residents of 2 long-term care facilities: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113Qas9N]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Mupirocin has been used in nursing homes to prevent the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), despite the lack of controlled trials. In this double-blind, randomized study, the efficacy of intranasal mupirocin ointment versus that of placebo in reducing colonization and preventing infection was assessed among persistent carriers of S. aureus. Twice-daily treatment was given for 2 weeks, with a follow-up period of 6 months.

Staphylococcal colonization rates were similar between residents at the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs (VA) Extended Care Center, Michigan (33%), and residents at a community-based long-term care facility in Ann Arbor (36%), although those at the VA Center carried MRSA more often (58% vs. 35%; p = 0.017). After treatment, mupirocin had eradicated colonization in 93% of residents, whereas 85% of residents who received placebo remained colonized (p < 0.001). At day 90 after study entry, 61% of the residents in the mupirocin group remained decolonized. Four patients did not respond to mupirocin therapy; 3 of the 4 had mupirocin-resistant S. aureus strains. Thirteen (86%) of 14 residents who became recolonized had the same pretherapy strain; no strain recovered during relapse was resistant to mupirocin. A trend toward reduction in infections was seen with mupirocin treatment.

### Editorial commentary: Duration of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: A question with many answers [^114VnL4p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

As one final point, I would like to comment on the observation that receipt of mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine baths was not associated with a shorter duration of MRSA colonization in the study being discussed. Prior studies have shown eradication therapy to be effective in decreasing MRSA colonization and subsequent infection, but these studies paid close attention to adherence. Cluzet et al. appropriately mention a number of limitations that might have impacted their assessment of the association between the use of mupirocin and/or chlorhexidine/bleach baths and the time to clearance of MRSA colonization. They specifically mention that compliance with these two agents was not determined and that decolonization regimens may have been given more commonly to patients with a perceived higher risk of recurrence.

Overall, Cluzet et al. have presented stimulating results from a well-designed study that took great efforts to longitudinally follow the MRSA colonization status of a cohort of patients and their household members following the diagnosis of community-acquired MRSA SSTI. Both the shorter duration of time to clearance of MRSA colonization and the putative association between SSTI treatment with clindamycin and a shorter duration of MRSA colonization deserve further investigation.

### Mupirocin prophylaxis against nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus infections in nonsurgical patients: a randomized study [^1135ZTp9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage is a major risk factor for nosocomial S. aureus infection. Studies show that intranasal mupirocin can prevent nosocomial surgical site infections, but no data are available on the efficacy of mupirocin in nonsurgical patients.

- **Objective**: To assess the efficacy of mupirocin prophylaxis in preventing nosocomial S. aureus infections in nonsurgical patients.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: Three tertiary care academic hospitals and one nonacademic hospital.

- **Patients**: 1602 culture-proven S. aureus carriers hospitalized in nonsurgical departments.

- **Intervention**: Therapy with mupirocin 2% nasal ointment (n = 793) or placebo ointment (n = 809), twice daily for 5 days, started 1 to 3 days after admission.

- **Measurements**: Nosocomial S. aureus infections according to defined criteria, in-hospital mortality, duration of hospitalization, and time to nosocomial S. aureus infection. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were genotyped to assess whether infection was caused by endogenous strains.

- **Results**: The mupirocin and placebo groups did not statistically differ in rates of nosocomial S. aureus infections (mupirocin, 2.6%; placebo, 2.8%; risk difference, 0.2 percentage point [95% CI, -1.5 to 1.9 percentage points]), mortality (mupirocin, 3.0%; placebo, 2.8%; risk difference, -0.2 percentage point [CI, -1.9 to 1.5 percentage points]), or duration of hospitalization (median for both, 8 days). However, time to nosocomial S. aureus infection was decreased in the mupirocin group from 12 to 25 days (P > 0.2).

### Prevention of surgical site infections: Decontamination with mupirocin based on preoperative screening for Staphylococcus aureus carriers or universal decontamination [^113iPQc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Perioperative decolonization of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers with mupirocin combined with chlorhexidine body washing reduces the incidence of S. aureus surgical site infections. A targeted strategy, applied only to S. aureus carriers, is costly, and its implementation may reduce effectiveness. Universal decolonization is more cost-effective but increases the exposure of noncarriers to mupirocin and the risk of resistance to mupirocin in staphylococci.

High-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus can emerge through horizontal gene transfer originating from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and through clonal transmission. Evidence on the occurrence of high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus and CoNS, combined with results from mathematical modeling, strongly suggests that increased selection of high-level mupirocin resistance in CoNS does not constitute a significant risk for high-level mupirocin resistance in S. aureus. Compared with a targeted strategy, universal decolonization seems associated with an equally low risk of mupirocin resistance in S. aureus.

### Pirnuo [^112ZosQz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

PIRNUO (Purr-NEW-oh) (mupirocin calcium) cream is a prescription medicine used on the skin (topical use) to treat certain skin infections caused by bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. It is not known if PIRNUO cream is safe and effective in children under 3 months of age.

- **Who should not use PIRNUO cream**: Do not use PIRNUO cream if you are allergic to mupirocin or any of the ingredients in the cream. See the end of this patient information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients.

- **What should I tell my healthcare provider before using PIRNUO cream**: Before using PIRNUO cream, inform your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if PIRNUO cream will harm your unborn baby. Additionally, if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, it is not known if PIRNUO cream passes into your breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you can use PIRNUO cream while breastfeeding.

### Perioperative intranasal mupirocin for the prevention of surgical-site infections: Systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis [^113tSRzo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the evidence evaluating perioperative intranasal mupirocin for the prevention of surgical-site infections according to the type of surgical procedure.

The design employed was a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials. The setting for these studies included either randomized clinical trials or prospective trials at a single institution that measured outcomes both before and after an institution-wide intervention (before-after trial). In all studies, intervention and control groups differed only by the use of perioperative intranasal mupirocin in the intervention group.

Patients included in the study were undergoing general or non-general surgery (e.g. cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery).

The main outcome measure was the risk of surgical-site infection following the use of perioperative intranasal mupirocin versus usual care.

Results indicated that three randomized and four before-after trials met the inclusion criteria. No reduction in the surgical-site infection rate was observed in randomized general surgery trials, with summary estimates showing 8.4% in the mupirocin group and 8.1% in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 0.81 to 1.33). In non-general surgery, the use of mupirocin was associated with a reduction in surgical-site infections in randomized trials, with summary estimates showing 6.0% in the mupirocin group and 7.6% in the control group (RR, 0.80; CI95, 0.58 to 1.10), and in before-after trials, with summary estimates showing 1.7% in the mupirocin group and 4.1% in the control group (RR, 0.40; CI95, 0.29 to 0.56).

### Screening and treatment for Staphylococcus aureus in patients undergoing hemodialysis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162e7n3]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Boelaert et al. reported that the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia was four times lower after nasal decolonization with mupirocin in patients with end-stage renal disease than in the untreated group (0.024 vs. 0.097 per patient-year, p = 0.008). Johnson et al. conducted a clinical trial involving patients undergoing HD and found a significantly lower incidence of bacteremia-related bloodstream infection (7% vs. 35%, p < 0.01) and longer survival duration (108 vs. 31 days, p < 0.05) in patients treated with dermal mupirocin at the CVC exit site three times a week than in untreated patients. Sesso et al. performed a prospective randomized study and found that the proportion of patients with S. aureus skin infection at the CVC insertion site was lower in the mupirocin group than in the untreated group (4.3% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.001). In their study, S. aureus bacteremia was observed in 17 patients: 2 in the mupirocin group (0.71 episodes per 1,000 patient-days) and 15 in the control group (8.92 episodes per 1,000 patient-days; p < 0.001).

An issue of concern when mupirocin is used for long periods is the emergence of mupirocin resistance. However, resistance has not been reported when treatment is limited to mupirocin prophylaxis or healthy patients. Three studies in the present meta-analysis evaluated resistance to mupirocin, and only one showed resistance associated with prolonged therapy. Notably, the long-term effect on the development of resistance is unknown because no studies have reported follow-up results of more than two years. Moreover, the techniques used varied.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of topical mupirocin to reduce Staphylococcus aureus colonization in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit [^114ect3m]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical mupirocin in reducing Staphylococcus aureus colonization in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

- **Study design**: A prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of mupirocin vs. placebo in S. aureus-colonized infants was conducted in a tertiary care NICU between October 2016 and December 2019. Weekly universal active surveillance using polymerase chain reaction screening identified colonized infants. Colonized infants received a 5-day course of mupirocin (mupirocin group) or petroleum jelly (control group). Repeat courses were given for additional positive screens.

- **Results**: A total of 216 infants were enrolled; 205 were included in data analyses. Primary decolonization was more successful for mupirocin-treated infants (86 of 104 [83%]) than for controls (20 of 101 [20%]; P < .001). Although re-S. aureus colonization occurred frequently (59 of 81 [73%] mupirocin-treated and 26 of 33 [79%] controls), subsequent decolonization remained more successful for mupirocin-treated infants than for controls (38 of 49 [78%] vs. 2 of 21 [10%]; P < .001). Subgroup analyses of infants of ≤ 30 weeks' gestational age yielded similar results; decolonization occurred more often in mupirocin-treated infants compared with control infants (63 of 76 [83%] vs. 13 of 74 [18%]; P < .001). Bacterial sterile site infections tended to be less frequent in mupirocin-treated infants compared with controls (2 of 104 [2%] vs. 8 of 101 [8%]; p = 0.057). No invasive S. aureus infections occurred in mupirocin-treated infants, but 50% of infection

### Temporary hemodialysis catheters: Recent advances [^1162cGbX]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial decolonization with intranasal mupirocin has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia for chronic hemodialysis patients with tunneled HD catheters. We are unaware of any studies that have assessed decolonization strategies specifically for patients with non-tunneled hemodialysis catheters (NTHCs).

Given that NTHCs are often used for acute kidney injury (AKI) in the context of critical illness, studies of decolonization strategies for unselected ICU patients are relevant to patients who have NTHCs in that setting. A recent, large, cluster-randomized trial (n = 74,256 patients in 73 ICUs) utilized a 5-day decolonization protocol consisting of twice daily intranasal mupirocin and daily bathing with chlorhexidine-impregnated cloths. This protocol, when applied to all ICU patients, significantly reduced the rate of bloodstream infections from any pathogen compared with a strategy of applying the same decolonization protocol only to methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriers or using a strategy that only involved isolation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriers (i.e. no decolonization).

It should be noted that this study did not report any analysis on the basis of whether or not patients had a NTHC in place, and its applicability to non-ICU patients with NTHCs is tenuous.

### Mupirocin [^115dtGUL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens.

- **Mechanism of action**: Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase. It is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration and is highly protein bound (greater than 97%). The effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of mupirocin has not been determined.

- **Resistance**: When mupirocin resistance occurs, it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, or from the acquisition of, by genetic transfer, a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. High-level plasmid-mediated resistance (MIC ≥ 512 mcg/mL) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S. aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mupirocin resistance occurs more frequently in methicillin-resistant than methicillin-susceptible staphylococci.

- **Cross resistance**: Due to its mode of action, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S. aureus and S. pyogenes, both in vitro and in clinical trials. Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown.

### The mutational landscape of Staphylococcus aureus during colonisation [^112xUTjP]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Five of the eight protein-altering mutations in ileS are known (Val588Phe and Val631Phe) or are in a codon (Gly593Ala) known to confer mupirocin resistance and exhibited elevated MICs compared to the wild-type clonal isolate from the same individual. We confirmed the role of a not reported frameshift mutation (Ile473fs) in mupirocin resistance (E-test MIC 1024 μg/mL, breakpoint > 12 μg/mL) and ruled out the effect of Gly591Ser (E-test MIC 0.5 μg/mL).

Out of the five S. aureus isolates with missense variants in dfrA, three had amino acid changes reported to confer resistance to trimethoprim (His150Arg and two Phe99Tyr). The available isolate with Phe99Tyr was phenotypically resistant (MIC ≥ 16 μg/mL), but the isolate carrying His150Arg was not (MIC ≤ 0.5 μg/mL, zone diameter 27 mm), ruling out the role of this mutation in trimethoprim resistance in this particular strain background.

### The evaluation of nasal mupirocin to prevent Staphylococcus aureus burn wound colonization in routine clinical practice [^111DTuuh]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus wound colonization frequently occurs in patients with burns and can lead to impaired wound healing. Nasal mupirocin application may help reduce burn wound colonization from endogenous origins, while colonization via the exogenous route can be reduced by blocking cross-infection from other sources. This study evaluated whether the implementation of routine treatment using nasal mupirocin ointment for patients and burn center personnel could reduce S. aureus burn wound colonization.

- **Methods**: We composed three study groups: a control period (Control), a mupirocin period (MUP), where patients with burns received nasal mupirocin upon admission, and a mupirocin+personnel period (MUP+P), where we also screened burn center personnel and decolonized S. aureus carriers with nasal mupirocin.

- **Results**: Patients who carried S. aureus in their nose but did not have S. aureus burn wound colonization at admission were deemed susceptible to nasal mupirocin. In these patients, the S. aureus burn wound colonization rate was consistent across all study groups. S. aureus nasal carriage emerged as a significant independent risk factor for burn wound colonization (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4–7.6) when analyzed within the three study groups.

- **Conclusion**: Although S. aureus carriage is a significant risk factor for developing burn wound colonization, the routine use of nasal mupirocin did not contribute to a reduction in burn wound colonization.

### Topical mupirocin treatment reduces interferon and myeloid signatures in cutaneous lupus erythematous lesions through targeting of Staphylococcus species [^114bnpMe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory skin manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Type I interferons (IFNs) promote inflammatory responses and are elevated in CLE lesions. We recently reported that CLE lesions are frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. This study investigates whether type I IFN and inflammatory gene signatures in CLE lesions can be modulated with mupirocin, a topical antibiotic treatment against S. aureus–mediated skin infections.

Participants with active CLE lesions (n = 12) were recruited and randomized into a week of topical treatment with either 2% mupirocin or a petroleum jelly vehicle. Paired samples were collected before and after seven days of treatment to assess microbial lesional skin responses. Microbial samples from nares and lesional skin were used to determine baseline and post-treatment Staphylococcus abundance and microbial community profiles through 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Inflammatory responses were evaluated by bulk RNA sequencing of lesional skin biopsies.

The study identified 173 differentially expressed genes in CLE lesions after topical mupirocin treatment. The decreased lesional Staphylococcus burden correlated with decreased IFN pathway signaling, inflammatory gene expression, and barrier dysfunction. Interestingly, mupirocin treatment lowered skin monocyte levels, and this mupirocin-associated depletion of monocytes correlated with decreased inflammatory gene expression.

Mupirocin treatment decreased lesional Staphylococcus levels and inflammatory markers, suggesting a promising therapeutic avenue for managing CLE lesions.

### The persistence of Staphylococcus aureus decolonization after mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine: Implications for patients requiring multiple or delayed procedures [^116288X5]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2012). Low credibility.

Preoperative screening and decolonization of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively) are advocated to reduce surgical site infections. This study determined the rate and duration of decolonization in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery. Patients attending the preoperative testing program (PAT) had their anterior nares cultured for MRSA and MSSA. All patients received treatment with intranasal mupirocin and a topical chlorhexidine solution. A cohort of patients returned to PAT before a subsequent elective procedure and were recultured. All culture results and time between PAT visits were recorded, and the rates of successful initial and persistent decolonization were determined.

Six hundred ten patients visited PAT 1290 times. Notably, 94 (70.1%) of 134 patients with initially MRSA- or MSSA-positive cultures remained decolonized at a mean time of 156 days (SD = 140), whereas 40 patients (29.9%) were not decolonized by the time of repeat testing at a mean time of 213 days (SD = 187). At repeat testing, 2 patients were newly MRSA-positive and 35 were newly MSSA-positive. Staphylococcus aureus decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and topical chlorhexidine was effective but not persistent in a significant proportion of patients. A small number of previously uncolonized patients became colonized. Therefore, Staphylococcus aureus screening and decolonization protocols must be repeated before any readmission, regardless of prior colonization status.

### Intranasal mupirocin to prevent postoperative Staphylococcus aureus infections [^115iuBGL]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). High credibility.

Patients with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus have an increased risk of surgical-site infections caused by that organism. Treatment with mupirocin ointment can reduce the rate of nasal carriage and may prevent postoperative S. aureus infections.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether intranasal treatment with mupirocin reduces the rate of S. aureus infections at surgical sites and prevents other nosocomial infections.

- **Results**: Of 4030 enrolled patients who underwent general, gynecologic, neurologic, or cardiothoracic surgery, 3864 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, 2.3 percent of mupirocin recipients and 2.4 percent of placebo recipients had S. aureus infections at surgical sites. Of the 891 patients (23.1 percent of the 3864 who completed the study) who had S. aureus in their anterior nares, 444 received mupirocin and 447 received placebo. Among the patients with nasal carriage of S. aureus, 4.0 percent of those who received mupirocin had nosocomial S. aureus infections, compared with 7.7 percent of those who received placebo (odds ratio for infection, 0.49; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.92; P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic intranasal application of mupirocin did not significantly reduce the rate of S. aureus surgical-site infections overall, but it did significantly decrease the rate of all nosocomial S. aureus infections among the patients who were S. aureus carriers.

### Successful control of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreak in a burn intensive care unit by addition of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin to basic infection prevention measures [^112oEPDw]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). High credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is frequently implicated in health care-associated outbreaks in burn intensive care units, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality to these high-risk patients and imposing excess costs on health care systems.

- **Methods**: MRSA health care-associated infections (HAIs) were noted before and after the implementation of basic infection prevention measures and the subsequent implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the relatedness of clinical isolates. A case-control study was conducted to characterize the risk factors for MRSA HAIs.

- **Results**: Basic interventions failed to decrease the rate of MRSA HAIs, although compliance with these interventions was high throughout the study. MRSA HAIs decreased from 8.53 HAIs per 1,000 patient days before the implementation of intranasal mupirocin to 3.61 HAIs per 1,000 patient days after the implementation of intranasal mupirocin (P = .033). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis disclosed 10 unique clones with no large clusters. The case-control study revealed a significant association between MRSA HAIs and lengths of stay, body surface area burned, intubation, pressor requirement, leukocytosis, lactic acidosis, development of pneumonia, MRSA colonization, and death.

- **Conclusions**: Basic environmental and behavioral interventions fell short of controlling a low-count, sporadic, and multiclonal MRSA outbreak in the burn intensive care unit of a tertiary medical center. However, the added implementation of universal decolonization with intranasal mupirocin proved effective in reducing MRSA HAIs.

### Prevention of Staphylococcus aureus burn wound colonization by nasal mupirocin [^114tjrVJ]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

There are two important routes for the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus to the burn wound. In the endogenous route, patients naturally carrying S. aureus colonize their own wounds, whereas in the exogenous route, burn wounds are cross-infected from other sources. In this study, we evaluated the effect of blocking the endogenous route on S. aureus burn wound colonization by mupirocin application in the noses of patients at the time of admission.

- **Methods**: From September 2000 to January 2002, all patients with burns admitted to a single dedicated Burn Centre received nasal mupirocin upon admission. This period was compared to two control periods (C1: July 1999 to July 2000 and C2: January 2002 to January 2003) for S. aureus burn wound colonization. The colonization risk was analyzed, adjusting for confounding factors, with Cox proportional hazard regression.

- **Results**: A total of 98 patients did not have S. aureus burn wound colonization at the time of admission and were thus considered at risk for S. aureus acquisition during their stay. As compared to C1, the relative risk of acquiring S. aureus in their wound was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.24–0.97) in the mupirocin period and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.28–1.1) during the C2 period. S. aureus nasal/pharyngeal colonization was a significant independent risk factor for wound colonization (RR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2–4.2).

- **Conclusion**: Nasal mupirocin may contribute to reducing the risk of S. aureus wound colonization in patients with burns.

### Effect of intranasal mupirocin prophylaxis on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission and invasive staphylococcal infections in a neonatal intensive care unit [^115dacWK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

Use of monthly intranasal mupirocin was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission and Staphylococcus aureus invasive infection in a large neonatal intensive care unit. Resistance to mupirocin emerged over time, but it was rare and was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

### Treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis exacerbations due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with mupirocin irrigations [^115wfY9Z]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) exacerbations due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are routinely encountered. Treatment often involves intravenous antibiotics that provide only transient benefits. Mupirocin has well-recognized antistaphylococcal activity, and its nasal formulation is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the eradication of nasal colonization with MRSA.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to describe the use of mupirocin nasal irrigations for the treatment of CRS exacerbations due to MRSA.

- **Materials and methods**: Charts of patients who received mupirocin nasal irrigations for MRSA exacerbations of CRS between January 2000 and October 2003 were reviewed.

- **Results**: Forty-two MRSA-positive cultures were obtained from 24 patients (mean age, 61 years; range, 38–82 years; 15 women and 6 men). Twenty-eight episodes were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations and doxycycline; 4 were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 7 episodes were treated with mupirocin nasal irrigations alone. Patients were reevaluated at approximately 4 to 6 weeks. Repeat cultures were not obtained in 12 patients (because of clinical and endoscopic resolution). Adequate follow-up was unavailable for 3 patients, and of the 27 repeat cultures, only 1 grew MRSA. Twelve patients had at least one recurrence, with a mean number of episodes of 1.75 (range, 1–8 episodes). The mean follow-up was 11.8 months (range, 3–27 months).

- **Conclusions**: Mupirocin nasal irrigations may avoid the need for intravenous antibiotics.

### Mupirocin [^111h1fVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in two clinical trials.

- **Clinical studies**: In the first trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or a vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for the vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for the vehicle placebo. In the second trial, subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment three times daily or 30 mg per kg to 40 mg per kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day. This was an unblinded trial conducted over 8 days, with a follow-up visit one week after the treatment ended. The clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups.

- **Pediatrics**: There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. The clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for the vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial, all subjects were pediatric except two adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years.

### Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and prophylaxis for infection with topical intranasal mupirocin: An evidence-based review [^111Xuzk9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Most Staphylococcus aureus infections are endogenously acquired, and treatment of nasal carriage is one potential strategy for prevention. We critically appraised the published evidence regarding the efficacy of intranasal mupirocin for eradication of S. aureus nasal carriage and for prophylaxis of infection. Sixteen randomized, controlled trials were appraised; nine trials assessed eradication of colonization as a primary outcome measure, and seven assessed the reduction in the rate of infection. Mupirocin was generally highly effective for eradication of nasal carriage in the short term.

- **Prophylactic treatment**: In large trials, intranasal mupirocin treatment of patients did not lead to a significant reduction in the overall rate of infections. However, subgroup analyses and several small studies revealed lower rates of S. aureus infection among selected populations of patients with nasal carriage treated with mupirocin. Although mupirocin is effective at reducing nasal carriage, routine use of topical intranasal mupirocin for infection prophylaxis is not supported by the currently available evidence.

### Mupirocin and chlorhexidine genotypic resistance found in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from young infants below 90 days old: A genetic basis for eradication failure [^116YXn88]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the genetic characteristics associated with eradication failure of Staphylococcus aureus in infants below 90 days old, S. aureus was isolated from clinical specimen cultures (blood, surgical tissue, or drainage, pus, etc) and routine screening cultures in the neonatal intensive care unit (nasal and axillary skin swab) from patients below 90 days old. These samples were collected prospectively for one year, from August 2017 to July 2018. The isolates underwent typing and screening for genes associated with chlorhexidine (qacA/B), quaternary ammonium (smr), and mupirocin resistance (iles mutation, mupA, mupB), as well as Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin.

During the study period, 40 nonduplicate isolates were included for analysis, of which 70.0% were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Mupirocin resistance was found in 25% of the total isolates, 17.4% of the colonizers, and 35.3% of the pathogens (P = 0.196). The chlorhexidine resistance gene was found in three MRSA isolates colonized in the nares of preterm infants. All isolates harbored the disinfectant quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance gene. The PVL toxin gene was present in 57.5% of the isolates, with a similar prevalence among colonizers and pathogens (69.6% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.072).

Mupirocin, chlorhexidine, and QAC-resistant MRSAs harboring the PVL toxin gene were found in the nasal carriages of preterm infants. In this highly vulnerable patient population, one-fourth of the isolates harbored mupirocin-resistant genes, and all were resistant to QAC disinfectants.

### Mupirocin [^114bE2VY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lactation - Risk summary**: It is not known whether mupirocin is present in human milk, has effects on the breastfed child, or has effects on milk production. However, breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to the drug due to the minimal systemic absorption of mupirocin in humans following topical administration of mupirocin ointment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for mupirocin ointment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from mupirocin ointment or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Clinical considerations**: To minimize oral exposure of the drug to children, a breast and/or nipple being treated with mupirocin ointment should be thoroughly washed prior to breastfeeding.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of mupirocin ointment have been established in the age range of 2 months to 16 years. Use of mupirocin ointment in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of mupirocin ointment in impetigo in pediatric subjects studied as a part of the pivotal clinical trials in adults [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Topical mupirocin for eradication of MRSA colonization with mupirocin-resistant strains [^11234n6w]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Topical mupirocin was able to interrupt colonization in 52% and 68% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-colonized patients carrying mupirocin-resistant and -sensitive strains, respectively. This includes 44.4% and 85.7% of those colonized only in the nares. Although there was a trend toward decreased effectiveness in clearing mupirocin-resistant MRSA, this agent can decolonize many patients with resistant strains.

### Bacterial infections in neonates following mupirocin-based MRSA decolonization: A multicenter cohort study [^114p5R2h]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the risk of infection after MRSA decolonization with intranasal mupirocin. It was designed as a multicenter, retrospective cohort study set in tertiary care neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from three urban hospitals in the United States, ranging in size from 45 to 100 beds. MRSA-colonized neonates were identified from NICU admissions occurring from January 2007 to December 2014, during which a targeted decolonization strategy was used for MRSA control.

In two time-to-event analyses, MRSA-colonized neonates were observed from the date of the first MRSA-positive surveillance screen until:

1. **The first occurrence of novel gram-positive cocci in sterile culture or discharge**.

2. **The first occurrence of novel gram-negative bacilli in sterile culture or discharge**.

Mupirocin exposure was treated as time-varying. Results indicated that a total of 522 MRSA-colonized neonates were identified from 16,144 neonates admitted to site NICUs. Of the MRSA-colonized neonates, 384 (74%) received mupirocin. The average time from positive culture to mupirocin treatment was 3.5 days (standard deviation, 7.2 days).

The adjusted hazard of gram-positive cocci infection was 64% lower among mupirocin-exposed versus mupirocin-unexposed neonates (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.76), whereas the adjusted hazard ratio of gram-negative bacilli infection comparing mupirocin-exposed and -unexposed neonates was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.42–2.62).

In conclusion, in this multicentered cohort of MRSA-colonized neonates, mupirocin-based decolonization treatment appeared to decrease the risk of infection for gram-positive cocci, although similar results were not observed for gram-negative bacilli.

### Randomized controlled trial of chlorhexidine gluconate for washing, intranasal mupirocin, and rifampin and doxycycline versus no treatment for the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization [^113kMetC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage may reduce the risk of MRSA infection and prevent transmission of the organism to other patients.

- **Methods**: To determine the efficacy of decolonization therapy, patients colonized with MRSA were randomized (3:1 allocation) to receive treatment (2% chlorhexidine gluconate washes and 2% mupirocin ointment intranasally, with oral rifampin and doxycycline for 7 days), or no treatment. Follow-up samples for MRSA culture were obtained from the nares, perineum, skin lesions, and catheter exit sites monthly for up to 8 months. The primary outcome measure was detection of MRSA at 3 months of follow-up. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to identify variables associated with treatment failure.

- **Results**: Of 146 patients enrolled in the study, 112 patients (87 treated; 25 not treated) were followed up for at least 3 months. At 3 months of follow-up, 64 (74%) of those treated had culture results negative for MRSA, compared with 8 (32%) of those not treated (P = .0001). This difference remained significant at 8 months of follow-up, at which time, 54% of those treated had culture results negative for MRSA (chi2 = 64.4; p < 0.0001, by log-rank test). The results of the multivariable analysis indicated that having a mupirocin-resistant isolate at baseline was associated with treatment failure (relative risk, 9.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.8–31.9; p = 0.0003), whereas decolonization therapy was protective (relative risk, 0.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.4; p = 0.0002).

- **Patient use and application**: Advise the patient to administer mupirocin ointment as follows: use mupirocin ointment only as directed by the healthcare provider. It is for external use only. Avoid contact of mupirocin ointment with the eyes; if mupirocin ointment gets in the eyes, rinse thoroughly with water. Do not use mupirocin ointment in the nose.

- **Application instructions**: Wash your hands before and after applying mupirocin ointment. Use a gauze pad or cotton swab to apply a small amount of mupirocin ointment to the affected area. The treated area may be covered by a gauze dressing if desired.

- **Adverse reactions**: Report to the healthcare provider any signs of local adverse reactions. Mupirocin ointment should be stopped and the healthcare provider contacted if irritation, severe itching, or rash occurs. Report to the healthcare provider or go to the nearest emergency room if severe allergic reactions such as swelling of the lips, face, or tongue, or wheezing occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Follow-up**: If impetigo has not improved in 3 to 5 days, contact the healthcare provider.

### The effect of total household decolonization on clearance of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^1171M3Td]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of total household decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine gluconate body wash on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection among subjects with MRSA skin and soft-tissue infection. The study was conducted as a three-arm nonmasked randomized controlled trial in five academic medical centers in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Participants included adults and children presenting to ambulatory care settings with community-onset MRSA skin and soft-tissue infection (i.e. index cases) and their household members.

The intervention involved randomizing enrolled households into one of three groups:

- **Education on routine hygiene measures**: This group received information on hygiene without any additional intervention.
- **Education plus decolonization without reminders**: This group received intranasal mupirocin ointment twice daily for 7 days and chlorhexidine gluconate on the first and last day without receiving any reminders.
- **Education plus decolonization with reminders**: Participants in this group received the same treatment as the second group but with daily telephone call or text message reminders.

The main outcome measures focused on the time to clearance of colonization in the index case, due to a small number of reinfections. Among the 223 households, 73 were randomized to education-only, 76 to decolonization without reminders, and 74 to decolonization with reminders. The results showed no significant difference in time to clearance of colonization between the education-only and decolonization groups (log-rank P = .768). However, secondary analyses indicated that compliance with decolonization was associated with decreased time to clearance (P = .018). In conclusion, total household decolonization did not result in decreased time to clearance of colonization.

### Retapamulin activity against pediatric strains of mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114e23VP]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Retapamulin activity against 53 isolates obtained from a mupirocin-resistant, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pediatric disease cluster was evaluated using broth microdilution. All strains were susceptible to retapamulin, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ≤ 0.5 μg/mL. DNA sequence analysis of rplC and cfr identified one rplC strain variant that did not demonstrate reduced phenotypic susceptibility to retapamulin. These results demonstrate that retapamulin may be a useful alternative therapy for mupirocin-resistant, community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, especially in disease clusters.

### Controlling the usage of intranasal mupirocin does impact the rate of Staphylococcus aureus deep sternal wound infections in cardiac surgery patients [^112nhKDx]. American Journal of Infection Control (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) is the major cause of surgical site infections (SSIs). At The Christ Hospital, Cincinnati, OH, S aureus accounted for over 80% of sternal wound infections in cardiac surgery patients. Approximately 700 cardiac surgeries are performed each year, with an associated infection rate of 1.8% per 100 procedures performed. In an attempt to reduce S aureus sternal wound infections, the use of prophylactic intranasal mupirocin was examined.

- **Methods**: Each patient undergoing cardiac surgery was nasally cultured before entering the operating room, then intranasal mupirocin was applied and continued every 12 hours. Culture results were finalized within 48 hours. Mupirocin was discontinued when the culture returned negative and continued for 7 days when the culture returned positive for S aureus.

- **Results**: Cultures showed a S aureus carrier rate of 21%. These patients received mupirocin for 7 days. A decrease in S aureus-associated SSI rates was observed from a case rate of 1.68% to 0.37% per 100 procedures over a 17-month period.

- **Conclusion**: Identifying and treating S aureus carriers with a full course of mupirocin does impact the rate of S aureus surgical site infections.
