## Question

Can pericarditis cause exudative pleural effusions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pericarditis can cause exudative pleural effusions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pericarditis and how it might extend to the pleura. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence linking pericarditis to pleural effusions and characterize their biochemical profile. Next, I will review mechanistic pathways that plausibly explain exudative fluid formation. After that, I should consider important mimics and confounders that could masquerade as pericarditis-related effusions. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically actionable conclusion and outline diagnostic implications and exceptions to watch for.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, typically with increased vascular permeability and cytokine-driven exudation; this inflammatory milieu can spill over to adjacent pleural surfaces via direct contiguity and shared lymphatics, making pleural involvement biologically plausible in active serositis [^1178k8TV] [^113L5T9M].

> Wait, let me verify the direct clinical evidence before drawing conclusions. In acute idiopathic pericarditis, pleural effusions are frequent, predominantly left-sided, and critically, about 99% meet Light's criteria for exudates with a lymphocyte-predominant profile in most cases, which strongly supports a causal inflammatory mechanism rather than passive transudation [^113rcnga]. I should also confirm that expert guidance recognizes pleural effusion as part of the inflammatory phenotype of pericarditis, which it does in contemporary ACC consensus statements describing effusions in the inflammatory presentation of pericarditis [^113kqH3S].

> Hold on, I should review related syndromes to ensure consistency. Post–cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS) regularly features concomitant pericardial and pleural effusions, and when thoracentesis is performed, the pleural fluid is exudative, aligning with an immune-mediated serositis model after myocardial or pericardial injury; case series consistently show exudative pleural effusions in PCIS presentations [^111V9voX] [^1111uehj]. Let me also consider systemic inflammatory diseases: lupus serositis commonly manifests with pleuritis and pericarditis, and case reports document large exudative pleural effusions alongside pericardial effusions in SLE, reinforcing the serosal inflammatory link [^1146mYDi] [^112oG86C].

> I will now examine the mechanistic basis for exudative characteristics. Inflammatory pericarditis increases local and systemic cytokines and permeability mediators such as VEGF, which can drive exudation into the pleural space; this helps explain why these effusions are protein-rich and often lymphocytic rather than transudative from hemodynamics alone [^113ff1WE]. But wait, what if the effusion is transudative — does that negate pericarditis? No, it just means I should double-check for concurrent systemic drivers like heart failure or hypoalbuminemia, because mixed etiologies are common and do not exclude pericarditis as a contributor [^115qgTr2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should not jump to conclusions without addressing mimics and confounders. Unilateral right-sided, massive, or frankly transudative effusions should prompt reconsideration of alternative diagnoses such as malignancy, pulmonary embolism, or cirrhosis-related effusions, even if pericarditis is present; guidelines emphasize interpreting pleural effusions in clinical context and recognizing that multiple concurrent causes are not rare [^113rcnga] [^115qgTr2]. I need to ensure that when pleural fluid is obtained, Light's criteria and adjunct tests are applied correctly to classify exudates, acknowledging occasional misclassification and the need for integrated clinical-imaging-laboratory correlation [^116mtozu].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the core answer. Yes, pericarditis can cause exudative pleural effusions, most convincingly in acute idiopathic pericarditis where nearly all associated pleural effusions are exudative and lymphocyte-predominant, and this pattern is echoed in PCIS and systemic inflammatory serositis. The mechanism is direct extension of inflammation and shared lymphatic pathways with cytokine-mediated permeability changes [^113rcnga] [^111V9voX] [^1146mYDi] [^113ff1WE]. I should confirm the diagnostic implications: when pleural effusion accompanies pericarditis, an exudative profile supports an inflammatory serositis and aligns with anti-inflammatory therapy; however, I need to check for alternative or additional causes if the effusion is atypical in size, side, or biochemistry, and use thoracentesis with appropriate studies to clarify etiology when indicated [^113g8rWT] [^113rcnga].

Pericarditis can cause **exudative pleural effusions** through direct pleural inflammation and increased capillary permeability [^113rcnga], most often in viral, tuberculous, or autoimmune etiologies [^notfound]. Pleural effusions in pericarditis are typically exudative, lymphocyte-predominant, and may be unilateral or bilateral, with a left-sided predominance in idiopathic cases [^113rcnga]. Diagnosis relies on clinical context, imaging, and pleural fluid analysis using Light's criteria [^116mtozu]; management targets the underlying pericarditis with anti-inflammatory therapy and drainage for large or symptomatic effusions [^113rcnga] [^111PpzHp].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking pericarditis to exudative pleural effusions

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain how pericarditis leads to exudative pleural effusions:

- **Direct pleural inflammation**: Inflammatory mediators from the pericardium can spread to adjacent pleural surfaces, increasing capillary permeability and causing exudative fluid accumulation [^113rcnga].

- **Lymphatic obstruction**: Pericardial inflammation may impair lymphatic drainage from the pleural space, promoting exudative effusions [^notfound].

- **Immune-mediated serositis**: Autoimmune or immune-mediated pericarditis (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis) can cause diffuse serosal inflammation, including the pleura, leading to exudative effusions [^1146mYDi].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting exudative pleural effusions in pericarditis

Multiple studies and case reports document **exudative pleural effusions** in pericarditis:

- **Acute idiopathic pericarditis**: Pleural effusions are common, typically exudative, lymphocyte-predominant, and often left-sided or larger on the left when bilateral [^113rcnga].

- **Post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS)**: Pleural effusions are frequent, often exudative, and can be bloody; they typically occur weeks to months after cardiac injury or surgery [^113rcnga] [^111V9voX].

- **Tuberculous pericarditis**: Frequently associated with exudative pleural effusions due to granulomatous inflammation and increased vascular permeability [^notfound].

- **Autoimmune pericarditis**: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis can cause exudative pleural effusions via immune-mediated serositis [^1146mYDi] [^116VhVvQ] [^115eChPD].

## Characteristics of pleural effusions in pericarditis

Pleural effusions associated with pericarditis typically exhibit the following **characteristics**:

| **Characteristic** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Fluid type | Exudative (high protein, high LDH) [^113rcnga] |
| Cell count | Lymphocyte-predominant [^113rcnga] |
| Laterality | - Left-sided predominance in idiopathic cases <br/> - Bilateral effusions common in systemic or severe disease [^113rcnga] |
| Volume | - Small to moderate <br/> - Occasionally large in severe or chronic cases [^113rcnga] |
| Hemorrhagic effusion | Occasional, especially in PCIS or malignant pericarditis [^113rcnga] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods for differentiating exudative pleural effusions

Accurate differentiation of exudative from transudative effusions is essential. Light's criteria remain the standard, with high sensitivity but limited specificity [^113QDHTh]:

- **Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5**: Indicates exudate.

- **Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6**: Indicates exudate.

- **Pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 upper limit of normal serum LDH**: Indicates exudate.

Additional tests — such as pleural fluid cholesterol, ADA, and cytology — may help refine the diagnosis, particularly in suspected malignant or tuberculous effusions [^113g8rWT].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Exudative pleural effusions in pericarditis have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Dyspnea, cough, and pleuritic chest pain are common and may require therapeutic thoracentesis [^114p8g5q].

- **Diagnostic challenge**: Exudative effusions necessitate thorough evaluation to exclude malignancy, infection, or other systemic diseases [^111LfgdA].

- **Management**: Treat underlying pericarditis with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids; perform therapeutic thoracentesis for large or symptomatic effusions [^111PpzHp] [^113rcnga].

---

## Prognostic significance of exudative pleural effusions in pericarditis

Exudative pleural effusions in pericarditis carry **prognostic significance**:

- **Severity marker**: Presence of pleural effusions may indicate more severe or chronic pericarditis [^notfound].

- **Recurrence risk**: Higher recurrence rates are observed in patients with pleural effusions, particularly in autoimmune or idiopathic pericarditis [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Increased risk of constrictive pericarditis, especially in tuberculous or chronic inflammatory cases [^113H9Eez].

---

Pericarditis can cause **exudative pleural effusions** through direct pleural inflammation, lymphatic obstruction, and immune-mediated serositis. These effusions are typically exudative, lymphocyte-predominant, and often left-sided, requiring careful diagnostic evaluation and targeted management of the underlying pericarditis [^113rcnga].

### Association between parapneumonic effusion and pericardial effusion in a pediatric cohort… [^114EMCjP]. publications.aap.org (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Associations between pleural and pericardial effusions have been described in malignancy and autoimmune disorders. Bacterial pneumonia is the most frequent cause of parapneumonic effusion; however, knowledge of the relationship between parapneumonic effusion and the presence of pericardial fluid in children is limited. We examined this relationship. METHODS. We performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who were admitted to our institution during a 6-year period with a diagnosis of either parapneumonic effusion or empyema and who had undergone an echocardiogram, a computed tomography scan of the thorax, or both. All demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data of these patients were collected, and statistical analysis was done with Student's. t tests and χ 2 analyses. RESULTS. We reviewed the charts of 59 children with parapneumonic effusions. Forty-eight underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography, chest computed tomography scan, or both.

Of these 48 patients, 54. 2% were found to have a concomitant pericardial effusion. The majority of patients with pericardial effusions had left-sided pleural disease. Patients with pericardial effusions had more symptomatic days before hospitalization, lower pleural fluid albumin levels, elevated serum white blood cell counts, elevated pleural fluid white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts, and an increased incidence of surgical intervention. One patient had evidence of hemodynamic compromise that required pericardiocentesis. CONCLUSIONS. We found a high incidence of pericardial effusions in pediatric patients with parapneumonic effusions. Leukocytosis, higher pleural fluid leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and a propensity for surgical intervention suggest a prognostic relationship between pericardial effusions and more severe parapneumonic disease. The majority of these pericardial collections resolve with treatment of the underlying pleural disease. Comments.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111eW1qd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis in children — adjunctive corticosteroids are discussed with caution: In children with certain forms of extrapulmonary TB disease, particularly TBM and TB-related pleural or pericardial effusions, the inflammatory response to disease can cause severe deleterious clinical consequences. Corticosteroids reduce the exuberance of the inflammatory response but may also diminish the immune response to disease. Evidence strongly suggests that adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids reduces mortality and disabling neurologic deficits in patients with TBM; one systematic review has suggested that corticosteroids may reduce mortality in any form of TB, but additional evidence is needed. While a mortality benefit has not been clearly demonstrated for other forms of TB disease, adjunctive corticosteroids have been shown to reduce constrictive pericarditis in patients with TB pericarditis and are associated with more rapid symptom resolution in TB pleural effusion. There are limited data on the use of corticosteroids in children, and these recommendations are largely based on studies involving adults.

Regarding specific circumstances for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to patients with neoplastic pericardial effusion, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing pericardiocentesis in patients with moderate to large pericardial effusion to establish the diagnosis of malignant pericardial effusion when the diagnosis cannot be reached by multimodality imaging.

### COVID-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: a case report [^114BGuUy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in two waves across diverse populations throughout the world, the long-term impact of this viral infection on the heart is yet to be fully understood. By examining the features of previous cases as well as newly reported cases, clinicians may better understand the various manifestations of COVID-19 infection, as it pertains to myopericarditis. This case report adds to the short list of similar cardiac complications experienced by others. Two publications, for example, reported on a review of COVID-19-related cardiac disease in general and commented on some cases of myopericarditis in men under 50 years of age. Another publication highlighted the case of an 80-year-old man with constrictive pericarditis who presented with shortness of breath, peripheral edema, weight loss, and skin rash. However, this case is the first known patient to require a pericardiectomy. COVID-19-related constrictive pericarditis was diagnosed by the need for a VATS procedure in which the pleural effusion was drained and a partial anterior pericardiectomy was performed. Pathology of the specimen revealed an autoimmune or immunoglobulin etiology. These manuscripts postulate an immunologic process as the mechanism by which the inflammatory pathways of the host result in clinical and histologic findings within the pericardium and elsewhere. Therefore, treatments were a combination of medical and surgical interventions.

### Breaking hearts and taking names: a case of sarcoidosis related effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^1159cMqx]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pericardial involvement of sarcoidosis is a rare cause for acute heart failure, and usually occurs as a result of the development of a pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade. Even rarer still, is the manifestation of constrictive pericarditis. We report a case of sarcoidosis with lung, pleural, and pericardial involvement with effusive-constrictive pericarditis leading to cardiac tamponade.

Case Presentation

A 34-year-old Caucasian man presented for evaluation of a history of worsening exertional dyspnea, edema, and weight loss. A high-resolution chest computed tomography showed diffuse pulmonary nodules with upper lobe predominance and in a perilymphatic distribution; large right pleural effusion; and large pericardial effusion with pericardial thickening. A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated early tamponade physiology for which a pericardial drain was placed. After removal of the drain he developed cardiogenic shock from cardiac tamponade attributed to the reaccumulation of a pericardial effusion and urgent pericardial window was performed. Serial echocardiography was concerning for organization and localization of the pericardial fluid. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a significant reduction in pericardial slippage between the parietal and visceral layers around the heart collectively suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Confirmation of effusive-constrictive pericarditis was noted on right heart catheterization. He then underwent pericardiectomy, which on histopathologic evaluation demonstrated non-necrotizing granulomas, thus confirming pericardial involvement of sarcoidosis.

Conclusions

We report a case demonstrating unique manifestations of sarcoidosis; effusive-constrictive pericarditis presenting with acute congestive heart failure.

### Uremic pleuritis: a case report and review of recurrent exudative pleural effusions in children [^117MpFwP]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite similar mechanisms driving pleural fluid accumulation, the causes of pleural effusions in children differ significantly from that of adults. When a pleural effusion re-occurs in an adult, literature recommends early thoracentesis, and consideration for pleuroscopy with biopsy to guide the diagnostic evaluation. In children, there is a paucity of literature for guiding management of recurrent exudative pleural effusion. We present an unusual pediatric case of uremic pleuritis with recurrent pericardial and exudative pleural effusions.

### Pneumonia and purulent pericarditis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae: an uncommon association in the antibiotic era [^112SpMsf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial pericarditis in children has become a rare entity in the modern antibiotic era. The most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, being Streptococcus pneumoniae an exceptional cause. We present 2 children, who were diagnosed of pneumonia complicated with a pleural effusion that developed a purulent pericarditis with signs of cardiac tamponade. One of them had received 4 doses of the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine. Systemic antibiotics and pericardial and pleural drainages were used. Pneumococcal antigens were positive in pleural and pericardial fluids in both cases, and S. pneumoniae was isolated from pleural effusion in one of them. Both children fully recovered, and none of them developed constrictive pericarditis, although 1 case presented a transient secondary left ventricular dysfunction. Routine immunization with 10- and 13-valent vaccines including a wider range of serotypes should further decrease the already low incidence.

### Pericardial effusions: causes, diagnosis, and management [^111qQ9VF]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The presentation of a patient with a pericardial effusion can range from an incidental finding to a life-threatening emergency. Accordingly, the causes of pericardial effusions are numerous and can generally be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory etiologies. For all patients with a suspected pericardial effusion, echocardiography is essential to define the location and size of an effusion. In pericardial tamponade, the hemodynamics relate to decreased pericardial compliance, ventricular interdependence, and an inspiratory decrease in the pressure gradient for left ventricular filling. Echocardiography provides insight into the pathophysiologic alterations, primarily through an assessment of chamber collapse, inferior vena cava plethora, and marked respiratory variation in mitral and tricuspid inflow. Once diagnosed, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with tamponade, preferably with echocardiographic guidance. With a large effusion but no tamponade, pericardiocentesis is rarely needed for diagnostic purposes, though is performed if there is concern for a bacterial infection. In patients with malignancy, pericardial window is preferred given the risk for recurrence. Finally, large effusions can progress to tamponade, but can generally be followed closely until the extent of the effusion facilitates safe pericardiocentesis.

### Pathophysiology of the pericardium [^113L5T9M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Pericardial heart disease includes pericarditis, (an acute, subacute, or chronic fibrinous, noneffusive, or exudative process), and its complications, constriction, (an acute, subacute, or chronic adhesive or fibrocalcific response), and cardiac tamponade. The pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis readily explains their respective findings on clinical examination, Doppler echocardiography, and at cardiac catheterization. The primary abnormality of cardiac tamponade is pan-cyclic compression of the cardiac chambers by increased pericardial fluid requiring that cardiac chambers compete for a fixed intrapericardial volume. Features responsible for the pathophysiology include transmission of thoracic pressure through the pericardium and heightened ventricular interdependence. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium limits diastolic filling and causes dissociation of intracardiac and intrathoracic pressures, and heightened ventricular interdependence. Both conditions result in diastolic dysfunction, elevated and equal venous and ventricular diastolic pressure, respiratory variation in ventricular filling, and ultimately, reduced cardiac output.

The role of inflammation in pericardial disease — pericarditis is characterized by a severe inflammatory response to injury of mesothelial cells triggered by viral infections, cardiac surgery or procedures, or immune derangements; etiologies including infectious, autoimmune, or mechanical injury promote transcription and translation of proinflammatory genes and inflammasome components, leading to caspase‑1 activation and maturation of interleukin‑1β and other cytokines; derangements in innate and adaptive immunity contribute to disparate clinical phenotypes, significant patient‑level variability, and dysregulated immunity is often implicated in recurrent and chronic cases where identifying these derangements can refine targeted immunosuppressive therapies.

### Delayed diagnosis of postcardiac injury syndrome [^111V9voX]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

The diagnosis of PCIS can be made using an integrated approach based on the clinical course and the results of physical examination, laboratory data and imaging studies, and by the exclusion of other possible aetiologies. There are no standardised criteria for the diagnosis of PCIS. The delayed diagnosis in our case was due to the prolonged interval between the causative surgical procedure and onset of symptoms, and the atypical presentation. However, step-by-step exclusion of other disease entities finally led to the correct diagnosis. In the diagnostic approach to PCIS, its latency in onset, symptoms (including oedema), laboratory data and pathological findings are of interest. Hence, we reviewed several cases to collect these data.

A PubMed search using the key words 'post-cardiac injury syndrome', 'post-pericardiotomy syndrome', 'post-myocardial infarction syndrome' and 'post-traumatic pericarditis' identified 13 cases written in English with our required clinical data. The interval between surgery and the onset of symptoms (or hospital admission) ranged from 16 hours to 3 months in these case reports. In our case, this interval was about 9 months. Among the 13 previous cases, 10 cases had fever,1 did not, and 2 did not mention about fever. Out of the 13 cases, 10 cases had elevated CRP,1 did not, and 2 was not described about CRP. Among 13 cases, eight caseshad elevated ESR, with ESR data being unavailable in the remaining five cases. In our case, both CRP and ESR were not elevated. An examination of the pleural fluid showed that the effusion was exudative in all six cases in which thoracocentesis was performed. In the other seven cases, there was either no description about thoracocentesis or it was not performed. Our case also showed exudative pleural effusion. None of the previous cases experienced systemic oedema, unlike our case. Only four of the 13 cases underwent pathology examinations, all of which revealed non-specific inflammation. This suggests that pathological evaluation is inconclusive in diagnosing PCIS.

Pericardial effusion — definition, causes, imaging goals, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) size grading: Pericardial effusion is defined by the accumulation of > 50 mL of fluid in the pericardial space. Approximately one-half of pericardial effusions are idiopathic; in North America and Western Europe, postviral infection is the most common identifiable cause, whereas tuberculosis is the most common cause in places where it is endemic. The objectives of imaging pericardial effusions are to support diagnosis, evaluate the size and location of the effusion, assess its hemodynamic impact, and inform decisions regarding drainage, if indicated, and TTE is the first-line imaging investigation. Echocardiographic size categories are: trivial (< 1.0 cm and not visualized throughout cardiac cycle), small (< 1.0 cm), moderate (1.0–1.9 cm), large (2.0–2.5 cm), and very large (> 2.5 cm). Common mimickers on echocardiography include a left pleural effusion and an epicardial fat pad that has a heterogenous echodensity, moves with the myocardium, and is often located anterior to the right ventricle.

### Transitory effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^111Ln676]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion of various sizes is a quite common clinical finding, while its progression to effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs in about 1.4–14% of cases. Although available evidence on prevalence and prognosis of this rare pericardial syndrome is poor, apparently a considerable proportion of patients conservatively managed has a spontaneous resolution after several weeks. A 61-year-old female presented to our emergency department reporting fatigue, effort dyspnea and abdominal swelling. The echocardiography showed large pericardial effusion with initial hemodynamic impact, so she underwent a pericardiocentesis with drainage of 800–850cm 3 of exudative fluid, on which diagnostic investigations were undertaken: possible viral and bacterial infections, medical conditions, iatrogenic causes, neoplastic and connective tissue diseases were all excluded. Despite empirical therapy with NSAIDs and colchicine, after about one week she had a recurrence of pericardial effusion and progressive development of constriction. Echocardiography performed after a few weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy showed resolution of constriction and PE, with clinical improvement. If progression of pericardial syndromes to a constrictive form is rarely described in literature, cases of transitory effusive-constrictive phase are even more uncommon, mainly reported during the evolution of pericardial effusion. According to the available data, risk of progression to a constrictive form is very low in case of idiopathic pericardial effusion. We report a case of large idiopathic subacute pericardial effusion, treated with pericardiocentesis and then evolved into an effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A prolonged anti-inflammatory treatment leads to complete resolution of pericardial syndrome without necessity of pericardiectomy.

Pericarditis — clinical diagnostic evaluation and multimodality imaging define diagnostic likelihood and imaging roles. "Pleuritic chest pain or equivalent suggestive presentation" plus "Plus ≥ 1 additional finding (0 = unlikely, 1 = possible, and 2+ = definite diagnosis)" establishes diagnostic categorization; additional findings include "Pericardial friction rub", "ECG changes (diffuse ST-elevation, PR-depression)", "Inflammatory biomarkers elevation (CRP, ESR)", "Cardiac imaging evidence of new or worsening pericardial effusion (echo preferred, CMR, CCT)", and "Cardiac imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation (CMR preferred, CCT)". Imaging roles are specified as "Echo: assess pericardial effusion and constrictive physiology", "CMR (if indicated): assess and grade pericardial thickness, inflammation, effusion and constrictive physiology", and "CCT (if indicated): assess pericardial thickness, calcification, constrictive physiology, pre-operative planning", with abbreviations defined (e.g., electrocardiogram [ECG], C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR], cardiac computed tomography [CCT], echocardiography [echo]).

Table 1
Etiology of Pericardial Effusion

The underlying malignancies are specified in Table 2. The most common malignancies were lung (52.9%), breast (17.6%), pleural mesothelioma (5.9%), ovarian (5.9%), and esophageal (2.9%). The most frequent lung tumor was adenocarcinoma (30 cases). There were no cases of squamous cell lung carcinoma. Eighty patients (29.7%) had a known malignancy before pericardiocentesis, and 64 of those already had known (extrapericardial) metastases. In 24 patients (8.9%), the pericardial effusion was the first presentation of a previously undiagnosed malignancy (12.7% of patients without previously known cancer). In addition, a positive pericardial cytology was the first metastatic site of a known malignancy in 10 patients, constituting 12.5% (10/80) of all patients with known cancer or 62.5% (10/16) of patients with a known but nonmetastasized malignancy. A substantial proportion of pericardiocentesis patients without a final definite explanation for their effusion (ie, the idiopathic patients) had underlying diseases, often a malignancy. In the idiopathic group, 25 of 71 patients (35.2%) had a known malignancy with extrapericardial metastasis and 6 of 71 (8.5%) had known malignancy without known metastasis; none had detectable atypical or malignant cells on cytology of the pericardial fluid (Table 3). Among the remaining idiopathic patients, 32 (45%) did not have any other diagnosis.

Table 3
Characteristics of the "Idiopathic" Group

The most frequent iatrogenic causes leading to a percutaneous pericardiocentesis were cardiothoracic surgery (7.4%), pacemaker or implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator placement (4.1%), and percutaneous coronary intervention (3.7%). In the infectious group, we identified only 10 cases of culture‐confirmed bacterial pericarditis, 9 cases of (assumed) viral pericarditis, and 1 case of HIV. There were no confirmed cases of fungal pericarditis. The most common bacterial pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases). In addition, there was 1 case of each of the following pathogens: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus auricularis and Mycobacterium genus.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^117ACVzX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients who have chronic cardiac failure, postoperative cardiac surgery patients, or patients who have certain infectious, benign or malignant diseases. They are often diagnosed either as incidental findings or when its related to systemic or cardiac disease. The clinical spectrum of patients with pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), and the etiology. Drainage of the PE is required for cardiac tamponade, symptomatic moderate to large pericardial effusions and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures, "Pericardial Windows", are often requested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived diagnostic benefit is that it allows for determination of malignancy or infection for patients with PEs of unclear etiology through testing of the pericardial fluid and tissue. The purpose of the study is to determine the diagnostic yield of surgical drainage procedures.

### Pathogenesis of the eosinophilic pleural effusions [^114yPkyH]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Eosinophilic pleural effusions (EPE) are defined as those that contain at least 10% eosinophils. EPEs account for 5 to 16% of exudative pleural effusions. However, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mechanisms that lead to eosinophilic pleural inflammation.

Recent Findings

Eosinophilic pleural effusions are caused by the presence of air or blood or both in the pleural space, infectious or other inflammatory diseases, malignancy, pulmonary emboli, asbestos exposure, and drug reactions. Differences in the clinical features suggest that a variety of mechanisms operate to induce eosinophilic pleural inflammation and pleural fluid accumulation. Human and animal studies indicate that interleukin (IL)-5 is an important common contributor of different pathogenetic pathways. The possible role of other cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the development of EPE is under investigation.

Summary

Understanding the pathogenesis of EPE will permit the development of novel therapies for the persistent, symptomatic, posttraumatic and idiopathic EPE. Anti-IL-5 treatment is an interesting option that requires further research.

### Abstract… [^115krujD]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is a common disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain in adults. Pathophysiology The acute inflammatory response in pericarditis can produce either serous or purulent fluid, or a dense fibrinous material. In viral pericarditis, the pericardial fluid is most commonly serous, is of low volume, and resolves spontaneously. Neoplastic, tuberculous, and purulent pericarditis may be associated with large effusions that are exudative, hemorrhagic, and leukocyte filled. 2, 11 Gradual accumulation of large fluid volumes in the pericardium, even up to 250 mL, may not result in significant clinical signs. 12 Although pericardial effusion may be absent in 60 percent of patients, large pericardial effusions may accumulate rapidly and impede diastolic filling of the right heart, resulting in cardiac tamponade and death.

1, 3, 11 Cardiac tamponade associated with acute pericardial disease is more common in patients with neoplastic, tuberculous, and purulent pericarditis than in patients with acute viral pericarditis. 11, 13 Prolonged pericarditis may result in persistent accumulation of pericardial fluid. In this case, the fluid constitutes to form a thick coating that surrounds the myocardium. The ultimate manifestation may be constrictive pericarditis. 4, 5, 15 The presence of a monophasic rub occurring with the respiratory cycle in the absence of diagnostic changes on ECG or elevated cardiac enzymes should alert physicians to the possibility of pleuritis. 3 Physical findings that suggest acute cardiac tamponade include tachypnea, tachycardia, neck vein distention, hypotension, and inspiratory fall in arterial blood pressure. Echocardiographic evidence of diastolic chamber collapse of the right atrium, right ventricle, or both serves to confirm tamponade.

10, 25 When pericardial effusion is found in the setting of clinical pericarditis, the diagnosis is confirmed. However, results of echocardiography may be normal in patients with the clinical syndrome of pericarditis. 10 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are useful if the initial work-up for pericarditis is inconclusive. 10.

### Shining a new light on pericardial fluid [^115bNovq]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In a healthy individual, there is 15–50 mL of fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the fibroelastic pericardium. The normal composition of pericardial fluid is currently ill-defined. In the USA, pericardiocentesis is performed in patients with pericardial disease approximately 1000 times per month. During pericardiocentesis fluid is almost uniformly sent for laboratory analysis per guideline recommendations to quantify general chemistry and cellular composition. To date, there is no established methodology to assess pericardial fluid composition nor are there recognised reference values for the normal constituents of pericardial fluid. Interpretation of pericardial fluid composition is commonly performed by extending the Light's criteria validated on pleural fluid analysis to pericardial fluid. The accuracy of this approach to establish if pericardial fluid is transudative or exudative is unknown.

Available data regarding the biochemical and cellular composition of physiological pericardial fluid are sparse. In a study of 30 consecutive patients without pericardial disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valvular replacement that underwent pericardial fluid analysis, mean fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 2.4 times higher and mean protein was 0.6 times lower than serum levels. LDH and protein fluid-serum ratio values of these normal specimens would be classified as exudative per the Light's criteria. A more recent study performed on 50 patients undergoing cardiac surgery without pericardial disease found that mean fluid LDH levels were 1.1 times higher and total protein in pericardial fluid was 0.5 times lower than plasma levels. All 50 samples of normal physiological pericardial fluid would be classified by the Light's criteria as exudates. These studies appear to suggest that the composition of pericardial fluid is distinct from pleural fluid and methods for classifying pleural effusions may not apply to pericardial effusions.

In Heart, Sabrina Buoro and colleagues sought to define specific reference values for pericardial fluid analysis. This study examined a final sample of 120 adult subjects undergoing elective open-heart surgery. The study population was predominantly male (68.1%) with a median age of 67 years and included those that underwent surgical revascularisation, valve repair/replacement, myomectomy and ascending aortic replacement. Subjects with active pericardial disease, heart failure, liver disease, renal disease, recent malignancy, haematological disorders, hypoproteinaemia, pregnancy and diabetes were excluded. At the time of surgery, the pericardial space was opened using an electric scalpel to minimise traumatic bleeding, and two separate 2 mL samples were obtained for analysis. Samples with evidence of haemolysis were discarded. The samples underwent biochemical analyses, automated cell count and optical microscopy.

### Extensive pericardial metastasis of angiosarcoma: diagnostic challenge in a young case with effusive constrictive pericarditis [^111cvi9n]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old healthy man developed a small pericardial effusion following a motor vehicle accident, which progressed to cardiac tamponade and bilateral pleural effusions over 2 months. Pericardiocentesis drained 1.5 L of hemorrhagic, lymphocyte-predominant exudative fluid, leading to symptomatic improvement and close outpatient follow-up for suspected postcardiac injury syndrome. However, he was readmitted 1.5 months later with recurrent effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and enlarging hepatic lesions, but without elevated inflammatory markers. Extensive analyses of various fluids, including expert-reviewed cytology and immunostaining, were inconclusive. Despite conservative management, worsening respiratory failure and persistent high chest tube output necessitated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Suspected constrictive pericarditis on transthoracic echocardiography led to the patient's transfer to our quaternary-care hospital for evaluation for pericardiectomy. However, pericardiectomy was deferred due to his unstable respiratory status. Despite intensive care, he eventually died of multiorgan failure 7 months after his initial presentation. Autopsy revealed high-grade hepatic angiosarcoma metastatic to lungs and pericardium with diffuse invasion into the myocardium. This case highlights the importance of cautious interpretation of negative cytology results in patients with recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, especially without elevated inflammatory markers. When clinical exclusion of pericardial malignancy is challenging, early multidisciplinary consideration of pericardial biopsy may be considered to enhance the diagnostic yield and guide management.

### Concurrent pericardial and pleural effusions: a double jeopardy [^117EvCjP]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

A 19-year-old man with large malignant pleural and pericardial effusions with tamponade physiology and signs of congestive heart failure presented for emergent subxiphoid pericardial window. Surgical drainage of the pericardium was complicated by a paradoxical cardiovascular collapse that failed to respond to pressors and intravenous fluids. Suspecting a pericardial perforation, a median sternotomy was performed and revealed an intact heart. The arterial pressure was promptly restored after drainage of the pleural effusion. It is proposed that, in patients presenting with tamponading pericardial and pleural effusions, drainage of the pleural effusion be given priority. The pathophysiology of low cardiac output states resulting from pericardial and large pleural effusion is discussed and the literature reviewed.

### A case of meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion [^114KSHS8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

High levels of serum CA-125 are suggestive of ovarian malignancy, and levels have been reported to increase in Meigs' syndrome. This antigen is produced by many clinical tissues, including the epithelium of fallopian tubes, endometrium, and mesothelium of the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum. In a previous report, immunohistochemical staining for CA-125 confirmed that the serum elevation of CA-125 in a patient with Meigs' syndrome was correlated with mesothelial expression of the antigen rather than the fibroma. Therefore, careful interpretation is needed in the case of elevated serum CA-125 levels whenever serosal (peritoneum, pleura, and pericardial) fluid is present as in Meigs' syndrome.

Pericardial effusion can occur in a large variety of underlying diseases. A review of 173 consecutive patients undergoing pericardiocentesis reported that the most common cause was malignancy (33%), followed by chronic-idiopathic causes (14%). Another study revealed that the etiology of pericarditis associated with pericardial effusion was not defined in up to 30% of patients, despite the progression of diagnostic techniques such as pericardioscopy and immunohistochemistry. The common ECG findings in patients with a large volume of pericardial effusion are sinus tachycardia, low QRS voltage, and electrical alternans, which were not seen in our case at admission or before the lung surgery. Pericardial drainage is indicated for tamponade, purulent effusion, or for recurrent or large idiopathic effusions with hemodynamic compromise or suspicion of neoplastic or tuberculous causes. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening entity requiring prompt drainage of pericardial fluid and can occur when a large volume of pericardial fluid acutely or subacutely accumulates. In contrast, a slow accumulation of pericardial effusion over several weeks does not increase pericardial pressure sufficiently to cause symptomatic cardiac tamponade, despite that the volume of pericardial effusion can be measured in liters. Although surgical approaches including pericardial fenestration and pericardiotomy should be considered in cases with recurrent large effusion, postoperative pleural effusion that has moved from the pericardial space through a pericardial window rarely becomes a problem. In our case, pleural effusion increased after surgery for localized lung cancer with pericardial fenestration, in contrast to decreasing pericardial effusion. We speculate that pericardial effusion, the volume of which had not changed for more than 3 years due to a closed pericardial space maintaining a well-balanced pericardial pressure, overflowed into the thoracic cavity through a pericardial window and accumulated as pleural effusion. Similar cytological findings, including abundant lymphocytes between the peripheral and pleural fluid, strengthen our hypothesis.

### Diagnostic value of the biochemical composition of pericardial effusions in patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^111VWjZf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In contrast to pleural effusion or ascites, there are few data regarding the chemical and cell-count parameters of pericardial effusions (PEs) to aid diagnosis. In the present work, all patients who underwent pericardiocentesis during a 9-year period (1995 to 2004) at a tertiary hospital and who had available fluid laboratory results were retrospectively identified. Causes of PE were diagnosed using predetermined criteria. The results of pericardial fluid biochemical and hematologic tests were compared with blood test results and analyzed to identify cut-off points that could distinguish among the various causes or among various groups of causes. Of 173 patients who underwent pericardiocentesis in the study period, 120 had available fluid laboratory results, and these patients constituted the study population. The most common causes of PE were neoplastic, idiopathic, and effusion related to acute pericarditis (accounting for 42, 22, and 17 of 120 patients, respectively). Most fluids (118 of 120) would have been classified as exudates by adopting Light's pleural effusion criteria. Moreover, in all parameters examined, there was a considerable overlap of test results among the different pericardial disorders. Thus, no biochemical or cell-count parameter was found useful at reasonable accuracy for differentiating among the individual causes or among various groups of pericardial disorders. In conclusion, most PEs are exudates. The analysis of pericardial fluid biochemical and cell-count composition is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of most PEs.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^111ncxMm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The normal pericardial sac contains up to 50 mL of fluid with anything greater being a pathologic effusion. The curvilinear pressure-volume relationship of the pericardial sac determines the hemodynamic consequences of a PE and is responsible for rapidly accumulating fluid that causes cardiac tamponade. There are numerous diseases and complications which cause PEs with the most common being idiopathic pericarditis, cancer, and hemorrhage. PE may be classified based on its onset (acute, subacute, or chronic when it has been present for greater than 3 months), distribution (circumferential or loculated), hemodynamic impact (none, cardiac tamponade, effusive-constrictive), and composition (exudates, transudate). PE is also distinguished by size as mild, moderate, and large based on echocardiographic assessment.

The pathophysiology of the development of PE has been described as resulting from any pathological process causing an inflammatory process with the possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Another mechanism for the formation of pericardial fluid may be decreased reabsorption due to increased systemic venous pressure as a result of congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension (transudate). The most common cause is often unknown as most of the PEs are idiopathic. Although the subxiphoid approach for surgical drainage has been our preferred method there are alternative approaches. The creation of a "pericardial window" can be done through a thoracotomy or video-assisted approach. The procedure is generally low risk with a low complication rate and rare mortality.

Table 8 — Multimodality cardiac imaging for pericardial effusions summarizes roles across echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): CCT is "Second-line if echocardiography inconclusive, or suspects secondary causes" and CMR is "Second-line if echocardiography inconclusive, or suspects pericarditis, pericardial malignancy, and/or CP" (constrictive pericarditis). For CCT pericardial effusion characterization, attenuation thresholds include "Transudate: 0–20 HU", "Exudate: 20–50 HU", and "Chylous: -60 to -80 HU". Added-value items include echocardiography to "Guide pericardiocentesis" and "TEE useful in detecting focal CTP (eg, post-cardiac surgery)" (transesophageal echocardiography), CCT to "Identify secondary causes and mimickers", and CMR to "Evaluate for coexisting pericarditis" and "Assess for loculated PEff/focal CTP (stable patients)".

### Management of acute and recurrent Pericarditis: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111PpzHp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers, resulting from a variety of stimuli triggering a stereotyped immune response, and characterized by chest pain associated often with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

### Pericarditis and pericardial effusions in end-stage renal disease [^114KD3PG]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Pericarditis and pericardial effusions are not uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Etiologies include those found in the general population along with two entities unique to patients with kidney disease, namely uremic and dialysis-associated pericarditis. Uremic pericarditis has been arbitrarily defined as pericarditis that develops before or within 8 weeks of initiation of dialysis, while dialysis-associated pericarditis is used to define pericarditis in patients on dialysis for more than 8 weeks. Retention of uremic toxins is likely a major contributor to uremic and dialysis-associated pericarditis although their exact cause is not known. Indeed, whether they are actually distinct entities is uncertain. Symptoms and signs of pericarditis differ in patients with ESRD compared to the non-ESRD population. Management has not been well studied and ranges from initiation and intensification of dialysis to percutaneous or open drainage for large effusions. This review covers the literature on this topic but emphasizes that most of the data are old and of relatively poor quality, and therefore additional research is needed.

### A case of purulent pneumococcal pericarditis [^113Jg8Lq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Purulent bacterial pericarditis is a rare and potentially fatal disease. The course may be fulminant, and the presentation may pose a diagnostic challenge.

Case Report

An otherwise healthy 75-year-old male was brought to the emergency department in a state of general deterioration, confusion, and shock. Bedside ultrasound showed a significant pericardial effusion. His condition quickly deteriorated and the resuscitation included emergent bedside pericardiocentesis. The drainage was purulent and later cultures grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Purulent pericarditis is extremely rare but should be considered in the patient with a fulminant infectious process (particularly pneumonia) and signs of pericardial effusion. Treatment should include appropriate antibiotics and early drainage.

### Clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of valproate-induced pleural effusion [^117UwSzY]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid derivative commonly prescribed for several types of seizure disorders or for acute manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. Several cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion have been reported, although the precise pathophysiological mechanism remains unknown.

Objective

To describe the presentation of pleural effusion associated with valproate use and to categorize published case reports according to clinical, immunological, and pleural effusion cell type.

Methods

PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase databases were systematically searched from January 1970 until November 2020 using the following search terms: "valproic acid" OR "valproate" OR "pleural fluid" OR "exudative effusion" OR "transudative effusion" OR "valproic lung adverse events". These searches yielded 171 references of which 135 articles were considered irrelevant, leaving 36 potentially relevant references which were carefully scrutinized. Twenty-eight cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion were identified after excluding two articles reporting five patients with lung parenchymal adverse reactions to treatment with valproic acid; two articles reporting three patients in whom the pleural effusion could not be attributed to valproic acid alone; one case discussing valproate therapy and fungal pleural effusion; and one describing a patient who suffered from severe cardiac failure. There were also two cases, in an abstract form, with pericardial and pleural effusion, but without any further informative details, and, thus, they were also excluded from this survey.

Exudative Eosinophilic Pleural Effusion

This was the most common type of valproate-induced pleural effusion reported in 17 out of 28 cases (60.7%), with concurrent peripheral eosinophilia in ten. Acute hypersensitivity reaction, inflammation of the pleural cavity induced by the drug, drug toxicity, and damage to mesothelial cells due to oxidants, comprise the possible pivotal mechanisms.

Exudative Lymphocytic Pleural Effusion

This was reported in two cases, with concurrent pericardial effusion in one. Discontinuation of valproate led to resolution of the effusion, although the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain abstruse. Interestingly, a patient presented with recurrent pleural effusion characterized by transition from eosinophilic to lymphocytic predominance after readministration of valproate.

Transudative Pleural Effusion

Three out of 28 cases (10.7%) were characterized by neutrophilic transudative pleural effusion after long-term therapy with valproate, while concurrent pericardial effusion was also noted in two.

Valproate-Induced Lupus Erythematosus With Pleural Effusion

Five patients receiving valproate therapy (17.9% out of the 28 cases) developed drug-induced lupus erythematosus with concurrent pleural effusion that was eosinophilic in three. All patients had positive antinuclear antibodies; anti-histone antibodies were positive in two.

Conclusions

Valproate-induced pleural effusion is rare, but patients receiving treatment with valproic acid who develop respiratory symptoms should be examined for valproate-induced pleural effusion.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^113e7oE4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Traumatic pericardial effusion

Traumatic PEs are the next cause of noninflammatory pericardial effusion. The leading cause among this group is iatrogenic PE (15–20% of overall cases). The management of traumatic pericardial effusion primarily focuses on prompt drainage to prevent cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition. While medical therapy is essential for treating underlying causes of pericardial effusion, its role in traumatic cases is limited. Treatment for pericardial effusion depends on factors such as the amount of fluid buildup, the cause of the effusion, and the presence or risk of cardiac tamponade. In cases of traumatic pericardial effusion, immediate drainage procedures like pericardiocentesis or surgical creation of a pericardial window are often necessary to relieve pressure on the heart. Medical therapies, such as anti-inflammatory medications, are more applicable in non-traumatic pericardial effusions where inflammation is the primary cause. Therefore, in the context of traumatic pericardial effusion, medical therapy serves a supportive role, with surgical intervention being the cornerstone of effective management.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae pericarditis [^116YK9h5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an atypical bacterium that is frequently implicated in respiratory infections, but uncommonly identified as a cause of pericarditis. We report 2 cases of pericarditis attributed to M. pneumoniae that were characterized by prolonged respiratory prodromes, pericardial, and pleural effusions, elevated inflammatory markers, and relapsing clinical courses. In conclusion, our experience suggests that M. pneumoniae should be considered as a potential cause in cases of pericarditis associated with upper respiratory symptoms, pneumonia, pleural effusions, arthralgia, and/or a recurrent/refractory clinical course. The availability of effective antibiotic treatment makes this an important diagnosis to make.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^112eit1L]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Diagnoses made on pleural biopsy

The 44.3% of patients with malignant pleuritis is in the range of other studies (60.0%, 54.0%, 44.2%, 36.6%). Of course this also depends on previous diagnostic work up before thoracoscopy (eg, imaging, number of thoracentesis, closed pleural biopsy), but also on your patient population, and if the data were collected in TB-endemic countries. We have a higher percentage of nonspecific pleuritis compared with these other studies, and lower percentage of other benign conditions. We however have no empyema, haemothorax nor heart failure, which is prevalent in some other studies. Neither do we have (clinical) probable diagnoses, but only certain diagnoses, and we categorised all these uncertain diagnoses as nonspecific pleuritis.

Pleural or pericardial effusions in NSCLC — staging and management: Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease, and T4 with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a; pleural or pericardial effusions are malignant in 90% to 95% of patients, so pathologic confirmation of a malignant effusion by thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended, with thoracoscopy considered if thoracentesis is inconclusive. In the absence of nonmalignant causes, an exudate or sanguineous effusion is considered malignant regardless of cytology, and if the effusion is negative for malignancy (M0), treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage; data suggest that most pleural or pericardial effusions are associated with unresectable disease in 95% of cases, and if positive for malignancy the tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) in addition to treatment as for stage IV disease.

### Vascular endothelial growth factor: the key mediator in pleural effusion formation [^113ff1WE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Pleural effusion is common in clinical practice. Increased vascular permeability and leakage play a principal role in the development of exudative pleural effusions. In vitro and in vivo evidence have solidly established vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent inducer of vascular permeability, as a crucial mediator in pleural fluid formation. VEGF is present in high quantities in human effusions. In the pleural space, mesothelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and (in malignant pleuritis) cancer cells contribute to the VEGF accumulation in the pleural fluids. Pleural fluid VEGF is biologically active and may promote tumor growth and chemotaxis. Strategies to antagonize the VEGF activity at various target points of its signaling pathway have shown success in vitro and in animal models of malignant pleural or peritoneal effusions. Novel agents targeting VEGF activities are undergoing clinical trials. Regulation of VEGF activity and vascular permeability represent a rapidly expanding field of research, which is likely to provide further insight in the pathophysiology of pleural fluid formation.

### Post-pericardiotomy syndrome: beware or just Be aware? [^1111uehj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

One of the least discussed and least examined complications in cardiac surgery is post–pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS). One reason for this lack of attention and probable underdiagnosis of the condition is the lack of a definitive blood test or imaging examination. Instead, the diagnosis rests on clinical findings. According to the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines: "the diagnosis of Post Cardiac Injury Syndrome (PCIS) may be reached after a cardiac injury following clinical criteria: (1) fever without alternative causes, (2) pericarditic or pleuritic chest pain, (3) pericardial or pleural rubs, (4) evidence of pericardial effusion and/or (v) pleural effusion with elevated CRP [C‐reactive protein]. At least two of five criteria should be fulfilled". 1 Fever, chest pain, and effusions are findings that are seen in a large proportion of patients after cardiac surgery, which makes the diagnosis difficult. In addition, the timing of PPS occurrence may make it likely to occur when the patient will already have been discharged home, thus escaping medical diagnosis unless the symptom is severe enough to warrant medical attention. 2

However, further awareness of PPS would draw attention to it as a likely immune‐mediated phenomenon that occurs in a large percentage of patients after cardiac surgery. It has been thought of as having a good overall prognosis. 3 However, it is also a large contributor to postoperative morbidity because it has been associated with tamponade, longer hospital stays, more readmissions, and a theoretical risk of constrictive pericarditis. 2, 4

In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Lehto et al examined the likelihood of PPS according to operation type and the possible relationship of PPS to postoperative mortality. 5 They used a Finnish national health database to study > 28,000 patients undergoing cardiac surgery from 2005 to 2013. Their analysis concluded that patients undergoing aortic or mitral valve surgery or an operation on the aorta were more likely to experience PPS compared with those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients experiencing PPS postoperatively also had an elevated risk for mortality, with a rate 1.7‐fold that of patients who did not have a PPS diagnosis. Although prior studies have demonstrated an association of PPS with cardiac tamponade, this appears to be the first study to make a direct association between PPS and an increased risk of mortality.

### Pleural effusions in acute idiopathic pericarditis and postcardiac injury syndrome [^113rcnga]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are frequent in the context of acute idiopathic pericarditis and following pericardiotomy, but they have seldom been characterized. This review summarizes their most relevant clinical features.

Recent Findings

In acute idiopathic pericarditis, pleural effusions tend to be left-sided and, if bilateral, they are usually larger on the left. Less than 5% are unilateral right-sided. About 90% of the effusions occupy less than one-third of the hemithorax, and 99% meet Light's exudative criteria with a predominance of lymphocytes in three fourths of the cases. Although postcardiac injury syndrome (PCIS)-related effusions share similar characteristics, they present some differential features: more than 15% are unilateral on the right (except for Dressler syndrome), one-fourth opacify half or more of the hemithorax, and nearly two thirds are bloody. The combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine, along with therapeutic thoracenteses for moderate-to-large effusions, is the mainstay treatment approach. The postoperative use of colchicine is also a reasonable option for preventing PCIS in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery.

Summary

Pleural effusions because of pericardial diseases remain a clinical diagnosis. If unilateral right-sided, massive, or transudative effusions are seen, an alternative diagnosis to acute pericarditis should be considered.

### A case of meigs' syndrome with preceding pericardial effusion in advance of pleural effusion [^116Ho7V8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although pleural fluid analysis plays an important role in diagnosing patients with pleural effusion, contradictory data regarding pleural fluid characteristics have been reported in patients with Meigs' syndrome, as some studies have classified it as a transudate, whereas others stated that it is an exudate. Pleural fluid is generally characterized as either a transudate or an exudate based on Light's criteria, which assess serum and pleural fluid protein and LDH. Transudative pleural effusion occurs in patients with imbalances in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the chest, such as chronic heart failure and nephrosis. In contrast, exudative pleural effusion results from a variety of mechanisms, including infection, malignancy, and trauma. According to a systematic review of 653 studies on Meigs' syndrome, the majority of pleural effusions in patients are exudates, as is in our case, despite limited data reliably defining the characteristics of the pleural effusion. In addition, we needed to carefully differentiate Meigs' syndrome from tuberculous pleural effusion, because the pleural effusion in our case was a lymphocyte-predominant exudate consistent with tuberculous pleurisy. As acid-fast bacilli stains and cultures are of low yield in the setting of tuberculous pleural effusion, such negative bacterial findings cannot rule out tuberculous pleurisy. When the bacterial evaluation of pleural fluid is not diagnostic, pleural biopsy, culture of pleural tissue, and an elevated pleural fluid ADA level are often useful to confirm the diagnosis. Pleural effusion in our case was unlikely to be caused by tuberculosis, due to the normal ADA level and the negative mycobacterial culture findings.

### Post-cardiac injury syndrome: an atypical case following percutaneous coronary intervention [^115owFUk]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Post-cardiac injury syndrome (PCIS) is a syndrome characterized by pericardial and/or pleural effusion, triggered by a cardiac injury, usually a myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery, rarely a minor cardiovascular percutaneous procedure. Nowadays, the post-cardiac injury syndrome, is regaining importance and interest as an emerging cause of pericarditis, especially in developed countries, due to a great and continuous increase in the number and complexity of percutaneous cardiologic procedures. The etiopathogenesis seems mediated by the immunitary system producing immune complexes, which deposit in the pericardium and pleura and trigger an inflammatory response. We present the atypical case of a 76-year-old man presenting with a hydro-pneumothorax, low-grade fever and elevated inflammation markers, after two complex percutaneous coronary interventions, executed 30 and 75 days prior. The clinical features of our case are consistent with the diagnostic criteria of PCIS: prior injury of the pericardium and/or myocardium, fever, leucocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, remarkable steroid responsiveness and latency period. Only one element does not fit with this diagnosis and does not find any further explanation: the air accompanying the pleural effusion, determining a hydro-pneumothorax and requiring a pleural drainage catheter positioning.

### Successful treatment of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions with tocilizumab in a patient with systemic lupus erythematous [^112oG86C]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 22-year-old Caucasian man presented to hospital with pleuritic chest pain. He had had a history of a sun-sensitive rash a year prior. Workup revealed normal cardiac enzymes and chest X-ray. However, electrocardiogram revealed ST elevation and PR depression, and echocardiogram revealed a slight pericardial effusion without other findings. A diagnosis of pericarditis was made. Subsequently, he was found to be positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), as well as antibodies to SSA, SSB and double-stranded DNA; C3 was low, and C4 was undetectable. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was made. The patient initially responded to high-dose ibuprofen. One month later, he developed a new pericardial effusion, this time with concomitant massive left-sided pleural effusion, requiring three separate thoracenteses draining a total of 6L of pleural fluid. The recurrent effusion failed to respond to high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Owing to the severity and rapidity of the recurrence of pleural and pericardial effusion, intravenous tocilizumab was administered. The patient had excellent clinical and radiographic improvement. This case shows that tocilizumab may have a role in the treatment of intractable pleuropericardial effusion and other forms of lupus-associated serositis.

### Diagnostic value and safety of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies in pleural exudative effusions of unknown origin, including follow-up [^112c6ybo]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

Pleural effusion without diagnosis after initial evaluation is a frequent problem in a respiratory division, for which thoracoscopic pleural biopsy is regularly necessary. Our data, which are the first Belgian data published, represent our experience with medical thoracoscopy. These data are comparable to other studies, as well in diagnostic yield, in diagnoses made, and safety data. Medical thoracoscopy has a high diagnostic yield, and is generally safe, certainly compared with the diagnostic and therapeutic importance. If malignant pleuritis is diagnosed after a diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis, usually it is within 1 year, rarely within 2 years. Follow-up after diagnosis of nonspecific pleuritis should preferably be 2 years.

### Diagnostic approach to pleural effusion in adults [^111mD8Dn]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

The first step in the evaluation of patients with pleural effusion is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. An exudative effusion is diagnosed if the patient meets Light's criteria. The serum to pleural fluid protein or albumin gradients may help better categorize the occasional transudate misidentified as an exudate by these criteria. If the patient has a transudative effusion, therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. If the patient has an exudative effusion, attempts should be made to define the etiology. Pneumonia, cancer, tuberculosis, and pulmonary embolism account for most exudative effusions. Many pleural fluid tests are useful in the differential diagnosis of exudative effusions. Other tests helpful for diagnosis include helical computed tomography and thoracoscopy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® workup of pleural effusion or pleural disease [^116VhVvQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusions are categorized as transudative or exudative, with transudative effusions usually reflecting the sequala of a systemic etiology and exudative effusions usually resulting from a process localized to the pleura. Common causes of transudative pleural effusions include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal failure, whereas exudative effusions are typically due to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disorders. This document summarizes appropriateness guidelines for imaging in four common clinical scenarios in patients with known or suspected pleural effusion or pleural disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

Non-inflammatory pericardial effusions

Neoplastic pericardial effusions:

Malignancies are the second leading cause of etiology-established pericardial effusion in developed countries (10–25%). The leading cause of neoplastic pericardial effusions is the spread of metastatic cells through the blood or lymphatic circulation system into the pericardium. Alternatively, inflammation involving the pericardium, radiation or chemotherapeutic therapy toxicity, or opportunistic infections following immunocompromised can result in pericardial. Pericardial effusions can be seen in up to 15–30% of patients with cancer at autopsy, while this percentage of people without cancer is roughly 4%. Lung (35%), breast (25%), and lymphoma and leukemia (15%) are the most common metastatic cancers that can cause PE, and other malignancies such as the esophagus, Kaposi's sarcoma, and melanoma are the next causes.

The clinical manifestations of neoplastic PE vary widely depending on the volume and rate of filling of the pericardium. PE can be asymptomatic when the fluid volume is minimal and is slowly accumulating. On the other hand, a high volume and rapid accumulation results in symptomatic cases such as arrhythmia, cardiovascular collapse, and death due to tamponade. Neoplastic diseases can cause cardiac pathologies with different acuities and consequences. The cardiac presentation can be rapid and fulminant such ass tamponade. Such complications need to be approached emergently as potential causes of cardiovascular collapse and death. Constrictive pericardial disease is a condition that is generally chronic, but it needs to be diagnosed, and it is usually treated with pericardiectomy. Mild and moderate pericardial effusion or pericarditis are less acute and give more time to patients and physicians to treat or control them. The treatment of pericardial effusion due to cancer includes relieving the symptoms and preventing the reaccumulating of fluid. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis is the mainstay of the treatment and, at the same time, an excellent diagnostic procedure. Pericardial effusion has significant prognostic implications for cancer patients. There is a high risk of recurrence of PE (about 90% in 90 days) if pericardiocentesis is done without prolonged pericardial drainage. In a study from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the overall recurrence rate of 11.8 ± 0.6 months after pericardiocentesis was 20%, and the mean interval to recurrence was 1.2 ± 2.1 months. However, patients with extended catheter drainage had a reduced recurrence rate of 12% compared to 52% in patients without extended drainage (p < 0.001).

Pericarditis in oncologic patients — Pericardial involvement in the setting of known malignancy can occur with direct spread or hematologic or lymphatic dissemination. Most pericardial metastases are identified as part of a staging chest computed tomography or positron emission tomography–computed tomography study. Frequently, the presence of new pericardial effusion or nodularity in staging imaging studies is the first clue for pericardial malignant involvement. The presence of hemorrhagic or complex pericardial effusion increases the likelihood of pericardial metastasis in that setting.

### Evaluating pleural effusions… [^111bche7]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

PLEURAL effusions are commonly seen in a variety of diseases. Based on the underlying pathophysiological abnormality, these effusions can be divided into transudates and exudates. 1 Transudative effusions develop when there is a change in systemic factors such as an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure or a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure with no change in the pleural surface. Common causes of transudative effusions include congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and low protein states. Exudative effusions are caused by an altered permeability of the pleural vessels or by obstruction of lymphatics as is seen in neoplasms, infections, or other inflammatory processes. Physicians use a number of laboratory tests to determine which of these processes is occurring in a particular patient. Light et al2 have shown that in a select group of patients, transudates and exudates can be separated in the laboratory by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^113zsoV6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

A significant pericardial effusion often requires a percutaneous drainage, not only to relieve the hemodynamic compromise but also to determine or (dis)prove the putative cause of the effusion. This can be relevant not only for patients without a known underlying disease but also for patients with a condition known to be prone to develop pericarditis or pericardial effusions. 6 Indeed, establishing an etiology, especially pericardial malignancy, metastasis, or bacterial causes, can be crucial for immediate management as well as the long‐term prognoses of these patients. Nevertheless, few contemporary data exist on the frequency of the varying conditions leading to pericardial effusions. In addition, the significant impact of these causes on outcome is often underestimated. We reported on the outcome and etiology, per standard care, of pericardial effusion requiring percutaneous pericardiocentesis in 269 consecutive patients over the span of a decade, making this study one of the largest to date. We found that in about half of the patients with known malignancy, abnormal pericardial cytology was observed, whereas for two thirds of the patients with previously nonmetastasized cancer, the effusion constituted their first metastatic site. Vice versa, one out of eight patients without a history of cancer was newly diagnosed with malignancy after pericardiocentesis. Importantly, patients with malignant pericardial effusion had significantly worse long‐term prognoses compared with patients with another or no definite diagnosis. Still, outcome appeared to be poor for all cancer patients undergoing pericardiocentesis, regardless of pericardial cytology. Finally, bacterial pericardial effusion appeared to be rare in our population.

### Sudden extensive bloody pleural and pericardial effusion in a subject with untreated known hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy, triggered by pneumonia [^1148qUbH]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormones are involved in metabolism, regulation of the sympathetic nervous system, and growth during childhood, and deficiency of thyroid hormones disrupts the metabolic mechanisms of the body. In subjects with hypothyroidism, fluid and mucopolysaccharide are stored in interstitial space and protein osmolality is increased, thus leading to edema and fluid retention. In addition, the characteristics of pleural effusion in this subject was exudative, which point is compatible with previous reports showing that characteristics of pleural effusion due to hypothyroidism is exudative, but not transudative. It is noted here that pleural effusion and pericardial fluid in this subject showed bloody color and included red blood cells. There is no report that pericardial fluid due to hypothyroidism shows bloody color. A flowchart of the diagnosis of a bloody pericardial fluid and bloody pleural effusion in this case is shown in Fig. 3. Bloody pericardial fluid could be brought about by several diseases such as viral pericarditis, tuberculous pericarditis, acute myocardial infarction, malignancy, collagen disease, blood disease, uremia, pulmonary vein thrombosis, trauma and rupture of the aortic aneurysm. In this subject, however, we excluded the possibility of having these diseases as described in case presentation section. Diseases that can bring about grossly bloody pleural effusion include malignancy, tuberculous pleurisy, pulmonary thromboembolism, and traumatic hemothorax, all of which were negative in this case. Although bacterial pleurisy and pyothorax can also cause bloody pleural effusion, pleural fluid culture test was negative and pleural fluid glucose level was not decreased (120 mg/dL) in this case, which was not compatible with bacterial pleurisy or pyothorax. In addition, there was no report of bloody pleural effusion due to pneumonia-associated pleural effusion. In the case of bloody pleural effusions, malignancy and tuberculosis are more frequent, and these tests are prioritized in clinical practice. Other diseases presenting with bloody pleural effusions are less frequent and may delay testing and diagnosis. On the other hand, measurement of thyroid hormones is quite straightforward. If the bloody pleural effusion is due to hypothyroidism, it can be quickly corrected with thyroid hormone replacement. We believe that many clinicians should be aware of this fact.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^116DjDV7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of review

The causes of exudative pleural effusions are diverse and frequently remain unclear despite exhaustive examinations. Recently recognized IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder that can affect nearly any organ including the lungs. This review will focus on the involvement of IgG4 in exudative pleural effusion of unknown cause.

Recent findings

IgG4 is found to be involved in a proportion of patients with undiagnosed pleural effusions. Pleural involvement in IgG4-RD can be seen in isolation or association with other organ disease. Pleural thickening and/or effusion are common clinical features of IgG4-related pleural lesions, and this condition is histologically characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells in the pleura. Although the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD is poorly understood, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates an antigen-driven process requiring T-cell and B-cell interaction in which autoantibodies, plasmablasts, follicular helper T cells and CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes participate.

Summary

The possibility of IgG4-related pleural lesion should be considered in patients with pleural effusion of unexplained cause when lymphoplasmacytic infiltration is seen in a pleural biopsy specimen. This condition is responsive to systemic steroid therapy.

### Constrictive pericarditis in a patient with fiberglass lung disease: a case report [^112j1dB6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Characteristic chest CT findings of asbestosis-related constrictive pericarditis usually reveal dense calcification in the pericardium associated with lung fibrosis. Asbestosis-associated pleural or pericardial effusion can be exudative or bloody. Our patient did not present dense calcification in the pericardium or exudative/bloody pleural effusion; therefore, we could reasonably rule out a diagnosis of asbestosis and avoid lung biopsy. However, given the patient's misleading self-reported history of extended asbestos exposure, it was initially difficult to rule out asbestosis. Clinicians should be familiar with the radiological and clinical characteristics of this condition.

In conclusion, fiberglass can cause inflammation of the pericardium, causing pericardial effusion and subsequently constrictive pericarditis, which is severe, requiring radical pericardiectomy. Careful review of exposure history and histopathological examinations are important for clinicians for exact diagnosis.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^11728aK9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a relatively common complication associated with inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases. The primary etiology of this condition could be considered when choosing therapeutic options and factors such as effusion size and its hemodynamic consequence. In most cases, small to moderate pericardial effusions can be managed with observation and anti-inflammatory medications unless the effusion develops rapidly. However, in a small proportion of patients, large effusions lead to impaired cardiac filling with hemodynamic compromise and cardiovascular collapse due to cardiac tamponade. The rate at which fluid accumulates is the primary determinant of hemodynamic impact and thus guides the choice of treatment, irrespective of the effusion's size. Severe cases are typically treated with pericardiocentesis with echocardiographic guidance. More aggressive treatments may be necessary for cases due to purulent or malignant etiologies. These cases may require a pericardial window to allow for long-term drainage of the pericardial fluid. This comprehensive review focuses on the epidemiology of pericardial effusion and discusses pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic options for different causes of secondary pericardial effusions.

Differential diagnosis

Based on the exudative nature of the pleural effusion, hypoproteinaemia without renal dysfunction or gastrointestinal tract leakage and the absence of any other distinctive pleural and pericardial findings, our differential diagnosis included recurrence of thymoma, pericarditis due to other malignant diseases, constrictive pericarditis (tuberculous pericarditis) and serositis due to connective tissue disease. Laboratory investigation indicated mild hypothyroidism. We then administered levothyroxine (25 µg/day) for 35 days as a way of therapeutic diagnosis. The TSH level decreased from 9.250 µIU/mL to 5.093 µIU/mL (normal: 0.35–4.94 µIU/mL). After almost normalisation of the TSH level, her symptoms remained stable, which was because we evaluated that hypothyroidism was not the direct cause of her symptoms. PCIS seemed to be less likely as a differential diagnosis because of the absence of elevation of inflammatory markers (CRP or ESR) and the presence of systemic oedema, which is not a typical symptom.

Constrictive pericarditis (tuberculous pericarditis) was ruled out because of the exudative nature of the pleural effusion, absence of calcification of the pericardium, no evidence of right atrial compression on echocardiography and no growth of any pathogen from the culture of the pleura and pericardium. Pericarditis due to other malignant diseases was also ruled out because biopsy of the pleura and pericardium showed non-specific inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous hyperplasia. Imaging studies indicated a low likelihood of recurrence of thymoma. Serositis due to connective tissue disease seemed less likely due to the absence of symptoms, consistent with connective tissue disease and negative auto-antibody tests. We finally made a diagnosis of PCIS.

Lupus serositis

The serosal manifestations of pleuritis and pericarditis are likewise typical signs of SLE that have been present in both ACR and SLICC criteria, with some changes in definitions. For pleuritis, pleural effusion is so likely to follow that this more objective finding was adopted for the EULAR/ACR criteria. Acute pericarditis was defined as per the European Society of Cardiology 2015 guidelines and given a slightly higher weight (Table 1). For diagnosis, other causes, including pulmonary embolism and virus pleuritis, are of major importance, which would also lead to not counting this manifestation for SLE in the EULAR/ACR criteria, according to the above-mentioned attribution rule. Much less common, serositis can also take the form of sterile peritonitis. Lupus serositis is one of the few situations where CRP is actually relevantly increased in SLE.

Pleural sepsis stems from an infection within the pleural space typically from an underlying bacterial pneumonia leading to development of a parapneumonic effusion. This effusion is traditionally divided into uncomplicated, complicated, and empyema. Poor clinical outcomes and increased mortality can be associated with the development of parapneumonic effusions, reinforcing the importance of early recognition and diagnosis. Management necessitates a multimodal therapeutic strategy consisting of antimicrobials, catheter/tube thoracostomy, and at times, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

### Pleural effusion related to IgG4 [^113qJtcE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pleural effusion is a common presentation, originating from a wide range of disorders, including congestive cardiac failure, pneumonia and cancer. The cause of a pleural effusion frequently remains unclear after thoracentesis. Light's criteria are used to help differentiate exudates from transudates by measuring the protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in the pleural fluid and the serum, and algorithms for the investigation of exudative pleural effusion have been developed. Nonetheless, the cause of exudative effusion remains uncertain in a substantial percentage of patients with lymphocytic pleural effusion after extensive examinations including thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Approximately 30% of cases of exudative pleural effusion are reported to be diagnosed with nonspecific pleuritis, that is no specific diagnosis, even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopy, and 12–15% of nonspecific pleuritis are ultimately diagnosed with pleural malignancy after a mean interval between thoracoscopy and the final diagnosis of 4.4–9.8 months. Therefore, 12–16 months of follow-up is suggested following thoracoscopy for patients with nonspecific pleuritis to exclude malignancy; however, unexplained pleural effusions often present a management dilemma for clinicians because of ongoing uncertainty about the possibility of a false-negative result from sampling error. In addition, the clinical course of such pleural effusions varies, for example resolving, persistent and progressive. Hence, new approaches are needed to detect their causes. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a fibroinflammatory disorder of uncertain cause that affects various organs including the pleura. Several lines of evidence indicate that IgG4-RD accounts for a proportion of patients with pleural effusions of idiopathic cause.

Assumptions and definitions — pericardial entities are defined to guide diagnosis and management: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium leading to characteristic pleuritic chest pain which can be accompanied by pericardial rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, new or worsening pericardial effusion, and elevated inflammatory markers; pericardial effusion is fluid accumulation in the pericardial space visible on imaging such as echocardiography; cardiac tamponade is compression of the heart by abnormal fluid accumulation causing impaired cardiac output and hemodynamic compromise; constrictive pericarditis is loss of elasticity with often abnormal pericardial thickening that impairs diastolic filling and leads to heart failure symptoms and can be transient/subacute (predominantly inflammatory and reversible) or advanced/chronic (often calcified and irreversible); effusive constrictive pericarditis is persistent constrictive physiology even after drainage of pericardial effusion.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^112VeT6n]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pericardial effusions are primarily categorized into inflammatory and non-inflammatory cases. This classification and the severity of the conditions determine the therapeutic plan. An essential consideration in understanding the epidemiology of the disease is the geographical region and country of residence. Not all pericardial effusions require evaluation to determine the cause. In developed countries, they are mainly categorized as idiopathic, believed to be associated with temporary viral infections. The second and third most common reasons are diagnosed diseases and malignancies. Conversely, in developing countries, tuberculosis remains the primary cause of the disease. These epidemiological factors can assist health decision-makers in approaching disease prevention and treatment. On a smaller scale, they empower physicians to make informed decisions for patient treatment when there is insufficient time to investigate the cause of pericardial effusion or when such investigation is not rationalized based on cost–benefit considerations. History, physical examination, and echocardiography constitute the main pillars of diagnosis. Treatment can range from observation to percutaneous or surgical procedures depending on the etiology and severity of fluid accumulation.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infection, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis have pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful. When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

However, the cause of the effusion can change during the disease course, and concomitant yet distinct causes are often underrecognized. We highlight this point by reporting a complex case of recurrent pleural effusions with different predominant causes during the disease course. Five causes for the pleural effusion were diagnosed, namely malignant pleural effusion, empyema, chylothorax, transudative pleural effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia, and esophagopleural fistula. This case serves as a reminder to clinicians that recurrent pleural effusion, even within the same pleural space, can arise from different causes and, whenever clinically appropriate, reinvestigation of the pleural effusion may be needed.

### An atypical case of rheumatoid arthritis serositis [^115eChPD]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key message
For RA patients presenting with complex pericardial effusions, tuberculosis should be considered as an important differential, with challenges surrounding diagnosis and management making multidisciplinary input essential. RA, the commonest form of inflammatory arthritis, can have extraarticular manifestations, including serositis. With disease-modifying treatment as a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB) infection, this report expands on differentiating between inflammatory, infective and malignant causes of serositis, with a particular focus on RA serositis and tuberculous pericarditis to guide multidisciplinary management. We present the case of a 36-year-old female with a complex, loculated pericardial effusion, progressing to constrictive pericarditis and concurrent pleural effusions on the background of a potential TB contact.

The patient was admitted from clinic following CT evidence of pericardial and right-sided pleural effusions during investigation for a 9-month history of chronic, dry cough. There had been no previous extraarticular manifestations since the diagnosis of seropositive (RF 73 IU/ml, anti-CCP 231 IU/ml) RA 8 years ago, well-controlled on methotrexate and etanercept, withheld on admission with potentially infective causes in mind. Prior to commencing anti-TNFα therapy, the patient had TB screening and a normal interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). She presented non-specifically with dyspnoea, lethargy, loss of appetite and mild weight loss, with clinical features suggestive of right-sided heart failure, including peripheral oedema, liver congestion, ascites, elevated jugular venous pulse, along with reduced breath sounds over the right lung base. The patient was haemodynamically stable and commenced on diuretic treatment.

Pericardial disease

Pericarditis

Pericarditis is a common disorder, and the most common pericardial disease. It typically presents with sharp pleuritic chest pain due to irritation of the pericardium. Any type of pericardial effusion (inflammatory or hemorrhagic) may eventually result in constrictive pericarditis. Causes include post myocardial infarction (Dressler syndrome), post-surgical, after irradiation therapy, infectious, systemic diseases as rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders, malignancy and idiopathic. CT is well accepted for evaluating pericarditis, although for assessment of constriction, echocardiography and MRI are more reliable. Findings include exudative or transudative, loculated fluid in the pericardial sac, in which differences in attenuation can be helpful. Thickening of the pericardial wall can be seen, and enhancement of the pericardial wall can be appreciated especially in active inflammatory pericarditis. Calcifications are seen in 50 percent of patients. Other findings include pleural effusions and ascites. It is of importance to recognize signs of constriction (Fig. 7).

### Physiology of breathlessness associated with pleural effusions [^1173q7BV]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Over 1 million patients develop a pleural effusion annually in the United States alone. Pleural effusions have more than 60 different causes, and vary in size and risk (and rates) of recurrence. Congestive heart failure (CHF), malignancy, pulmonary infection and embolism account for over 90% of pleural effusions.

Pleural effusions can impact profoundly on the cardiorespiratory system. Breathlessness, the commonest presentation, is often debilitating and significantly impairs quality of life. Relief of breathlessness often necessitates therapeutic pleural interventions with associated discomfort, risks of infection, bleeding, pneumothorax and even death. Management of pleural effusions represents a significant healthcare burden worldwide.

To date, research on, and hence our understanding of, the effects of pleural effusions on respiratory physiology and breathlessness has been limited. The conventional belief that pleural effusions cause breathlessness through compression of the lung is overly simplistic. The severity of breathlessness often correlates poorly with the size of the effusion Conversely, symptom reduction from fluid drainage varies significantly between patients, and no reliable predictors exist to identify those who will benefit. Most previous studies have involved small cohorts and examined specific etiological factors in isolation; few have compared physiological changes with symptom benefits in patients.

This article reviews published literature on the pathophysiological effects of pleural effusions (and their therapeutic evacuation). Key knowledge gaps are highlighted which may guide future research.

### Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of a patient with constrictive pericarditis treated with antituberculosis drugs and pericardiectomy [^113rfwTp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a severe cardiac disorder which often manifests as a long-term sequela following acute or chronic pericarditis due to infections. A number of cardiotropic viruses, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections can cause CP. While rare in Western countries, tuberculosis is the most common cause of pericarditis in countries endemic to tuberculosis and HIV. Other important causes of CP are malignancy, rheumatological diseases, uraemia, radiotherapy and cardiac surgery, and in some cases the cause may be unknown (idiopathic). Chronic effusive pericarditis and inflammation in any of these conditions may lead to formation of granulomatous tissue, fibrosis, calcification and thickening of the pericardium with adhesion to the heart. Typically, CP results in impaired cardiac function, most often associated with diastolic heart failure, and symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue, increased jugular venous pressure, ascites, pleural effusion and peripheral oedema. Although standard transthoracic echocardiography is the cornerstone, a multimodality imaging-based approach is often required to timely diagnose the condition and guide further therapeutic options.

### The immunopathogenesis of tuberculous pericarditis [^113H9Eez]. Microbes and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Tuberculous pericarditis is a severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis and is the commonest cause of pericardial effusion in high incidence settings. Mortality ranges between 8 and 34%, and it is the leading cause of pericardial constriction in Africa and Asia. Current understanding of the disease is based on models derived from studies performed in the 1940–50s. This review summarises recent advances in the histology, microbiology and immunology of tuberculous pericarditis, with special focus on the effect of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the determinants of constriction.

### COVID-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: a case report [^115He71h]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A 37-year-old man with symptoms of anosmia and ageusia contracted COVID-19 in October 2020. Over the next two years, he began to complain of fatigue, dyspnea, and right-sided chest pressure. Chest radiography demonstrated moderate right pleural effusion. He was referred to the pulmonary clinic in November 2022, where thoracentesis was recommended. The next week, right thoracentesis yielded 2250 mL of serosanguinous fluid. A month later, in December 2022, a chest CT scan demonstrated the recurrence of moderate to large right pleural effusion and a small pericardial effusion with high density, suggestive of hemopericardium or exudative effusion from prior pericarditis (Image 1 a). He was referred for thoracic surgery. Prior to the performance of a surgical drainage procedure, transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%, normal RV size and function, and no valvulopathy. However, the mitral annular velocity was consistent with the annulus reversal, suggesting constrictive physiology. In addition, there was a small pericardial effusion localized posteriorly, and the inferior vena cava (IVC) failed to collapse with forced inspiration. In January 2023, Video-Assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) was performed, yielding 2700 mLs of serous pleural fluid from the right chest. The operative findings included mild thickening and inflammation of the parietal pleura. Pleural biopsies revealed adipose tissue with lymphoid aggregates. The pleural fluid showed rare lymphocytes and rare mesothelial cells; there was no growth from the cultures, and cytology was negative. Although she initially improved from a respiratory standpoint, the patient began to experience dyspnea again along with abdominal bloating and leg swelling several months later. A chest radiograph taken on August 2023 demonstrated recurrence of the right pleural effusion. Additional studies were undertaken.

### Does this patient have an exudative pleural effusion? The rational clinical examination systematic review [^116mtozu]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Thoracentesis is performed to identify the cause of a pleural effusion. Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

Objective

To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence.

Data Sources

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection

We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies).

Results

The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1–250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95% CI, 6.8–46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95% CI, 5.5–38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein > 0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH > 0.6, or pleural fluid LDH > two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02–0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0% of cases (95% CI, 4.0%-7.0%). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0% of procedures (95% CI, 0.99%-2.9%) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.08–1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.06–5.3).

Conclusions and Relevance

Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid and allow comprehensive characterisation of cause. Despite this advance, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic, and radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes. Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. Integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge but is facilitated by tissue doppler and colour M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^115bnE6D]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the time, the pericardial fluid appearance is straw-colored or serosanguinous and can contain lymphocytes, RBCs, and granulocytes. Due to the presence of physiologic fluid accumulation after these surgeries, differentiation of PE from the normal fluid can be difficult, but the rate of PE can be as high as 88–92% in most cases, which is primarily mild (83%), rather than moderate (13%) or significant (4%). PPS treatment, most of the time, is limited to colchicine, with or without NSAIDs. Additional therapy is needed — we generally use an IL1-inhibitor, rilonacept. However, others often use corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of recurrence. However, percutaneous drainage of the accumulated fluid should be considered insignificant pericardial or pleural effusion cases. Although needle pericardiocentesis under the guidance of fluoroscopy or echocardiography is the treatment of choice, in selected cases, a surgical approach might be recommended in complex cases or in those in which needle aspiration might be difficult. A strong association exists between severe PPS and mortality, specifically the first two-year mortality.

Post-myocardial infarction pericardial effusion

Sterile pericarditis after myocardial injury, called Dressler syndrome, is an inflammatory process due to necrosis of myocardial cells and activation of the immune system against released intracellular components. Although it had a high prevalence of about 3–5% in the past, with the development of revascularization techniques, the incidence is now less than 1%. It usually presents nonspecific symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain (exacerbated by lying flat), fever, shortness of breath, and ECG changes. However, it can rarely become complicated with PE or even tamponade.

Dressler's syndrome typically manifests with pericardial effusion occurring between two to eight weeks after an acute myocardial infarction. The optimal management involves using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. In cases where NSAIDs are ineffective or contraindicated, corticosteroids may be considered. However, their use is generally reserved for more severe cases due to potential side effects. Early recognition and appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment are essential for managing symptoms and preventing complications. The rapid accumulation of fluid compresses the chambers. It limits the filling and expansion of the right and left heart chambers, which limits forward stroke volume and cardiac output. The consequence of the accumulation of intra-pericardial fluid and reduced stroke volume can lead to tachycardia, low blood pressure, muffled heart sounds, elevated jugular venous pressure, and CV collapse.

### Can cholesterol be used to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates? evidence from a bivariate meta-analysis [^113QDHTh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusion often develops in patients with thoracic or systemic diseases. Such effusion has traditionally been classified as transudate or exudate based on the etiology and underlying pathology, and differentiating the two types of pleural effusion is critical for guiding treatment. Transudates are usually taken as a sign of underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis, which then becomes the focus of treatment. Because in the case of a transudate, aetiology and therapy are directed to the underlying congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Alternatively, exudates are usually taken as a sign of, inflammatory disorders or malignancy, leading to more extensive diagnostic procedures.

The criteria most widely used to differentiate exudates and transudates in patients with pleural effusions are Light's criteria, established by Light et al. in 1972. These criteria rely on levels of total protein and of lactate dehydrogenase. The criteria maximize sensitivity at the expense of specificity: they typically identify 98% of pleural exudates, but they misclassify approximately 25% of transudates as exudates. As a result, patients misclassified with exudate undergo unnecessary and risky invasive diagnostic procedures, such as thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy. This highlights the need to develop better methods to differentiate exudative and transudative pleural effusions.

Since Light's criteria were published in 1972, pleural cholesterol levels have been explored for their usefulness in diagnosing pleural exudates. Cellular degeneration and vascular leakage due to increased permeability are thought to elevate pleural cholesterol levels. Several studies suggest that pleural cholesterol is increased in pleural exudates, making it a potential biomarker for differentiating exudative and transudative pleural effusions. Studies have come to conflicting conclusions about whether pleural cholesterol levels can provide adequate differentiating power, and other studies have explored the diagnostic potential of the ratio of cholesterol in pleural fluid to cholesterol in serum (P/S cholesterol ratio) and come to similarly conflicting conclusions. To help gain more reliable insights, we meta-analyzed the literature on using pleural cholesterol level or the P/S cholesterol ratio to distinguish pleural exudates from transudates.

### US database study of clinical burden and unmet need in recurrent pericarditis [^117Qk8L7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis is often associated with severe symptoms, including sharp, pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. While pericarditis epidemiology data are limited in the United States, about 5% of patients presenting in emergency departments with chest pain ultimately are identified as having an acute pericarditis episode. Acute pericarditis is diagnosed based on having at least 2 of the following: chest pain, pericardial friction/rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. The etiology of pericarditis varies, and causes can include infection, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post‐cardiac injury syndromes. In developing countries, tuberculosis is often a cause, but up to 90% of cases are considered "idiopathic" in developed countries, and presumed to be viral or post‐viral. While the term "idiopathic" is commonly used in these presumed post‐viral cases without a clear underlying cause, there is a growing body of evidence that innate immune system‐mediated autoinflammation, specifically interleukin‐1 signaling, plays an important role in various inflammatory disorders, including recurrent pericarditis (RP) cases that are classified as "idiopathic".

For most patients, pericarditis manifests as a single episode that lasts a few days to several weeks, and symptoms are resolved through conventional treatments such as NSAIDs with or without colchicine. There are, however, some patients who do not experience long‐term symptom resolution after an acute pericarditis episode. Up to 30% of patients experience recurrent pericarditis within 18 months when a subsequent episode occurs following a symptom‐free period of at least 4 weeks. Beyond the first recurrence, the clinical picture of RP varies broadly, with some patients responding well to conventional therapy and having no further recurrence. By contrast, 25% to 50% of patients who have experienced a first recurrence will experience additional recurrence, and among patients who have experienced ≥ 2 recurrences, 20% to 40% are expected to have subsequent episodes. Reasons for recurrence include incomplete or inadequate response to therapy and persistent underlying factors that drive pericardial inflammation, which appears to be primarily driven by autoinflammatory processes in patients with RP either without an underlying autoimmune etiology or in conjunction with other known causes, such as post‐cardiac injury syndromes.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^115p9D9k]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice either as incidental finding or manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The aetiology is varied (infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related), being tuberculosis the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and all over the world, while concurrent HIV infection may have an important promoting role in this setting. Management is guided by the haemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and the aetiology whenever possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined aetiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic aetiology is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means. A true isolated effusion may not require a specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, but large ones are at risk of progression to cardiac tamponade (up to one third). Pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, but recurrences are also common and pericardiectomy or less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered with recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion (either circumferential or loculated). The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate current knowledge on the management of pericardial effusion.

Pericarditis in oncologic patients — imaging roles by modality are contrasted as follows: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) may identify nodular pericardial thickening or pericardial masses when malignant involvement and is the best method to identify signs of tamponade. Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) demonstrates nodular pericardial thickening and enhancement on contrast-enhanced CCT that is highly indicative of pericardial metastasis and is the best modality for evaluating calcified structures; CT attenuation values of pericardial effusion (PEff) on noncontrast CT may help distinguish between exudative, hemorrhagic, and transudative fluid. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can diagnose pericardial inflammation by enhancement on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) or T2-short tau inversion recovery (T2-STIR) sequences; high signal intensity on T1-weighted black-blood images with intermediate intensity on cine white-blood is suggestive of exudative PEffs, and hemorrhagic effusion can be characterized with imaging appearance depending on acuity of bleeding.

### Ascites and other incidental findings revealing undiagnosed systemic rheumatoid arthritis [^116z1oVB]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of a 43-year-old man presenting to the gastroenterology outpatient department with exudative ascites. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pericardial effusion and pleural effusion were detected on further imaging. Further clinical examination revealed subcutaneous nodules on the left arm, which were confirmed to be rheumatoid nodules on histology. Inflammatory markers were elevated with positive serology for rheumatoid factor and anticyclic citrullinated protein antibody. Our investigations excluded tuberculosis, pancreatitis and malignancy in the patient. Following review by a rheumatologist, a diagnosis of systemic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was made. Pleuritis and pericarditis are well recognised as extra-articular manifestation of RA. Ascites, however, is rarely recognised as a manifestation of RA. Our literature search revealed two other cases of ascites due to RA disease activity, and both patients had long-standing known RA. This case adds to the discussion on whether ascites and peritonitis should be classified as extra-articular manifestations of RA.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical because of the relative lack of randomized trials that involve patients with these conditions. A first attempt to bring together and organize current knowledge resulted in the publication of the first guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases. Nevertheless, a number of observational studies and the first randomized trials are moving the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient and, although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^113g8rWT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

### Identification and management of pleural effusions of multiple aetiologies [^115qgTr2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Historically, pleural effusions have been attributed to a single cause. There is growing recognition that a substantial proportion of pleural effusions may have more than one underlying cause. The purpose of this review is to summarise recent findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of effusions secondary to more than one aetiology.

Recent Findings

A recent prospective study identified that 30% of pleural effusions had more than one underlying aetiology. With a rising prevalence of cardiovascular and malignant disease, the incidence of the complex pleural patient is increasing. The use of biomarkers, including pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, have been suggested as a way of identifying contributing disease process.

Summary

Understanding that there are potentially concurrent causes to a pleural effusion is vital in establishing the diagnoses of multiple underlying aetiologies. New diagnostic pathways, with increasing use of biomarkers, will be required to identify the complex pleural effusion. Further studies on whether the targeting of separate aetiologies improves outcomes will help develop future management strategies.
