## Question

non-surgical tx for dry eye syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about non-surgical treatment of dry eye syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that guide non-surgical management. Then, I should verify the stepwise treatment framework and how severity and etiology influence choices. Next, I will examine first-line non-pharmacologic measures, followed by second-line pharmacologic and procedural options. After that, I need to consider advanced non-surgical therapies and special populations such as Sjögren's syndrome. Finally, I should review monitoring, follow-up, and evidence quality to ensure the plan is practical and evidence-aligned [^116RkKQp] [^116XuECY].

> Let me first confirm the core principles so I don't jump to conclusions: dry eye is multifactorial, so I need to identify and treat causative factors; tear replacement alone often fails if I don't address drivers like inflammation, meibomian gland dysfunction, or medication toxicity; patient education is essential because the disease is chronic and not curable; and therapies can be selected from any category regardless of severity, tailoring to patient preference and clinician judgment, which I should explicitly document in the care plan [^116RkKQp] [^115Km2os] [^114p3eCZ].

> I should double-check the stepwise framework before mapping treatments. The AAO 2024 staged approach moves from education and environment to tear conservation and anti-inflammatory therapy, then to advanced biologics and contact lens strategies, and finally to surgical options if refractory; importantly, options within a step are not ranked, and multiple modalities can be combined based on severity and etiology, so I need to ensure I'm not overcommitting to a single pathway too early [^116XuECY] [^113TRocc] [^114e9SDe].

> Now, let me consider first-line non-pharmacologic measures in Step 1, and I should verify each element against guidance. Education should cover chronicity, realistic goals, and adherence; environmental modification includes humidity, reducing screen time, and avoiding smoke or wind; medication review to reduce drying agents is prudent; ocular lubricants should start with preservative-free tears and be matched to evaporative versus aqueous-deficient profiles; eyelid hygiene and warm compresses are foundational, especially for meibomian gland dysfunction; and while omega-3s are often discussed, I need to note that AAO 2024 judges evidence insufficient for routine use in moderate-to-severe disease, so I should individualize and not overpromise benefit [^1162qtpr] [^116ssFau] [^112MxuF9] [^111nAX7u].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of artificial tears more precisely. Guidelines endorse tear supplements, preferably unpreserved, as first-line, but head-to-head evidence is heterogeneous and often low quality; some formulations may outperform others in small studies, yet overall class effects are modest, so I should tailor viscosity and dosing to symptoms and tolerance, escalating to gels or ointments at night as needed and avoiding preserved drops with frequent dosing to limit toxicity [^112MxuF9] [^1152kdUE] [^117Bd7UD].

> Next, I will examine Step 2 additions when first-line measures are inadequate, and I need to ensure I separate non-surgical from surgical options. Nonpreserved lubricants reduce preservative toxicity with frequent dosing; Demodex-directed therapy with tea tree oil or lotilaner can be considered if infestation is present; tear conservation with punctal plugs or moisture chambers can help, though I should counsel on epiphora and rare complications; overnight ointments or moisture devices support nocturnal protection; in-office meibomian gland procedures such as thermal pulsation can improve lipid layer; and short courses of low-potency topical corticosteroids can dampen inflammation while monitoring intraocular pressure, with immunomodulators like cyclosporine or lifitegrast as longer-term anti-inflammatory options, plus varenicline nasal spray for neurostimulation and oral tetracyclines for posterior blepharitis or rosacea-associated MGD [^113TRocc] [^1164AwWq] [^116ypD52] [^112SydKJ] [^115qgGc9].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for some of these Step 2 choices so I don't overstate certainty. Punctal occlusion has mixed and generally low-certainty evidence for symptom benefit, though it may reduce artificial tear use and improve tear film stability in some patients, so shared decision-making is key; topical corticosteroids can improve symptoms and some signs short term but require IOP surveillance; and while immunomodulators are FDA-approved and guideline-endorsed, comparative effectiveness data are limited, reinforcing the need to individualize and reassess response [^114apacS] [^112SydKJ] [^115qgGc9].

> I will now examine Step 3 advanced non-surgical options for refractory disease, and I should confirm indications and cautions. Oral secretagogues such as cevimeline or pilocarpine can increase aqueous production, particularly helpful in Sjögren's syndrome, though oral dryness benefits may exceed ocular benefits; autologous or allogeneic serum eye drops may improve symptoms and staining in select patients but evidence quality is low and access can be limiting; therapeutic contact lenses, including bandage lenses used cautiously and scleral lenses for severe surface disease, can provide pain relief and visual rehabilitation when standard measures fail [^114e9SDe] [^1157A8uP] [^112sJrq2].

> But wait, what if the patient has Sjögren's syndrome or other systemic drivers; I need to ensure I align with disease-specific guidance. For Sjögren's-related dry eye, first-line remains lubricants and gels, with escalation to anti-inflammatory drops, punctal plugs in carefully selected patients, short-course topical corticosteroids for flares, and consideration of autologous serum if symptoms persist despite maximal conventional therapy; oral secretagogues are reasonable when both dry eye and dry mouth coexist, and systemic immunosuppression is generally reserved for systemic disease rather than ocular dryness alone, with TNF inhibitors not recommended for sicca symptoms [^111g9q9v] [^1163JABU] [^111k4ef4] [^112B6vy7] [^117PZZwZ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up so I can course-correct early. Follow-up should assess symptom response, ocular surface integrity, and treatment burden, with frequency tailored to severity and response; I need to check for corneal complications in severe disease and reinforce adherence; importantly, if there is no response or disease is moderate to severe, referral to ophthalmology is advised, and uncontrolled dry eye should be optimized before elective corneal or refractive surgery to avoid exacerbations and suboptimal outcomes [^113qDw2Y] [^117Szz48] [^111GivDk] [^116Wj7vx].

> Hold on, I should verify the overall evidentiary footing so I don't overstate what we know. High-quality comparative effectiveness data across many dry eye interventions are limited, and several systematic reviews conclude that evidence is inconclusive or low certainty for several commonly used modalities, including artificial tears comparisons, punctal plugs, autologous serum, and device-based thermotherapies; this means I should frame expectations realistically, prioritize safety and patient preference, and document shared decision-making while remaining open to iterative adjustments as new data emerge [^113QoL6A] [^1152kdUE] [^114apacS] [^114W2rPe].

> Let me reconsider the practical flow to ensure internal consistency. Start with education and trigger modification, initiate preservative-free lubricants matched to phenotype, add lid hygiene and warm compresses, escalate to tear conservation and short-course anti-inflammatories if needed, consider immunomodulators for persistent inflammation, and deploy advanced non-surgical options such as serum tears or scleral lenses for refractory cases, all while reassessing at each step and integrating patient values; this staged, multimodal approach aligns with AAO and TFOS frameworks and respects the chronic, multifactorial nature of dry eye disease [^116XuECY] [^114g5CgZ] [^116RkKQp].

---

Non-surgical management of dry eye syndrome centers on **tear supplementation** [^112MxuF9] and **tear conservation** [^114apacS], with escalation to anti-inflammatory therapy [^113TRocc] and lifestyle changes as needed [^114g5CgZ]. Begin with **preservative-free artificial tears** [^112MxuF9] and **warm compresses/lid hygiene** [^113TRocc]; add punctal plugs or moisture chambers if symptoms persist [^116ypD52] [^113TRocc], and use short-course topical corticosteroids [^112SydKJ] or immunomodulators (cyclosporine, lifitegrast) [^115qgGc9] for inflammation [^114g5CgZ]. Omega-3s [^116ssFau], **environmental control** [^1162qtpr], and **blinking exercises** [^114g5CgZ] support care, and autologous serum or scleral lenses are options for refractory cases [^114e9SDe] [^112sJrq2]. Management should be individualized and reassessed regularly [^113qDw2Y] to balance efficacy, safety, and patient preference [^116RkKQp].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle modifications

Environmental and lifestyle changes are foundational and often **low-cost**:

- **Humidification**: Use humidifiers to maintain indoor humidity > 40% [^notfound].

- **Blinking exercises**: Encourage regular blinking, especially during screen use [^114g5CgZ].

- **Dietary supplements**: Omega-3 fatty acids (1,000–2,000 mg/day) may improve tear film stability, though evidence is mixed [^111nAX7u].

- **Medication review**: Identify and adjust systemic drugs that worsen dryness (e.g. antihistamines, antidepressants, beta-blockers) [^1162qtpr].

---

## Tear supplementation

Artificial tears are **first-line** and should be preservative-free with frequent use:

- **Preservative-free artificial tears**: Use during the day; consider lipid-containing formulations for evaporative DED [^112MxuF9].

- **Gels and ointments**: Thicker agents at bedtime for overnight lubrication [^112MxuF9].

- **Hydroxypropyl cellulose inserts**: Useful for sustained lubrication in moderate-to-severe DED [^notfound].

---

## Tear conservation

Conserving tears improves ocular surface moisture without surgery:

- **Punctal plugs**: Silicone plugs reduce tear drainage; use the largest size to limit extrusion [^116ypD52] [^114apacS].

- **Moisture chamber spectacles**: Reduce evaporation in severe or environmental DED [^notfound].

---

## Lid margin and meibomian gland therapies

Addressing lid margin disease and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is essential:

- **Warm compresses and lid hygiene**: Daily warm compresses and lid scrubs improve meibum flow [^115t2E67].

- **Thermal pulsation devices**: In-office LipiFlow/iLux/TearCare improve gland function and symptoms [^1125sSEh].

- **Demodex management**: Tea tree oil wipes or lotilaner drops for infestations [^113TRocc].

---

## Anti-inflammatory pharmacologic therapies

Inflammation is a key driver; **anti-inflammatory therapy** is indicated for moderate-to-severe DED:

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical corticosteroids (loteprednol, fluorometholone) | Short-term flare control | Limit to 2–4 weeks; monitor IOP [^112SydKJ] [^115T1Bcu] |
| Cyclosporine 0.05–0.09% | Chronic inflammation | Twice daily; FDA-approved; may cause burning [^115qgGc9] |
| Lifitegrast 5% | T-cell mediated inflammation | Twice daily; FDA-approved; may cause taste disturbance [^115qgGc9] |
| Perfluorohexyloctane | Evaporative DED with MGD | Water-free lipid layer replacement [^113TRocc] |
| Varenicline nasal spray | Neurostimulation of tear production | Once daily; FDA-approved [^115qgGc9] |

---

## Advanced non-surgical options

For refractory DED, consider **autologous serum tears** (20% for severe or Sjögren-related disease) [^1157A8uP] [^1163JABU] and **scleral contact lenses** for severe surface disease with pain and visual compromise [^114e9SDe].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Education and follow-up are critical: explain the **chronic nature**, set realistic expectations, and reinforce adherence [^1174YRtg]; reassess at 2–3 months and adjust therapy based on response and tolerance [^notfound].

---

Non-surgical DED care spans environmental measures, tear supplementation, conservation, lid/MGD therapy, and anti-inflammatory drugs, with escalation to advanced options for refractory disease; **individualize therapy** and monitor regularly to optimize outcomes [^116XuECY].

Survey Results

Given the extensive research and development into new therapeutic options for the treatment of DED we anticipated a modified treatment approach among practitioners. Where the more traditional treatments work to address the symptoms and restore the ocular surface, the newer therapeutic modalities endeavour to reverse the primary cause of the DED (such as inflammation).

In this literature review the general trend among practitioners did follow a stepwise treatment approach. Mild dry eye was treated with non-preserved artificial tear substitutes combined with lid hygiene. Therapeutics for moderate to severe dry eye meant the addition of non-preserved gels or ointments and topical anti-inflammatories. In addition, it was found that the proportion of anti-inflammatory drugs used increased with the treatment of moderate to dry eye. There seems to be consensus over the last twenty years that therapeutic management is based on disease severity. Successful management can be determined by improvement of patient-reported symptoms and a reduction in ocular signs.

Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and tear film that results in ocular discomfort, visual disturbances, and tear instability, with potential damage to the cornea and conjunctiva. Risk factors for dry eye syndrome include age (> 50 years old), female sex, environments with low humidity, systemic medications, and autoimmune disorders. There are several treatment options that range from artificial tears to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agents. Treatment of this highly prevalent condition can drastically improve the quality of life of individuals and prevent damage to the ocular surface.

Physicians caring for patients who have Sjögren's syndrome often face a particularly difficult task in managing the dry eye that occurs with this disease. The discomfort produced by the condition and the fluctuation of vision attendant to tear film instability are often the most annoying of the clinical symptoms. The understanding of dry eye disease in both its clinical expression and underlying etiopathology has expanded over the past 10 years with implications for management and therapy. The array of potential treatments both topical and systemic has evolved to provide a much more targeted and effective arsenal from which the clinician may choose.

### Call to action: treating dry eye disease and setting the foundation for successful surgery [^113yy39U]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common disease that can reduce the quality of life. Prevalence estimates vary but have been reported to be as high as 60% in some populations. Diagnosis is complicated by a multifactorial etiology and a disconnection between clinical signs and patient-reported symptomatology. Critically, preexisting DED can exacerbate postoperative dry eye symptoms and reduce patient satisfaction after ocular surgery, highlighting the value of thorough evaluation and screening for signs and symptoms of DED in preparation for ocular surgery. This article reviewed predisposing and exacerbating factors for DED and presented an argument for the importance of adequately treating DED prior to surgery, from the perspective of both the patient and the provider. It briefly reviewed currently available methodologies and emphasized the utility of multimodal diagnosis and treatment algorithms to optimize outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^115nF17E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is frequently undertreated. Barriers to appropriate treatment include the time required to adequately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment based on the patient's severity level, the perception by clinicians that the condition has minor impact on patient well-being, the perception by patients that the disease is normal or less important than other conditions that require treatment, lack of understanding of the disease process, and a perceived paucity of therapeutic options. Supplemental artificial tears and eyelid hygiene are common treatment modalities for dry eye disease, yet many patients continue to experience significant disruption to their daily lives. Our findings suggest that dry eye symptoms are frequently troublesome to the patient at all levels of disease severity, and require attention and adequate treatment. A complete and comprehensive medical and ocular history conducted by clinicians should help correctly identify patients who may have ambiguous symptoms without clinical signs or vice versa, and allow proper treatment and management of dry eye disease.

### Advances, limitations and future perspectives in the diagnosis and management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome [^112WhdG1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a complex systemic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands such as the lacrimal glands. Dry eye disease is one of the most prevalent complications of Sjögren's syndrome, affecting most patients. It significantly impairs quality of life and management is often difficult and unsatisfactory, in part due to weak correlation between symptoms and signs and poor recognition of the three main subtypes aqueous-deficient, evaporative and neuropathic dry eye. This review provides an overview of key aspects of dry eye disease, such as its multifactorial aetiology and recent insights into pathophysiology. The uses and pitfalls of commonly-used diagnostic tests for dry eye are reviewed, as well as the increasing number of new imaging technologies and biomarkers to refine diagnosis. There are many current and emerging treatment options for dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome, but high-level evidence of efficacy is mostly lacking, as are evidence-based treatment algorithms. All these aspects make the management of dry eye in Sjögren's syndrome challenging.

### Managing Sjögren's syndrome and non-Sjögren syndrome dry eye with anti-inflammatory therapy [^1152Kfkr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

SS and non–SS dry eye are chronic diseases that can significantly affect quality of life. There are many options for treatment on the market; however, after a decade, cyclosporine A is the only approved drug specifically designed to treat inflammation in dry eye syndromes. As our understanding of the pathogenesis of dry eye increases, we hope that this newfound knowledge will translate into the design of drugs that specifically target immune pathways.

Through a search of clinical trials databases, we were able to determine that there were 13 relevant clinical trials; however, only one of these had published results. A RCT has been registered in the Netherlands, investigating cognitive behavioural therapy and exercise training to treat fatigue in SS and non-SS sicca syndrome, but no results have yet been published. Further research is recommended into clinically relevant non-pharmacological interventions for which there is evidence of efficacy in other conditions with similar symptoms; such as cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy for fatigue management in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

A Cochrane systematic review of punctal plugs for dry eyes concluded that they provided some symptomatic relief in severe dry eyes, and it is likely that they would be of benefit in pSS as well as in other dry patient groups. Further investigation into any differences between pSS dry eye treatment and standard dry eye treatment is warranted.

Conclusion

Overall, we identified no current evidence to support any non-pharmacological interventions to improve the quality of life for people with pSS. The area needs good quality, appropriately powered RCTs that are reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. Outcomes should be sensitive to changes that are important and relevant to patients.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^116XuECY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome staged management and treatment recommendations outline a stepwise approach. Step 1 includes "Education on the condition, its management, treatment, and prognosis", environmental modification, dietary education "including oral essential fatty acid supplementation", medication review, "Ocular lubricants of various types (if MGD is present, then consider lipid-containing supplements)", and "Eyelid hygiene of various types and warm compresses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 2 additions including "Nonpreserved ocular lubricants to minimize preservative-induced toxicity", Demodex therapy with "Tea tree oil or lotilaner drop treatment for Demodex (if present), also off-label use of ivermectin 1% cream for Demodex", tear conservation with "Punctal occlusion" and "Moisture chamber spectacles/goggles", "Overnight treatments (such as ointment or moisture chamber devices)", "In-office, physical heating and expression of the meibomian glands (including thermal pulsation devices)", and prescription drugs to manage dry eye disease (DED) such as "Topical antibiotic or corticosteroid applied to the lid margins short-term for anterior blepharitis (if present)", "Topical corticosteroid (limited duration)", "Topical secretagogues", "Topical nonglucocorticoid immunomodulatory drugs (such as cyclosporine)", "Topical LFA-1 antagonist drugs (such as lifitegrast)", "Topical water-free lipophilic liquid (perfluorohexyloctane)", "Nasal spray (such as varenicline), cholinergic neuroactivation via the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway", and "Oral macrolide or tetracycline antibiotics". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 3 options including "Oral secretagogues", "Autologous/allogeneic serum eye drops", "Platelet-rich plasma eye drops", "Blood-based products", and therapeutic contact lenses including "Soft bandage lenses with caution" and "Rigid scleral lenses". If the above options are inadequate consider Step 4 options including "Topical corticosteroid for longer duration", "Amniotic membrane grafts", "Surgical punctal occlusion (punctal cautery)", and "Other surgical approaches (e.g., tarsorrhaphy, minor salivary gland transplantation)". Notes state that "One or more options concurrently within each category can be considered within that step of the dry eye disease state", that options "are not ranked according to importance and may be equally valid", that "The severity and etiology of the DED state will dictate the range and number of management options selected from one or more steps", and that prescription drug use "needs to be considered in the context of the individual patient presentation, and the relative level of evidence supporting their use for those specific indications".

Severe dry eye — beyond mild/moderate therapies, the following treatments may be considered for severe dry eye: permanent punctal occlusion can be accomplished by thermal or laser cautery with a stepwise approach so that no more than one punctum is cauterized in each eye at a session, and limited tarsorrhaphy for nonresponders. Autologous serum or autologous plasma rich in growth factors drops have been reported to improve ocular irritation symptoms and conjunctival/corneal dye staining in Sjögren's syndrome (I+, Insufficient, Strong), and a systematic review reported a benefit in symptoms with 20% autologous serum compared with artificial tears over 2 weeks; when repeated blood sampling is not possible, allogeneic serum eye drops have been shown to be an effective and safe alternative (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). For filamentary keratitis, options include debridement (moistened cotton-tip applicator, cellulose sponge, or forceps), topical mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine to decrease mucinous tear film viscosity, and soft contact lenses to prevent recurrence; if neurotrophic keratopathy is present, lenses should be used with caution due to infection risk, and insertion of a self-retaining or sutureless amniotic membrane in refractory cases should be considered with recognition of the short-term effect. Rigid gas-permeable scleral lenses have been used successfully for years, but use may be limited by fitting difficulties, cost, and patient ability to manage insertion and removal. Oral medications are available (I-, Moderate, Discretionary); cholinergic agonists such as cevimeline are FDA approved to treat dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome, improve ocular irritation symptoms and aqueous tear production, and may have fewer adverse systemic side effects than oral pilocarpine. In a trial, pilocarpine 5 mg orally four times a day produced significantly greater improvement in the ability to focus during reading and in blurred vision versus placebo in Sjogren syndrome, but there was no improvement in light sensitivity, ocular discomfort, and other dry eye symptoms; the most common side effect was excessive sweating in over 40% of patients, and Two percent withdrew due to this and other drug-related side effects.

Dry eye syndrome — classification and symptom severity indicate that more-effective relief of patient symptoms can be achieved if the ophthalmologist can differentiate conditions related to dry eye from other causes, that patients with moderate dry eye syndrome have increased discomfort and frequency of symptoms with a more consistent negative effect on visual function while severe disease may become constant and potentially disabling, and that dry eye syndrome is categorized into aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative or a mixture of the two, which coexist in the majority of patients with the disease.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116HKikh]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Sjögren's syndrome–related dry eye evaluation and therapy guidance: Evaluation of the patient should include symptoms of both discomfort and visual disturbance and determination of the relative contribution of aqueous production deficiency and evaporative loss of tear volume; objective parameters of tear film stability, tear osmolarity, degree of lid margin disease, and ocular surface damage should be used to stage severity to assist in selecting appropriate treatment options; patient education is critical; and treatment options include tear supplementation and stabilization, control of inflammation of the lacrimal gland and ocular surface, and possible stimulation of tear production according to the character and severity. Although there was paucity of rigorous clinical trials to support therapy recommendations, topical lubricants, topical anti-inflammatory therapy, and tear-conserving strategies seemed effective; the efficacy of oral secretagogues was greater in the treatment of oral dryness than ocular dryness; although oral hydroxychloroquine is commonly prescribed, the literature did not demonstrate strong evidence for the efficacy of this treatment for dry eye; another systematic review confirmed benefits for oral secretagogues (pilocarpine and cevimeline) for sicca features (mostly oral) and topical anti-inflammatories (cyclosporine) for moderate or severe dry eye; anti-tumor necrosis factor agents were not found to be effective, and the evidence for efficacy of rituximab was not strong.

### Dysfunctional tear syndrome: a Delphi approach to treatment recommendations [^1159fvXk]. Cornea (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop current treatment recommendations for dry eye disease from consensus of expert advice.

Methods

Of 25 preselected international specialists on dry eye, 17 agreed to participate in a modified, 2-round Delphi panel approach. Based on available literature and standards of care, a survey was presented to each panelist. A two-thirds majority was used for consensus building from responses obtained. Treatment algorithms were created. Treatment recommendations for different types and severity levels of dry eye disease were the main outcome.

Results

A new term for dry eye disease was proposed: dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS). Treatment recommendations were based primarily on patient symptoms and signs. Available diagnostic tests were considered of secondary importance in guiding therapy. Development of algorithms was based on the presence or absence of lid margin disease and disturbances of tear distribution and clearance. Disease severity was considered the most important factor for treatment decision-making and was categorized into 4 levels. Severity was assessed on the basis of tear substitute requirements, symptoms of ocular discomfort, and visual disturbance. Clinical signs present in lids, tear film, conjunctiva, and cornea were also used for categorization of severity. Consensus was reached on treatment algorithms for DTS with and without concurrent lid disease.

Conclusion

Panelist opinion relied on symptoms and signs (not tests) for selection of treatment strategies. Therapy is chosen to match disease severity and presence versus absence of lid margin disease or tear distribution and clearance disturbances.

### Over the counter (OTC) artificial tear drops for dry eye syndrome [^1152kdUE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Over the counter (OTC) artificial tears historically have been the first line of treatment for dry eye syndrome and dry eye-related conditions like contact lens discomfort, yet currently we know little regarding the overall efficacy of individual, commercially available artificial tears. This review provides a much needed meta-analytical look at all randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials that have analyzed head-to-head comparisons of OTC artificial tears.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of OTC artificial tear applications in the treatment of dry eye syndrome compared with another class of OTC artificial tears, no treatment, or placebo.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to December 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to December 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) and the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) website (www.fda.gov). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 4 December 2015. We searched reference lists of included trials for any additional trials not identified by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

This review includes randomized controlled trials with adult participants who were diagnosed with dry eye, regardless of race and gender. We included trials in which the age of participants was not reported, and clinical trials comparing OTC artificial tears with another class of OTC artificial tears, placebo, or no treatment. This review did not consider head-to-head comparisons of artificial tears with another type of dry-eye therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened the search results, reviewed full-text copies for eligibility, examined risk of bias, and extracted data. We performed meta-analysis for trials that compared similar interventions and reported comparable outcomes with sufficient data. We summarized all other included trial results in the text.

Main Results

We included 43 randomized controlled trials (3497 participants with dry eye). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included trials with respect to types of diagnostic criteria, interventions, comparisons, and measurements taken, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. The review found that, in general, there was uncertainty whether different OTC artificial tears provide similar relief of signs and symptoms when compared with each other or placebo. Nevertheless, we found that 0.2% polyacrylic acid-based artificial tears were consistently more effective at treating dry eye symptoms than 1.4% polyvinyl alcohol-based artificial tears in two trials assessing this comparison (175 participants). All other included artificial tears produced contradictory between-group results or found no between-group differences. Our review also found that OTC artificial tears may be generally safe, but not without adverse events. Overall, we assessed the quality of evidence as low due to high risks of bias among included trials and poor reporting of outcome measures which were insufficient for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we identified an additional 18 potentially eligible trials that were reported only in clinical trial registers with no associated results or publications. These trials reportedly enrolled 2079 total participants for whom no data are available. Such lack of reporting of trial results represents a high risk of publication bias.

Authors' Conclusions

OTC artificial tears may be safe and effective means for treating dry eye syndrome; the literature indicates that the majority of OTC artificial tears may have similar efficacies. This conclusion could be greatly skewed by the inconsistencies in study designs and inconsistencies in reporting trial results. Additional research is therefore needed before we can draw robust conclusions about the effectiveness of individual OTC artificial tear formulations.

### A systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sjögren's syndrome [^116rPtuh]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary SS (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting exocrine glands, resulting in dry eyes and dry mouth. It has a female preponderance, and a recent meta-analysis has identified a prevalence rate of 74/100 000 inhabitants, using the American–European Consensus Criteria. The disease can also have extra-glandular features, with patients experiencing symptoms of pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, low mood and an increased risk of developing lymphoma. Consequently, many patients experience reduced quality of life and difficulty with carrying out a range of daily activities. Furthermore, the disease is associated with significant direct and indirect healthcare costs equating to ∼£12–15 000 per patient, per year. Similar figures have been identified in the United States. European studies have identified increased physician visits and higher work disability for patients with a diagnosis of pSS.

Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS may vary according to the particular symptom that they are targeting. They may be complex, target several symptoms at once and be conducted by more than one member of a multidisciplinary team. Such interventions may include fatigue and mood management, and patient education by healthcare professionals. Other interventions may be conducted by a clinician with specialist skills (such as occupational therapy to establish a balance in daily activities and improve function), insertion of lacrimal punctal plugs for dry eye symptoms or the use of acupuncture for the symptomatic relief of dry mouth.

Treatments in clinics for people with pSS tend to focus on pharmacological interventions. However, a recent systematic review has shown that evidence to support the efficacy of pharmacological therapies in pSS is poor. Given the range of bio-psychosocial symptoms that these patients experience, it is possible that there are effective non-pharmacological treatments that could improve symptoms. The reduced impact of symptoms consequently may lead to an improvement in quality of life, improved work capacity and a reduction in economic costs to society. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for PSS in adults.

### Punctal occlusion for dry eye syndrome [^114apacS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Dry eye syndrome is a disorder of the tear film that is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. Punctal occlusion is a mechanical treatment that blocks the tear drainage system in order to aid in the preservation of natural tears on the ocular surface.

Objectives

To assess the effects of punctal plugs versus no punctal plugs, different types of punctal plugs, and other interventions for managing dry eye.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 December 2016), Embase.com (1947 to 8 December 2016), PubMed (1948 to 8 December 2016), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database) (1982 to 8 December 2016), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com; last searched 18 November 2012 - this resource is now archived), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov; searched 8 December 2016), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en; searched 8 December 2016). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We also searched the Science Citation Index-Expanded database and reference lists of included studies. The evidence was last updated on 8 December 2016 SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of collagen or silicone punctal plugs in symptomatic participants diagnosed with aqueous tear deficiency or dry eye syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for additional information when needed.

Main Results

We included 18 trials (711 participants, 1249 eyes) from Austria, Canada, China, Greece, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Turkey, the UK, and the United States in this review. We also identified one ongoing trial. Overall we judged these trials to be at unclear risk of bias because they were poorly reported. We assessed the evidence for eight comparisons. Five trials compared punctal plugs with no punctal plugs (control). Three of these trials employed a sham treatment and two trials observed the control group. Two trials did not report outcome data relevant to this review. There was very low-certainty evidence on symptomatic improvement. The three trials that reported this outcome used different scales to measure symptoms. In all three trials, there was little or no improvement in symptom scores with punctal plugs compared with no punctal plugs. Low-certainty evidence from one trial suggested less ocular surface staining in the punctal plug group compared with the no punctal plug group however this difference was small and possibly clinically unimportant (mean difference (MD) in fluorescein staining score -1.50 points, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.12; eyes = 61). Similarly there was a small difference in tear film stability with people in the punctal plug group having more stability (MD 1.93 seconds more, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.20; eyes = 28, low-certainty evidence). The number of artificial tear applications was lower in the punctal plug group compared with the no punctal plugs group in one trial (MD -2.70 applications, 95% CI -3.11 to -2.29; eyes = 61, low-certainty evidence). One trial with low-certainty evidence reported little or no difference between the groups in Schirmer scores, but did not report any quantitative data on aqueous tear production. Very low-certainty evidence on adverse events suggested that events occurred reasonably frequently in the punctal plug group and included epiphora, itching, tenderness and swelling of lids with mucous discharge, and plug displacement. One trial compared punctal plugs with cyclosporine (20 eyes) and one trial compared punctal plugs with oral pilocarpine (55 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. Five trials compared punctal plugs with artificial tears. In one of the trials punctal plugs was combined with artificial tears and compared with artificial tears alone. There was very low-certainty evidence on symptomatic improvement. Low-certainty evidence of little or no improvement in ocular surface staining comparing punctal plugs with artificial tears (MD right eye 0.10 points higher, 0.56 lower to 0.76 higher, MD left eye 0.60 points higher, 0.10 to 1.10 higher) and low-certainty evidence of little or no difference in aqueous tear production (MD 0.00 mm/5 min, 0.33 lower to 0.33 higher)Three trials compared punctal plugs in the upper versus the lower puncta, and none of them reported the review outcomes at long-term follow-up. One trial with very low-certainty evidence reported no observed complications, but it was unclear which complications were collected. One trial compared acrylic punctal plugs with silicone punctal plugs and the trial reported outcomes at approximately 11 weeks of follow-up (36 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. One trial compared intracanalicular punctal plugs with silicone punctal plugs at three months follow-up (57 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision. Finally, two trials with very low-certainty evidence compared collagen punctal plugs versus silicone punctal plugs (98 eyes). The evidence was judged to be very low-certainty due to a combination of risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the investigators of the individual trials concluded that punctal plugs are an effective means for treating dry eye signs and symptoms, the evidence in this systematic review suggests that improvements in symptoms and commonly tested dry eye signs are inconclusive. Despite the inclusion of 11 additional trials, the findings of this updated review are consistent with the previous review published in 2010. The type of punctal plug investigated, the type and severity of dry eye being treated, and heterogeneity in trial methodology confounds our ability to make decisive statements regarding the effectiveness of punctal plug use. Although punctal plugs are believed to be relatively safe, their use is commonly associated with epiphora and, less commonly, with inflammatory conditions such as dacryocystitis.

### Making the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome in patients with dry eye [^113uLnre]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic and progressive systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves immune-mediated damage to the lacrimal and salivary glands. This pathology translates into hallmark clinical symptoms of dry eyes (keratitis sicca or keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth. SS is the second most prevalent autoimmune rheumatic disease, likely affecting close to four million Americans.–The exact prevalence is difficult to determine due to variations in disease definitions and lack of a diagnostic gold standard. Womenand Caucasiansare the predominantly affected demographic groups. SS is primarily a disease of middle- to older aged adults, with onset typically occurring in the fourth or fifth decade of life. In one large Scandinavian study, the prevalence of SS was approximately seven times higher among elderly individuals (71–74 years of age) compared with a middle-aged population (40–44 years). The condition is associated with significant impairments in quality of life–and functioning.

While rheumatologists typically oversee the overall care of SS patients, a multidisciplinary team that involves ophthalmology specialists, as well as oral care professionals, is critical not just for the management of known SS patients, but also to identify potential SS cases. The symptoms of SS can progress slowly and are often highly variable in presentation, making diagnosis difficult.–Consequently, it is estimated that the disease remains undiagnosed in more than half of affected adults. Data suggest that patients experience symptoms for an average of 3.9 years before a diagnosis of SS is made. Unfortunately, such delays in diagnosis can be a source of psychological distress from unexplained symptoms, not to mention prolonging the initiation of appropriate treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of SS is essential to prevent or mitigate development of complications such as cerebrovascular events and myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, dry eye symptoms are very non-specific, especially in the immediate absence of other SS-related complaints or findings. In a recent US survey of eye care specialists, most practitioners reported relying primarily on patient history to guide treatment decisions. These findings underscore the need for reliable objective measures and diagnostic tools to quantify and classify dry eye symptoms.

This review aims to provide eye care professionals with an understanding of methods for distinguishing SS dry eye from other types of dry eye and to describe options for a differential diagnostic approach. The reader is reminded that SS is a systemic disease with many non-ocular manifestations that are not addressed in detail herein, but have been reviewed elsewhere. Collaboration with a rheumatologist is essential when SS is suspected in a given patient.

### TFOS DEWS III: management and therapy [^114g5CgZ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

This report provides an evidence-based review of current strategies to manage dry eye disease (DED). First-line management focuses on methods to replenish, conserve and stimulate the tear film, with an emphasis on ocular supplements, which remain the cornerstone of DED treatment. Meibomian gland dysfunction, a primary contributor to DED, is typically treated with warm compresses and a wide variety of in-office treatments, including device-driven technologies to warm the eyelids, intense pulsed light therapy, low-level light therapy and other new and emerging technologies. Lid hygiene treatments include lid wipes, anti-Demodex therapies, blepharoexfoliation and topical antibiotics. DED caused by certain etiological drivers can benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies, including corticosteroids, T-cell immunomodulatory topical drugs and a wide variety of pharmacological agents, in addition to biologic tear substitutes such as autologous serum and platelet-rich plasma. Emerging therapies, such as neuromodulation via nasal neurostimulation and novel pharmacological treatments offer potential future options. Advanced options, including amniotic membrane grafts and complex surgical methods, provide options for severe or refractory cases. Lifestyle modifications, including optimized blinking, dietary supplementation and environmental adjustments, play a crucial role in long-term management. Patient education and adherence to treatment regimens remain essential for sustained symptom relief. The TFOS DEWS III prescribing algorithm provides an evidence-based framework to offer guidance to clinicians in selecting relevant interventions based on disease etiology that aim to provide targeted management of the subtype of DED that an individual is experiencing.

### Bridging the gap in managing dry eye disease: a consensus report by the Taiwan society of cataract and refractive surgeons [^112gYU19]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment and management

Comprehensive and individualized treatment approaches are vital to successfully restoring homeostasis of the ocular surface. These approaches include various therapeutic interventions that are typically determined by the clinical presentation, accurate diagnosis, disease severity level, and DED classification.

The treatment progression for DED follows a step-wise intervention approach, adapted from the protocol of the TFOS DEWS II report, and is presented in Fig. 1. Additional details are provided Table 1. The process begins with step 1, which emphasizes education, lifestyle modifications, and the use of lubricating eye drops. It then advances to step 2, which involves both nonpharmacological and mild pharmacological management, including use of a nonpreserved ocular lubricant and specific prescription medications. If these initial treatment steps are inadequate, more intensive pharmacological management can be implemented in step 3, with further progression to surgical interventions combined with aggressive pharmacological prescriptions in step 4. The severity level of DED may be used to determine the corresponding treatment step (Table 2). If a patient responds positively to the initial treatment, the treatment may be de-escalated to the corresponding disease severity level.

### Managing Sjögren's syndrome and non-Sjögren syndrome dry eye with anti-inflammatory therapy [^117Gbd7t]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Dry eye from Sjögren's syndrome is a multifactorial disease that results in dysfunction of the lacrimal functional unit. Studies have shown changes in tear composition, including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteinase. T-lymphocytes have been shown to increase in the conjunctiva and lacrimal glands in patient and animal models. This inflammation is in part responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease, which results in symptoms of eye irritation, ocular surface epithelial disease, and loss of corneal barrier function. There are a number of anti-inflammatory approaches for treating this disease. The current study reviews details of immune response and anti–inflammatory therapies used to control this disease.

Dry eye topical treatment

Dry eye topical treatment approach is based on: (a) non-pharmacologic measures, including avoidance of dry, smoky, windy environments, prolonged reading, computer use, use of humidifiers, goggles with side seals/moisture chambers, avoidance of aggravating drugs (diuretics, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines), and punctual occlusion in refractory cases (plugs, cauterization, surgery); (b) replacement of tear volume, that is, artificial tears (preservative-free products, hypotonic solutions, and emulsions), autologous serum eye drops and platelet releasate, which are promising treatments especially for patients intolerant to artificial tears or with refractory KCS (the major limitation to a widespread use of these products is related to their preparation and preservation); (c) topical drugs counting ciclosporin A, which was approved for the treatment of dry eye by the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) but not by the European Medicine Agency (EMA), corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

There are few rigorous studies on the effect of topical medications for eyes in patients with SS. As far as artificial teardrops are concerned, emulsions containing hyaluronate and hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, hypotonic solutions that decrease the tear film osmolality, and preservative-free products that are less irritating when applied chronically on a daily basis, seem to be the best options.

In patients with severe KCS, topical NSAIDs can be effective in relieving ocular pain, but they should only be used for a short time and under medical supervision since they reduce corneal sensitivity, predisposing users to corneal damage.

Patients with severe dryness and refractory KCS may also require topical corticosteroid treatment. Although glucocorticoids exert a rapid and intense anti-inflammatory effect, they should only be used for a short time since they can induce severe side effects such as glaucoma and cataracts.

A number of studies were carried out with the use of topical ciclosporin A in patients with KCS and SS, showing good results in terms of dry symptom relief and tear production.

Dry eye disease (DED) is a common ocular condition, but the diagnosis relative to other ocular conditions and the evaluation of severity of the condition has often been difficult. This challenge can be due to clinical signs and symptoms not always correlating with each other. An understanding of the various components which create the condition, as well as the diagnostic measures used to evaluate these components, is useful to the clinician working with DED patients. This review paper will discuss traditional diagnostic options, diagnostic imaging, and Advanced Point of Care testing capabilities to determine the severity level of dry eye disease more adequately.

### Autologous serum eye drops for dry eye [^115HYykK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Theoretically, autologous serum eye drops (AS) have a potential advantage over traditional therapies based on the assumption that ASserve not only as a lacrimal substitute to provide lubrication, but also contain other biochemical components mimicking natural tears more closely. The application of AS in dry eye treatment has gained popularity as a second-line therapy in the treatment of dry eye. Published studies on the subject indicate that autologous serum could be an effective treatment for dry eye.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of AS compared to artificial tears for treating dry eye.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE,(January 1950 to April 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences(LILACS) (January 1982 to April 2013), themetaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov(www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We also searched the Science Citation Index Expanded database (September 2013) and reference lists of included studies. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 15 April 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which AS was compared to artificial tears in the treatment of dry eye in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles of potentially eligible trials. Two review authors extracted data and assessed the methodological quality and characteristics of the included trials. We contacted investigators for missing data. For both primary and secondary outcomes, we reported mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified four eligible RCTs in which AS was compared with artificial tear treatment or saline in individuals (n = 72 participants)with dry eye of various etiologies (Sjögren's syndrome-related dry eye, non-Sjögren's syndrome dry eye and postoperative dry eye induced by laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)). The quality of the evidence provided by these trials was variable. A majority of the risk of bias domains were judged to have an unclear risk of bias in two trials owing to insufficient reporting of trial characteristics. One trial was considered to have a low risk of bias for most domains while another was considered to have a high risk of bias for most domains. Incomplete outcome reporting and heterogeneity in the participant populations and follow-up periods prevented the inclusion of these trials in a summary meta-analysis. For the primary outcome, improvement in participant-reported symptoms at one month, one trial (12 participants) showed no difference in participant-reported symptoms between 20% AS and artificial tears. Based on the results of two trials in 32 participants, 20% AS may provide some improvement in participant-reported symptoms compared to traditional artificial tears after two weeks of treatment. One trial also showed positive results with a mean difference in tear breakup time (TBUT) of 2.00 seconds (95% CI 0.99 to 3.01 seconds) between 20% AS and artificial tears after two weeks, which were not similar to findings from the other trials. Based on all other objective clinical assessments included in this review, AS was not associated with improvements in aqueous tear production measured by Schirmer's test (two trials, 33 participants), ocular surface condition with fluorescein (four trials, 72 participants) or Rose Bengal staining (three trials, 60 participants), and epithelial metaplasia by impression cytology compared to artificial tears (one trial, 12 participants). Data on adverse effects were not reported by three of the included studies. In one study, there were no serious adverse events reported with the collection of and treatment with AS.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall there was inconsistency in the possible benefits of AS in improving participant-reported symptoms and TBUT and lack of effect based on other objective clinical measures. Well-planned, large, high-quality RCTs are warranted, in different severities of dry eye and using standardized questionnaires to measure participant-reported outcomes and objective clinical tests as well as objective biomarkers to assess the benefit of AS therapy for dry eye.

### Personalized management of dry eye disease: beyond artificial tears [^113Eoo6A]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The etiology of DED is multifactorial, and thus management of DED cannot be considered as a one-size-fits-all. Personalized treatment for DED involves clinical assessments of tear film and meibomian gland function, as well as taking the patient's medical and treatment history into consideration. The TFOS DEWS II Management and Therapy Report reports various treatments for DED, including topical prescriptions (corticosteroids, secretagogues, antibiotics, LFA-1 antagonist drugs), oral antibiotics, lid hygiene, warm compression, therapeutic contact lenses, moisture chamber and even surgical punctal occlusion. Artificial tears are one of the options in the armamentarium of therapies for DED, and customization of the treatment will likely contribute to the success of DED management because of its complexity and variability among patients.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^112TVn4R]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Quality of ophthalmic care core criteria — quality ophthalmic care is provided in a manner and with the skill that is consistent with the best interests of the patient, and the ophthalmologist is first and foremost a physician who demonstrates compassion and concern, utilizes the science and art of medicine to help alleviate patient fear and suffering, strives to develop and maintain clinical skills at the highest feasible level through training and continuing education, ensures that needy patients receive necessary care directly or through referral and supports activities that promote health and prevent disease and disability, and respects the dignity and integrity of patients without exploiting their vulnerability. The essence of quality care is a meaningful partnership relationship between patient and physician in which the ophthalmologist strives to communicate effectively, educates patients about the nature and progress of their condition and about proper and appropriate therapeutic modalities, and ensures meaningful participation in decisions to improve motivation and compliance with the agreed plan of treatment and to help alleviate fears and concerns. The ophthalmologist uses his or her best judgment in choosing and timing appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and the frequency of evaluation and follow-up with due regard to urgency, the nature of the condition, and unique needs and desires, carries out only those procedures for which he or she is adequately trained, experienced and competent or, when necessary, is assisted by someone who is depending on urgency and the availability and accessibility of alternative providers, provides appropriate alternate ophthalmic care with adequate mechanisms for informing patients when unavailable, and maintains complete and accurate medical records.

Counseling and referral in dry eye — in moderate to severe cases that are unresponsive to treatment or when systemic disease is suspected, timely referral to an ophthalmologist who is knowledgeable and experienced in the management of these entities is recommended. Referral to an internist or rheumatologist can be considered for patients with systemic immune dysfunction or for those who require immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with systemic disease such as primary Sjogren's syndrome, secondary Sjogren's (associated with a connective-tissue disease), or connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis should be managed by an appropriate medical specialist. Patients who have dry eye and are considering keratorefractive surgery, particularly LASIK, should be cautioned that keratorefractive surgery may worsen their dry eye symptoms; effective treatment for dry eye should be achieved before undergoing keratorefractive surgery, and uncontrolled dry eye syndrome is a contraindication for keratorefractive surgery. Patients with severe dry eye are at greater risk for contact lens intolerance and associated complications.

### Autologous serum eye drops for dry eye [^114W2rPe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Theoretically, autologous serum eye drops (AS) offer a potential advantage over traditional therapies on the assumption that AS not only serve as a lacrimal substitute to provide lubrication but contain other biochemical components that allow them to mimic natural tears more closely. Application of AS has gained popularity as second-line therapy for patients with dry eye. Published studies on this subject indicate that autologous serum could be an effective treatment for dry eye.

Objectives

We conducted this review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AS given alone or in combination with artificial tears as compared with artificial tears alone, saline, placebo, or no treatment for adults with dry eye.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2016), Embase (January 1980 to July 2016), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to July 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We also searched the Science Citation Index Expanded database (December 2016) and reference lists of included studies. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 5 July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared AS versus artificial tears for treatment of adults with dry eye.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts and assessed full-text reports of potentially eligible trials. Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias and characteristics of included trials. We contacted investigators to ask for missing data. For both primary and secondary outcomes, we reported mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We did not perform meta-analysis owing to differences in outcome assessments across trials.

Main Results

We identified five eligible RCTs (92 participants) that compared AS versus artificial tears or saline in individuals with dry eye of various origins (Sjögren's syndrome-related dry eye, non-Sjögren's syndrome dry eye, and postoperative dry eye induced by laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)). We assessed the certainty of evidence as low or very low because of lack of reporting of quantitative data for most outcomes and unclear or high risk of bias among trials. We judged most risk of bias domains to have unclear risk in two trials owing to insufficient reporting of trial characteristics, and we considered one trial to have high risk of bias for most domains. We judged the remaining two trials to have low risk of bias; however, these trials used a cross-over design and did not report data in a way that could be used to compare outcomes between treatment groups appropriately. Incomplete outcome reporting and heterogeneity among outcomes and follow-up periods prevented inclusion of these trials in a summary meta-analysis. Three trials compared AS with artificial tears; however, only one trial reported quantitative data for analysis. Low-certainty evidence from one trial suggested that AS might provide some improvement in participant-reported symptoms compared with artificial tears after two weeks of treatment; the mean difference in mean change in symptom score measured on a visual analogue scale (range 0 to 100, with higher scores representing worse symptoms) was -12.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) -20.16 to -3.84; 20 participants). This same trial found mixed results with respect to ocular surface outcomes; the mean difference in mean change in scores between AS and artificial tears was -0.9 (95% CI -1.47 to -0.33; 20 participants; low-certainty evidence) for fluorescein staining and -2.2 (95% CI -2.73 to -1.67; 20 participants; low-certainty evidence) for Rose Bengal staining. Both staining scales range from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating worse results. The mean change in tear film break-up time was 2.00 seconds longer (95% CI 0.99 to 3.01; 20 participants; low-certainty evidence) in the AS group than in the artificial tears group. Investigators reported no clinically meaningful differences in Schirmer's test scores between groups (mean difference -0.40 mm, 95% CI -2.91 to 2.11; 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of these three trials reported tear hyperosmolarity and adverse events. Two trials compared AS versus saline; however, only one trial reported quantitative data for analysis of only one outcome (Rose Bengal staining). Trial investigators of the two studies reported no differences in symptom scores, fluorescein staining scores, tear film break-up times, or Schirmer's test scores between groups at two to four weeks' follow-up. Very low-certainty evidence from one trial suggested that AS might provide some improvement in Rose Bengal staining scores compared with saline after four weeks of treatment; the mean difference in Rose Bengal staining score (range from 0 to 9, with higher scores showing worse results) was -0.60 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.09; 35 participants). Neither trial reported tear hyperosmolarity outcomes. One trial reported adverse events; two of 12 participants had signs of conjunctivitis with negative culture that did resolve.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, investigators reported inconsistency in possible benefits of AS for improving participant-reported symptoms and other objective clinical measures. There might be some benefit in symptoms with AS compared with artificial tears in the short-term, but we found no evidence of an effect after two weeks of treatment. Well-planned, large, high-quality RCTs are warranted to examine participants with dry eye of different severities by using standardized questionnaires to measure participant-reported outcomes, as well as objective clinical tests and objective biomarkers to assess the benefit of AS therapy for dry eye.

### Agreement of physician treatment practices with the international task force guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of dry eye disease [^113DTmQx]. Cornea (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the clinical implementation of guidelines for the treatment of dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS) developed by the International Task Force (ITF) of dry eye disease experts.

Methods

Nine physicians implemented the ITF guidelines for 3 months. Newly diagnosed patients with DTS rated their ocular symptoms and were clinically examined. Using the guidelines, physicians determined the DTS severity level (0–4, where 4 is most severe) and made their therapeutic choices.

Results

Of 183 patients enrolled (mean age, 65.1 years; range, 25–91 years), 67% presented without lid margin disease, and 68% had no apparent ocular surface inflammation. Symptoms were significantly more severe in patients with altered tear distribution or evident inflammation (P < 0.05). Most patients diagnosed at severity level 1 did not have lid margin disease (56/61, 92%), and inflammation was not apparent (53/58, 91%); 43% of severity level 1 patients (27/63) were treated at level 2 (therapeutic choices include unpreserved tears or topical cyclosporine). Most patients presenting with inflammation were diagnosed at severity level 2 (74%, 32/43). More than 9 in 10 severity level 2 patients were treated at level 2 (100/106; 94%). Physicians reported that 96% of their treatment recommendations were consistent with management they would have recommended if they had not consulted the ITF guidelines. They spent an average of 4.5 minutes per patient applying the guidelines.

Conclusions

Implementation of the ITF guidelines was simple and not time consuming. Many practitioners chose to treat patients diagnosed at severity level 1 with treatments at level 2 that include unpreserved tears and topical cyclosporine.

### Treatment of dry eye disease [^116sEVJe]. The Consultant Pharmacist (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dry eye disease:

- Definition: DED, also known as dry eye syndrome or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic, multifactorial condition characterized by a deficiency in tear production or excessive evaporation, leading to ocular surface inflammation and discomfort.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of DED involves two main mechanisms: aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. Aqueous tear deficiency is due to decreased tear production, often associated with age, autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, or certain medications. Evaporative dry eye is primarily due to meibomian gland dysfunction, which results in an unstable tear film and increased tear evaporation.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of DED varies widely globally, depending on the geographic region and the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from 5% to 50%. In the US, the prevalence of DED in adults is estimated at 5–7%, with rates 2–3 times higher in females.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for DED include older age, female sex, contact lens wear, screen time, environment factors such as pollution and low humidity, hormonal changes such as menopause, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome, and certain medications including antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and some antihypertensives.
- Disease course: The clinical course of DED is characterized by symptoms of ocular discomfort, irritation, pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and visual disturbances. Signs of DED include conjunctival injection, corneal staining, and meibomian gland dysfunction. DED can also impact daily activities such as reading, driving, and using digital screens.

### Simple surgical punctal occlusion with high frequency radiowave electrosurgery [^112uVJpm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Dry eye disease is a multifactorial disease that can show various symptoms due to changes in tear film homeostasis. According to its pathophysiology, dry eye disease can be divided into evaporative dry eye (EDE) caused by Meibomian gland dysfunction, blepharitis, blinking, SCL wear, vitamin A deficiency, topical drug preservatives, ocular surface diseases and Accutane use and aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE) caused by decreased tear secretion including Sjögren's syndrome (SS) lacrimal deficiency, lacrimal duct obstruction and systemic drug use.

Besides supplementing the lack of tears simply with artificial tears for treating dry eye syndrome, various medical treatment options such as lipid supplementation and autologous serum depending on the cause of the disease are also available. Interventional treatment method with punctal occlusion such as punctal plug can help the ocular surface to keep the natural tear film for a longer duration. It is recommended for ADDE.

Punctal occlusion can be broadly classified into non-surgical and surgical methods. Punctal plug is a typical example of a non-surgical method. The plug can be used temporarily or permanently depending on the material and model. It is easy to manipulate. Several studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in improving symptoms and ocular surface indices in patients with various dry eye syndromes. However, it may irritate the eye or become unable to serve its purpose due to self-extrusion. In addition, inflammation and granuloma formation related to punctal plug may occur. Furthermore, infections including dacryocystitis might develop. Surgical methods include punctal cauterization, conjunctival flap, punctal plug suturing, and extirpation of canaliculus. Coagulating punctum and canaliculi using thermal cautery has been used in clinical trials. Its usefulness has been proven in several studies. However, this method should be carefully considered because it can cause irreversible tissue damage.

Devices using radiofrequency wave have been used in ophthalmology and other medical fields as they are convenient and safe. In addition, they allow precise manipulation. High-frequency wave has less heat dispersion than conventional cautery. Thus, there might be less damage to surrounding tissues with a shallow depth of the burn, resulting in less scarring, adhesion, and changes in appearance after the procedure. In addition, it has the advantage of a quick recovery.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of punctal coagulation using high-frequency radio-wave with relatively low temperatures (7–80°) for ADDE patients refractory to general management.

### Punctal occlusion for dry eye syndrome [^113LB2Hw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Dry eye syndrome is a disorder of the tear film and is associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort. Punctal occlusion is a mechanical treatment in which the tear drainage system is blocked in order to aid in the preservation of natural tears on the ocular surface.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of punctal plugs for the management of dry eye.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 6), MEDLINE (January 1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2010), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov). We also searched the Science Citation Index-Expanded database and reference lists of included studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 21 June 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of collagen or silicone punctal plugs in symptomatic participants diagnosed with aqueous tear deficiency or dry eye syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study investigators for additional information.

Main Results

Seven randomized controlled trials including 305 participants (601 eyes) met the inclusion criteria and are summarized in this review. We did not perform meta-analysis due to appreciable variability in interventions and follow-up intervals. Although punctal plugs provided symptomatic improvement and clinical outcomes also improved from baseline measures, few studies demonstrated a benefit of punctal plugs over the comparison intervention. Reported adverse effects included epiphora (overflow of tears), foreign body sensation, eye irritation, and spontaneous plug loss.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows a relative scarcity of controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of punctal occlusion therapy in dry eye. Although the evidence is very limited, the data suggest that silicone plugs can provide symptomatic relief in severe dry eye. Moreover, temporary collagen plugs appear similarly effective to silicone plugs on a short-term basis.

Introduction

Dry Eye Disease

Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic condition impacting ≥ 30 million people in the United States and ≥ 344 million people globally. It is a multifactorial disease of ocular surface characterized by a loss of tear film homeostasis, and accompanied by ocular symptoms such as eye discomfort and visual disturbances. The prevalence of DED with/without symptoms ranges from 5% to 50%; and based on signs alone, up to 75%. Moreover, the prevalence of DED is reportedly higher in women (9.5%) than men (6.8%); high prevalence (9.5% to 87.5%) is reported with use of digital screens (computers and smartphones).

DED can be classified as aqueous deficient dry eye (ADDE), evaporative dry eye (EDE), and mixed DED. ADDE is due to tear underproduction by the lacrimal glands. EDE can occur due to causes related to either lid (meibomian gland dysfunction [MGD] or blink-related) or ocular surface (mucin deficiency and contact lens wear), resulting in abnormal lipid secretion, tear film instability, and excessive evaporation of tears. Although EDE is considered a leading cause of DED, ADDE can occur without obvious signs of EDE and vice versa. Therefore, as DED progresses, it increasingly adapts clinical characteristics of both ADDE and EDE, that is known as mixed DED.DED patients across the United States were approximately 3 times more likely to be subclassified as EDE (characterized by MGD) than ADDE; and approximately 36% of patients had mixed DED. Further, iatrogenic DED could be caused by topical or systemic drugs, contact lens wear, and ophthalmic surgical/non-surgical procedures. Goblet cells, which produce mucins and contribute to the stability of the tear film and immune defenses, are extremely sensitive to toxic/inflammatory stress and are reduced in density after exposure to iatrogenic factors. Owing to the multifactorial nature of DED, medications that can target multiple underlying pathologies simultaneously are desirable.

Treatment goal for DED is to restore ocular surface and tear film homeostasis. Current treatment options in the management of DED include artificial tears or ocular lubricants, nutraceuticals, anti-inflammatory agents, tear stimulants, autologous serum, antibiotics, and other therapies (eg, physical treatments such as warm compresses, complementary medicines such as herbal products, punctal occlusion, and surgical approaches).

Treatments for the management of dry eye

Artificial tears

A common therapy for dry eye has been the use of artificial tears. These provide temporary relief of symptoms in most cases. There are several artificial tear products on the market with different compound formulations, but all contain similar ingredients such as water, lubricants, and electrolytes. Artificial tears can control symptoms in patients with mild disease but offer only temporary relief. Different lubricants used in the formulation of artificial tears vary in their viscosity and level of hydration. More viscous solutions offer longer relief but cause blurred vision and discomfort. Many products contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, sodium perborate, and sodium chlorate that can cause damage to the ocular surface. In severe cases where administration is needed four times a day or more, preservative-free artificial tears are needed to limit preservative toxicity.

Punctal plugs

Punctal plugs are devices inserted into tear ducts to block drainage and increase the tear film. Insertion of punctal plugs has provided relief for patients suffering from mild severity of dry eye. However, with increased understanding of the pathogenesis of dry eye, punctual plugs can worsen long-term symptoms since without drainage, the tear film becomes saturated with inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

Anti-inflammatory therapies for dry eye

Clinical studies have shown that anti-inflammatory therapies that inhibit the inflammatory mediators reduce the symptoms of dry eye syndrome. The remainder of this review will focus on anti-inflammatory therapies in general, since anti-inflammatory management of dry eye benefits both SS and non-SS forms.

### Is the meibopatch heated pad useful in treating patients with meibomian gland-related dry eye disease?-assessing tolerability, acceptance, and effectiveness [^116eiwXJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Dry Eye Syndrome (DES) significantly impacts vision-related quality of life and poses a substantial financial burden in ophthalmology practice globally. Projected expenditure on DES treatments is estimated to exceed 6.6 billion USD by 2027. The Meibopatch (VISUfarma International, Valbonne, France) represents one of the latest devices designed to enhance treatment adherence and aid in managing Dry Eye Syndrome (DES). However, its long-term acceptance and efficacy among patients with posterior blepharitis, a condition closely linked with Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), has yet to be demonstrated.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic non-responsive blepharitis were enrolled during clinic visits and asked to self-administer Meibopatch treatment for four weeks. The ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire was utilized to evaluate symptoms both at baseline and following the four-week treatment period. Supplementary assessments on acceptability and tolerability were conducted through post-treatment questionnaires.

Results

A total of 43 patients were recruited. The baseline pre-treatment OSDI score ± SD (Standard Deviation) was 47.9 ± 16.4, while the post-treatment OSDI value + SD was 37.7 ± 14.9. Analysis revealed a significant mean difference between pre- and post-treatment OSDI scores (p = 0.0005), indicating notable symptomatic improvement over the assessment duration. However, the findings diverged from evaluations of acceptability and overall patient satisfaction with the Meibopatch.

Conclusion

The results suggest that Meibopatch represents a safe therapeutic option for managing DES. However, the controversy arises from the incongruence between the substantial reduction in symptoms noted from the OSDI scores and the reported patient outcomes regarding satisfaction and effectiveness. Future efforts should focus on validating the OSDI in blepharitis patients and establishing patient-centered outcomes in the realm of DES.

Recommendations for Management and Therapy

TFOS DEWS II recommends individualized management of DED based on the relative contribution of aqueous-deficient and evaporative pathophysiology (to the extent that this can be determined), as well as disease severity. Treatment for DED progresses in a stepwise approach starting with education, dietary modification, lid hygiene, the use of lubricating eye drops, and modification of environmental factors, and progresses to nonpharmacologic and pharmacological management (Table 1). The multifactorial nature of DED requires a multi-targeted treatment approach from the lids and lashes to the tear film; one treatment does not replace another, although some treatments may target multiple aspects of a DED presentation. A medication review is necessary to identify systemic and topical medications that may contribute to DED (Table 2). For patients with early-stage DED, conventional, low-risk and widely available therapies such as warm compresses and over-the-counter artificial tears or other ocular lubricants may be used as first-line treatment. Lid hygiene includes detergent-based cleaning products and microblepharoexfoliation procedure to help remove lid margin debris and scurf, saline hygiene solution containing 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid to reduce biofilm, and warm compresses or lid hyperthermia to soften meibum and to facilitate its egress from the ducts.

### Review of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts for treatment of dry eye [^111b8Cvh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Dry eye syndrome is a prevalent disease that affects visual acuity, activities of daily living, and quality of life. A number of contributory factors affect the severity of dry eye syndrome, including autoimmune disease, environmental surroundings, contact lens use, hormonal changes, anatomical features, chronic inflammation, infections, and iatrogenic factors, such as medications or surgery. Symptoms may include intermittent or constant blurry vision, discomfort, burning, foreign body sensation, hyperemia, dryness, and photophobia. The severity of dry eye syndrome can range from very mild disease to extremely severe cases with vision-threatening consequences. A variety of dry eye treatment modalities exist to address the different causes, symptoms, and consequences of ocular surface disease, including artificial tears, lubricating gels, ophthalmic inserts, anti-inflammatory drops, and surgical procedures. In this paper, an assortment of literature pertaining to the treatment of dry eye syndrome, in particular hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts, is reviewed. These inserts can be used effectively as monotherapy, or in conjunction with other therapies, and should be considered in the treatment of dry eye syndrome.

### Is thermal pulsation therapy effective for dry eyes before and after cataract surgery? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1125sSEh]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meibomian glands produce an oily tear film layer to prevent evaporation, ensuring optimal comfort. Dysfunction of these glands often leads to dry eye syndrome and irritation. One of the emerging non-invasive, effective treatments is thermal pulsation therapy (TPT), which helps alleviate meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) symptoms.TPT combines heat therapy and massage as a treatment for MGD. Furthermore, clinical trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of TPT in treating MGD. Additionally, pulsations are applied to the eyelids to express the liquefied oil from the glands, enhancing oil flow and gland function.

TPT is an effective treatment for MGD. Leading brands include Lipiflow, offering FDA-approved in-office therapy with heat and pulsation; iLux, combining localized heat with manual compression; and TearCare, featuring customizable heated patches with clinician-assisted expression. EyeXpress uses a goggle-like device for bilateral heating, while MiBo Thermoflo applies continuous thermoelectric heat via a handheld device. These technologies improve meibum secretion, alleviate dry eye symptoms, and vary in cost, duration, and patient suitability. These devices are intended to ease MGD symptoms and have been subjected to several clinical trials to determine their safety and effectiveness.

MGD is a significant contributor to dry eye disease (DED). There are two major types of dry eye: aqueous-deficient dry eyes, caused by inadequate tear production, and evaporative dry eyes, for which MGD is the most common cause. Increased keratin production may also block gland openings. Similarly, chronic inflammation may damage the glands, altering normal function.

Cataract surgery may also cause dry eye symptoms postoperatively due to surgical factors and recovery-related incidences. Surgical trauma due to perioperative corneal and ocular surface manipulation may disrupt the tear film and cause inflammation. Similarly, perioperative damage to the corneal nerves responsible for tear production stimulation may alter tear production. In addition, postoperative inflammation may also affect the ocular surface. Anti-inflammatory and antibiotic eye drops postoperatively may also irritate and worsen dry eye symptoms. Moreover, perioperative exposure to air may dry the ocular surface.

### Patient information: dry eye disease… [^115jtRtc]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Risk Factors for Dry Eye Disease Risk factors for dry eye disease include use of contact lenses, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, and history of stem cell transplant. Dry eye disease may be caused by vitamin A deficiency or Bell palsy, a condition involving facial weakness or paralysis that can lead to incomplete eyelid closure. Dry eye disease is typically diagnosed based on ocular symptoms and examination of the eye and eyelid. Patients should be carefully evaluated for conditions that may present similarly to dry eye disease, including a foreign body in the eye, infection, allergic conjunctivitis, and toxic conjunctivitis. First-line treatment for dry eye disease is use of an artificial tears solution, which lubricates the eye.

It is important to be aware that over-the-counter artificial tears products that contain a preservative can cause toxic conjunctivitis if used more than 4 to 6 times per day. Similarly, eye drops that provide redness relief should be used sparingly. Ophthalmic gels and ointments, which are thicker than artificial tears, may cause blurring of vision so are generally recommended for use before bedtime. Lifestyle Modifications for Dry Eye Disease Aerobic exercise should be encouraged because it increases secretion of tears. Ingestion of low-glycemic-index foods has also been associated with improvement in dry eye symptoms. For individuals who wear contact lenses, decreased frequency of use may be recommended.

Ophthalmologists may prescribe topical anti-inflammatory medications, oral or topical antibiotics, autologous serum eye drops, or platelet-rich plasma. Punctal occlusion, which involves insertion of plugs into tear ducts to prevent drainage of tears, may be performed by an ophthalmologist. Another treatment option is scleral contact lenses, which have a reservoir for tears or ophthalmic medications. Surgery may be recommended for patients with dry eye disease due to abnormal eyelid function or anatomy.

Question What does the body of reliable systematic reviews provide regarding evidence for the effectiveness and safety of various interventions for dry eye. Findings This overview of reliable systematic reviews finds some evidence for interventions, including environmental and dietary modifications, artificial tears and lubricants, punctal occlusion, intense pulsed light therapy, vectored thermal pulsation therapy, topical corticosteroids/cyclosporine A/secretagogues, and autologous serum. However, certainty of evidence is generally low, rendering findings inconclusive. Meaning Most common dry eye interventions may be effective, but the current evidence is largely inconclusive, and most systematic reviews addressing dry eye interventions were not reliable. Importance Dry eye is a common ocular disease that can have substantial morbidity. Systematic reviews provide evidence for dry eye interventions and can be useful for patients, clinicians, and clinical guideline developers.

Overviews of reviews use explicit and systematic methods to synthesize findings from multiple systematic reviews, but currently, there are no overviews of systematic reviews investigating interventions for dry eye. Results were synthesized from reliable systematic reviews to provide summaries of evidence for each intervention. Evidence for each intervention was defined as conclusive or inconclusive depending on whether high-certainty evidence across systematic reviews was available according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations criteria and whether findings reached statistical or clinical significance. Recommendations were made for further research. Findings Within the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US satellite database, 138 potentially relevant systematic reviews were identified, 71 were considered eligible, and 26 were assessed as reliable. Among reliable systematic reviews, no conclusive evidence was identified for any dry eye intervention.

Inconclusive evidence suggested that environmental modifications, dietary modifications, artificial tears and lubricants, punctal occlusion, intense pulsed light therapy, vectored thermal pulsation therapy, topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine A, topical secretagogues, and autologous serum may be effective. Only unreliable systematic reviews evaluated lifitegrast, oral antibiotics, and moisture chamber devices. Conclusions and Relevance This overview of systematic reviews found some evidence that dry eye interventions may be effective, but no conclusive evidence was available. The conduct and reporting of most systematic reviews for dry eye interventions warrant improvement, and reliable systematic reviews are needed to evaluate lifitegrast, oral antibiotics, and moisture chamber devices.
