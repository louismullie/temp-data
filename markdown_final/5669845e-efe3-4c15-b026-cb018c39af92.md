## Question

How is the severity of small bowel obstruction assessed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to assess the severity of small bowel obstruction, including how to use imaging and scores to stratify risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and laboratory markers that flag high-risk disease. Then, I should verify the imaging strategy and, in particular, how CT features quantify anatomic severity and predict ischemia. Next, I will examine validated grading systems and clinico-radiologic scores that calibrate risk. After that, I need to integrate these data into pragmatic categories that guide nonoperative management, contrast challenge, or urgent surgery. Finally, I should confirm dynamic reassessment timelines and special populations, such as the elderly, that may warrant a lower threshold for intervention.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical syndrome and immediate red flags. Typical features include crampy abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and obstipation, with adhesions being the leading etiology, while continuous pain, peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension raise concern for ischemia or perforation that escalates severity and often mandates operative intervention [^113V7zqS] [^112zPWLr]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also verify that clinical examination alone cannot reliably grade obstruction or exclude ischemia, which is why imaging and labs are essential from the outset [^11769Xvp].

> I need to check baseline laboratory markers that correlate with severity and strangulation risk. Leukocytosis, elevated CRP, metabolic acidosis, and lactate elevation are worrisome, and the combination of WBC at least 10 × 10⁹/L and CRP at least 75 mg/L appears in a validated clinico-radiological score for strangulation, reinforcing their prognostic value in triage [^112GH4fd] [^115rrtRa]. Wait, let me verify the pathophysiologic link; rising lactate and acidosis reflect tissue hypoperfusion, so trending these values during observation is critical to avoid delayed recognition of ischemia [^112GH4fd].

> Next, I should review the imaging pathway and correct an easy pitfall. My first instinct used to be to obtain plain abdominal radiographs to "screen" for obstruction, but, hmm, wait a minute, more contemporary guidance prioritizes CT because plain films neither grade severity nor detect ischemia reliably, and some guidelines even recommend avoiding routine abdominal X-rays in this context [^114wNzTP] [^11769Xvp]. Hold on, I should double-check earlier recommendations; older consensus favored initial X-rays, yet both EAST and ACR now support early contrast-enhanced CT as the cornerstone because it clarifies grade, cause, transition point, and complications that alter management [^116zzqBS] [^11769Xvp].

> I will now examine CT-based features that define anatomic severity and predict outcomes. High-grade or complete obstruction, marked small-bowel dilation, an abrupt transition point, closed-loop configuration, peritoneal free fluid, mesenteric edema or congestion, and especially reduced mural enhancement stratify patients toward urgent surgery, whereas the small bowel feces sign and passage of intraluminal contrast suggest partial obstruction that is more likely to resolve nonoperatively [^11769Xvp] [^111pS2ta]. Let me reconsider predictors across studies; meta-analyses identify peritoneal free fluid, high-grade obstruction, and mesenteric inflammation as strongly associated with surgery, aligning radiologic severity with clinical decisions and reinforcing CT's primacy for risk stratification [^112ePoT1] [^1151P6KS].

> Hold on, I should verify the CT signs most concerning for strangulation or ischemia because those are surgical triggers. Reduced or absent bowel wall enhancement, bowel wall thickening with low attenuation, mesenteric edema and vascular engorgement, and free intraperitoneal fluid are earlier markers, while pneumatosis and portal venous gas are late catastrophic findings, and these should prompt urgent operative exploration rather than prolonged observation [^11769Xvp] [^112zPWLr]. I need to ensure clinical correlation remains front and center; when these CT findings coexist with continuous pain, peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, or rising lactate, delay to operation increases resection risk and mortality, so the threshold for surgery must remain low in such scenarios [^112zPWLr] [^114oJRNW].

> Let me consider standardized severity grading, because reproducibility matters for decision-making. The AAST anatomic severity grading for adhesive SBO spans from partial without ischemia to complete obstruction with diffuse ischemia or perforation, and higher grades correlate with higher rates of conversion to open surgery, bowel resection, temporary abdominal closure, and stoma creation, which helps prognosticate and communicate operative risk [^116o9ehY]. Wait, I should confirm generalizability; external validation in multi-institutional cohorts supports the grading system's utility, though local interobserver agreement and integration with physiology remain important to verify in practice [^116o9ehY].

> Next, I should review the clinico-radiologic strangulation score that can be applied at the bedside. Assigning one point each for pain at least four days, guarding, CRP at least 75 mg/L, leukocytosis at least 10 × 10⁹/L, free fluid at least 500 mL on CT, and reduced bowel wall enhancement identifies high-risk patients, with scores of three or more demonstrating high specificity for resection and thereby supporting expedited surgery when the score is positive [^115rrtRa]. But wait, what if labs are borderline and CT is equivocal; I should double-check that the score complements, rather than replaces, clinical judgment and CT synthesis, especially since low scores do not absolutely exclude evolving ischemia in dynamic disease processes [^115rrtRa] [^112ePoT1].

> I will now integrate these elements into practical severity categories that drive management. Patients with stable vitals, colicky pain, reassuring labs, partial obstruction on CT with preserved enhancement, small bowel feces sign, and contrast passage are good candidates for nonoperative management with decompression and fluids, whereas patients with complete obstruction or any ischemic features warrant urgent surgery, and those in between merit close observation with a low threshold to escalate [^114oJRNW] [^112zPWLr]. Hold on, I should verify the role of a water-soluble contrast challenge; if contrast reaches the colon within about 24 hours, the likelihood of nonoperative resolution exceeds 90%, while failure to progress strongly predicts the need for surgery and can be used to shorten time to decision.

> Let me first confirm the timing for reassessment so we do not miss deterioration. Serial abdominal examinations every several hours, trending WBC, CRP, and lactate, and repeat CT if the patient worsens or fails to improve are key, and if after approximately 48 hours of optimized nonoperative care there is no improvement, a contrast study and consideration of operative exploration are recommended to avoid delayed intervention in complete or complicated obstruction [^116U7Dsr] [^116U7Dsr]. Hold on, I should verify admission context; admission to a surgical service improves outcomes and supports timely imaging, contrast protocols, and operative readiness when indicated [^116zzqBS] [^114oJRNW].

> Finally, let me consider special populations where my threshold should shift. In frail or elderly patients, atypical presentations, limited physiologic reserve, and higher complication and mortality risks argue for earlier surgical consultation and a lower tolerance for prolonged observation, while also balancing goals of care and risks such as contrast nephropathy with contrast-enhanced CT [^116zc9QP] [^114MSqEp]. I should double-check that shared decision-making and comprehensive geriatric assessment are initiated early in such cases to align management with patient priorities and improve outcomes [^116zc9QP] [^114MSqEp].

Severity of small bowel obstruction (SBO) is determined by the degree of luminal compromise, presence of ischemia or perforation, and patient-specific factors such as age and comorbidities [^1138bjgk] [^116o9ehY]. Complete obstruction, strangulation, or ischemia indicate **severe SBO** [^113V7zqS] and require urgent surgery [^112zPWLr], while partial obstruction without ischemia may be managed conservatively [^1138bjgk]. CT is the **gold standard** [^11769Xvp] for assessing severity, identifying the transition point [^114oJRNW], and detecting complications [^113Ewzaq]. Clinical signs of severity include persistent pain [^115rrtRa], peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis [^112zPWLr]; laboratory markers such as elevated lactate and leukocytosis also indicate severity [^112GH4fd] [^112ePoT1]. Early recognition and appropriate intervention are **critical to reduce morbidity and mortality** [^1151P6KS].

---

## Clinical classification of severity

SBO severity is classified based on the **degree of obstruction, presence of complications, and patient-specific factors** [^116o9ehY] [^112GH4fd]:

| **Severity level** | **Clinical features** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | - Partial obstruction <br/> - Minimal symptoms <br/> - No signs of ischemia or perforation | Conservative management [^1138bjgk] (IV fluids, nasogastric decompression, close monitoring) |
| Moderate | - Complete obstruction <br/> - No signs of ischemia or perforation <br/> - Significant symptoms (pain, vomiting, distension) | - Initial conservative management with close monitoring [^1138bjgk] <br/> - Surgery if no improvement within 48–72 hours |
| Severe | - Strangulation <br/> - Ischemia <br/> - Perforation <br/> - Peritonitis <br/> - Sepsis | Immediate surgical intervention [^112zPWLr] |

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms indicating severity

Several signs and symptoms indicate **greater severity and risk of complications** in SBO:

- **Persistent abdominal pain**: Continuous or severe pain suggests ischemia or strangulation [^115rrtRa] [^112zPWLr].
- **Peritonitis**: Rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity indicate perforation or ischemia [^112zPWLr].
- **Systemic signs**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis indicate systemic inflammatory response or sepsis [^111jwYqH] [^112zPWLr].
- **Vomiting and dehydration**: Severe vomiting and dehydration indicate significant fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance [^113V7zqS] [^116QJvaG].

---

## Laboratory markers indicating severity

Laboratory tests provide **useful indicators of severity** in SBO:

- **Elevated lactate levels**: Indicates tissue hypoperfusion and ischemia [^112zPWLr] [^112GH4fd].
- **Leukocytosis**: Elevated white blood cell count suggests inflammation or infection [^112GH4fd] [^112ePoT1].
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic alkalosis indicate severe fluid and electrolyte disturbances [^112GH4fd] [^111jwYqH].
- **Elevated creatinine and urea**: Indicates renal impairment due to dehydration and hypoperfusion [^112GH4fd] [^111jwYqH].

---

## Imaging findings indicating severity

Imaging studies, particularly CT, **are essential for assessing SBO severity**:

- **CT scan findings**: CT is the gold standard [^11769Xvp] for evaluating SBO severity, identifying the transition point [^114oJRNW], degree of obstruction, and complications such as ischemia, perforation, and strangulation [^113Ewzaq].
- **Peritoneal free fluid**: Strongly associated with surgical intervention and ischemia [^112ePoT1] [^113ViEi6].
- **Bowel wall thickening**: Indicates ischemia and increased severity [^112ePoT1] [^113ViEi6].
- **Mesenteric inflammation**: Associated with increased severity and need for surgery [^112ePoT1].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing severity

Patient-specific factors influence SBO severity and outcomes. Elderly patients experience **higher morbidity and mortality** [^113Xpymi] due to reduced physiological reserves and comorbidities. Comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and renal impairment increase the risk of complications and mortality [^114MSqEp]. Prior abdominal surgery predisposes to adhesive SBO, a common cause that also affects severity [^113V7zqS] [^112GH4fd].

---

## Impact of severity on treatment decisions

Severity **significantly influences** treatment decisions. Mild to moderate SBO is initially managed **conservatively** [^1138bjgk] with close monitoring, with surgery if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, whereas **severe SBO** requires immediate surgical intervention [^112zPWLr] to prevent complications such as ischemia, perforation, and sepsis [^116CmJ2u].

---

## Prognostic factors associated with severity

Prognostic factors linked to greater severity and worse outcomes include **delayed diagnosis and treatment** [^113V7zqS], which increase the risk of complications and mortality [^1151P6KS]. The presence of ischemia or strangulation substantially increases morbidity and mortality [^113V7zqS]. High-grade obstruction is associated with a higher likelihood of surgery [^112ePoT1] and complications [^116o9ehY].

Severity of small bowel obstruction is determined by clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, as well as patient-specific factors. Early recognition and appropriate management are **essential to reduce morbidity and mortality** [^1138bjgk].

The following constitutes key background information on small bowel obstruction:

- **Definition**: SBO is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms related to mechanical blockage of the small bowel.

- **Pathophysiology**: Common etiologies include adhesions (65%), hernias (10%), neoplasms (5%), and Crohn's disease (5%).

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of SBO is approximately 100 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: The distension of small bowel segments that are proximal to the obstruction may lead to clinical manifestations of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Bacterial translocation can result in bacteremia. Progressive, untreated obstruction may lead to bowel ischemia and perforation, with secondary fecal peritonitis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with SBO due to postoperative adhesions, in-hospital mortality is estimated at 4.7%. In patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for SBO, 1-month mortality is estimated at 7.2%.

### The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma severity grade is valid and generalizable in adhesive small bowel obstruction [^116o9ehY]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) anatomic severity grading system for adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) was validated at a single institution. We aimed to externally validate the AAST ASBO grading system using the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma multi-institutional small bowel obstruction prospective observational study.

- **Methods**: Adults (age ≥ 18) with ASBO were included. Baseline demographics, physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate), laboratory tests (lactate, hemoglobin, creatinine, leukocytosis), imaging findings, operative details, length of stay, and Clavien-Dindo complications were collected. The AAST ASBO grades were assigned by two independent reviewers based on imaging findings. Kappa statistic, univariate, and multivariable analyses were performed.

- **Results**: There were 635 patients with a mean (± SD) age of 61 ± 17.8 years; 51% were female, and the mean body mass index was 27.5 ± 8.1. The AAST ASBO grades were: grade I (n = 386, 60.5%), grade II (n = 135, 21.2%), grade III (n = 59, 9.2%), and grade IV (n = 55, 8.6%). Initial management included nonoperative (n = 385; 61%), laparotomy (n = 200, 31.3%), laparoscopy (n = 13, 2.0%), and laparoscopy converted to laparotomy (n = 37, 5.8%). An increased median [IQR] AAST ASBO grade was associated with the need for conversion to an open procedure (2 [1–3] vs. 3 [2–4], p = 0.008), small bowel resection (2 [2–2] vs. 3 [2–4], p < 0.0001), postoperative temporary abdominal closure (2 [2–3] vs. 3 [3–4], p < 0.0001), and stoma creation (2 [2–3] vs. 3 [2–4]).

### Small bowel obstruction: The role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This approach has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure surgeons that medical therapy can be safely instituted. Thus, radiologists bear the responsibility of guiding their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted.

Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications, such as ischaemia and perforation, which will prompt surgical intervention. This review discusses the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outlines its impact on patient management.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^116pKFgV]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) remains problematic. A 2018 review stated that "there has been no reliable clinical method for predicting failure of nonoperative management for adhesive SBO". Accordingly, the primary aim of our review was to identify both imaging and non-imaging factors that should be investigated for the development and evaluation of a multi-variable model predicting treatment strategy for small bowel obstruction. Ideally, such a model would identify those patients unlikely to respond to conservative management and therefore at high risk of ischemia. At the same time, an accurate model could identify those patients destined to resolve conservatively, thus avoiding surgery.

Unfortunately, the large majority of existing literature that investigates predictors of surgery and/or ischemia is single-center, potentially suffering from spectrum bias and/or insufficient power. A single-center study by Scrima and colleagues sensibly included both imaging and non-imaging factors, but their model was not evaluated. Zielinski and co-workers developed a model based predominantly on CT scanning, finding vomiting, free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric edema, and the absence of the "small bowel feces" sign predictive of surgery. The authors then evaluated the model prospectively, adding more predictors and removing predictors initially found significant during development. The American Association for Surgery of Trauma has advocated an "anatomic severity schema" for small bowel obstruction that was validated subsequently in 351 patients.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is one of the leading causes of surgical emergencies, particularly those requiring emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction accounted for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that make up 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the United States, with ASBO being the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, representing 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in an average of 8 days of hospitalization and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20% and 30% of patients with ASBO require operative treatment. The length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the necessity for surgical intervention. The average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. A Dutch study in 2016 estimated associated costs at €16,305 for surgical and €2227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, its prevention and treatment often rely on surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a substantial amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### A systematic review of outcomes reported in small bowel obstruction research [^117G2eah]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a condition commonly treated by general surgeons. The evidence base for treating this condition is limited in part by variable reporting of outcomes in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify commonly used outcomes in research on SBO.

- **Methods**: This review was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017065538). Searches were performed of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify prospective cohort or randomized trials reporting outcomes of interventions in SBO. Studies addressing diagnostics, pediatric populations, and SBO due to malignancy were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion. Study and outcome characteristics were extracted into a pre-designed pro forma and mapped onto the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) framework.

- **Results**: A total of 1222 studies were screened for eligibility, 74 full-text articles were retrieved, and 51 studies were included for synthesis. A total of 50 different outcomes were used. Duration of hospital stay was the most frequently reported outcome (n = 21 studies). Resolution of SBO was reported in 12 studies but only defined in eight studies, which used six different definitions. Patient-reported outcomes were reported in only four studies.

- **Conclusions**: There is a high degree of variation in the outcomes reported in SBO research. There is a clear need for a core outcome set and the development of a patient-reported outcome measure.

### Multidetector CT of bowel obstruction: value of post-processing [^115wEoH9]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

The value of imaging in patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction depends on the ability to answer questions relevant to clinical management. Is there mechanical obstruction? Is it a small bowel obstruction (SBO) or a large bowel obstruction (LBO)? What is the transition point? What is the cause of the obstruction? What is the severity of the obstruction? The results of studies published more than 10 years ago using axial and single-slice helical CT revealed findings based on axial slices that enable CT to answer these different questions. With the recent advent of multislice CT, large numbers of thin sections can be generated with short image intervals, which is well-suited for post-processing.

- **Post-processing techniques**: Include standard reformatting methods such as sagittal, coronal, and oblique reformatting, curved reformatting, maximum and minimum-intensity projection, variable thickness viewing, and volume and surface rendering.

This pictorial review illustrates the added value of post-processing for answering different questions concerning patients with suspicion of bowel obstruction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116nHuvB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency, causing high morbidity and some mortality. The adhesions causing such bowel obstructions are typically the footprints of previous abdominal surgical procedures. This paper presents a revised version of the Bologna guidelines for the evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of ASBO. The working group has added sections on the prevention of ASBO and special patient groups.

- **Methods**: The guideline was developed under the auspices of the World Society of Emergency Surgery by the ASBO working group. A systematic literature search was conducted prior to the update of the guidelines to identify relevant new papers on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of ASBO. Literature was critically appraised according to an evidence-based guideline development method. Final recommendations were approved by the workgroup, taking into account the level of evidence of the conclusions.

- **Recommendations**: Adhesion formation might be reduced by minimally invasive surgical techniques and the use of adhesion barriers. Non-operative treatment is effective in most patients with ASBO. Contraindications for non-operative treatment include peritonitis, strangulation, and ischemia. When the adhesive etiology of obstruction is uncertain, or when contraindications for non-operative management might be present, CT is the diagnostic technique of choice. The principles of non-operative treatment are nil per os, naso-gastric or long-tube decompression, and intravenous supplementation with fluids and electrolytes.

### Use of small bowel follow through in management of small bowel obstruction [^112YCswS]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2025). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstructions (SBOs) pose a significant burden to healthcare. Despite being a common disease, notable inconsistencies exist within their management, particularly concerning the use of small bowel follow through (SBFT). We evaluated patients who underwent SBFT, comparing early versus late use of SBFT on outcomes.

- **Study design**: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 799 patients with SBO admitted between 2012 and 2019. Patients aged between 18 and 89 years were included, while those requiring emergent operations upon admission were excluded. The groups were evaluated based on whether they underwent SBFT or not, with further distinction on SBFT performance before (early) or after (late) 48 hours.

- **Results**: Of the 799 patients with SBO, 757 (94.7%) underwent SBFT, while 42 (5.2%) did not. Out of the 757 patients who had SBFT, 476 (62.8%) had it performed early, and 281 (37.1%) completed it late. Patients who received SBFT experienced a shorter length of stay (LOS) (p < 0.003). Additionally, patients admitted to the surgical service were more likely to receive an SBFT (p < 0.0042). Early SBFT was associated with more frequent admissions to academic institutions (p < 0.0001) and surgical services (p < 0.0001), decreased LOS (p < 0.001), reduced readmissions (p < 0.0001), a lower likelihood of requiring surgery (p < 0.0009), shorter time to operation (p < 0.0001), and faster operation-to-discharge time (p < 0.0005).

- **Conclusions**: The implementation of SBFT for SBO led to improved outcomes, particularly when performed early. This suggests that admission to a surgical service with more frequent early SBFT can decrease LOS. There is a tendency for…

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^111GPdXD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

- **Water-soluble contrast enema**: A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

- **Small bowel follow-through**: A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for non-operative management of adhesive small bowel obstruction. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 hours after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery, with an active therapeutic role.

- **Safety and adverse effects**: The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality; however, adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction by shifting fluids into the bowel lumen. In some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of small bowel obstruction: Evidence-based recommendations [^111jwYqH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a commonly diagnosed disease in the emergency department (ED). Recent literature has evaluated the ED investigation and management of SBO.

- **Objective**: This review evaluates the ED investigation and management of adult SBO based on the literature.

- **Discussion**: SBO is most commonly due to occlusion of the small intestine, resulting in fluid and gas accumulation. This may progress to mucosal ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. A variety of etiologies are present, but in adults, adhesions are the most common cause. Several classification systems exist; however, the most important distinction is complete vs. partial and complicated vs. simple obstruction, as complete complicated SBO more commonly requires surgical intervention.

	- History and physical examination can vary, but the most reliable findings include prior abdominal surgery, history of constipation, abdominal distension, and abnormal bowel sounds. Signs of strangulation include fever, hypotension, diffuse abdominal pain, peritonitis, and several others. Diagnosis typically requires imaging; though plain radiographs are often ordered, they cannot exclude the diagnosis. Computed tomography and ultrasound are reliable diagnostic methods.

	- Management includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and determining the need for operative vs. nonoperative therapy. A nasogastric tube is useful for patients with significant distension and vomiting by removing contents proximal to the site of obstruction. Surgery is needed for strangulation and those that fail nonoperative therapy.

### Small bowel obstruction: A practical step-by-step evidence-based approach to evaluation, decision making, and management [^116ks8Ue]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The initial goal of evaluating a patient with small bowel obstruction (SBO) is to immediately identify strangulation and the need for urgent operative intervention, combined with rapid resuscitation. This relies on a combination of traditional clinical signs and CT findings. In patients without signs of strangulation, a protocol for the administration of Gastrografin immediately in the emergency department efficiently sorts patients into those who will resolve their obstructions and those who will fail nonoperative management. Furthermore, because of the unique ability of Gastrografin to draw water into the bowel lumen, it expedites the resolution of partial obstructions, shortening the time to removal of the nasogastric tube, liberalization of diet, and discharge from the hospital.

Implementation of such a protocol is a complex, multidisciplinary, and time-consuming endeavor. As such, we cannot overemphasize the importance of clear, open communication with everyone involved. If surgical management is warranted, we encourage an initial laparoscopic approach with open access. Even if this results in immediate conversion to laparotomy after assessment of the intra-abdominal status, we encourage this approach with a goal of a 30% conversion rate or higher. This will attest that patients will have been given the highest likelihood of a successful laparoscopic lysis of adhesions (LOA).

### Small bowel obstruction: Computed tomography features and pitfalls [^111kdrKV]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern-day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO; show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately; and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize both common and unusual causes, as well as conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO, their differentiation, and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

### Intraluminal causes of mechanical small bowel obstruction: CT findings and diagnostic approach [^116br6zV]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Intraluminal causes of small bowel obstruction (SBO) are less common than mural or extrinsic etiologies. This review categorizes intraluminal causes of SBO into four broad categories to provide a diagnostic framework for radiologic interpretation:

- **Ingested contents**: Ingested materials can result in SBO when individual or accumulated contents are too large to pass, such as in the case of foreign bodies or bezoars.

- **Bowel stasis**: Bowel stasis causing SBO can be secondary to abnormal bowel function, such as in cystic fibrosis, reduced transit of contents at sites of narrowing such as surgical anastomoses, or the formation of enteroliths in diverticula that may subsequently dislodge and result in luminal obstruction.

- **Inflammatory causes**: Inflammatory causes of SBO include strictures or fistulas that allow foreign bodies (such as gallstones) formed outside the bowel to enter the bowel lumen and cause obstruction.

- **Neoplasms**: Neoplasms can present as endophytic masses that occlude the bowel lumen through a ball-valve mechanism or serve as a lead point for intussusception.

Recognizing the imaging features that are suggestive of intraluminal SBO is critical for accurate diagnosis and timely patient care.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^113osnRj]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Potential studies were identified via scrutiny of online titles and abstracts, with definite exclusions being discarded. The full text was obtained for potentially eligible studies. Uncertainty was resolved through face-to-face consensus meetings between all authors.

Mindful of the distinction between prognostic and diagnostic data, and aware that studies frequently confound these, we piloted data extraction on the initial 10 studies identified to ascertain potential literature quality and review viability. Data were categorized into five broad headings: study design, patient characteristics, radiological predictors, non-radiological predictors (further subdivided into clinical or laboratory predictors), and clinical outcomes. Informed by this, we developed an extraction sheet (Microsoft Excel), and then populated it with selected studies as follows: study design, patient characteristics (demographics), imaging variables, clinical variables, laboratory variables, and overall outcomes (surgery vs. conservative treatment, expressed as contingency tables). If intra-operative findings such as the presence of ischaemia/strangulation were reported, or if resection was performed, these were also extracted. We noted whether the authors attempted to develop a predictive score or model.

- **Risk of bias and applicability assessment**: We assessed the study methodological quality and potential sources of bias using a modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS 2) tool. This consisted of the four main domains.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^114PNkuv]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The guideline was written under the auspices of the WSES by the ASBO working group. Systematic searches of the MEDLINE and Embase databases were carried out in October 2016 using keywords relevant to each section. Terms relevant to each section of the guideline were mapped to MEDLINE Medical Subjects Headings (MeSH) terms and searched for as text items. Articles describing randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews were searched using the methodological filters of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. The bibliographies of included articles were subsequently hand-searched for other relevant references, and experts in the field were consulted to ensure no relevant reports were missing.

- **Critical appraisal**: Articles selected to support recommendations were assessed using the levels of evidence as published by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford. Articles were classified according to the type of article and individually assessed for methodological quality using the GRADE method as proposed by the GRADE working group. That working group developed a common, sensible, and transparent approach to grading the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The main literature on which the conclusion for each relevant topic is based is stated with the conclusion, accompanied by the level of evidence.

### A core outcome set for clinical studies of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^111xi2Br]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a very common emergency surgical condition; it accounts for nearly half of the 25,000 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in the UK. SBO is the cause of death in 3.5 people per 100,000 population each year in high-income countries and 1.8 deaths per 100,000 population in low- and middle-income countries. The most common cause of mechanical SBO is adhesions, usually from previous abdominal surgery, accounting for around 50% of all cases. Postoperative adhesions may affect up to 3.5% of patients by 20 years. Adhesive SBO (ASBO) typically manifests with cramping abdominal pain, abdominal distension, intolerance to enteral intake, and bilious vomiting. Patients are at risk of dehydration, renal failure, infection including aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and poor wound healing. One-third of ASBO cases require treatment with surgical intervention; the remaining cases resolve with supportive management only. Morbidity and mortality following treatment remain significant, with reported mortality of 7.2% at 90 days post-surgery.

The quality of randomized data and outcomes reporting in ASBO is limited. The most recent trials in ASBO focus on the use of water-soluble contrast agents or laparoscopic surgery. Given the challenges of delivering research in this area, it is important to maximize the utility of studies to support the literature. As studies focus on interventions in different parts of the patient pathway, the outcomes selected for reporting may differ, meaning that some key outcome data are not always captured.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^116zc9QP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with small bowel obstruction. The available literature indicates that elderly patients are at an increased risk for complications and mortality, and they might benefit from earlier surgical intervention. It is crucial to consider patients' preferences when initiating treatment and specifically when offering surgery, as this can significantly impact quality of life. An assessment of frailty and a comprehensive geriatric approach with multidisciplinary specialist care is required from the start, preferably in the emergency department.

More research on the management of small bowel obstruction in elderly patients is urgently needed given the rise in this age group. It is concluded that managing small bowel obstruction requires more than merely applying treatment recommendations and guidelines based on studies in younger adults. Based on knowledge about frail elderly and small bowel obstruction, a flowchart has been developed that provides an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction. After assessing cognition, frailty, and patient goals, the risks and benefits of surgical and conservative management should be weighed.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^11769Xvp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction as neither patient presentation, clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific to diagnose or guide management. This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. It seeks to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings.

- **Guideline details**: The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^113Xpymi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is one of the most frequent emergencies in general surgery, commonly affecting elderly patients. Morbidity and mortality from small bowel obstruction in the elderly is high. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction in recent years; however, little is known regarding whether this progress has benefitted outcomes in elderly patients, particularly those who are frail or have a malignancy as the cause of the obstruction, especially when considering quality of life and functioning as outcomes.

In this review, we discuss the specific challenges and needs of the elderly in the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction. We address quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with small bowel obstruction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^112o6KZE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade SBO. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO; it can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and a negative predictive value of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary, but oral is not. Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non-operative conservative management to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery. This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction. MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- **Conservative treatment and timing for surgery**: The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically.

- **Clinical decision rule**: These are algorithms or scoring systems that lead to a prognostic estimation or a diagnostic category.

- **Note on trials**: See note above for advice on how to understand, rate, and use trials or other studies with broad confidence intervals.

- **Rx availability impact**: Met when all patients died before the treatment (Rx) became available, but some now survive on it; or when some patients died before the Rx became available, but none now die on it.

- **Poor quality cohort study**: A poor quality cohort study is one that failed to clearly define comparison groups and/or failed to measure exposures and outcomes in the same (preferably blinded), objective way in both exposed and non-exposed individuals and/or failed to identify or appropriately control known confounders, and/or failed to carry out a sufficiently long and complete follow-up of patients.

- **Poor quality case-control study**: This refers to studies that failed to clearly define comparison groups and/or failed to measure exposures and outcomes in the same (preferably blinded), objective way in both cases and controls and/or failed to identify or appropriately control known confounders.

- **Split-sample validation**: This is achieved by collecting all the information in a single tranche, then artificially dividing this into "derivation" and "validation" samples.

- **Diagnostic findings**: An "Absolute SpPin" is a diagnostic finding whose specificity is so high that a positive result rules in the diagnosis. An "Absolute SnNout" is a diagnostic finding whose sensitivity is so high that a negative result rules out the diagnosis. Good, better, bad, and worse refer to the comparisons between treatments in terms.

### A core outcome set for clinical studies of adhesive small bowel obstruction [^114c7yum]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common surgical emergency condition. Research in the field is plentiful; however, inconsistency in outcome reporting makes comparisons challenging. The aim of this study was to define a core outcome set (COS) for studies of ASBO.

- **Methods**: The long list of outcomes was identified through systematic review and focus groups across different geographical regions. A modified Delphi consensus exercise of three rounds was undertaken with stakeholder groups (patients and clinicians). Items were rated on a 9-point Likert scale, with items exceeding a 70% rating at 7–9 being passed to the consensus meeting. New item proposals were invited in round 1. Individualized feedback on prior voting compared to other participants was provided. An international consensus meeting was convened to ratify the final COS.

- **Results**: In round 1, 56 items were rated by 118 respondents. A total of 18 items reached consensus, and respondents proposed an additional 10 items. Round 2 was completed by 90 respondents, and nine items achieved consensus. In round 3, 80 surveys were completed; one item achieved consensus, and five borderline items were identified. The final COS included 26 outcomes, mapped to the following domains: interventions, need for stoma, septic complications, return of gut function, patient-reported outcomes, and recurrence of obstruction, as well as mortality, failure to rescue, and time to resolution.

- **Conclusion**: This COS should be used in future studies in the treatment of adhesive SBO. Further studies to define a core measurement set are necessary.

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, lactate, electrolytes, and BUN/Creatinine, the first step of the diagnostic work-up for ASBO is a supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray. This can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops, and the absence of gas in the colonic section.

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR C).

- **Secondary evaluation**: CT scan is highly diagnostic in small bowel obstruction and holds great value for patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade obstruction. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process unless clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR B).

	- CT scans often confirm the presence of complete obstruction and help diagnose the cause of SBO. They can also exclude non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with sensitivity and specificity higher than 90%, and a negative predictive value of nearly 100%.

	- The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a, GoR B).

- **Ultrasound**: Ultrasound has limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with a distended bowel, as the air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual ultrasound findings include distention, peristalsis (for differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around the transition point, and free fluid (a sign of ischemia).

- **MRI**: The use of MRI should be restricted.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^1128mSfh]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

A major issue, often not diagnosed, is a localized bowel obstruction due to adhesion formation. This may be clinically suspected in patients with a history of multiple abdominal operations, with or without extensive adhesion division. A history of intermittent colicky abdominal pain, abdominal distension, loud bowel sounds, no bowel or stoma action, and vomiting are suggestive. A distal obstruction is indicated if the vomit is feculent, while a more proximal obstruction is indicated by green/yellow vomit. During an obstructive episode, the bowel secretes more fluid. When the obstruction resolves, diarrhea or a high stomal output follows. Adopting a low residue or liquid diet may reduce or even eliminate obstructive episodes. If successful, this approach can be a useful diagnostic test.

Radiologically, an organic obstruction is suggested by a distinct transition point between dilated and normal-sized bowel. However, this may not be apparent if the obstruction has resolved or the bowel is fixed by adhesions and cannot dilate. An abdominal CT scan during severe pain episodes can be helpful. While contrast follow-through studies or MRI scans are useful when positive, they may not be tolerated acutely and do not always show the obstruction. Unsuspected diagnoses, such as small bowel volvulus from a band adhesion or an intussusception, may be revealed. Further clues to an organic obstruction include visible small bowel peristalsis, which may worsen.

### Small bowel obstruction: a population-based appraisal [^113ANtCx]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common reason for surgical consultation, but little is known about its natural history. We performed a population-based analysis to evaluate SBO frequency, type of operation, and long-term outcomes.

- **Study design**: Using the California Inpatient File, we identified all patients admitted in 1997 with a diagnosis of SBO. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of bowel obstruction in the previous 6 years (1991 to 1996). For the remaining cohort, the natural history of SBO over the subsequent 5 years (1998 to 2002) was analyzed. Index hospitalization outcomes (e.g. surgical versus nonsurgical management, length of stay, in-hospital mortality), and long-term outcomes, including SBO readmissions and 1-year mortality, were evaluated.

- **Results**: We identified 32,583 patients with an index admission for SBO in 1997; 24% had surgery during the index admission. The distribution of surgical procedures was as follows: 38% lysis of adhesions, 38% hernia repair, 18% small bowel resection with lysis of adhesions, and 6% small bowel resection with hernia repair. Patients who underwent operations during the index admission had longer lengths of stay, lower mortality, fewer SBO readmissions, and longer time to readmission than those treated nonsurgically. Regardless of treatment during the index admission, 81% of surviving patients had no additional SBO readmissions over the subsequent 5 years.

- **Conclusions**: Most of the 32,583 patients requiring admission for index SBO in 1997 were treated nonsurgically, and few of these patients were readmitted.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^1116eVnB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is one of the most frequent emergencies in general surgery, commonly affecting elderly patients. Morbidity and mortality from small bowel obstruction in the elderly are high. Significant progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of bowel obstruction in recent years, but little is known about whether this progress has benefitted outcomes in elderly patients, particularly those who are frail or have a malignancy as the cause of the obstruction. Additionally, the consideration of quality of life and functioning as outcomes remains underexplored.

In this review, we discuss the specific challenges and needs of the elderly in the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction. We address quality of life aspects and explore how the concept of geriatric assessment can be utilized to improve decision-making and outcomes for elderly patients with a small bowel obstruction.

### The utility of computed tomography in acute small bowel obstruction [^115D4d9a]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a significant cause of acute surgical admissions. Surgeons are tending to favor an initial trial of conservative management. Due to the unreliability of clinical signs in accurately predicting which patients require early intervention, there is an increasing tendency to utilize imaging investigations, particularly computed tomography (CT), to help define the severity, cause, and complications of acute small bowel obstruction. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the contribution CT can make to the management of these patients.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^1151P6KS]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is common; it accounts for 20% of abdominal surgeries in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, and around one-quarter of SBO admissions culminate in surgery. In the developed world, adhesions remain the most common cause. The limitations of plain abdominal radiography are widely appreciated. A seminal 1991 paper transitioned diagnosis towards CT scanning, which determines both the cause and level of obstruction more accurately. With improved diagnosis by CT, the pivotal clinical question then becomes whether surgery is necessary or not.

The old surgical maxim of, "Never let the sun set on a small bowel obstruction", has been replaced by a shift towards more conservative management, with around 75% of patients now avoiding an operation. Nevertheless, untreated obstruction can culminate in irreversible mural ischaemia and intestinal perforation, a surgical catastrophe with considerable morbidity and mortality. The dilemma familiar to every general surgeon is thus: Operate too soon and expose the patient to unnecessary surgical risk; too late, and the patient is in extremis.

It is surprising that SBO prognostication still adopts a "try it and see" approach, bolstered by surgical experience. Failed conservative treatment, signs of peritonism, and clinical concerns for ischaemia may precipitate surgery. While it is seemingly intuitive that a multivariable prognostic model incorporating clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors could predict surgical requirement, no models are used widely.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^116Wh8ao]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified six potential predictors strongly associated with the need for surgery (five positively and one negatively; three were derived from CT), and three strongly associated with ischemia at surgery (all positively; two were derived from CT). The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently well in the primary literature but which enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^1117Dxrt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In another recently developed model for predicting the risk of strangulated SBO, six variables correlated with small bowel resection: history of pain lasting 4 days or more, guarding, C-reactive protein level at least 75 mg/l, leucocyte count 10 × 10⁹/l or greater, free intraperitoneal fluid volume at least 500 mL on computed tomography (CT), and reduction of CT small bowel wall contrast enhancement.

A further multivariate predictive model of surgical operation in SBO showed free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric edema, lack of the "small bowel feces sign" at CT, and history of vomiting to be significant predictors of the need for operative exploration.

In a retrospective study of 53 patients with ASBO treated using a long nasointestinal tube (LT), complete SBO (no evidence of air within the large bowel) and increased serum creatine phosphokinase (≥ 130 IU/L) were independent predictive factors for LT decompression failure.

A recent prospective study aimed to evaluate an algorithm using CT-scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction. Severe abdominal pain (VAS > 4), abdominal guarding, raised WCC, and devascularized bowel at CT predict the need for emergent laparotomy at the time of admission. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction, whilst CT-scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies.

Again, two systematic reviews confirmed the value of water-soluble contrast medium in predicting the need for surgical intervention.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^114tVm5e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

When patients are suspected or formally tested as being frail, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) should be performed prior to taking further steps in diagnosis and treatment. Such assessment demands considerable time and attention from geriatricians but offers the most comprehensive information on frail patients and can help in choosing the treatment that optimally meets the demands and wishes of the elderly. Reduced length of stay and a lower percentage of change in discharge destination are reported following a CGA. Although there are no data on a (shortened) CGA in small bowel obstruction patients, we believe that optimal care for frail elderly patients with small bowel obstruction will require a multidisciplinary approach from the start, at the ED. Similar to earlier reports on emergency surgery, management of polypharmacy and interactions between the treatment of small bowel obstruction and co-morbidities can benefit from dedicated geriatric care and improve results for this frequent condition with high morbidity.

There are several models for providing comprehensive geriatric care, including geriatric consultation teams, interdisciplinary pathways, aged care consultation at nursing level, and primary admittance to a geriatric ward. The optimal model for emergency care, e.g. small bowel obstruction, remains undetermined and might vary with local expertise and resources. By all means, the model chosen should fulfil criteria of rapid availability of geriatric competence at the ED 24 hours a day and a predefined multidisciplinary care path.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^111yrEXE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with ASBO treated non-surgically have a shorter hospital stay; however, they have a higher recurrence rate and a shorter time to re-admission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is the same (Level of Evidence 2b).

- **Classification**: SBO can be classified according to several criteria:
	- **Completeness**: Partial vs. complete (or high grade vs. low grade),
	- **Etiology**: Adhesional vs. non-adhesional,
	- **Timing**: Early vs. late (> 30 days after surgery).

Even if Zielinski and Bannon proposed to switch the traditional focus of differentiating SBO to one of predicting the failure of NOM, the goal remains to explore patients with expected failure as soon as possible.

- **Risk factors**: The most important risk factor for adhesive SBO is the type of surgery and the extent of peritoneal damage. The technique of the procedure (open vs. laparoscopic) plays an important role in the development of adhesion-related morbidity.

	- In a retrospective review of 446,331 abdominal operations, Galinos et al. noticed that the incidence was 7.1% in open cholecystectomies vs. 0.2% in laparoscopic; 15.6% in open total abdominal hysterectomies vs. 0.0% in laparoscopic; 23.9% in open adnexal operations vs. 0.0% in laparoscopic, and there was no significant difference between open and laparoscopic appendectomies (1.4% vs. 1.3%).

In a further recent paper, Reshef et al. compared the risk of ASBO in 205 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery and 205 who underwent similar open operations, both without any previous history of open surgery. After a mean follow-up of 41 months, the authors found that although the data needed further analysis.

All studies have been evaluated for quality according to the STARD checklist for the reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy. Categories of evidence and grades of recommendation have been assessed and classified according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (Version March 2009).

- **Categories of evidence and grades of recommendation**: These categories are available on the homepage of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. This includes definitions of terms used.

Notes: Users can add a minus sign "-" to denote the level of evidence that fails to provide a conclusive answer due to either a single result with a wide confidence interval or a systematic review with troublesome heterogeneity. Such evidence can only generate Grade D recommendations.

- **Definition of homogeneity**: By homogeneity, we mean a systematic review that is free of worrisome variations (heterogeneity) in the directions and degrees of results between individual studies. Not all systematic reviews with statistically significant heterogeneity are considered homogeneous.

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^1151bNNn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Bowel obstruction is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for nearly 30,000 deaths and more than $3 billion per year in direct medical costs; it is responsible for approximately 15% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain in the United States and about 20% of cases needing acute surgical care.

- **Etiology**: Bowel obstruction is based on a mechanical intrinsic luminal obstruction or extrinsic compression. Adynamic ileus and colonic pseudo-obstruction are caused by a lack of enteric propulsion. Colonic pseudo-obstruction and adynamic ileus can be caused by drugs, trauma, the postoperative period, metabolic disturbances, and various other factors.

In 90% of cases, small bowel obstruction is caused by adhesions, hernias, and neoplasms. Adhesive small bowel obstruction represents 55–75% of small bowel obstruction cases, while hernias and small bowel tumors account for the remainder. Large bowel obstruction is provoked by cancer in about 60% of cases; volvulus and diverticular disease are responsible for another 30%. Other causes, such as carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, and others, account for the remaining 10–15% of bowel obstructions. This review focuses on the management of bowel obstruction, excluding duodenal mechanical obstruction, to be better included in gastric outlet obstruction.

*Others include carcinomatosis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease stenosis, intussusception, ischemic stenosis, radiation stenosis, postanastomotic stenosis, gallstones, foreign bodies, and bezoars.

### Clinicoradiological score for predicting the risk of strangulated small bowel obstruction [^115rrtRa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Intestinal ischaemia as a result of small bowel obstruction (SBO) requires prompt recognition and early intervention. A clinicoradiological score was sought to predict the risk of ischaemia in patients with SBO.

- **Methods**: A clinico-radiological protocol for the assessment of patients presenting with SBO was used. A logistic regression model was applied to identify determinant variables and construct a clinical score that would predict ischaemia requiring resection.

- **Results**: Of 233 consecutive patients with SBO, 138 required laparotomy, of whom 45 underwent intestinal resection. In multivariable analysis, six variables correlated with small bowel resection and were given one point each towards the clinical score: history of pain lasting 4 days or more, guarding, C-reactive protein level at least 75 mg/l, leucocyte count 10 × 10⁹/l or greater, free intraperitoneal fluid volume at least 500 mL on computed tomography (CT), and reduction of CT small bowel wall contrast enhancement. The risk of intestinal ischaemia was 6 percent in patients with a score of 1 or less, whereas 21 of 29 patients with a score of 3 or more underwent small bowel resection. A positive score of 3 or more had a sensitivity of 67.7 percent and specificity 90.8 percent; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 (95 percent confidence interval 0.79 to 0.95).

- **Conclusion**: By combining clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters, the clinical score allowed early identification of strangulated SBO.

### Small-bowel obstruction: State-of-the-art imaging and its role in clinical management [^1125Pa6C]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common clinical condition with signs and symptoms similar to other acute abdominal disorders. Radiologic investigation of patients with SBO, as well as the indications and timing of surgical intervention, have changed over the past two decades. This review focuses on modern imaging techniques and their role in both the diagnosis and treatment of patients with SBO.

### Non-emergency small bowel obstruction: Assessment of CT findings that predict need for surgery [^111pS2ta]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify CT findings predictive of surgical management in non-emergency small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans of 129 patients with non-emergency SBO were evaluated based on various criteria: small bowel luminal diameter, wall thickness, presence of the small bowel faeces sign (defined as intraluminal particulate matter in a dilated small bowel) and its length, transition point, submucosal oedema, mesenteric stranding, ascites, and degree of obstruction (categorized as low-grade partial, high-grade partial, and complete obstruction). Medical records were reviewed for age, gender, management, and history of abdominal surgery, abdominal malignancy, or prior SBO. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata Release 9.2.

The results indicated that the degree of obstruction was the sole predictor of the need for surgical intervention. Specifically, 18.0% of patients with low-grade partial obstruction (n = 50) underwent surgery, compared to 32.5% of those with high-grade partial obstruction (n = 77), and 100% of patients with complete obstruction (n = 2) required surgery (P = 0.004). Interestingly, the presence of the small bowel faeces sign was inversely predictive of surgical need (P = 0.018).

In conclusion, for non-emergency SBO patients with contrast-enhanced CT imaging, the grade of obstruction is predictive of the necessity for surgery, whereas the small bowel faeces sign inversely predicts the need for surgery.

### Adult small bowel obstruction [^116QJvaG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a clinical condition often initially diagnosed and managed in the emergency department (ED). The high rates of potential complications associated with an SBO make it essential for the emergency physician (EP) to make a timely and accurate diagnosis.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the history, physical examination, and imaging modalities associated with the diagnosis of SBO. The secondary objectives were to identify the prevalence of SBO in prospective ED-based studies of adult abdominal pain and to apply Pauker and Kassirer's threshold approach to clinical decision-making to the diagnosis and management of SBO.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, major emergency medicine (EM) textbooks, and the bibliographies of selected articles were scanned for studies that assessed one or more components of the history, physical examination, or diagnostic imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of SBO. The selected articles underwent a quality assessment by two of the authors using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Data used to compile sensitivities and specificities were obtained from these studies, and a meta-analysis was performed on those that examined the same historical component, physical examination technique, or diagnostic test. Separate information on the prevalence and management of SBO was used in conjunction with the meta-analysis findings of computed tomography (CT) to determine the test and treatment threshold.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^114MSqEp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

It is questionable if elderly patients with small bowel obstruction benefit from the progress in the management of this condition because of specific challenges and demands in diagnosis and treatment within this patient population. They represent a diverse group, consisting of vital elderly patients who have sufficient resilience to cope with a 'second hit' like surgery, compared to frail elderly patients with limited reserve capacity and a high risk of complications, even without surgery. Elderly patients often present with atypical clinical features, causing a delay in diagnosis and advanced disease at initial presentation.

Most elderly patients have reduced renal function, increasing the risk of contrast nephropathy from contrast-enhanced CT. This risk is higher when fluid intake is diminished, as it often is in small bowel obstruction. Limited physiological reserves and frailty contribute to worse outcomes in elderly patients in terms of functional decline, more complications, and prolonged hospital stays, regardless of treatment. Advanced age and common co-morbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, have been shown to be independent risk factors for mortality in small bowel obstruction.

Little is known about the interference of starvation treatment with the necessity to continue medication for chronic disease and pre-existing nutritional deficiencies, all of which present challenges in managing elderly patients with small bowel obstruction. Regarding goal settings, frail elderly patients often judge quality of life to be more important than prolongation of life, which implies a more balanced decision-making process.

Adhesions quantification

Among the different adhesions scoring systems proposed mainly by gynecologists, the Peritoneal Adhesion Index (PAI) score proposed by Coccolini et al. is the more complete and easy-to-use system. Specific attention should be paid to the uniformity of measurement. We suggest a regimented classification system for adhesions to standardize their definition and subsequent analysis. This approach allows different surgeons in various treatment centers to evaluate patients more effectively, comparing their conditions to past evaluations using a universal classification system. This classification is based on the macroscopic appearance of adhesions and their extent across different regions of the abdomen. Using specific scoring criteria, clinicians can assign a PAI ranging from 0 to 30, thereby providing a precise description of the intra-abdominal condition.

- **Peritoneal adhesion index**: By ascribing to each abdomen area an adhesion-related score as indicated, the sum of the scores will result in the PAI.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^113ViEi6]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

A 2015 meta-analysis investigated CT findings that predicted small bowel ischaemia at subsequent surgery for small bowel obstruction. Analysis of 768 patients from nine studies found that reduced mural enhancement was associated with surgical ischaemia, whereas the absence of mesenteric fluid effectively ruled out strangulation. However, it is unlikely that surgeons will restrict their decision-making to imaging alone. Because of this, we performed a systematic review of potential predictor variables that extended beyond CT, into clinical and biochemical realms. In addition to the meta-analysis of factors to predict ischaemia at surgery, we also looked for associations predicting conservative versus operative management. Furthermore, we did not simply rely on statistical significance following meta-analysis to identify promising predictors but based our selection on the strength of statistical evidence, including assessments of consistency and credibility, with non-credible results reflected by excessive OR values and/or excessively wide confidence intervals.

We meta-analysed 14 imaging, 10 clinical, and 5 laboratory predictor variables but could only identify strong evidence of potential utility for 8 of these.

- **Imaging variables**: Peritoneal free fluid, mesenteric inflammation, and high-grade obstruction (defined by clinical suspicion of complete or nearly complete obstruction) all predicted surgical management, whereas peritoneal free fluid and bowel thickening predicted ischaemia at surgery.

- **Clinical variables**: Three clinical variables demonstrated pot…

### A nationwide analysis of outcomes, healthcare encounters, and costs of small bowel obstruction [^113ttGcA]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a prevalent and clinically challenging condition. Surgical interventions may be relatively high-risk for vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and underinsured. This study investigates the sociodemographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, and hospital characteristics of SBO encounters to better understand risk factors.

- **Methods**: We utilized the 2020 National Inpatient Sample database for adults (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of SBO, identified using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision Procedure Coding System codes were used to define the type of management. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcomes were inpatient cost and length of hospital stay.

- **Results**: Among 246,395 patients with SBO, 25,083 (10%) underwent operative management (OM) and 221,312 (90%) underwent non-operative management (NOM). Among all patients, the majority were female (56%), used Medicare (58%), were White (72%), with a mean age of 65. NOM patients were discharged home more often (75% versus 53%, P < 0.001). OM patients experienced more mortality (4.5% versus 1.4%). OM patients were treated at urban teaching hospitals more often (71% versus 67%, P < 0.001) and had shorter lengths of stay (4.2 versus 11.1 days, P < 0.001) with lower inpatient costs ($11,124 versus $35,346, P < 0.001) compared to NOM. In adjusted analyses, patients aged 75–84 had 9.0 times greater odds of mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 9.0, P < 0.001), and OM had 3.3 greater odds of mortality.

### Optimal management of malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction: Do international guidelines agree [^113fPzDo]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Of the 19 guidelines, 13 (68%) appraised the quality of evidence available to formulate their recommendations. Several different tools were used to grade the evidence, but the most commonly used was the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Thirteen guidelines were published between 2010 and 2016. Most of these guidelines were based on low quality or level III–IV evidence (n = 5, 38%). In contrast, six guidelines were published between 2017 and 2018, and these were mostly based on moderate quality or level I–II evidence (n = 5, 83%). At the time of writing, no guidelines have reported on high quality or level Ia evidence.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^112ePoT1]. European Radiology (2024). High credibility.

To identify imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables potentially prognostic for surgical management of small bowel obstruction, two researchers systematically reviewed indexed literature from 2001 to 2021. This review focused on imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables potentially predictive of surgical management of small bowel obstruction and/or ischemia at surgery, where performed. Risk of bias was assessed, and contingency tables for variables reported in at least five studies were extracted and meta-analyzed to identify strong evidence of association with clinical outcomes across studies.

Thirty-one studies were ultimately included, reporting on 4,638 patients (ranging from 44 to 313 per study). Among these, 11 studies (35%) raised no risk of bias concerns. Computed tomography (CT) was the modality reported most frequently (29 studies, 94%). A meta-analysis of 21 predictors identified five that were strongly associated with surgical intervention, three of which were derived from CT: peritoneal free fluid (odds ratio [OR] 3.24, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.29), high-grade obstruction (OR 3.58, 95% CI 2.46 to 5.20), and mesenteric inflammation (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.50). Additionally, abdominal distension (OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.42) and peritonism (OR 3.97, 95% CI 2.67 to 5.90) were noted, along with one factor associated with conservative management: previous abdominopelvic surgery (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85).

Meta-analysis of 10 predictors identified three that were strongly associated with ischemia at surgery, two of which were derived from CT: peritoneal free fluid (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.28 to 5.35) and bowel thickening (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.91 to 5.55). Another significant predictor of ischemia was a high white cell count (OR 4.76, 95% CI 2.71 to 8.36).
