## Question

Otitis media 4 months old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a 4-month-old infant with otitis media, distinguishing acute otitis media from otitis media with effusion, and outlining diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and how that shifts the diagnostic and therapeutic thresholds. Then, I should verify the key diagnostic distinctions between AOM and OME and the best methods to confirm middle ear effusion. Next, I will consider management pathways for AOM at 4 months, including pain control, antibiotic decisions, and follow-up. After that, I will examine OME management, especially the 3-month watchful waiting window and when to obtain hearing testing. Finally, I should review prevention, counseling, and documentation requirements to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care [^115vFj9E] [^1131Dqsw].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why age matters. At 4 months, the infant is below the 6-month threshold where AOM guidelines typically begin, so I need to be cautious and ensure that any AOM diagnosis is truly warranted and that I am not conflating OME with AOM, because management diverges substantially and overtreatment with antibiotics is common in this age group [^115vFj9E].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic distinction before committing to treatment. AOM requires acute symptoms such as fever, ear pain or marked irritability, and otoscopic findings of moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not due to otitis externa; mild bulging plus recent ear pain or marked erythema can support the diagnosis, whereas OME is fluid in the middle ear without acute inflammatory signs or symptoms, so I should not label non-bulging effusions as AOM in a 4-month-old [^115vFj9E] [^115a7wto]. I should double-check the ear exam technique because pneumatic otoscopy is the primary recommended method to confirm effusion and distinguish AOM from OME, and tympanometry can help when the diagnosis is uncertain after attempting pneumatic otoscopy [^111V3q59] [^112YAxw6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics if AOM is suspected at 4 months. I initially thought that all infants under 6 months with AOM should receive antibiotics immediately, but I should confirm guideline nuances; the AAP AOM guideline scope starts at 6 months, so for a 4-month-old, most clinicians treat AOM when confidently diagnosed because of age and the difficulty of observation, yet the formal AAP recommendations about observation versus immediate antibiotics are written for 6 months and older, which means my threshold to treat a 4-month-old is low but I must acknowledge the guideline scope limitation and base decisions on severity and diagnostic certainty [^115vFj9E] [^1121zYTK]. If AOM is diagnosed with high certainty, amoxicillin at 80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily is first-line unless there are specific risk factors for beta-lactamase producers or recent amoxicillin exposure, in which case amoxicillin-clavulanate is reasonable, and I should treat for 10 days given the infant's age and severity considerations [^115a7wto] [^1135fz6j]. I need to ensure robust pain control with acetaminophen or ibuprofen if age-appropriate, and arrange close follow-up within 48–72 hours to reassess if I use observation due to diagnostic uncertainty or mild disease, with a low threshold to start antibiotics if worsening or no improvement [^115vFj9E] [^112zwNdR].

> Let me consider OME next, because many 4-month-olds present with effusion without acute signs. If the infant has OME without AOM features, I should recommend watchful waiting for 3 months from diagnosis, avoid antibiotics, and avoid intranasal or systemic steroids, antihistamines, or decongestants, as these do not improve long-term outcomes and carry harms; I should document the effusion and plan reassessment at 3–6 month intervals until resolution or new concerns arise [^112YAxw6] [^111V3q59]. I should confirm hearing status if OME persists for 3 months or at any time if developmental red flags appear, using age-appropriate methods such as visual reinforcement audiometry, and counsel families about potential speech and language impacts when bilateral OME with documented hearing loss is present [^1131Dqsw] [^111yG953]. But wait, what if the infant failed a newborn hearing screen with presumed OME; in that scenario, I should ensure timely follow-up to document resolution and exclude underlying sensorineural hearing loss, ideally within about 3 months, and refer to otolaryngology if persistent hearing loss is documented [^115yBPdZ] [^115g9e4t].

> I should double-check surgical thresholds because families often ask about tubes. Tympanostomy tube insertion is not indicated for a single brief episode of OME under 3 months' duration; evidence and guidelines support observation until OME has persisted at least 3 months before considering tubes, except in at-risk children where earlier intervention may be appropriate, so I need to individualize based on duration, hearing status, and risk factors [^112GxUXr] [^113ngcjb]. If OME persists for 3 months with documented hearing loss or significant developmental concerns, referral to otolaryngology for tympanostomy tube consideration is appropriate, and in children under 4 years, tympanostomy tubes are preferred over adenoidectomy when surgery is indicated for OME [^111YcvWE] [^113QGkvV].

> Next, I should review prevention and counseling because they meaningfully reduce recurrence and improve outcomes. I need to ensure the infant is up to date on pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months when feasible, and advise avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure, as these measures reduce AOM risk and may mitigate OME burden over time [^112Bg1aw] [^116dJPqn]. I should confirm that families understand the natural history of OME, the rationale for watchful waiting, red flags that warrant earlier reassessment, and the plan for hearing follow-up if effusion persists, using guideline-provided counseling resources when available [^112YAxw6] [^116HspNF].

> I will now examine documentation and follow-up to close the loop. I need to record the diagnosis with method of confirmation, laterality, estimated duration, severity of symptoms, management plan including analgesia and antibiotic decision rationale, and the follow-up arrangement; if observation is used, I must ensure a rescue plan and reliable return within 48–72 hours if the infant worsens or fails to improve, and I should document hearing outcomes and quality-of-life improvements over time when managing OME [^116dAKSh] [^112zwNdR]. Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed caregiver education and a safety net, because adherence to follow-up and rescue pathways is essential to safe observation strategies in this age group [^115mpysL].

> In summary, for a 4-month-old with suspected otitis media, I need to first confirm whether this is AOM or OME using pneumatic otoscopy and, if needed, tympanometry; if AOM is diagnosed with high certainty, treat with high-dose amoxicillin for 10 days, provide analgesia, and arrange close follow-up, recognizing that formal AOM guidelines start at 6 months and that diagnostic certainty is crucial to avoid overtreatment; if OME is diagnosed, observe for 3 months without antibiotics or steroids, reassess periodically, obtain age-appropriate hearing testing if persistent or if developmental concerns arise, and refer for tympanostomy tube evaluation if OME persists with hearing loss or other risk factors, all while reinforcing prevention and thorough documentation [^115vFj9E] [^1131Dqsw] [^111V3q59] [^112GxUXr].

For a 4-month-old with otitis media, **distinguish AOM from OME** using pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry [^111V3q59] [^112YAxw6]. Treat **AOM with high-dose amoxicillin** (80–90 mg/kg/day) for 10 days if the infant is ≥ 6 months; if younger, treat promptly without observation [^1135fz6j] [^115a7wto]. For OME, **observe for 3 months** without antibiotics or steroids, and obtain hearing testing if effusion persists or the child is at risk [^1132zHVL] [^114GsdtY]. Tympanostomy tubes are indicated for persistent bilateral OME with hearing loss or recurrent AOM [^115g9e4t] [^114KJyqh]. Provide analgesia, avoid decongestants/antihistamines, and ensure close follow-up [^115vFj9E] [^111V3q59].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Acute otitis media (AOM)**: Characterized by acute onset of symptoms (fever, irritability, ear tugging) and middle ear effusion with signs of inflammation (bulging, erythema, limited mobility of the tympanic membrane) [^115a7wto].

- **Otitis media with effusion (OME)**: Presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs of acute inflammation or infection [^112YAxw6].

- **Diagnostic methods**: Pneumatic otoscopy is the primary diagnostic tool, with tympanometry used to confirm effusion when otoscopy is inconclusive [^114EDL2Q].

---

## Management of acute otitis media (AOM)

### Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line antibiotic**: High-dose amoxicillin (80–90 mg/kg/day divided twice daily) for 10 days is recommended for infants ≥ 6 months [^1135fz6j].

- **Younger infants**: For infants < 6 months, immediate antibiotic therapy is recommended without observation due to higher risk of complications [^115EmKpe].

- **Observation strategy**: Not recommended for infants < 6 months due to age-related risks [^115EmKpe].

---

### Adjunctive therapies

Provide **analgesia** with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever control [^notfound]. Avoid **decongestants and antihistamines**, as they are ineffective and not recommended [^117Y9bUu].

---

## Management of otitis media with effusion (OME)

### Observation and follow-up

Use a **watchful waiting** approach for 3 months from diagnosis, as most cases resolve spontaneously [^1132zHVL]. Arrange **regular follow-up** with reassessment at 3–6 month intervals until effusion resolves or significant hearing loss is identified [^111YcvWE].

---

### Hearing assessment

Obtain **hearing testing** if OME persists ≥ 3 months or at any time if the child is at risk for developmental delays [^114GsdtY]. Use **age-appropriate methods** such as visual reinforcement audiometry for infants and young children [^111yG953].

---

### Surgical intervention

Tympanostomy tubes are indicated for persistent bilateral OME with documented hearing loss or for recurrent AOM (≥ 3 episodes in 6 months or ≥ 4 episodes in 12 months) [^114WLTvd] [^114KJyqh]. Adenoidectomy is not recommended for children < 4 years unless there is a distinct indication (e.g. nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis) [^113ZRs1P].

---

## Risk factors and prevention

- **Breastfeeding**: Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months reduces the risk of AOM [^116dJPqn].

- **Vaccinations**: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and annual influenza vaccination are recommended [^115Bhgjw] [^112Bg1aw].

- **Environmental factors**: Avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure and reducing pacifier use after 6 months may reduce risk [^112Bg1aw].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **hearing loss** from persistent effusion or recurrent infections, as well as **speech and language delays** due to chronic middle ear effusion. Recurrent or chronic infections may lead to tympanic membrane perforation or chronic suppurative otitis media. Intratemporal and intracranial complications, though rare, include mastoiditis and meningitis [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **regular visits** to monitor resolution of effusion, hearing status, and developmental milestones. Provide **parent education** on the natural history of OME, the importance of follow-up, and signs of complications [^112YAxw6].

---

Management of otitis media in a 4-month-old infant involves accurate diagnosis, appropriate antibiotic therapy for AOM, and careful observation for OME. Regular follow-up and hearing assessment are essential to prevent complications and ensure normal development.

### Screening children in the first four years of life to undergo early treatment for otitis media with effusion [^112TKi1h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. This condition has a prevalence of about 20% at the age of two years, a time of rapid language development. It is most often asymptomatic. Effective treatment exists for clearing effusions. Some have argued, therefore, that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. However, there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of effusions and for some children, effusions may represent a physiological response that does not reduce hearing significantly or impact negatively on language development or behaviour. Previous reviews of the effect of screening and treatment have included studies using non-randomised designs.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effectiveness, on language and behavioural outcomes, of screening and treating children with clinically important OME in the first four years of their life. The focus was on the first four years of life because this is the time of most rapid language development. The consequences of hearing loss are likely to be most serious during this time. In addition, children of this age are least likely to be able to report or seek help for impaired hearing, particularly if these problems have a slow onset and are subtle.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (the Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966–2002) and EMBASE (1974–2002) (all in February 2002) and reference lists of all studies. We also contacted the first authors of the studies we included in this review.

Selection Criteria

1. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening. 2. Comparison of outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME and outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We identified no trials comparing outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME with outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME. We identified three trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening. From these trials, we found no evidence of clinically important benefit in language development from screening and treating children with clinically important OME. Although there was a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME and improved hearing in the short-term (six months), this effect largely disappeared in the long-term (12 months).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The identified randomised trials do not show an important benefit from screening of the general population of asymptomatic children in the first four years of life for OME on language development and behaviour.

### Identification of children in the first four years of life for early treatment for otitis media with effusion [^113LmV47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and has been associated with delayed language development and behavioural problems. This condition has a point-prevalence of about 20% at the age of two years, a time of rapid language development. It is most often asymptomatic. Effective treatment exists for clearing effusions. Some have argued, therefore, that children should be screened and treated early if found to have clinically important OME. However, there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of effusions and, for some children, effusions may represent a physiological response that does not reduce hearing significantly or impact negatively on language development or behaviour. Previous reviews of the effect of screening and treatment have included studies using non-randomised designs.

The focus was on the first four years of life because this is the time of most rapid language development. The consequences of hearing loss are likely to be most serious during this time. In addition, children of this age are least likely to be able to report or seek help for impaired hearing, particularly if these problems have a slow onset and are subtle.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2006), MEDLINE (1950 to 2006) and EMBASE (1974 to 2006) in February 2002, and again in January 2006, and the reference lists of all studies. We also contacted the first authors of the studies we included in the original review.

Selection Criteria

1. Randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening.2. Comparison of outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME and outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, two in the original review and two for the update.

Main Results

We identified no trials comparing outcomes for children randomised to be screened for OME with outcomes for children who were not randomised to be screened for OME. We identified three trials evaluating interventions for OME among children with OME identified through screening, one of which generated three published studies. These were trials of treatment in children identified through screening rather than trials of treatment programs. From these trials, we found no evidence of clinically important benefit in language development from screening and treating children with clinically important OME.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified randomised trials do not show an important benefit on language development and behaviour from screening of the general population of asymptomatic children in the first four years of life for OME. However, these trials were all conducted in developed countries. Evidence generated in the developed world, where children may enjoy better nutrition, better living conditions and less severe and different infections may not be applicable to children in developing countries. The screening aspect of some of these studies was aimed primarily at identifying suitable children in whom to evaluate the effects of treatment, rather than to evaluate the effects of screening programs. Younger children and children with milder disease may have been included in these treatment trials compared to children who are offered treatment in pragmatic settings.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115vFj9E]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) guideline — this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM and focuses on appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM and addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures, and it also addresses recurrent AOM. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships, and the practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance; rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making, not to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children, and these recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to management.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^113QGkvV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — surgery for children < 4 years old: Clinicians should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old, and adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication other than OME exists; this recommendation is based on systematic reviews of RCTs with a preponderance of benefit over harm. If surgery is chosen, tympanostomy tube insertion is the procedure of choice, and adenoidectomy is not recommended for a primary indication of OME in children < 4 years old; more recent evidence suggests that 4 years is a more appropriate cut point and the threshold for adenoidectomy as repeat surgery has been raised to age 4 years.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1162orWZ]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotic therapy or offering observation with close follow-up in patients aged 6–23 months without severe signs or symptoms. Initiate antibiotic therapy if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48–72 hours of the onset of symptoms.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1173F3P5]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Purpose of this section — if an antibiotic will be used for treatment of a child with AOM, the clinician must choose an antibiotic with a high likelihood of being effective against the most likely etiologic bacterial pathogens with considerations of cost, taste, convenience, and adverse effects, and this section proposes first- and second-line antibiotics that best meet these criteria while balancing potential benefits and harms.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116ZUjvu]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 4C — For acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up, clinicians should reassess the patient if the caregiver reports that the child's symptoms have worsened or failed to respond to the initial antibiotic treatment within 48 to 72 hours and determine whether a change in therapy is needed (Evidence Quality: Grade B, Rec. Strength: Recommendation).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^113qN9za]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 2 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated acute otitis media (AOM). The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of otolaryngology, epidemiology, and infectious disease. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the evidence-based literature related to AOM. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibacterial treatment, appropriate choices of antibacterials, and preventive measures. Decisions were made based on a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, as well as expert consensus when definitive data were not available. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the partnering organizations. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115Draen]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to initiate antibiotic therapy in patients aged 6–23 months with bilateral AOM, regardless of symptom severity.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112CSxYj]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Practice patterns — adherence to clinical practice guidance for otitis media with effusion (OME) is low: only 7% to 33% of pediatricians use pneumatic otoscopy for diagnosis, only 29% obtain an age-appropriate hearing test when effusion persists for > 3 months, and 32% treat OME inappropriately with antibiotics, contributing to unnecessary adverse events and bacterial resistance.

---

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116ssQHf]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — recommendations state that the update group made recommendations that clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening, should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors, and should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age. Clinicians should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort, and should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME.

---

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112zwNdR]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Initial management strategies for AOM — this section defines two options and required safeguards: initial antibiotic therapy is defined as treatment of AOM with antibiotics that are prescribed at the time of diagnosis with the intent of starting antibiotic therapy as soon as possible after the encounter, and initial observation is defined as initial management of AOM limited to symptomatic relief with commencement of antibiotics only if the child's condition worsens at any time or does not show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis; it also states that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and initiation of antibiotics if the child fails observation.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112QStUz]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis media, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotics, indications, young children, AAFP/AAP 2013 guidelines recommend to initiate antibiotic therapy in ≥ 6 months old patients with AOM (bilateral or unilateral) with severe signs or symptoms, including:

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^112WRk5V]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline is a revision of the 2004 acute otitis media (AOM) guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Family Physicians. It provides recommendations to primary care clinicians for the management of children from 6 months through 12 years of age with uncomplicated AOM. In 2009, the AAP convened a committee composed of primary care physicians and experts in the fields of pediatrics, family practice, otolaryngology, epidemiology, infectious disease, emergency medicine, and guideline methodology. The subcommittee partnered with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Southern California Evidence-Based Practice Center to develop a comprehensive review of the new literature related to AOM since the initial evidence report of 2000. The resulting evidence report and other sources of data were used to formulate the practice guideline recommendations. The focus of this practice guideline is the appropriate diagnosis and initial treatment of a child presenting with AOM. The guideline provides a specific, stringent definition of AOM. It addresses pain management, initial observation versus antibiotic treatment, appropriate choices of antibiotic agents, and preventive measures. It also addresses recurrent AOM, which was not included in the 2004 guideline. Decisions were made on the basis of a systematic grading of the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationships. The practice guideline underwent comprehensive peer review before formal approval by the AAP. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the management of children with AOM. Rather, it is intended to assist primary care clinicians by providing a framework for clinical decision-making. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition. These recommendations may not provide the only appropriate approach to the management of this problem.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion executive summary (update) [^117Y9bUu]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion". To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 18 recommendations developed emphasize diagnostic accuracy, identification of children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from otitis media with effusion, and education of clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most otitis media with effusion and the lack of efficacy for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Pediatric acute otitis media: the case for delayed antibiotic treatment [^113CsUn7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is both a commonly diagnosed condition and a frequent indication for antibiotic use in children. Recent literature suggests that antibiotics are not needed in many children with AOM, as most cases resolve spontaneously without complication. However, a majority of AOM infections in children are still treated with antibiotics. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians released a guideline for treatment of AOM in children. We review the guideline as well as scientific evidence related to AOM treatment options. We support a set of evidence-based guidelines employing a delayed prescription option for antibiotic therapy in selected children. If used appropriately, these cost-effective guidelines will reduce the amount of antibiotics prescribed, increase parental satisfaction, and may lower rates of antibiotic resistance while producing similar rates of resolution of AOM.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^113zjyLA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the United States, Canada and Australia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to October week 4, 2012), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2012), Current Contents (1966 to November 2012), CINAHL (2008 to November 2012) and LILACS (2008 to November 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 12 RCTs (3317 children and 3854 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible. However, one trial did not report patient-relevant outcomes, leaving 11 trials with generally low risk of bias. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20) and fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95; NNTB 20). When compared with placebo, antibiotics did not alter the number of abnormal tympanometry findings at either four to six weeks (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) or at three months (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24), or the number of AOM recurrences (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10). However, antibiotic treatment did lead to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral AOM episodes (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) as compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.34; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.55; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) were eligible. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis on pain at days three to seven. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic group or the expectant observation group. Additionally, no difference in tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence was observed. Immediate antibiotic prescribing was associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash as compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of children with AOM experiencing pain at two to seven days compared with placebo but since most children (82%) settle spontaneously, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one suffering from ear pain at two to seven days. Additionally, antibiotic treatment led to a statistically significant reduction of tympanic membrane perforations (NNTB 33) and contralateral AOM episodes (NNTB 11). These benefits must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics had been withheld. Antibiotics appear to be most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease, an expectant observational approach seems justified. We have no trials in populations with higher risks of complications.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113ngcjb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) natural history and observation thresholds are described as follows: Short-term natural history shows rates of spontaneous resolution or improvement ranging from 28% to 52% within 3 or 4 months of diagnosis. Most studies of tympanostomy tube efficacy required documented bilateral OME for at least 3 months before entry into the study, and one group enrolled children with at least 2 months of bilateral OME. Because of these restrictions, there are no data to support tympanostomy tube insertion in children with OME of brief duration (less than 2 to 3 months), and observation until the OME has been documented for at least 3 months can avoid unnecessary surgery. Children with OME who are at risk for developmental delays or disorders are excluded from this recommendation and should therefore be managed on an individual basis when OME is diagnosed.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^116fLhfv]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) initial management — Table 4 lists age-, severity-, otorrhea-, and laterality-based options: for "6 mo to 2 y", otorrhea with AOM, unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms, and bilateral AOM without otorrhea are "Antibiotic therapy", whereas unilateral AOM without otorrhea allows "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation"; for " ≥ 2 y", otorrhea with AOM and unilateral or bilateral AOM with severe symptoms are "Antibiotic therapy", while bilateral AOM without otorrhea and unilateral AOM without otorrhea allow "Antibiotic therapy or additional observation". These recommendations "apply only to children with well-documented AOM with high certainty of diagnosis", define severe features including "persistent otalgia more than 48 h" and "temperature ≥ 39°C (102.2°F) in the past 48 h", and emphasize shared decision-making with a safety net: "If observation is offered, a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens or fails to improve within 48 to 72 h of AOM onset".

Failed newborn hearing screen with suspected otitis media with effusion (OME) — follow-up considerations include that referral to an otolaryngologist is appropriate for all infants with documented persistent hearing loss after a failed newborn hearing screen, even if the cause is presumed to be secondary to OME; for infants aged ≥ 6 months with documented bilateral OME for ≥ 3 months and documented hearing difficulties, clinicians should offer tympanostomy tubes; insertion of tympanostomy tubes to resolve effusion and facilitate better assessment of hearing status may also be appropriate on an individualized basis for children with severe hearing loss, a history of congenital SNHL in the immediate family, or an at-risk status as defined in Table 3; the decision of whether or not to insert tympanostomy tubes should be shared with, and explained to, patients and their families; and the Table 8 FAQ can be distributed to parents and caregivers to fulfill counseling about follow-up to ensure hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying SNHL.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116HspNF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion implementation considerations — pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry were previously recommended for diagnosis, but pneumatic otoscopy in particular continues to be underused in primary care settings; the guideline provides expanded information on these modalities, yet enhanced efforts will still be needed in primary care and educational efforts would likely benefit specialists as well. OME is one of the most common reasons that infants fail a newborn hearing test, with challenges in ensuring follow-up to assess effusion resolution and exclude underlying SNHL; counseling materials are provided for families, but continued education of hospital providers who administer newborn testing is an additional challenge. The new guideline reaffirms a prior recommendation against routine screening of children for OME and adds a new recommendation that clinicians evaluate at-risk children when the at-risk condition is diagnosed and again at 12 to 18 months of age, a change that imposes additional burden but had strong consensus and support from the GUG.

Conclusions

The main findings favouring placebo at one and nine months provide evidence that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common illnesses for which children in the United States receive an antimicrobial agent. Of the six recommendations offered in recent guidelines for treatment of AOM, only one, the assessment and treatment of pain with analgesics, is based on strong evidence. This article reviews the diagnosis of AOM and the accuracy of various signs and symptoms in indicating a bacterial origin, the data on the effect of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo in the treatment of AOM, and the gaps in knowledge that should be addressed by future research and clinical trials.

Surgery for children aged ≥ 4 years with OME — if a decision is reached to manage OME in a child aged ≥ 4 years with surgical intervention, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tube insertion, or both can be recommended, and the availability of at least 3 surgical options (tubes alone, adenoidectomy alone, or adenoidectomy plus tubes) creates an opportunity for shared decision making with caregivers; evidence from an individual patient data meta-analysis based on 1761 children from 10 randomized trials (9 comparisons of adenoidectomy with or without tubes vs no surgery or tubes alone) found no clinically important benefits for adenoidectomy in children < 4 years old, whereas children aged ≥ 4 years old spent 50 fewer days with OME over the next 12 months, had lower failure rates (51% vs 70%), and a lower rate of future surgery (2% vs 19%); in that study, failure at 12 months was defined as additional surgery, recurrent AOM, middle ear effusion at least 50% of the time, or average hearing improvement < 10-dB HL; additionally, a review of 15 randomized trials and observational studies evaluated tympanostomy tubes with or without adenoidectomy as primary therapy for OM.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115PKrFc]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic choice and comparative trial design — notes that amoxicillin-clavulanate has a broader spectrum than amoxicillin and may be a better initial antibiotic; however, because of cost and adverse effects, the subcommittee has chosen amoxicillin as first-line AOM treatment. For head-to-head comparisons, stringent diagnostic criteria should be the standard for these studies, antibiotic comparisons for AOM should now include an observation arm for patients with nonsevere illness to ensure a clinical benefit over placebo, and studies should also have enough patients to show small but meaningful differences. Additional research is needed to determine whether risk factors such as child care settings and siblings younger than 5 years indicate a need for different initial treatment, to develop new antibiotics that are safe and effective and test them against the currently available medications, and to conduct randomized controlled trials using different durations of antibiotic therapy in different age groups to optimize therapy with the possibility of decreasing duration of antibiotic use, which would need to be performed initially with amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and again include an observation arm in nonsevere illness.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^115yBPdZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — failed newborn hearing screen follow-up: Clinicians should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn hearing screen regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Intentional vagueness states that the method and specifics of follow-up are at the discretion of the clinician but should seek resolution of OME within 3 months of onset or, if not known, diagnosis. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C; Level of confidence in evidence: Medium; Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit, with benefits including more prompt diagnosis of SNHL, earlier intervention for hearing loss, reduced loss to follow-up, and reassurance for parents, and risks including time spent in counseling and parental anxiety from increased focus on child hearing issues. Supporting data report that among screening failures referred for further testing, 55% of children had OME, of which 23% had spontaneous resolution; in remaining infants after tympanocentesis or placement of ventilation tubes, 69% had immediate return and 31% had delayed return in hearing with a median of 4.8 months; a cohort study found that 11% had SNHL in addition to the transient conductive hearing loss from the effusion.

Table 4
Adverse effects experienced while taking active or placebo spray as reported at one and three month assessments

Pass/fail results on sweep audiometry (fail at two or more frequencies at 25 dB hearing level in the better ear) did not differ between the groups: 63% (52/83) of treated children versus 58% (47/81) of those in the placebo group failed at three months, as did 59% (44/74) versus 51% (34/67) at nine months.

We evaluated concealment in children and parents (guardians), and prediction of the correct group was no better than chance. More than 80% of parents (guardians) in the placebo group thought their children were receiving the active treatment. Reported adherence was very good or excellent in 95/99 (96%) children in the topical steroid group and 93/103 (90%) in the placebo group at one month and in 79/90 (88%) and 78/89 (88%) at three months. Analysis of adherence by age group showed a non-significant difference for the main outcome at one and three months (Fisher's test 0.04; χ 2 test for trend P = 0.40).

### Otitis media: review of the 2004 treatment guidelines [^114T49UA]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the 2004 treatment guidelines provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) regarding the treatment of otitis media in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, restricted to English-language articles about pediatric patients, was conducted (1966-May 2005) using the key words acute otitis media (AOM), guideline, observation therapy, and vaccination. Additional references were located through review of the bibliographies of cited articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies related to the fundamental basis of the updated guidelines and articles addressing current issues related to otitis media infection were included.

Data Synthesis

Otitis media affects many children in the US. Concerns have been raised about the proper treatment of AOM in the face of increasing drug resistance among primary pathogens responsible for infection. Some countries have chosen to observe patients for a designated period of time prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The AAP and AAFP have updated the treatment guidelines for otitis media to include the option of observation therapy, recommendations for dosing of various antibiotic regimens and their place in therapy, and the importance of initial pain management.

Conclusions

Updated treatment guidelines for otitis media have been developed in an effort to properly treat children while decreasing current resistance rates for common organisms that cause AOM. In the future, the therapeutic outcomes of observation therapy related to both the incidence of drug resistance and the possibility of increased complications related to otitis media will need to be evaluated in the US.

### Antibiotics for acute otitis media in children [^1137FsEi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood. Antibiotic use for AOM varies from 56% in the Netherlands to 95% in the United States, Canada and Australia. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 1997 and previously updated in 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics for children with AOM.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to April week 3, 2015), OLDMEDLINE (1958 to 1965), EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2015), Current Contents (1966 to April 2015), CINAHL (2008 to April 2015) and LILACS (2008 to April 2015).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 1) antimicrobial drugs with placebo and 2) immediate antibiotic treatment with expectant observation (including delayed antibiotic prescribing) in children with AOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

For the review of antibiotics against placebo, 13 RCTs (3401 children and 3938 AOM episodes) from high-income countries were eligible and had generally low risk of bias. The combined results of the trials revealed that by 24 hours from the start of treatment, 60% of the children had recovered whether or not they had placebo or antibiotics. Pain was not reduced by antibiotics at 24 hours (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.01) but almost a third fewer had residual pain at two to three days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20). A quarter fewer had pain at four to seven days (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.91; NNTB 16) and two-thirds fewer had pain at 10 to 12 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66; NNTB 7) compared with placebo. Antibiotics did reduce the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.90; NNTB 11), at six to eight weeks (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; NNTB 16) and the number of children with tympanic membrane perforations (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; NNTB 33) and halved contralateral otitis episodes (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95; NNTB 11) compared with placebo. However, antibiotics neither reduced the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at three months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24) nor the number of children with late AOM recurrences (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.10) when compared with placebo. Severe complications were rare and did not differ between children treated with antibiotics and those treated with placebo. Adverse events (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) occurred more often in children taking antibiotics (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.59; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 14). Funnel plots do not suggest publication bias. Individual patient data meta-analysis of a subset of included trials found antibiotics to be most beneficial in children aged less than two years with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For the review of immediate antibiotics against expectant observation, five trials (1149 children) from high-income countries were eligible and had low to moderate risk of bias. Four trials (1007 children) reported outcome data that could be used for this review. From these trials, data from 959 children could be extracted for the meta-analysis of pain at three to seven days. No difference in pain was detectable at three to seven days (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.12). One trial (247 children) reported data on pain at 11 to 14 days. Immediate antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in the number of children with pain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10) compared with expectant observation. Additionally, no differences in the number of children with abnormal tympanometry findings at four weeks, tympanic membrane perforations and AOM recurrence were observed between groups. No serious complications occurred in either the antibiotic or the expectant observation group. Immediate antibiotics were associated with a substantial increased risk of vomiting, diarrhoea or rash compared with expectant observation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.36; NNTH 9). Results from an individual patient data meta-analysis including data from six high-quality trials (1643 children) that were also included as individual trials in our review showed that antibiotics seem to be most beneficial in children younger than two years of age with bilateral AOM (NNTB 4) and in children with both AOM and otorrhoea (NNTB 3).

Authors' Conclusions

This review reveals that antibiotics have no early effect on pain, a slight effect on pain in the days following and only a modest effect on the number of children with tympanic perforations, contralateral otitis episodes and abnormal tympanometry findings at two to four weeks and at six to eight weeks compared with placebo in children with AOM. In high-income countries, most cases of AOM spontaneously remit without complications. The benefits of antibiotics must be weighed against the possible harms: for every 14 children treated with antibiotics one child experienced an adverse event (such as vomiting, diarrhoea or rash) that would not have occurred if antibiotics were withheld. Therefore clinical management should emphasise advice about adequate analgesia and the limited role for antibiotics. Antibiotics are most useful in children under two years of age with bilateral AOM, or with both AOM and otorrhoea. For most other children with mild disease in high-income countries, an expectant observational approach seems justified.

### Contemporary concepts in management of acute otitis media in children [^116E8E4w]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common disease of childhood. AOM is most appropriately diagnosed by careful otoscopy with an understanding of clinical signs and symptoms. The distinction between AOM and chronic otitis media with effusion should be emphasized. Treatment should include pain management, and initial antibiotic treatment should be given to those most likely to benefit, including young children, children with severe symptoms, and those with otorrhea and/or bilateral AOM. Tympanostomy tube placement may be helpful for those who experience frequent episodes of AOM or fail medical therapy. Recent practice guidelines may assist the clinician with such decisions.

### Otitis media with effusion [^117WBZDL]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children 1 to 3 years old with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced-practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media. The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should 1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME, 2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk, and 3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that 4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME, 5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected, and 6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate (tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure). Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that 1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children, and 2) because antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME, they should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that 1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and 2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery) and provide additional relevant information such as history of acute otitis media and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for 1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME, based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy, or 2) allergy management as a treatment for OME, based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children more than 12 years old, because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child-development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### A randomized comparative study of levofloxacin versus amoxicillin / clavulanate for treatment of infants and young children with recurrent or persistent acute otitis media [^1174ut1D]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The need for alternative antimicrobial therapy for recurrent and persistent acute otitis media (AOM) in children has raised interest in assessing the efficacy and safety of fluoroquinolones for treatment of these infections.

Methods

In an evaluator-blinded, active-comparator, noninferiority, multicenter study, children (6 months to < 5 years) were randomized 1:1 to receive levofloxacin (10 mg/kg twice daily) or amoxicillin/clavulanate (14:1; amoxicillin 45 mg/kg twice daily) for 10 days, with evaluations 4–6 days of therapy (visit 2), 2–5 days after completing therapy (visit 3), and 10–17 days after last dose (visit 4). Primary outcome was clinical cure at visit 3 based on resolution of clinical signs and symptoms of AOM.

Results

A total of 1650 children were randomized and 1305 were clinically evaluable at visit 3 (630 levofloxacin, 675 comparator). Clinical cure rates were 72.4% (456 of 630) in levofloxacin-treated and 69.9% (472 of 675) in amoxicillin/clavulanate-treated children. Cure rates were also similar for levofloxacin and comparator for each age group (≤ 24 months: 68.9% versus 66.2%; > 24 months: 76.9% versus 75.1%; respectively). Cure rates at visit 4 were 74.9% and 73.8% in levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate groups, respectively. The upper limits of the confidence intervals were less than the noninferiority margin of 10% indicating that levofloxacin treatment is noninferior to comparator treatment overall and in both infants (6 months to 2 years) and children 2–5 years. No differences between treatment groups regarding the frequency or type of adverse events were apparent.

Conclusions

Levofloxacin was not inferior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of recurrent and/or persistent AOM in infants and children.

Table 3
Children cured of otitis media with effusion according to tympanometric criteria (that is, proportions of children with either A or C1 tympanogram in at least one ear)

Overall, we found a low risk of individual children not being cured — 57% at one month, decreasing by a further 60% at three months and 60% at nine months (proportion of those remaining unresolved throughout 0.18, 0.13 to 0.26) (fig 2). The rate of referral to ear, nose, and throat specialists was low at 15/102 (15%) for the active group and 17/112 (15%) for the placebo group at nine months; 60% of these referrals were deemed appropriate according to suggested Medical Research Council criteria.

Fig 2 Natural history of bilateral otitis media with effusion in a primary care population

Adverse events, although relatively minor, included cough, dry throat, epistaxis, and nasal stinging (table 4). In total, 48 adverse events were noted by three months in the topical steroid group compared with 33 adverse events in the control group; statistical significance was not reached for any symptoms. The reported hearing difficulty (P = 0.08) and days with otalgia (P = 0.46) from the diaries at three months did not differ significantly between the groups at three months. Neither the total OM8–30 scores nor the scores for any of the eight subscales differed significantly between arms.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116aLddA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgery — shared decision making and age-based procedure selection emphasizes that there are 2 aspects of decision making (surgery vs additional observation, and procedure selection), candidacy depends on hearing status, associated symptoms, developmental risk, and anticipated chance of spontaneous resolution, and the poorest spontaneous resolution occurs when effusion is chronic (≥ 3 months) or associated with a type B (flat curve) tympanogram; once surgery is chosen, shared decision making is limited for children < 4 years old because tympanostomy tubes are recommended, whereas in children ≥ 4 years old options include tympanostomy tube placement alone (offers the most reliable short- and intermediate-term resolution of hearing loss and caregivers of at-risk children perceive large improvements after tube placement), adenoidectomy alone (offers comparable OME control to tubes at 6 and 12 months but may be less reliable in the short term, reduces the need for repeat surgery, has more potential anesthetic- and procedure-related complications, and some children may need additional surgery for tympanostomy tube insertion), adenoidectomy plus myringotomy without tubes (has outcomes comparable to tubes with less otorrhea and tympanic membrane sequelae, but tympanostomy tube insertion offers more reliable short-term effusion resolution and middle ear ventilation and is preferable when potential relapse must be minimized or when pronounced inflammation is present), and adenoidectomy plus tympanostomy tube placement (offers combined benefits, especially reducing repeat surgery in children with a history of tympanostomy tube placement, and may benefit children with nasal obstruction or recurrent sinonasal infections insufficient alone to justify adenoidectomy).

The importance of preventing NTHi and non-PCV13-type early, persistent and severe OM in this populations is highlighted by our work. Our analysis of transitions in OM status during the first 6 months of life found less than 10% infants with OM had returned to normal healthy ears at subsequent visits. Where a diagnosis of bilaterally normal ears was made, this was transient, indicating the importance of regular and opportunistic ear assessments throughout the first months and years of life for these children. The National Guide for prevention of hearing loss in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations recommends timely vaccinations, surveillance, exclusive breast feeding, avoidance of smoke exposure, surgical interventions to reduce hearing impairment, chemoprophylaxis for high-risk children, and assessment of household overcrowding. Many of these strategies prevent other infections and are broadly recommended. However, evidence for prevention of OM is weak or lacking, and where reported, effect size is generally small. Our univariate and multivariable analyses of risk factors did not show statistically significant associations between OM and the classical risk factors, possibly due to high rates of OM with or without risk factor exposures. All infants in our study received appropriate management plans for their OM detected by research nurses at the time of vaccination, and according to otitis media guidelines for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, including education and guidance about detecting and managing ear and hearing problems, primary health care and specialist service referrals. Very few infants received follow-up from their primary care providers, nor specialist services. The failure of these combined efforts to prevent and treat OM in these infants warrants a much greater local investment.

A limitation of our study was low sample size and limited ability to detect small but potentially important clinical differences between vaccines and schedules.

### Outpatient antibiotic prescribing for 357, 390 children with otitis media [^117RDWL8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) is a common complication of respiratory tract infections in children. Over 130,000 acute OM cases were diagnosed and treated in Finnish children in public health care centers in 2014. Nearly half of the infants have suffered from acute OM during their first living year and 70% before the age of 2 years. Among 17 European evidence-based guidelines, all recommend analgesics, and 15 recommend the wait-and-see practice in selected cases, and when treated, 14 recommend amoxicillin as the first-choice antibiotics: 7 with the dose of 40–50 mg/kg/day and 7 with the dose of 90 mg/kg/day.

The Finnish Current Care Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of OM, which were published in 2011 and updated in 2017, are in line with the European guidelines. The Finnish guidelines recommend that children younger than 24 months of age, and children with bulging eardrum, draining middle ear or purulent OM in both ears should be treated immediately, and the first-line antibiotics are amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. High amoxicillin dosing is not needed due to the low frequency of pneumococcal penicillin resistance in the country. Second-generation cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfa and macrolides are the second-line drugs recommended for those allergic to penicillin. Children 2 years of age and upward with less prominent clinical findings can be left without antibiotics, but they must be reexamined after 2 to 3 days if the symptoms continue.

A task force set up by the European Paediatric Association concluded that the overconsumption of antibiotics in children with spontaneously recovering respiratory tract infections is 1 of the 4 most important health care problems in children in Europe. Indeed, many children with signs and symptoms of OM during acute respiratory infection recover spontaneously, and a wait-and-see practice with delayed introduction of antibiotics, if needed, is justified in appropriate cases and eventually reduces the consumption of antibiotics at the population level.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate antibiotic prescriptions for children with OM in a nationwide private network of outpatient clinics in Finland. Special focus was paid to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions, which have been the first-choice recommendations since 2017, according to Finnish guidelines. A nationwide dataset allowed an estimation of variations by age, time, region and the specialty of the physicians. Further, we were interested in identifying potential needs and specific areas for future active interventions antibiotic use among children with OM.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1118woaa]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

The trial profile shows the flow of participants throughout the study period (fig 1). In the active monitoring group, 77.4% (961/1242) of children were excluded by the first tympanometry screen because bilateral otitis media with effusion was not confirmed and 55% (109/197) were excluded after three months because bilateral otitis media with effusion had not persisted. In those without active monitoring, 79.7% (683/857) were excluded because bilateral otitis media with effusion was not confirmed. In all, 261 children met the study entry criteria and 217 were randomised — 72 with previous active monitoring and 174 without. Table 2shows that potential confounders were equally distributed between the groups, but with slightly more boys in the placebo group (56% v 44%), confirming that randomisation was effective overall. The level of retention was high — 93% (201) at one month, 84% (182) at three months, and 73% (158) at nine months. At one month, 7% (16) of children were lost to follow-up but a further 3% (7) had missing tympanometric data, were uncooperative, or had uninterpretable tympanograms. We assumed that all missing data were missing at random and censored them in the analysis (without imputation).

### Updated guidelines for the management of acute otitis media in children by the Italian Society of Pediatrics: treatment [^115EmKpe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

New insights into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of acute otitis media (AOM) have been gained in recent years. For this reason, the Italian Paediatric Society has updated its 2010 guidelines.

Methods

A literature search was carried out on PubMed. Only pediatric studies published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2018 in English or Italian were included. Each included study was assessed according to the GRADE methodology. The quality of the systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR 2. The recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts.

Results

Prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for children with otorrhea, intracranial complications and/or a history of recurrence and for children under the age of 6 months. For children 6 months to 2 years of age, prompt antibiotic treatment is recommended for all forms of unilateral and bilateral AOM, whether mild or severe. Prompt antibiotic treatment is also recommended for children over 2 years with severe bilateral AOM. A watchful-waiting approach can be applied to children over 2 years with mild or severe unilateral AOM or mild bilateral AOM. High doses of amoxicillin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for patients with a high risk of infection by Beta-lactamase producing strains, remain the first-line antibiotics.

Conclusions

AOM should be managed on a case-by-case basis that takes account of the child's age, the severity of the episode and whether it is unilateral or bilateral. In patients under 2 years, prompt antibiotic treatment is always recommended.

Hearing assessment methods in OME — preferred approaches and age thresholds indicate that the preferred method of hearing assessment is age-appropriate audiologic testing through conventional audiometry, comprehensive audiologic assessment, and frequency-specific auditory-evoked potentials. Typically developing children aged ≥ 4 years may be sufficiently mature for conventional audiometry, which can be done in the primary care setting with a fail criterion > 20-dB HL at ≥ 1 frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) in either ear. Comprehensive audiologic evaluation by a licensed audiologist is recommended for children aged 6 months to 4 years and for any child who fails conventional audiometry in a primary care setting. Visual reinforcement audiometry is typically used for hearing assessment in children aged 8 months to 2.5 years, and has been shown to provide reliable results in infants as young as 6 months when performed by audiologists. Hearing testing by an audiologist is needed to determine the degree, type, and laterality of hearing loss to assess the functional impact of OME on a child's hearing, yet hearing testing is infrequently performed for children with OME in primary care settings.

### Pediatric ear, nose, and throat emergencies [^1144gKTe]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute otitis media is the most common infection for which antibiotics are prescribed in children, resulting in more than 20 million antibiotic prescriptions annually. New practice guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media. This article reviews those guidelines, several other common ear, nose, and throat entities, including sinusitis and dental emergencies, and current strategies in diagnosis and treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^113ikDaj]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings show that three months' use of topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children seems to be no better than placebo in improving clearance of effusions of otitis media at one, three, and nine months, or in improving important symptom related outcomes. This is an important and under-researched area of child health, as evidence for the use of promising non-surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion is lacking. Otitis media with effusion is a common chronic problem seen in primary care, for which no effective treatment exists in this setting and which often leads to referral and surgery.

This UK-wide primary care study is the largest double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with otitis media with effusion from any health setting; it is larger than the only previous randomised controlled trial from primary care that evaluated antibiotics. Follow-up rates were high, and we did not impute missing results (which would provide even more conservative findings than this analysis so would not alter the inferences). The results should thus be both relevant and generalisable to most children seen in the NHS.

This study used an objective outcome that evaluated efficacy in clearing bilateral effusions at one month. Although several small studies have suggested efficacy for topical nasal steroids, and they are often used off-licence for this condition, efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated in the literature. The risk difference (measured in children rather than ears) was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1) in favour of placebo. The main findings show that the adjusted relative risks were less than 1 at one and nine months, indicating that placebo did better in both the short and longer term.

This study has shown that when an active monitoring scheme (sometimes called watchful waiting) is used in primary care, almost half of children will spontaneously clear the fluid from at least one of their ears by as soon as one month, and thus considerably reduce their risk of disability.

Relevant concomitant care

Throughout this study, the Australian Indigenous infant vaccination schedule was EngerixB™ at birth, Rotarix R at 2–4 months, Infanrix R Hexa, and (for non-study participants) Prevenar13 at 2–4–6 months. Study staff provided treatment or referral for all concomitant conditions according to local guidelines.

Secondary outcomes: otitis media

Ear assessments were made at scheduled study visits at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 months by research nurses trained in paediatric video otoscopy and tympanometry. Diagnostic categories (see Table 2) were made according to national guidelines for otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations and managed according to these and local guidelines (Central Australian Rural Practitioners Association Standard Treatment Manual). Tympanometry-only was used at 1 and 2 months of age, and both otoscopy and tympanometry were used at all subsequent visits. At 1 and 2 months of age a diagnosis of either normal (type A tympanogram) or OM (type B (flat) tympanogram) was made. For each child and time point a worst ear diagnosis and laterality were allocated as this determines medical management. The hierarchy of increasing severity was normal, OME, AOMwoP, DP, AOMwiP, and CSOM. Dry perforations were detected on two occasions and have been excluded from analyses.

When the duration of OME is unknown, physicians must use whatever evidence is available and make a reasonable estimate, and hearing screening by school systems with rescreening or monitoring of hearing and tympanometry over a 2–3 month period can provide the medical community with important information on the duration of OME so that appropriate management options can be determined.

### Otitis media and its consequences: beyond the earache [^114CgyV2]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

An international group of multidisciplinary experts on middle-ear and paediatric infections met to explore where consensus exists on the management of acute otitis media. After informal discussions among several specialists of paediatric infectious disease, the group was expanded to include a larger spectrum of professionals with complementary expertise in middle-ear disease. Acute otitis media is a very common bacterial infection in children worldwide, leading to excessive antibiotic consumption in children in most countries and to a substantial burden of deafness and suppurative complications in developing countries. The group attempted to move beyond the existing controversies surrounding guidelines on acute otitis media, and to propose to clinicians and public health officials their views on the actions needed to be taken to reduce the disease burden caused by acute otitis media and the microbial antibiotic resistance from the resulting use of antibiotics. Definition of acute otitis media and diagnostic accuracy are crucial steps to identify children who will potentially benefit from treatment with antibiotics and to eliminate unnecessary prescribing. Although the group agreed that antibiotics are distributed indiscriminately, even to children who do not seem to have the disease, no consensus could be reached on whether antibiotics should be given to all appropriately diagnosed children, reflecting the wide range of practices and lack of convincing evidence from observational studies. The major unanimous concern was an urgent need to reduce unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics to prevent further increases in antibiotic resistance. Prevention of acute otitis media with existing and future viral and bacterial vaccines seems the most promising approach to affect disease burden and consequences, both in developed and developing countries.

### Treatment of acute otitis media in children under 2 years of age [^115djLqd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recommendations vary regarding immediate antimicrobial treatment versus watchful waiting for children younger than 2 years of age with acute otitis media.

Methods

We randomly assigned 291 children 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media diagnosed with the use of stringent criteria, to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or placebo for 10 days. We measured symptomatic response and rates of clinical failure.

Results

Among the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, 35% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 80% by day 7; among children who received placebo, 28% had initial resolution of symptoms by day 2, 54% by day 4, and 74% by day 7 (P = 0.14 for the overall comparison). For sustained resolution of symptoms, the corresponding values were 20%, 41%, and 67% with amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 14%, 36%, and 53% with placebo (P = 0.04 for the overall comparison). Mean symptom scores over the first 7 days were lower for the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than for those who received placebo (P = 0.02). The rate of clinical failure — defined as the persistence of signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination — was also lower among the children treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate than among those who received placebo: 4% versus 23% at or before the visit on day 4 or 5 (P < 0.001) and 16% versus 51% at or before the visit on day 10 to 12 (P < 0.001). Mastoiditis developed in one child who received placebo. Diarrhea and diaper-area dermatitis were more common among children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate. There were no significant changes in either group in the rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Conclusions

Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days tended to reduce the time to resolution of symptoms and reduced the overall symptom burden and the rate of persistent signs of acute infection on otoscopic examination.

Breastfeeding and formula exposure — risk of acute otitis media: Breastfeeding for at least 4 to 6 months reduces episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) and recurrent AOM, and exclusive breastfeeding through 6 months compared with no or less than 4 months is associated with a lower risk of nonrecurrent otitis (0.61 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4–0.92]). In a systematic review, any formula use in the first 6 months was associated with increased otitis media (OM) incidence with reported odds ratios of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.19–2.70) and 4.55 (95% CI: 1.64–12.50), and the pooled odds ratio for any formula in the first 3 months was 2.00 (95% CI: 1.40–2.78). Consistent findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation to encourage exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and to continue for at least the first year and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child.

Diagnosis and Outcome assessments

Eligibility and scheduling

Baseline characteristics and pre-enrolment ear disease were assessed from clinical records. Infants were examined fortnightly from enrolment to randomization, and monthly over the 24 week intervention period or until success was documented.

Assessments

At each study visit a paediatrician or pediatric nurse trained by an Australian expert used video pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry (Grason Stadler GSI 38) to assess ear status. Clinic notes were reviewed to assess inter-current illness and side effects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and at each post-randomisation visit, and processed as previously reported to detect pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

Criteria for otitis media categories (Table 1)

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria and severity scale for worse ear

Diagnostic criteria were as previously reported. Table 1 gives definitions and the severity scale used to assign the worse (highest score) ear diagnosis at each examination. In this study, ear examinations that demonstrated type B tympanogram, reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy and a marked or moderately bulging TM were categorised as AOM without perforation (AOMwoP) even if the child was asymptomatic.

Success

The primary outcome ('success'), was detection of bilateral aerated middle ears (confirmed with tympanometry) at two consecutive monthly visits.

Statistical power and methods

We aimed to achieve a sample size of 118 that would provide 80% power to detect a 20% increase in success rate (5% to 25%). This would also give 88% power to detect a 30% reduction in perforation at the end of therapy (60% to 30%). Interim analysis and stopping rule was intended to be applied if the success rate in the active arm was 40%.

Data were analysed according to a pre-determined plan. We used the outcome in the worse ear (the ear with the highest severity score) to avoid dependence between ears. Estimates of treatment effect are given as the difference between amoxicillin and placebo groups in the prevalence of each outcome at the end of therapy, as a difference in the proportion of examinations during therapy (risk difference and unadjusted 95% confidence interval) or as a adjusted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (adjusted for repeat child examinations using generalised linear models – Poisson). For children who failed to complete therapy, the last available assessment was used. Two sided significance tests were used throughout. All calculations used Stata version 9.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^115mpysL]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — initial observation, parent partnership, and rescue antibiotics: National guidelines in several countries included observation as an initial treatment option under specified circumstances, and in numerous studies only approximately one-third of initially observed children required a rescue antibiotic, suggesting antibiotic use could potentially be reduced by 65% in eligible children. The decision not to give initial antibiotic treatment and observe should be a joint decision of the clinician and the parents, and a system for close follow-up and a means of beginning antibiotics must be in place if symptoms worsen or no improvement is seen in 48 to 72 hours. Initial observation of AOM should be part of a larger management strategy that includes analgesics, parent information, and provisions for a rescue antibiotic; education of parents should include an explanation about the self-limited nature of most episodes of AOM, especially in children 2 years and older, the importance of pain management early in the course, and the potential adverse effects of antibiotics, and such an approach can substantially reduce prescription fill rates for rescue antibiotics. A critical component is the ability to provide a rescue antibiotic, often by using a "safety net" or "wait-and-see" prescription to be filled only if the child fails to improve within 2 to 3 days or if symptoms worsen at any time, or alternatively instructing the caregiver to call or return if the child fails to improve within 2 to 3 days or if symptoms worsen.

### Panel 7: otitis media: treatment and complications [^114WLTvd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective We aimed to summarize key articles published between 2011 and 2015 on the treatment of (recurrent) acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, tympanostomy tube otorrhea, chronic suppurative otitis media and complications of otitis media, and their implications for clinical practice. Data Sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, the Cochrane Library, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing). Review Methods All types of articles related to otitis media treatment and complications between June 2011 and March 2015 were identified. A total of 1122 potential related articles were reviewed by the panel members; 118 relevant articles were ultimately included in this summary. Conclusions Recent literature and guidelines emphasize accurate diagnosis of acute otitis media and optimal management of ear pain. Watchful waiting is optional in mild to moderate acute otitis media; antibiotics do shorten symptoms and duration of middle ear effusion. The additive benefit of adenoidectomy to tympanostomy tubes in recurrent acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion is controversial and age dependent. Topical antibiotic is the treatment of choice in acute tube otorrhea. Symptomatic hearing loss due to persistent otitis media with effusion is best treated with tympanostomy tubes. Novel molecular and biomaterial treatments as adjuvants to surgical closure of eardrum perforations seem promising. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of complementary and alternative treatments. Implications for Practice Emphasis on accurate diagnosis of otitis media, in its various forms, is important to reduce overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and antibiotic resistance. Children at risk for otitis media and its complications deserve special attention.

### Otitis media with effusion: an underestimated cause of hearing loss in infants [^1132ihgt]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is the major reason for failure of neonatal hearing screening. However, little is known about the impact on hearing status of OME in infants during the first months of life.

Patients

Infants who failed universal newborn hearing screening.

Methods

Prospective evaluation for the presence of OME, the degree of hearing loss and the disease evolution.

Results

Between 2007 and 2008, approximately 152 infants were referred because of unilateral or bilateral failure on universal newborn hearing screening with an automated auditory brainstem response device. Eighty-four (55.3%) had OME, 20 of them were lost to follow-up. The remainder 64 infants comprised 37 boys and 27 girls, with a median age of 49 days (range, 40–65 d) at admission. Auditory brainstem response thresholds were 50 dB nHL (range, 40–60) in both ears. A spontaneous resolution of OME was documented in 15 infants. In the remaining, hearing normalized after tympanocentesis or placement of ventilation tubes. Normal hearing could be ascertained in all children at a median age of 4.8 months (range, 3.3–7.8 mo). In the group of infants analyzed, no permanent hearing loss could be detected.

Conclusion

OME is an important cause of transient, moderately severe hearing loss during the first months of life — a critical period for development of the auditory system. Active treatment should be considered if spontaneous resolution does not occur to prevent any delay in language acquisition and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss.

### Otitis media: rapid evidence review [^115a7wto]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common diagnosis in childhood acute sick visits. By three years of age, 50% to 85% of children will have at least one episode of AOM. Symptoms may include ear pain (rubbing, tugging, or holding the ear may be a sign of pain), fever, irritability, otorrhea, anorexia, and sometimes vomiting or lethargy. AOM is diagnosed in symptomatic children with moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane or new-onset otorrhea not caused by acute otitis externa, and in children with mild bulging and either recent-onset ear pain (less than 48 hours) or intense erythema of the tympanic membrane. Treatment includes pain management plus observation or antibiotics, depending on the patient's age, severity of symptoms, and whether the AOM is unilateral or bilateral. When antibiotics are used, high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg per day in two divided doses) is first-line therapy unless the patient has taken amoxicillin for AOM in the previous 30 days or has concomitant purulent conjunctivitis; amoxicillin/clavulanate is typically used in this case. Cefdinir or azithromycin should be the first-line antibiotic in those with penicillin allergy based on risk of cephalosporin allergy. Tympanostomy tubes should be considered in children with three or more episodes of AOM within six months or four episodes within one year with one episode in the preceding six months. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and exclusive breastfeeding until at least six months of age can reduce the risk of AOM.
