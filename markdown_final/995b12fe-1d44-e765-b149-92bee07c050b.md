## Question

How to close a bleeding artery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to close a bleeding artery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate life-threatening bleeding control in the field. Then, I should verify prehospital tourniquet indications and technique. Next, I will consider in-hospital definitive control options, including surgery, endovascular embolization, and damage-control strategies. After that, I need to review special anatomic scenarios like pelvic, hepatic, and airway bleeding. Finally, I should confirm adjuncts, coagulopathy management, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking evidence strength and noting controversies or gaps.

> Let me first confirm the universal first step: direct manual pressure is the mainstay for external bleeding and should be applied immediately, with hemostatic dressings as adjuncts when available, because randomized data show faster time to hemostasis with direct pressure compared with some mechanical devices and improved control when hemostatic dressings are added to direct pressure [^ab1283c5] [^6ebfd78a] [^c357e7c0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about tourniquets; I should verify when they are indicated. For life-threatening extremity bleeding not controlled by direct pressure, a tourniquet is indicated and should be tightened until bleeding stops and distal pulse is absent; commercial devices are preferred over improvised ones, and if bleeding continues, a second tourniquet proximal to the first is reasonable, with clear documentation of time and intent to convert to definitive care as soon as possible [^9e9343fc] [^4c9c026f] [^4fffe64f].

> Wait, let me verify technique details so I don't miss anything critical. Tourniquets should be placed 2–3 inches proximal to the wound, not over a joint, and applied to bare skin; they should be reassessed frequently during transport, and if a commercial device is unavailable, an improvised tourniquet should be at least 2 inches wide and tightened sufficiently to occlude arterial flow, with the understanding that pressure-point techniques are unreliable due to rapid collateral perfusion [^c357e7c0] [^4793ca9b] [^9e9343fc].

> I need to check the evidence base supporting tourniquets in civilians. Multiple contemporary guidelines endorse tourniquets for severe extremity hemorrhage, and a 2024 systematic review suggests improved survival with timely prehospital tourniquet use in civilian vascular extremity trauma, though much of the literature remains observational and heterogenous; nonetheless, the balance favors early use when indicated [^c528b6c5] [^4fffe64f] [^64328527].

> Next, I should review definitive control in the hospital. Surgical exploration with direct repair, ligation, or shunting remains the gold standard for many arterial injuries, particularly when there is hard evidence of arterial trauma or ongoing ischemia; damage control surgery principles apply in unstable patients, prioritizing rapid hemorrhage control over definitive reconstruction initially [^9204b66f].

> Let me consider endovascular options, because I should confirm when embolization is preferred. Angiographic embolization is highly effective for arterial bleeding that is difficult to access surgically or in anatomically complex regions such as the pelvis, liver, and bronchial circulation; for pelvic fractures, early embolization is recommended when instability persists despite stabilization, and for massive hemoptysis, bronchial artery embolization is a key definitive therapy alongside airway control [^961eb0c0] [^49509063] [^879d7b34].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is noncompressible or retroperitoneal? For pelvic trauma, I should confirm that pelvic binders and external fixation reduce volume and tamponade venous bleeding, while arterial sources often require embolization; preperitoneal packing can be used as an adjunct when embolization is delayed or unavailable, and REBOA is a temporizing measure in extreme circumstances to buy time for definitive control [^49509063] [^7cea0501] [^7bf68fbb].

> I will now examine hepatic arterial bleeding, because I need to ensure I don't overstate packing. Perihepatic packing controls venous hemorrhage but will not control arterial bleeding; arterial bleeders should be suture-ligated or selectively embolized, and if the proper hepatic artery is injured and cannot be repaired, selective ligation is acceptable with awareness of ischemia risk, while portal venous injuries should be repaired primarily when feasible [^961eb0c0] [^72313cfb].

> Hold on, I should verify airway-related arterial bleeding. In massive hemoptysis, airway protection and lung isolation are paramount; bronchial artery embolization provides durable control in most cases, and rigid or flexible bronchoscopy can be used for local control when embolization is not immediately available, with lung isolation as a bridge to definitive therapy [^879d7b34] [^3ff4b3f8].

> Let me think about adjuncts and coagulopathy management, because I need to ensure comprehensive care. Topical hemostatic agents are recommended as adjuncts for venous or moderate arterial bleeding in parenchymal injuries, and tranexamic acid should be administered early in trauma with significant hemorrhage; massive transfusion protocols with balanced ratios of plasma, platelets, and RBCs should be activated early in unstable patients to mitigate trauma-induced coagulopathy [^ccf5100f] [^4a4846d6] [^961eb0c0].

> I should double-check the decision algorithm so it's practical. Start with direct pressure and escalate to tourniquet for uncontrolled extremity bleeding; in the hospital, choose surgery for accessible injuries with hard signs, embolization for inaccessible arterial sources or persistent instability despite stabilization, and damage-control strategies for unstable patients; throughout, minimize time to definitive hemorrhage control and coordinate multidisciplinary care to reduce mortality [^ab1283c5] [^94b01fc1] [^4a4846d6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought pressure points might be a reliable bridge, but I should correct that. Evidence shows pressure-point maneuvers are ineffective for sustained control because collateral circulation restores distal flow within seconds, so they should not replace tourniquets or direct pressure when bleeding is life-threatening [^4c9c026f] [^21eb7d46].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and tourniquet management are not overlooked. Tourniquets should be clearly marked with time of application, the limb should be exposed, and removal should follow a structured ED protocol assessing duration, contraindications, and readiness to convert to definitive control, with plans to immediately reapply if bleeding recurs [^495a1266] [^74c3264c].

---

To close a bleeding artery, apply **direct pressure** [^ab1283c5] as first-line control; if bleeding persists, escalate to a **tourniquet** [^9e9343fc] for extremity injuries [^4fffe64f]. For definitive closure, use **suture ligation** or vascular repair in the operating room [^9204b66f], or **endovascular embolization** [^9b639e31] for inaccessible vessels. In damage-control scenarios, temporary clamps or balloon tamponade [^0cac1f3e] can be used until definitive repair is possible [^3038ecd1]. Always address coagulopathy and hemodynamic stability concurrently [^4a4846d6].

---

## Immediate hemorrhage control

### Direct pressure

- **First-line intervention**: Apply firm, direct pressure [^ab1283c5] to the bleeding site using sterile gauze or cloth [^6ebfd78a].
- **Mechanism**: Compresses the vessel, promotes clot formation, and reduces blood loss.
- **Duration**: Maintain pressure for at least 10–15 minutes without interruption.

---

### Tourniquet application

- **Indication**: Use when direct pressure fails or is impractical, especially in extremity injuries [^9e9343fc] [^4fffe64f].
- **Application**: Place 2–3 inches proximal to the wound, tighten until bleeding stops, and secure [^c357e7c0].
- **Documentation**: Record time of application and communicate clearly [^74c3264c].
- **Complications**: Risk of ischemia and nerve injury; minimize time and monitor closely [^e03fb736].

---

## Definitive arterial closure techniques

### Surgical methods

#### Suture ligation

- **Indication**: For accessible arteries with clear visualization.
- **Technique**: Identify the bleeding vessel, isolate it, and ligate with non-absorbable suture (e.g. silk or polypropylene).
- **Limitations**: Risk of ischemia if collateral flow is inadequate; consider bypass if critical vessel.

---

#### Vascular repair

- **Primary repair**: Direct suture of a clean, linear arterial laceration.
- **Patch angioplasty**: For larger defects using autologous vein or synthetic graft.
- **End-to-end anastomosis**: For transected segments with minimal gap.
- **Bypass grafting**: For extensive injury or contamination; use autologous vein or synthetic graft.

---

#### Temporary vascular clamps

Temporary clamps (e.g. bulldog or Satinsky) provide **proximal and distal control** [^notfound] to enable definitive repair; they are removed once permanent closure is achieved.

---

### Endovascular methods

#### Angiographic embolization

- **Indication**: For inaccessible arteries (e.g. pelvic, visceral, bronchial) or high-risk surgical candidates [^9b639e31].
- **Technique**: Catheterize the feeding artery and embolize with coils, particles, or glue.
- **Outcomes**: High success and low complication rates in experienced hands [^notfound].

---

#### Balloon occlusion

Balloon catheters provide **temporary occlusion** [^0cac1f3e] to control bleeding during transport or as a bridge to definitive therapy (e.g. REBOA in pelvic trauma) [^49509063].

---

## Adjunctive measures

### Hemostatic agents

Topical agents such as **hemostatic dressings** (e.g. QuikClot, Celox) are adjuncts for external bleeding when direct pressure alone is insufficient [^4c9c026f] [^d798cc76]. Fibrin sealants are useful for diffuse parenchymal bleeding or as adjuncts to surgical closure [^ccf5100f].

---

### Pharmacologic support

Tranexamic acid is administered **early** [^4a4846d6] to reduce bleeding and mortality in trauma. Massive transfusion protocols with a 1:1:1 ratio of PRBC:plasma:platelets correct coagulopathy and support hemostasis [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

### Anticoagulated patients

Anticoagulation should be **reversed** [^f52de74b] with agents such as vitamin K, PCC, or specific antidotes (e.g. andexanet, idarucizumab) [^e7755c80]. Local measures include direct pressure, hemostatic agents, and surgical closure [^4f5a6a49].

---

### Pediatric patients

Tourniquets are effective in children when indicated, but **careful monitoring** is essential to avoid ischemic injury [^e03fb736].

---

## Complications of arterial closure

- **Ischemia**: From prolonged occlusion or inadequate collateral flow.
- **Rebleeding**: Due to incomplete closure or coagulopathy.
- **Infection**: Especially with prosthetic grafts or contaminated fields.
- **Thrombosis**: At repair or embolization site.

---

## Summary of arterial closure techniques

| **Technique** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Direct pressure | External bleeding | Simple, rapid | May fail with arterial spurting |
| Tourniquet | Extremity bleeding | Rapid, effective | Ischemia, nerve injury |
| Suture ligation | Accessible artery | Definitive | Ischemia risk |
| Vascular repair | Clean laceration | Preserves flow | Technical complexity |
| Embolization | Inaccessible artery | Minimally invasive | Recurrence, ischemia |
| Balloon occlusion | Temporary control | Rapid | Temporary, complications |

---

Closing a bleeding artery requires a **stepwise approach**: start with direct pressure, escalate to tourniquet if needed, and pursue definitive closure with surgery or embolization. Address coagulopathy and hemodynamics in parallel to optimize outcomes [^4a4846d6].

Many patients with severe epistaxis benefit from endoscopic intervention for control of bleeding. Critical maneuvers to improve endoscopic visualization during surgery include head-of-bed elevation, application of topical vasoconstrictors, and local injection of vasonstrictors. Controlled, hypotensive anesthesia may also decrease intraoperative blood loss and improve visualization during surgery. Intractable posterior epistaxis can be controlled with high rates of success with endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation. Although less common, intractable anterior epistaxis may be controlled by anterior ethmoid artery ligation once this artery is identified as the primary source. Less common sources of severe epistaxis are also discussed in this article.

### Managing massive hemoptysis [^879d7b34]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Massive hemoptysis is a medical emergency with high mortality presenting several difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The origin of bleeding and underlying etiology often is not immediately apparent, and techniques for management of this dangerous condition necessitate an expedient response. Unlike hemorrhage in other circumstances, a small amount of blood can rapidly flood the airways, thereby impairing oxygenation and ventilation, leading to asphyxia and consequent cardiovascular collapse. Of paramount importance is early control of the patient's airway and immediate isolation of hemorrhage in an attempt to localize and control bleeding. A coordinated team response is essential to guarantee the best chances of patient survival. Prompt control of the airway and steps to limit the spread of hemorrhage take precedence. Bronchial artery embolization, rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, and surgery all serve as potential treatment options to provide definitive control of hemorrhage. Several adjunctive therapies described in recent years may also assist in the control of bleeding; however, their role is less defined in life-threatening hemoptysis and warrants additional studies. In this concise review, we emphasize the steps necessary for a systematic approach in the management of life-threatening hemoptysis.

Since the 1960s, interventional radiology has played a role in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. What began primarily as a diagnostic modality has evolved into much more of a therapeutic tool. And although the frequency of gastrointestinal bleeding has diminished thanks to management by pharmacologic and endoscopic methods, the need for additional invasive interventions still exists. Transcatheter angiography and intervention is a fundamental step in the algorithm for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Local bleeding management

Recommendation 2

We recommend local compression to limit life-threatening bleeding. (Grade 1A)

We recommend adjunct tourniquet use to stop life-threatening bleeding from open extremity injuries in the pre-surgical setting. (Grade 1B)

We recommend the adjunct use of a pelvic binder to limit life-threatening bleeding in the presence of a suspected pelvic fracture in the pre-surgical setting. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

Most life-threatening bleeding from extremities observed in the civilian setting can be controlled by local compression, by either manual compression or pressure bandages applied to the wounds. Extra local compression to the source of bleeding can also be achieved in certain penetrating injuries by Foley catheter insertion directly into the wound. Foley catheter balloon tamponade was initially described in bleeding penetrating injuries of the neck. In addition, the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with direct pressure enhances bleeding control in the pre-hospital setting (see also R21).

When uncontrolled arterial bleeding occurs as a result of mangled extremity injuries, including penetrating or blast injuries or traumatic amputations, a tourniquet is a simple and efficient method with which to acutely control haemorrhage. Tourniquet application has become the standard of care for the control of severe external haemorrhage following military combat injuries, and several publications report the effectiveness of tourniquets in this specific setting in adults and children. A study of volunteers showed that any tourniquet device presently on the market works efficiently. The study also showed that "pressure point control" was ineffective because collateral circulation was observed within seconds. Tourniquet-induced pain was not often reported by patients. No evidence or opinion supports the use of tourniquets in the context of closed injuries.

### Maternal haemorrhage [^92871309]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Maternal haemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable maternal death worldwide and encompasses antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum bleeding. This review highlights factors that predispose to severe bleeding, its management, and the most recent treatment and guidelines. Advances in obstetric care have provided physicians with the diagnostic tools to detect, anticipate, and prevent severe life-threatening maternal haemorrhage in most patients who have had prenatal care. In an optimal setting, patients at high risk for haemorrhage are referred to tertiary care centres where multidisciplinary teams are prepared to care for and deal with known potential complications. However, even with the best prenatal care, unexpected haemorrhage occurs. The first step in management is stabilization of haemodynamic status, which involves securing large bore i.v. access, invasive monitoring, and aggressive fluid management and transfusion therapy. Care for the patient with maternal bleeding should follow an algorithm that goes through a rapid and successive sequence of medical and surgical approaches to stem bleeding and decrease morbidity and mortality. With the addition of potent uterotonic agents and the advent of minimally invasive interventional radiological techniques such as angiographic embolization and arterial ligation, definitive yet conservative management is now possible in an attempt to avoid hysterectomy in patients with severe peripartum bleeding. If these interventions are inadequate to control the bleeding, the decision to proceed to hysterectomy must be made expeditiously. Recombinant factor VIIa is a relatively new treatment that could prove useful for severe coagulopathy and intractable bleeding.

Rationale

Haemodynamically stable patients, or those who can be stabilised during initial resuscitation, with an unidentified bleeding source, but not in need of immediate bleeding control, should undergo further investigation to determine the source of bleeding. During the primary survey, aside from monitoring vital signs, imaging studies (ultrasonography and CT) and laboratory blood tests (blood gas and coagulation status) are recommended.

In recent years, the accessibility of CT scanners has increased dramatically, replacing the need for conventional radiographic imaging. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of these immediate measures are dependent on pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. The proximity of the CT scanner to the resuscitation room in the emergency department has been shown to have a significant positive effect on the probability of survival for the severely injured patient. The trauma workflow, comprising immediate CT diagnosis and rapid bleeding control without patient transfer, as realised in the hybrid emergency room, may improve survival in severe trauma. If a CT scanner is not available in the emergency department, the clinician must evaluate the potential risks and benefits of patient transfer to a CT room, assuring continuous monitoring and resuscitation. In a well-structured environment and by a well-organised trauma team, CT seems to be safe and justified even in severely injured haemodynamically unstable patients.

In a retrospective study between 2016 and 2019, 2694 consecutive patients were admitted to a level I trauma centre and a strict emergency room algorithm followed. Injuries were missed in seven patients (0.26%; one epidural bleeding and six abdominal hollow organ injuries; two died), which highlights the need for continuous clinical and instrument-based examinations after completion of the tertiary survey.

Catheter angiography should be considered in patients with blunt pelvic trauma found to have active arterial extravasation, regardless of bleed size or patient clinical or laboratory values, while contrast extravasation on CT, high volume pRBC transfusions and ISS ≥ 16 can assist in identifying pelvic fracture patients for angiography with more precision.

A retrospective analysis and systematic review of epidemiology, radiologic examinations, patterns of injuries, therapeutic measures, clinical courses and outcomes showed that visceral perfusion should be monitored clinically and radiologically and follow-up via magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography angiography performed in order to rule out vascular complications after traumatic dissection of celiac artery.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^761229f6]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In 2007, we published a European guideline for the management of bleeding following major trauma that included recommendations for specific interventions to identify and control bleeding sources using surgical, physiological and pharmacological strategies. The guideline was developed by a multidisciplinary group of European experts, including designated representatives from relevant professional societies, to guide the clinician in the early phases of treatment. Here we present an updated version of the guideline that incorporates a renewed critical survey of the evidence published during the intervening three years and a consideration of changes in clinical practice that have taken place based on technologies that have become more widely available and pharmacological agents that have entered or left the market. Although the level of scientific evidence has improved in some areas, other areas remain devoid of high-level evidence, which may never exist for practical or ethical reasons. The formulation and grading of the recommendations presented here are therefore weighted to reflect both this reality and the current state-of-the-art.

Tourniquet use

Recommendation 2

We recommend adjunct tourniquet use to stop life-threatening bleeding from open extremity injuries in the pre-surgical setting. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

When uncontrolled arterial bleeding occurs from mangled extremity injuries, including penetrating or blast injuries or traumatic amputations, a tourniquet is a simple and efficient method with which to acutely control haemorrhage. Tourniquet application has become standard of care for the control of severe external haemorrhage following military combat injuries, and several publications report the effectiveness of tourniquets in this specific setting in adults and children. A study of volunteers showed that any tourniquet device presently on the market works efficiently. The study also showed that "pressure point control" was ineffective because collateral circulation was observed within seconds. Tourniquet-induced pain was not often reported by patients. No evidence or opinion supports the use of tourniquets in the context of closed injuries.

Tourniquets should be left in place until surgical control of bleeding is achieved; however, this time span should be kept as short as possible. Improper or prolonged placement of a tourniquet can lead to complications such as nerve paralysis and limb ischaemia, however these effects are rare. Some publications suggest a maximum application time of 2 h. Reports from military settings describe cases in which tourniquets have remained in place for up to 6 h with survival of the extremity.

Much discussion has been generated recently about the translation of this evidence to civilian practice, as there is little published evidence. Bleeding from most civilian wounds can be controlled by local pressure, however uncontrolled external bleeding from either blunt or penetrating limb injury should be controlled with a tourniquet.

Ventilation

Recommendation 3

We recommend the avoidance of hypoxaemia. (Grade 1A)

We recommend normoventilation of trauma patients. (Grade 1B)

We suggest hyperventilation in the presence of signs of imminent cerebral herniation. (Grade 2C)

Tourniquet use

Recommendation 2

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^7cea0501]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

The mortality rate for patients with severe pelvic ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains high. The early detection of these injuries and initial efforts to reduce disruption and stabilise the pelvis as well as containing bleeding is therefore crucial. Markers of pelvic haemorrhage include anterior-posterior and vertical shear deformations on standard roentgenograms, CT "blush" (active arterial extravasation), bladder compression pressure, pelvic haematoma evident by CT and ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate fracture stabilisation.

The initial therapy for pelvic fractures includes control of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding by pelvic closure as a first step. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to control haemorrhage from pelvic fractures, but pelvic closure may also be achieved using a pelvic binder, a pelvic C-clamp or improvised methods such as a bed sheet. In addition to the pelvic closure, fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of the haematoma, pre-, extra or retroperitoneal packing will reduce or stop the venous bleeding. Pre-peritoneal packing is used to decrease the need for pelvic embolisation and may be performed simultaneously, or soon after, initial pelvic fracture stabilisation. The most commonly embolised vascular bed and therefore the most studied is the pelvis. Pelvic packing could potentially aid in early intrapelvic bleeding control and provide crucial time for more selective haemorrhage management.

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^e250f50f]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Control of bleeding in first aid — 2015 CoSTR suggested tourniquets for severe external limb bleeding not controlled by direct pressure, but evidence is limited primarily to military case series or animal studies, and civilian data consist of small observational studies. There are no direct comparative studies of tourniquets versus hemostatic dressings or of using a second tourniquet when the first fails, and no studies comparing improvised tourniquets for bleeding control; research on hemostatic dressings is largely animal based. Further research comparing hemorrhage-control methods is needed, and knowledge gaps include optimal education for first aid providers and lay public in proper application of both commercial and improvised tourniquets.

Packing, embolisation and surgery

Recommendation 20

We recommend that patients with ongoing haemodynamic instability, despite adequate pelvic ring stabilisation, receive early surgical bleeding control and/or pre-peritoneal packing and/or angiographic embolisation. (Grade 1B)

We suggest that the use of aortic balloon occlusion be considered only under extreme circumstances in patients with pelvic fracture in order to gain time until appropriate bleeding control measures can be implemented. (Grade 2C)

Rationale

The mortality rate for patients with severe pelvic ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains high. There is no consensus as to the optimal treatment paradigm for patients presenting with haemorrhage from severe pelvic fractures. Angioembolisation and an external fixator are the most common approaches. REBOA is considered by some practitioners to be an important adjunct in the treatment of patients with severe pelvic fracture and in shock. However, this method is still in the early stages of development and is not currently used widely across trauma centres. Pelvic ring injuries are associated with a high mortality rate within the first 24 h, due mainly to exsanguinations. Injured patients are managed using a multidisciplinary damage-control strategy. Unstable patients should undergo surgical haemostasis control immediately. Arterial embolisation is an effective means of achieving this and justifies the permanent availability of this approach in level-1 trauma centres. Following CT assessment of injuries, stable patients can undergo arterial embolisation if active arterial bleeding or vascular damage is present. The selective or nonselective embolisation methods and agents used depend on the patient's haemodynamic status and an assessment of the injury whenever possible. The early detection of these injuries and initial efforts to reduce disruption and stabilise the pelvis as well as containing bleeding is therefore crucial.

Severe pelvic trauma is a particularly challenging condition, requiring a multidisciplinary trauma team, including a general surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, endovascular surgeon/interventional radiologist. The pelvis can harbour a multifocal haemorrhage that is not easily compressible or managed using traditional surgical methods such as tying off a blood vessel or removing an organ. Treatment often requires a triage of multiple investigations that can lead to the re-approximation of bony structures, including DCR, assessment of associated injuries and multimodal haemorrhage control via external fixation, pre-peritoneal packing, angioembolisation and/or REBOA, for example. Markers of pelvic haemorrhage include anterior-posterior and vertical shear deformations on standard roentgenograms, CT "blush" (active arterial extravasation), bladder compression pressure, pelvic haematoma evident using CT and ongoing haemodynamic instability, despite adequate fracture stabilisation.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^4c9c026f]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Bleeding control dressings and pressure point methods — In an RCT of 160 patients in the ED with stab wounds to the limbs, the proportion with cessation of bleeding in < 5 minutes was higher for participants who received a hemostatic dressing plus direct pressure (51.2%) compared with participants who received direct pressure alone (32.5%). There are currently no data addressing which type of dressing may be more effective in the first aid setting, but 3 in-hospital RCTs suggest no difference between dressing types in time to cessation of bleeding or complications. Commercial pressure dressings and elastic adhesive dressings may be effective in maintaining hemorrhage control or even as the primary means of hemorrhage control when applied by people who have received bleeding control training, including by non–health care personnel. No studies were identified evaluating the effectiveness of manual compression of the femoral or brachial artery (also known as pressure points) to control distal hemorrhage; in a volunteer study, manual digital occlusion eliminated distal blood flow in most subjects but was not sustained, with distal pulses returning in a median of 40 seconds after brachial artery occlusion and 20 seconds of femoral artery occlusion.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^85df8b56]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society — Tourniquet indications in extremity hemorrhage state that tourniquet application is an effective means to control arterial bleeding and should be considered the primary intervention to control life-threatening arterial bleeds in extremities (Recommendation grade: 1A), and that it is an effective means to control bleeding that has failed to substantially decrease with other less aggressive techniques (Recommendation grade: 1B); lower pressure bleeding can typically be controlled with direct pressure and pressure dressings, but if these methods are unsuccessful then tourniquets are indicated.

### Effect of prehospital tourniquets on resuscitation in extremity arterial trauma [^22969c95]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncontrolled bleeding is recognized as a cause of potentially preventable mortality in trauma patients. Tourniquets are effective in controlling hemorrhage from severe extremity injuries. Military reviews have demonstrated improved survival in injuries amenable to tourniquets, especially if placed in the field and prior to the onset of shock. The translation of these results to civilian experience remains a debated topic due to differences in transport times, mechanism of injury, and patient demographics. Recently, several retrospective series have demonstrated effective and appropriate tourniquet use in American trauma systems.

Our urban trauma center treats a high volume of both blunt and penetrating extremity injuries that allowed characterization of civilian tourniquet experience. We describe our cohort of patients with extremity arterial injuries with prehospital tourniquet placement and compare with a matched cohort with similar injuries but without tourniquet placement.

### Tourniquets for the control of traumatic hemorrhage: a review of the literature [^83e44a4b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Failure of a tourniquet is usually the result of insufficient pressure, but this can easily be prevented by reinforcing during the training of those who will be employing such devices that total arterial occlusion is the goal. There have been isolated cases reported among surgical patients where extreme calcification of the arteries prevented effective use of tourniquets for the establishment of a bloodless field This is unlikely however to be a significant factor in the use of tourniquets for hemorrhage control.

There are still several unanswered or only partially answered question regarding the use of tourniquets and the attendant complications, infrequent as they may be in current practice. These include the role of hypothermia and agents such as antioxidants in minimizing muscle and nerve damage from ischemia. The former has already been demonstrated to be of benefit on a limited basis, with even a marginal (2–3 degrees Celsius) decrease in muscle temperature has been shown to be beneficial. Further research into these aspects of trauma care, and others, are still needed and therefore should be encouraged.

The use of the tourniquet in hemorrhage control is likely to remain controversial for the near future, however given the best evidence available mandates serious reconsideration of the attitudes that we as a profession hold toward this practice. While there are potential risks involved in the utilization of tourniquets should not be overlooked, expeditious and clinically and/or situation appropriate application in the presence of potentially life threatening hemorrhage is in keeping not only with the standards of the medical professions, but accordingly so with the best interests of the patient.

Based upon the best evidence available from the literature, the following conclusions are drawn:

- Emergency medical personnel, both civilian and military, should be trained in and equipped for the proper use of tourniquets; the focus of first aid training for civilian populations should continue to deemphasize their use and focus instead on early medical assistance and the use of direct pressure to control hemorrhage.

### Removal of the prehospital tourniquet in the emergency department [^495a1266]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Life-threatening hemorrhage from extremity injuries can be effectively controlled in the prehospital environment through direct pressure, wound packing, and the use of tourniquets. Early tourniquet application has been prioritized for rapid control of severe extremity hemorrhage and is a cornerstone of prehospital trauma resuscitation guidelines. Emergency physicians must be knowledgeable regarding the initial assessment and appropriate management of patients who present with a prehospital tourniquet in place.

Discussion

An interdisciplinary group of experts including emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, and tactical and Emergency Medical Services physicians collaborated to develop a stepwise approach to the assessment and removal (discontinuation) of an extremity tourniquet in the emergency department after being placed in the prehospital setting. We have developed a best-practices guideline to serve as a resource to aid the emergency physician in how to safely remove a tourniquet. The guideline contains five steps that include: 1) Determine how long the tourniquet has been in place; 2) Evaluate for contraindications to tourniquet removal; 3) Prepare for tourniquet removal; 4) Release the tourniquet; and 5) Monitor and reassess the patient.

Conclusion

These steps outlined will help emergency medicine clinicians appropriately evaluate and manage patients presenting with tourniquets in place. Tourniquet removal should be performed in a systematic manner with plans in place to immediately address complications.

Tourniquet use

Recommendation 2

We recommend adjunct tourniquet use to stop life-threatening bleeding from open extremity injuries in the pre-surgical setting (Grade 1C).

Rationale

Much discussion has been generated recently regarding the use of tourniquets for acute external haemorrhage control. Pressure bandages rather than tourniquets should be applied in the case of minor bleeding from open wounds in extremity injuries. When uncontrolled arterial bleeding occurs from mangled extremity injuries, including penetrating or blast injuries or traumatic amputations, a tourniquet represents a simple and efficient method to acutely control haemorrhage. Several publications from military settings report the effectiveness of tourniquets in this specific setting. A study of volunteers showed that any tourniquet device presently on the market works efficiently. The study also showed that 'pressure point control' was ineffective because collateral circulation was observed within seconds. Tourniquet-induced pain was not an important consideration.

Tourniquets should be left in place until surgical control of bleeding is achieved; however, this time-span should be kept as short as possible. Improper or prolonged placement of a tourniquet can lead to complications such as nerve paralysis and limb ischaemia. Some publications suggest a maximum time of application of two hours. Reports from military settings report cases in which tourniquets have remained in place for up to six hours with survival of the extremity.

II. Diagnosis and monitoring of bleeding

### Anticoagulants: to bleed or not to bleed, that is the question [^47418d7e]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Thromboembolic vascular diseases remain the main cause of death in Western industrialized societies. Anticoagulants retard the formation, growth, and embolization of thrombi and are effective agents in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. Anticoagulants in venous thromboembolism have been investigated extensively with rigorous randomized, controlled trials, while the roles for anticoagulants in arterial thromboembolism generally have evolved through natural history studies and empirical practice. Thus, many current guidelines for anticoagulant use in arterial disease are based on successful established routines and rational therapy. To effectively balance the efficacy and risks of anticoagulation, the vascular surgeon needs a thorough understanding of anticoagulant drugs, their mechanisms of action, and their proven and unproven indications. Since the first use of heparin in arterial surgery, a variety of new and different anticoagulants have become available, including low-molecular-weight heparins, heparin-like drugs, hirudins, and thrombin inhibitors. Despite their diverse actions, they all inhibit some portion of the plasma coagulation cascade, thus distinguishing them from platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytics. Every interference with the coagulation cascade carries a risk of minor, major, or fatal hemorrhage. To date, no drug or therapeutic strategy has succeeded fully in dissociating its antithrombotic effects from its risks of bleeding.

Techniques for management of postpartum hemorrhage — Management "should use a multidisciplinary and multifaceted approach that involves maintaining hemodynamic stability while simultaneously identifying and treating the cause of blood loss". Options include "administration of uterotonics or pharmacologic agents, tamponade of the uterus (eg, intrauterine balloons), surgical techniques to control the bleeding (eg, the B-Lynch procedure), embolization of pelvic arteries or, ultimately, hysterectomy". "Generally, less invasive methods should be tried initially if possible; however, if unsuccessful, more invasive measures may be required". Algorithm-based programs "have been used more widely at individual hospitals and in health systems", employ "a multidisciplinary (eg, obstetrics, nursing, anesthesia, transfusion medicine), multifaceted, stepwise approach", and are "aimed at treating cases early and consistently", though "evidence regarding maternal outcomes, such as severe maternal morbidity or intensive care unit admission, is inconsistent".

### Is it more dangerous to perform inadequate packing? [^72313cfb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Many major liver injuries and progressive coagulopathy are the most frequent indications for DCS, and surgical experience is very important during this process. The "damage control" concept has been shown to increase overall survival and is likely to modify the management of the critically injured patient. Pringle maneuver, which is one of the damage control surgeries in normothermia, is also safe for at least 60 minutes; this was maintained up to 85 minutes. However, because the tolerance of the liver to hypoxia decreases in such trauma patients who are susceptible to hemorrhagic shock, the time of occlusion is kept as short as possible. In our series, the Pringle maneuver was used for a period of 20 min, after which the clamp was released and the liver was re-examined for any further bleeding. Selective ligation of the hepatic artery in the patients with any arterial bleeding was then undertaken, or other definitive surgical interventions were performed. It is important to recognize that liver packing will not control arterial bleeding and that any bleeding artery should be suture-ligated before packing procedure. However, a significant number of the patients with high-grade liver trauma tend to develop consumption coagulopathy, in which case none of the surgical procedures can be successfully performed. Additionally, when the bleeding is mainly from retrohepatic veins or the portal vein, hepatic artery ligation alone will fail to control the bleeding. In such circumstances, perihepatic packing, a definitive hemostatic procedure, is currently a well-accepted technique for severe liver trauma when routine procedures cannot control the bleeding. The main aim of PHP, one of the lifesaving part of the DCS, is to overcome the lethal triad correcting the acidosis (pH < 7.2), hypothermia (< 35°C) and coagulopathy (prothrombin time > 16s). For many years, therefore, PHP has been one of the most popular methods for the management of major liver injuries. The description of this method comprises several parts. The initial operation, which should be performed minimally, essentially includes the control of exsanguinations, ligation of active bleeders or more complex procedures including hepatectomy, and prevention of contamination of the peritoneal cavity. After a further resuscitation progress in the intensive care unit characterized by improved hemodynamics, correction of coagulopathy, rewarming, and complete ventilatory support the patient will be ready for re-look operation. It enables the recognition of the main injury after the removal of the packs and a definitive surgical repair of the injury. In the present study, three patients did not have a chance to undergo a second operation in our institution; one of them died from severe exsanguination during the first operation, and the other two patients succumbed to death in the intensive care unit in spite of administration of triple inotropic agents accompanied by supplementary drugs after the first operation in our institution. The last two cases had lost excessive amount of blood due to underpacking and other injuries. In Group B, the mean unit of blood transfusion (3 units vs. 8 units, p < 0.05) and mortality rate were higher, but only the difference between the mean blood units transfused was statistically significant. Transfusion of many units of blood due to continuing high blood loss might slow down the coagulation cascade resulting in disseminate intravascular coagulopathy and can also lead unpreventable severe acidosis. In such conditions, PHP is a lifesaving technique for temporary control of severe liver injury providing enough time to correct either physiological or metabolic derangements.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^a2ab5b30]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Recommendation 13

We recommend that patients with ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate pelvic ring stabilisation receive early angiographic embolisation or surgical bleeding control, including packing (grade 1B).

Rationale

Markers of pelvic haemorrhage include anterior-posterior and vertical shear deformations, CT 'blush' (active arterial extravasation), bladder compression pressure, pelvic haematoma volumes greater than 500 mL evident by CT, and ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate fracture stabilisation. Initial therapy of pelvic fractures includes control of venous and/or canellous bone bleeding by pelvic closure. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to control haemorrhage from pelvic fractures, but pelvic closure may also be achieved using a bed sheet, pelvic binder, or a pelvic C-clamp. Although arterial haemorrhage from pelvic fractures may be lethal, venous bleeding may be equally devastating. Arterial embolisation appears to achieve its effect by controlling the arterial bleeding and allowing the tamponade effect of the haematoma to control venous bleeding.

Results of surgery to control pelvic haemorrhage via laparotomy have remained poor due to the existence of an extensive collateral circulation. However, in suboptimal situations (for example, when embolisation is not possible), extraperitoneal packing of the pelvis may reduce the loss of blood. Extraperitoneal haemorrhage in patients with haemorrhagic shock and pelvic ring disruption may be attributed to ruptured veins, fracture surfaces, and/or arterial sources. The overall mortality rate of patients with severe pelvic ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains as high as 30% to 45%. Angioembolisation is often applied in patients with ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate fracture stabilisation and the exclusion of extra-pelvic sources of haemorrhage. Repeat angiography may be of value in those selected patients. Patients who require embolisation tend to be older, have a higher injury severity score, and are more likely to be coagulopathic and haemodynamically unstable than patients who not require embolisation.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^86dbf858]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the case of major pelvic injury, it is nevertheless agreed that damage-control interventional radiology and urgent resuscitative surgery should be initiated early and simultaneously. Adjunct techniques can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if deemed necessary. This may decrease the high mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic injuries who have undergone laparotomy as the primary intervention. However, non-therapeutic laparotomy should be avoided. Time to pelvic embolisation for haemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures may impact survival.

Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted as highly effective means with which to control arterial bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisation. Radiological management can also be usefully applied to abdominal and thoracic bleeding. Martinelli et al. reported the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce bleeding and permit transport to an angiography theatre. In contrast, Morozumi et al. suggested the use of mobile digital subtraction angiography for arterial embolisation performed in the clinic by trauma surgeons. A number of authors argue that permissive hypotension could achieve better survival by achieving pelvic stabilisation and/or angiography through DCR, hypertonic solutions and controlled hypothermia. Institutional differences in the capacity to perform timely angiography and embolisation may explain the different treatment algorithms suggested by many authors. Reports on transcatheter angiographic embolisation suggest a 100% higher mortality during off-hours due to lack of radiological service. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach to these severe injuries is required.

Local haemostatic measures

Recommendation 21

We recommend the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with other surgical measures or with packing for venous or moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchymal injuries. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

A wide range of local haemostatic agents is currently available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical techniques to obtain haemorrhagic control. These topical agents can be particularly useful when access to the site of bleeding is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatine or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding.

The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors, such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, bleeding severity, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when auto-transfusion is applied, and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals, but increasing experience in humans is now available.

### Penetrating arterial trauma to the limbs: outcome of a modified protocol [^9204b66f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Our protocols stress the importance of emergency room hemorrhage control; direct digital pressure being the most effective method, which was maintained until definitive operative control was established. Balloon tamponade has been a useful adjunctive measure, where one ore more Foley catheters are inserted into the tract of the missile or stab and the balloon inflated with fluid until hemorrhage is controlled. Large skin wounds are rapidly closed around the catheter(s) with skin sutures to prevent dislodgement during balloon inflation and to assist in creating a tamponade.

Physical examination was the cornerstone of the diagnosis and relied mostly on the presence of "hard" or "soft" signs of arterial injury (Tables 1 & 2). "Hard" signs are indicative of ischemia or ongoing hemorrhage and include absent distal pulses, extensive external bleeding, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, palpable thrill, continuous murmur, or other signs of distal ischemia (pain, pallor, coolness). The presence of "hard" signs mandated immediate surgical exploration. "Soft" signs of arterial injury included a history of severe bleeding at the trauma scene, nonexpanding hematoma, diminished but palpable pulses, and peripheral neural deficit. Doppler pressure measurements were undertaken in our department as an adjunct to stratify risk in patients with arterial trauma. In the absence of "hard" signs, a Doppler pressure deficit of greater than 10 per cent, compared with the contralateral limb, was considered a "soft" sign of arterial injury. As recommended by Frykberg et al. and confirmed in our previous published experience, proximity of injury to major vessels was not considered a "soft" sign.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the services required to treat patients with multiple injuries, many healthcare systems have developed trauma networks or processes. The underlying aim of trauma care organisation is to move patients to multi-specialist care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate critical interventions. These aims can come into conflict, and there are a number of different means with which to resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in trauma care systems both between and within countries and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the literature. The evidence is weak, but there is a general consensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into a "trauma system" leads to about a 15% reduction in trauma death, with about a 50% reduction in "preventable death". Inter-hospital transfer of patients does not seem to change overall mortality, and the evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport from the accident scene to a major trauma centre. However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged > 65 years. No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between a hospital's trauma patient volume and outcomes. Despite a lack of evidence, there is a consensus that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility in a timely manner is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" will depend on the patient profile, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Minimisation of time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to lack of equipoise.

### Managing severe (and open) pelvic disruption [^dc939e5d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Management during resuscitation

The primary goal in the resuscitation phase is rapid hemorrhage control to allow for effective resuscitation and the eventual stabilization of the patient hemodynamically. Hemorrhage from pelvic fractures accounts for approximately 60% of deaths in the acute phase, with bleeding originating from venous plexuses in most cases (85%–90%) and arterial sources in 10%–15%. Venous and osseous bleeding is often diffuse and non-compressible, making it particularly challenging to manage.

Initial stabilization

The pelvic binder has revolutionized the initial management of complicated pelvic fracture. These devices reduce pelvic volume and realign bony structures, promoting clot formation and tamponading bleeding. They are often applied in the emergency center or even in the prehospital setting as the first step in stabilization. Studies show that prompt application of a pelvic binder can significantly reduce mortality by controlling exsanguination during transport and initial resuscitation.

Standard radiographs, including AP pelvic X-rays, help identify fractures and guide further interventions. CT scans are performed to delineate the extent of injury and associated organ damage. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma may aid in detecting intraperitoneal hemorrhage but is less effective for retroperitoneal bleeding.

Hemodynamic management

Large-bore intravenous access is established for aggressive resuscitation with blood products. The use of massive transfusion protocols, often employing a 1:1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets, is essential to manage coagulopathy associated with severe hemorrhage.

### Liver trauma: WSES 2020 guidelines [^961eb0c0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

At laparotomy, if no major bleeding is present, compression alone or electrocautery, bipolar devices, argon beam coagulation, topical hemostatic agents, simple suture of the hepatic parenchyma, or omental patching may be sufficient to stop the bleeding.

In case of major hemorrhage, more aggressive procedures including manual compression and hepatic packing, ligation of vessels in the wound, hepatic debridement and finger fracture, balloon tamponade, shunting procedures, or hepatic vascular isolation and exclusion may be used. Of paramount importance is to provide simultaneous intraoperative intensive resuscitation with early institution of a massive transfusion protocol (MTP) aiming to maintain organ perfusion and ultimately reverse all trauma-induced physiological derangements.

In case of evident injury to the proper hepatic artery, an attempt to control and repair it should be made. If not effective or not possible, selective hepatic artery ligation should be considered as a viable option. If the injury is on the right or left branches of the proper hepatic artery, selective ligation is advisable. If the right or common hepatic artery must be ligated, cholecystectomy should be performed to avoid gallbladder necrosis. If the patient's condition allows for it, post-operative AE represents a viable alternative allowing hemorrhage control while reducing complications. Hepatic artery ligation increases the risk of hepatic necrosis, abscesses, and biloma formation.

Portal vein injuries should be repaired primarily. Portal vein main branch ligation should not be considered and should be avoided because of the high risk of liver necrosis or massive bowel edema. If no other option exists, ligation can be used, but only in patients with an intact hepatic artery. Liver packing or liver resection should be preferred to ligation in case of lobar or segmental/subsegmental portal venous branch injuries.

Whenever Pringle maneuver or arterial control fails and bleeding persists, the presence of an aberrant hepatic artery should be considered. If the bleeding comes from behind the liver, retro-hepatic caval or hepatic vein injury should be highly suspected. Three viable options exist for the management of retrohepatic caval/suprahepatic venous injuries: (1) tamponade with hepatic packing, (2) direct repair (with or without vascular isolation), and (3) lobar resection. Liver packing is the least risky method to temporarily deal with severe venous injuries. Direct venous repair is difficult especially in non-experienced hands, with high mortality rates.

Wilderness Medical Society — Tourniquet basics specify that a tourniquet can be placed for up to 2 hours with minimal risk of complication; the minimum acceptable width is 4 cm (1.5 inches); if initial placement fails to control bleeding, a second tourniquet should be placed immediately adjacent and proximal to the first; the device must have a windlass, a standard belt cannot be used, and application must occlude arterial pressure confirmed by the absence of distal pulses because occluding only venous pressure can increase bleeding.

### Tourniquets for the control of traumatic hemorrhage: a review of the literature [^63c6a62b]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

"The systematic use of the elastic tourniquet cannot be too severely condemned. The employment of it, except as a temporary measure during an operation, usually indicates that the person using it is quite ignorant both of how to stop bleeding properly and also of the danger to life and limb caused by the tourniquet. If an orderly has applied a tourniquet, it is the duty of the medical officer who first sees the patient to remove it at once, and to examine the limb so as to ascertain whether there is any bleeding at all, and if there is, to use proper measures for its arrest".

Once again, the admonition never to allow a tourniquet to be left in place beyond the prehospital phase of care was repeated due to the risk of pain, infection and amputation. While immediate conversion to less aggressive measures of hemorrhage control are optimal, such across the board advice is most likely the source of the modern day hesitancy to utilize tourniquets in any manner. One must question whether this belief arose as the product of a seriously flawed system of medical care, as obviously existed, rather than an inherent flaw in the idea behind the use of tourniquets.

More useful information regarding tourniquets, still largely applicable, was provided by Tuttle:

1. Never cover over or bandage a tourniquet.

2. Write plainly on the emergency medical tag the word 'tourniquet'.
3. If the injured man is conscious, he should be instructed to tell every medical officer with whom he comes in contact that he has a tourniquet on.

Tuttle also emphasized the use of arterial "pressure points" to "buy time" in which other methods of control can be employed, including the application of a tourniquet.

Bailey in his seminal text on war surgery, published during the Second World War, gave a great deal of attention to the subject of tourniquets and indicated that tourniquets have a place in management of arterial bleeding that fails to respond to other interventions. He also suggested the preemptive application of a loosely applied tourniquet in cases of secondary hemorrhage and their use to provide a bloodless surgical field. The latter use has become commonplace in hospitals around the world today, through the application of pneumatic tourniquets in orthopedic procedures.

Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatin or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding.

The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, severity of bleeding, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when autotransfusion is applied, and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals, but increasing experience in humans is now available.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^d89bdd54]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Pelvic fracture hemorrhage — AE (angioembolization) plays an important role in controlling life-threatening hemorrhage from pelvic fracture, and all facilities need a protocol for the management of patients with pelvic fractures that includes a PI process because time to AE impacts outcome; consider AE as initial treatment for patients with a pelvic injury stabilized by a sheet or binder who are still hemodynamically unstable and have no indication for laparotomy or other source of hemorrhage, and AE may be performed in combination with pelvic reduction with local resource availability considered; if the patient's pelvis is adequately stabilized with a sheet or binder, hardware fixation is not immediately necessary; in addition, consider AE in all patients with pelvic fracture and contrast extravasation on CT scan, regardless of hemodynamics, repeat AE for patients who have previously undergone AE of the pelvis and have ongoing hemorrhage, and also consider AE for patients with pelvic fracture who have undergone pre-peritoneal packing and have ongoing hemorrhage; when possible, perform selective angiography of the bleeding vessel, but in cases of severe injury or diffuse pelvic bleeding this may not be possible, in which case embolization of the entire internal iliac system can be performed; arterial bleeding is intermittent and may not be apparent at arteriography, and when no arterial extravasation is seen the decision for prophylactic AE is made on several factors; patients not embolized who show ongoing hemorrhage may require repeat angiographic imaging and AE, and elderly patients with a negative angiogram should be treated more aggressively with AE than younger individuals due to lower cardiovascular reserve.

Recommendation 20

We recommend that patients with ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate pelvic ring stabilisation receive early preperitoneal packing, angiographic embolisation and/or surgical bleeding control. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

The mortality rate of patients with severe pelvic ring disruptions and haemodynamic instability remains unacceptably high. The early detection of these injuries and initial efforts to reduce disruption and stabilise the pelvis as well as contain bleeding is therefore crucial. Markers of pelvic hemorrhage include anterior-posterior and vertical shear deformations on standard roentgenograms, CT 'blush' (active arterial extravasation), bladder compression pressure, pelvic haematoma volumes > 500 mL evident by CT and ongoing haemodynamic instability despite adequate fracture stabilisation.

The initial therapy of pelvic fractures includes control of venous and/or cancellous bone bleeding by pelvic closure. Some institutions use primarily external fixators to control hemorrhage from pelvic fractures, but pelvic closure may also be achieved using a bed sheet, pelvic binder or a pelvic C-clamp. In addition to the pelvic closure, fracture stabilisation and the tamponade effect of the haematoma, pre-, extra- or retroperitoneal packing will reduce or stop the venous bleeding. Pre-peritoneal packing decreases the need for pelvic embolisation and may be performed simultaneously or soon after initial pelvic fracture stabilisation. Pelvic packing could potentially aid in early intrapelvic bleeding control and provide crucial time for more selective management of hemorrhage. The technique can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if deemed necessary. This may decrease the high mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic injuries who underwent laparotomy as the primary intervention. As a consequence, it was recommended that non-therapeutic laparotomy be avoided.

Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted as a highly effective means with which to control arterial bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisation. Martinelli et al. report on the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce bleeding and permit transport to angiography. In contrast, Morozumi et al. suggest the use of mobile digital subtraction angiography in the emergency department for arterial embolisation performed by trauma surgeons themselves. A number of authors stress that permissive hypotension while obtaining pelvic stabilisation and/or angiography (damage control resuscitation, hypertonic solutions, controlled hypothermia) could achieve better survival. Controversy exists about the indications and optimal timing of angiography in haemodynamically unstable patients. Institutional differences in the capacity to perform timely angiography and embolisation may explain the different treatment algorithms suggested by many authors. Nevertheless, the general consensus is that a multidisciplinary approach to these severe injuries is required.

### Lung isolation-a personalized and clinically adapted approach to control bronchoscopy-associated acute massive airway hemorrhage [^3ff4b3f8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As the comparative results of this study showed that there were significant differences in many factors of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics of patients between the two groups. The symptoms of breath-holding in patients and the degree of airway stenosis were more severe in acute group than those in the non-acute group. The more severe degree of stenosis and breathlessness necessitated an increase in the probability of emergency surgery, but the probability of intraoperative massive bleeding due to the nature of the lesions is still high, despite the fact that bronchial artery embolization had been performed for non-emergency patients.

There were significant differences in the total amount of blood loss, hemostatic methods, operation duration and perioperative complications between the patients with acute massive airway hemorrhage and non-acute massive airway hemorrhage. Among them, the intraoperative mortality was of great concern, which was greatly affected by the following rescue methods, had a great impact on patients and was also a great test for doctors. Compared with the non-acute group of patients, the amount of blood loss in the acute group of patients was significantly increased, and the duration of operation was prolonged. Hemostatic methods vary with the amount and rate of bleeding, and are more cumbersome and complex in acute massive airway hemorrhage. In many cases, the bleeding rate was too fast to follow the conventional hemostasis steps step by step, so it was necessary to directly take the method of lung isolation, which played a decisive role in the prognosis of patients.

Many studies had reported the benefits of VV-ECMO combined with bronchoscopic airway intervention for critically ill patients with airway problems, but not in all patients. Although the advanced technology is good, it is not omnipotent for emergencies, and the establishment of ECMO is time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring a long time and a lot of preparation, which cannot meet the principle of rapid and accurate handling of emergencies. An effective, feasible and adaptable hemostasis measure is needed to meet the dual functions of ventilation and hemostasis when acute massive airway hemorrhage breaks out during bronchoscopy airway intervention, to gain valuable time and opportunity for subsequent treatment. Lung isolation can effectively control the hemorrhage of the bleeding side and ensure the oxygenation of the patient by using the non-bleeding side lung. The two patients who died during the operation were intubated after cardiac and respiratory arrest. At that time, the patients had missed the best time for lung isolation to stop bleeding, and eventually died during the operation due to circulatory failure.

Postabortion hemorrhage — algorithmic assessment and stepwise care are outlined as follows: assessment includes cervical laceration (visual and digital inspection of cervix), atony (bimanual exam and cannula test), and hematometra (ultrasound); primary treatment lists repair of cervical laceration, uterine massage, and uterotonics; secondary treatment lists resuscitative measures, laboratory evaluation, re-aspiration, and balloon tamponade; tertiary treatment lists uterine artery embolization, laparoscopy, laparotomy, and hysterectomy. The cannula test is performed by inserting an 8 to 10 mm cannula to the fundus and withdrawing it slowly to identify when bleeding through the cannula is briskest, and in the absence of evidence of a cervical laceration or perforation, we recommend initiating uterine massage.

### Nomogram based on clinical characteristics and ultrasound indicators for predicting severe postpartum hemorrhage in patients with anterior placenta previa combined with previous cesarean section: a retrospective case-control study [^3c973caa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the rates of one-step-conservative surgery, abdominal aortic balloon placement, intraoperative uterine tamponade, uterine artery ligation, hysterectomy or postoperative interventional embolization were significantly higher in the SPPH group compared to the non-SPPH group. However, apart from one-step-conservative surgery, other operations were not causally related to the occurrence of SPPH. The use of abdominal aortic balloons remains controversial; some studies suggest that they can reduce intraoperative blood loss and lower the risks of hysterectomy and secondary surgery. However, other studies indicate that the use of abdominal aortic balloons not only fails to reduce bleeding and transfusion volumes but also prolongs surgery duration and increases hospitalization costs. In this study, the incidence of SPPH was 40.44%, and the rate of abdominal aortic balloon placement was 5.78%. Patients undergoing abdominal aortic balloon placement are often preoperatively assessed as individuals with a high risk of bleeding or a greater likelihood of requiring a hysterectomy. In recent years, due to advancements in surgical techniques and the increasing incidence of complications following abdominal aortic balloon placement, the clinical applications of this procedure have gradually decreased. In this study, the rates of uterine artery ligation and uterine tamponade were 72.89% and 51.11%, respectively. When excessive bleeding occurs after fetal or placenta delivery, most surgeons ligate the uterine artery regardless of whether it is PAS or not. When massive bleeding is under control, but there is still oozing of blood in the uterine wall where the placenta was attached, most surgeons insert an intrauterine balloon or gauze before suturing the uterus to reduce the risk of subsequent bleeding in PAS. Most surgeons in non-PAS would opt for local suturing to achieve hemostasis, which typically yields favorable outcomes, and uterine tamponade is only used when sutures are ineffective. Hysterectomy or postoperative interventional embolization is typically considered as a last resort when SPPH has occurred and other treatments have proven ineffective. Although they cannot reduce the incidence of SPPH, their roles in reducing perioperative bleeding are undeniable. One-step-conservative surgery does not remove the placenta, but instead directly excise the uterine wall invaded by the placenta and perform uterine reconstruction. This procedure can prevent excessive bleeding caused by aggressive placental dissection. However, in our study, one-step conservative surgery was identified as a risk factor for SPPH, which appears to contradict previous research findings. This discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that our target population included patients with anterior placenta previa who had previous cesarean sections, while not all patients had PAS. The majority of patients undergoing one-step-conservative surgery in our study had PAS, which is a high-risk factor for SPPH. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that one-step-conservative surgery was a protective factor against hysterectomy or postoperative interventional embolization (see Additional file 2 and 3).

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^ab1283c5]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

External bleeding control — civilian first aid recommendations: Uncontrolled bleeding is the most important preventable cause of death in 35% of trauma patients and can occur before the arrival of emergency services, and life-threatening bleeding can be recognized by pooling of blood on the ground, rapidly flowing or spurting blood, bleeding that continues despite direct manual pressure, or bleeding that results in systemic symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, chest pain, or loss of consciousness. Control of bleeding is a foundational first aid skill, and applying direct pressure is the mainstay of treatment; direct manual pressure is the hallmark of hemorrhage control. COR 1, LOE C-LD: Direct manual pressure should be applied to achieve initial control of external bleeding. COR 2a, LOE C-LD: A hemostatic dressing can be useful as adjunctive therapy to improve the effectiveness of direct manual pressure. COR 2b, LOE C-LD: Once bleeding has been controlled, it may be reasonable to apply a pressure dressing to maintain bleeding cessation, and the utility of indirect manual pressure (ie, pressure points) for bleeding control is uncertain. COR 2b, LOE C-EO: Mechanical pressure such as pressure bandages or devices might be considered in some situations when direct manual pressure is not feasible. These guidelines are intended for use in the civilian first aid setting; the management of life-threatening bleeding in tactical rescue situations, mass casualty events, and military conflict is outside the scope of these guidelines.

Results

I. Initial resuscitation and prevention of further bleeding

Minimal elapsed time

Recommendation 1

We recommend that severely injured patients be transported directly to an appropriate trauma facility. (Grade 1B)

We recommend that the time elapsed between injury and bleeding control be minimised. (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Because relatively few hospitals provide all of the services required to treat patients with multiple injuries, many healthcare systems have developed trauma networks or systems. The underlying aims of trauma care organisation is to move patients to a multi-specialist care as early as possible, yet still provide immediate critical interventions. These aims can come into conflict, and there are a number of different means with which to resolve these issues, resulting in large variations in trauma care systems both between and within countries and a consequent significant heterogeneity in the literature. The evidence is weak, but there is a general consensus that the organisation of a group of hospitals into a "trauma system" leads to about a 15% reduction in trauma death, with about a 50% reduction in "preventable death". Inter-hospital transfer of patients does not seem to change overall mortality, and the evidence neither supports nor refutes direct transport from the accident scene to a major trauma centre. However, there is some evidence that a lower threshold for trauma centre care should be used in patients aged > 65 years. No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between a hospital's trauma patient volume and outcomes. Despite a lack of evidence there is a consensus that "systemised" trauma care that matches each patient to the most appropriate treatment facility is advantageous, whereby the definition of "appropriate" will depend on the patient profile, the nature of the injuries and the hospital facilities available.

Trauma patients in need of emergency surgery for ongoing haemorrhage have increased survival if the elapsed time between the traumatic injury and admission to the operating theatre is minimised. More than 50% of all trauma patients with a fatal outcome die within 24 h of injury. Despite a lack of evidence from prospective RCTs, well-designed retrospective studies provide evidence for early surgical intervention in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. In addition, studies that analyse trauma systems indirectly emphasise the importance of minimising the time between admission and surgical bleeding control in patients with traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Minimisation of time to surgery is an accepted principle of trauma care and is unlikely to ever be tested in a clinical trial due to lack of equipoise.

At discharge, discuss with the patient's primary team regarding continuing or discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

Bleeding control

Direct pressure, wound packing and tourniquet application are the mainstem of bleeding control. In catastrophic extremity bleeding, a tourniquet should be applied immediately and tightened sufficiently to stem arterial bleeding. A second tourniquet may be required if the bleeding continues. Some wounds require packing in addition to direct pressure. The bleeding vessel should be located within the wound, and hemostatic gauze applied directly to the source of the bleed, packing tightly until the wound is filled to provide sufficient pressure. A pressure bandage can then be applied over the top of the haemostatic gauze. For neck wounds direct pressure should be maintained and the need for (early) airway interventions should be considered.

5-min scene time

EMS focus should be to provide immediate life-saving interventions and leave scene towards definite care within 5 min. Patients should be assisted to walk to the ambulance where possible or rapidly extricated by carry-chair or stretcher if necessary. All emphasis should be upon leaving scene with a shared understanding that most intervention can be performed en route to hospital. If vascular (IV/IO) access cannot be gained immediately, additional attempts can be made on route if safe to do so. Tranexamic Acid (IV or IM if no access can be obtained), analgesia and basic monitoring can all be managed en route to hospital and if no reliable blood pressure readings are generated, the patient's volume status should be assessed and described by peripheral pulses, colour, diaphoresis and respiratory status.

Figure 2 — management of nonmajor bleeding on OACs uses the decision, "Does the bleed require hospitalization, surgical/procedural intervention, or transfusion?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is not on VKA, do not administer reversal/hemostatic agent; if patient is on a VKA, consider ≤ 2.5 mg PO/IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no, actions are: consider continuing OAC (provided there is an appropriate indication); provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy, assess risks and benefits of stopping; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and determine if dosing of OAC is appropriate. The pathway then asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and, once patient is stable, advises to "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)".

### Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^d36aced6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.

Search Methods

We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all-cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug-containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs. We were unable to perform the planned network meta-analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review. Systemic drug treatments We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low-certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants). Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low-certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding. Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non-cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE). Topical drug treatments Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open-label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants). The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open-label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. The other three outcomes were associated with very low-certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days. We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased. Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.

### Cervical ectopic pregnancy-the first case of live birth and uterus-conserving management [^b5145b59]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast, live birth is published in cases of isthmocervical pregnancies. However, nearly all patients needed an emergency hysterectomy. Histological examen showed AIP (abnormally invasive placenta). We recently published a case of isthmocervical pregnancy with severe hemorrhage in the second trimester. In this case, embolization of cervical branches of the uterine artery was performed in the 19th week of pregnancy resulting in bleeding arrest for 10 weeks. In the 29th week of pregnancy, severe hemorrhage occurred again and a hysterectomy was performed after the fundal delivery of the preterm but healthy baby.

Concerning the pathogenesis of AIP, it is well known that the decidua plays a crucial role in the control of trophoblast invasion and the associated spiral artery remodeling. AIP always is a consequence of an endometrial defect. If the decidua is completely absent, as is the case in the endocervix, CEP will result per definition always in AIP, characterized by excessive vascularization. In contrast to a CSP (cesarean scar pregnancy), where there is a mechanical defect in anterior uterine wall, the placenta does not overwhelm the surface and does not penetrate the cervical wall in CEP, allowing a manual or instrumental evacuation. Since the cervical wall is not able to perform contractions like the myometrium, vessel sealing is strongly impaired after placental detachment, resulting in a life-threatening hemorrhage. On the other side, the missing ability of the cervix to cause contractions may explain the lack of antenatal bleeding in our and several of the published cases. Therefore, CEP is strongly characterized by severe bleeding after placental detachment but not always before placental delivery.

In conclusion, one main first goal of CEP management is LISA (leaving the placenta in situ approach). As a second step, bleeding prevention procedures should be performed before the placenta will be detached. Here, we performed embolization of the cervical branches of the uterine artery after the delivery of the baby and the cervical internal os plasty after the complete detachment of the placenta.

A study of 29 cases showed the high efficiency of the UAE in preventing life-threatening bleeding in CEP and postpartum AIP. Several cases of efficacious prophylactic UAE followed by curettage in the first-trimester CEP have been reported. However, UAE in advanced gestational age was still associated with severe bleeding.

We also hypothesized that the uncomplicated pregnancy course was a result of a very intensive care and infection prevention approach in our patient. The cerclage itself contributed to cervical closure by prevention of cervical dilatation through the growing placenta.

### Management of epistaxis… [^c6cb0597]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The rich vascular supply of the nose originates from the ethmoid branches of the internal carotid arteries and the facial and internal maxillary divisions of the external carotid arteries. 5 Although nasal circulation is complex, epistaxis usually is described as either anterior or posterior bleeding. This simple distinction provides a useful basis for management. Most cases of epistaxis occur in the anterior part of the nose, with the bleeding usually arising from the rich arterial anastomoses of the nasal septum. Posterior epistaxis generally arises from the posterior nasal cavity via branches of the sphenopalatine arteries. 8 Such bleeding usually occurs behind the posterior portion of the middle turbinate or at the posterior superior roof of the nasal cavity. In most cases, anterior bleeding is clinically obvious.

In contrast, posterior bleeding may be asymptomatic or may present insidiously as nausea, hematemesis, anemia, hemoptysis, or melena. Infrequently, larger vessels are involved in posterior epistaxis and can result in sudden, massive bleeding. Diffuse oozing, multiple bleeding sites, or recurrent bleeding may indicate a systemic process such as hypertension, anticoagulation, or coagulopathy. In such cases, a hematologic evaluation should be performed. Appropriate tests include a complete blood count, anticoagulant levels, a prothrombin time, a partial thromboplastin time, a platelet count and, if indicated, blood typing and crossmatching. ANTERIOR EPISTAXIS If a single anterior bleeding site is found, vasoconstriction should be attempted with topical application of a 4 percent cocaine solution or an oxymetazoline or phenylephrine solution.

For bleeding that is likely to require more aggressive treatment, a local anesthetic, such as a 4 percent cocaine solution or tetracaine or lidocaine solution, should be used. Adequate anesthesia should be obtained before treatment proceeds. 5, 9 Bayonet forceps and a nasal speculum are used to approximate the accordion-folded layers of the gauze, which should extend as far back into the nose as possible. Each layer should be pressed down firmly before the next layer is inserted. Once the cavity has been packed as completely as possible, a gauze "drip pad" may be taped over the nostrils and changed periodically.

### Epistaxis: outpatient management | AAFP… [^d66615b6]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Anatomy Approximately 90% of epistaxis cases arise from the anterior part of the nasal septum; this is known as anterior epistaxis. 5–7 Anterior bleeding most commonly occurs from the rich vascular supply at the Kiesselbach plexus. 8 This plexus is formed by terminal branches of the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. 3, 6, 9. Posterior epistaxis typically occurs along the nasal septum or lateral nasal wall, and originates from branches of the internal maxillary, sphenopalatine, and descending palatine arteries. 3, 10 The posterior ethmoid artery provides a small contribution. 10 Because hemostasis is more difficult to achieve with posterior bleeding, the distinction between anterior and posterior epistaxis guides management.

Management ANTERIOR EPISTAXIS Outpatient management of anterior epistaxis is a stepwise process beginning with conservative measures to control bleeding and moving toward more invasive means to achieve hemostasis. An initial assessment of airway patency is necessary. A brisk bleed can lead to a large amount of blood entering the posterior pharynx, potentially causing airway obstruction. Any concern for airway obstruction should be immediately referred for emergency evaluation. 13 The next step is directive therapy. If there continues to be bleeding or a prominent vessel that is suspected to be the source of the bleeding, direct vasoocclusive therapy to the area is warranted. In the outpatient setting, the use of silver nitrate sticks is convenient and effective. Silver nitrate creates a chemical cautery when it comes in contact with a moist mucous membrane.

The silver nitrate should be applied in a circumferential pattern around the site of bleeding before it is applied to the bleeding site itself. Brisk bleeding will wash silver nitrate away before cauterization, so relative hemostasis is needed for this approach to be successful. POSTERIOR EPISTAXIS Posterior epistaxis is often brisk, and given the location of these vessels, it is usually difficult to visualize the site of bleeding. Compared with anterior epistaxis, patients with posterior epistaxis are more likely to require hospitalization and are twice as likely to require nasal packing.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^493f1f41]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The recommendations made in this guideline are graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, summarised in Table 1. According to the GRADE scheme, the number associated with each recommendation reflects the strength of the recommendation by the author group, with "we recommend" (Grade 1) being stronger and "we suggest" (Grade 2) being weaker, while the letter reflects the quality of the scientific evidence. Comprehensive, structured, computer-based literature searches were performed using the indexed online database MEDLINE/PubMed, supplemented by screening of reference lists within relevant publications. The aim of each search strategy was to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs and systematic reviews that addressed specific scientific queries. In the absence of high-quality scientific support, case reports, observational studies and case control studies were also considered and the literature support for each recommendation graded accordingly.

### Drugs to reduce bleeding and transfusion in major open vascular or endovascular surgery: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^6a6c957e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti‐fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss.

Search methods

We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all‐cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main results

We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug‐containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs.

We were unable to perform the planned network meta‐analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review.

Systemic drug treatments

We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low‐certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants).

Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding.

Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low‐certainty evidence due to imprecision).

There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non‐cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE).

Topical drug treatments

Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open‐label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants).

The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open‐label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies.

None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

The other three outcomes were associated with very low‐certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days.

We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes.

Authors' conclusions

Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all‐cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days.

There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased.

Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.

### Liver biopsy [^ef0dbd8d]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Liver biopsy — bleeding incidence and timing are described as follows: Less severe bleeding, defined by pain or reduced blood pressure or tachycardia without need for transfusion or intervention, occurs in approximately 1 in 500 biopsies; severe bleeding is usually clinically evident within 2–4 hours, though late hemorrhage can occur up to one week. Based on laparoscopic observations, some degree of bleeding occurs after all percutaneous liver biopsies, and ultrasonography detects intrahepatic and peripheral bleeding in 18%-20% of patients after percutaneous biopsy. Because severe hemorrhage is usually arterial, US guidance would not be expected to identify small arteries and does not appear to significantly reduce the risk thereof.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: an updated European guideline [^04060287]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Recommendation 17

We recommend the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with other surgical measures or with packing for venous or moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchymal injuries (Grade 1B).

Rationale

A wide range of local haemostatic agents are currently available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical techniques to obtain haemorrhage control. These topical agents can be particularly useful when access to the bleeding area is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatin or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding. The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, severity of bleeding, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when autotransfusion is used and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals but increasing experience from humans is now available.

The different types of local haemostatics are briefly presented according to their basis and haemostatic capacity:

i) Collagen-based agents trigger platelet aggregation resulting in clot formation when in contact with a bleeding surface. They are often combined with a procoagulant substance such as thrombin to enhance the haemostatic effect. A positive haemostatic effect has been shown in several human studies.

ii) Gelatin-based products can be used alone or in combination with a procoagulant substance. Swelling of the gelatin in contact with blood reduces the blood flow and, in combination with a thrombin-based component, enhances haemostasis. A similar or superior haemostatic effect has been observed compared with collagen-based agents.

iii) The effect of cellulose-based haemostatic agents on bleeding has been less well studied and only case reports that support their use are available.

### Tourniquets for the control of traumatic hemorrhage: a review of the literature [^6bb58a65]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The United States Army Medical Department in a review of the medical services of World War II stated that soldiers frequently misused tourniquets, failed to alert staff at aid stations of their presence and otherwise contributed to negative outcomes stemming from the use of tourniquets. This was such a widespread problem that their use was restricted in one unit that the senior surgeon ordered that the only reason for the use of such a device was for the control of "active spurting hemorrhage from a major artery". The directive was also issued to reinforce the proper documentation of the placement of a tourniquet to allow rapid notification of upper echelon personnel. The early advice to loosen the tourniquet every 30 minutes to allow perfusion of the limb via collateral circulation due to the fact that the practice put a patient at risk of bleeding to death by slow degrees was also replaced with orders that a tourniquet that should only be removed by a medical officer. This opinion continues to be common practice today.

It should be noted, for the sake of full disclosure, that perhaps not all of the blame for poor outcomes should be trained at the tourniquet or the men applying them, or the system in which they functioned- although admittedly the delays in access to operative intervention undoubtedly played a role as did the inappropriate battlefield care of the wounded. The operative techniques employed by military surgeons for vascular trauma suffered, secondary to both the case volume and a failure of the military medical system to learn the lessons of prior conflicts. Ligation of arteries was a common practice especially during the early stages of the war, and one that produced a high rate of gangrene as documented in the literature. This is in no way a condemnation or an attack on the skill and dedication of the surgeons who served the militaries of all the combatant nations, but rather another sad example of history repeating itself when appropriate lessons are either not learned or not applied. This is supported by the fact that as the war progressed, amputation rates decreased as surgeons gained experience with the injuries common on the battlefield, in which they were not well educated prior to their deployment due to oversight on the part of their commanders.

### Tourniquets for the control of traumatic hemorrhage: a review of the literature [^74c3264c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

- Any limb with an applied tourniquet should be fully exposed with removal of all clothing, and the tourniquet should never be covered with an form of bandage. The patient should be clearly marked so as the presence of a tourniquet will be know, along with the time it was placed. It may also be advisable to instruct a conscious patient to tell every medical provider they come in contact with about the presence of a tourniquet.

- Continued bleeding (other than medullary oozing from fracture bones) distal to the site of the tourniquet is a sign of insufficient pressure and a need to tighten the tourniquet further.

- A tourniquet should not be loosened in any patient with obvious signs of shock, amputation that necessitated use of such a device to control bleeding, recurrent hemorrhage upon release of the tourniquet or any case where the hemorrhage associated with the wound would be expected to be uncontrollable by any other means.

- Any tourniquet that has been in place for more than six hours should be left in place until arrival at a facility capable of definitive care.

### Bleeding avoidance strategies. consensus and controversy [^7b1f3d51]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Bleeding complications after coronary intervention are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased hospital costs, patient dissatisfaction, morbidity, and 1-year mortality. Bleeding avoidance strategies is a term incorporating multiple modalities that aim to reduce bleeding and vascular complications after cardiovascular catheterization. Recent improvements in the rates of bleeding complications after invasive cardiovascular procedures suggest that the clinical community has successfully embraced specific strategies and improved patient care in this area. There remains controversy regarding the efficacy, safety, and/or practicality of 3 key bleeding avoidance strategies for cardiac catheterization and coronary intervention: procedural (radial artery approach, safezone arteriotomy), pharmacological (multiple agents), and technological (vascular closure devices) approaches to improved access. In this paper, we address areas of consensus with respect to selected modalities in order to define the role of each strategy in current practice. Furthermore, we focus on areas of controversy for selected modalities in order to define key areas warranting cautious clinical approaches and the need for future randomized clinical trials in this area.

### The surgical management of complicated peptic ulcer disease: an EAST video presentation [^e4c52192]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD), once primary a surgical problem, is now medically managed in the majority of patients. The surgical treatment of PUD is now strictly reserved for life-threatening complications. Free perforation, refractory bleeding and gastric outlet obstruction, although rare in the age of medical management of PUD, are several of the indications for surgical intervention. The acute care surgeon caring for patients with PUD should be facile in techniques required for bleeding control, bypass of peptic strictures, and vagotomy with resection and reconstruction. This video procedures and techniques article demonstrates these infrequently encountered, but critical operations.

Content Video Description

A combination of anatomic representations and videos of step-by-step instructions on perfused cadavers will demonstrate the key steps in the following critical operations. Graham patch repair of perforated peptic ulcer is demonstrated in both open and laparoscopic fashion. The choice to perform open versus laparoscopic repair is based on individual surgeon comfort. Oversewing of a bleeding duodenal ulcer via duodenotomy and ligation of the gastroduodenal artery is infrequent in the age of advanced endoscopy and interventional radiology techniques, yet this once familiar procedure can be lifesaving. Repair of giant duodenal or gastric ulcers can present a challenging operative dilemma on how to best repair or exclude the defect. Vagotomy and antrectomy, perhaps the least common of all the aforementioned surgical interventions, may require more complex reconstruction than other techniques making it challenging for inexperienced surgeons. A brief demonstration on reconstruction options will be shown, and it includes Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy.

Conclusion

Surgical management of PUD is reserved today for life-threatening complications for which the acute care surgeon must be prepared. This presentation provides demonstration of key surgical principles in management of bleeding and free perforation, as well as gastric resection, vagotomy and reconstruction.

### Tourniquets for the control of traumatic hemorrhage: a review of the literature [^a9c40077]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

- No patient should exsanguinate from an extremity wound because of the hesitance of a medical professional to utilize a tourniquet to control bleeding due to fear of potential complications.

- In circumstances- such as combat (or the civilian equivalent thereof), high risk of building collapse, fire, or explosions- where expedient movement of the patient is necessary for the safety of the patient and the caregivers, the use of a tourniquet is appropriate to gain control of life threatening hemorrhage

- The existence of a mass casualty incident may be an indication for the use of tourniquets for temporary control of hemorrhage while the situation is brought under control.

- The need for a tourniquet applied to allow movement of a wounded person or during a mass casualty incident should be reevaluated at the earliest possible time;

- The mere presence of an amputation with hemorrhage does not necessitate the use of a tourniquet; most bleeding from such injuries are controllable through use of direct pressure, elevation and packing of the wound. If these actions do not achieve hemostasis, then the use of a tourniquet is indicated.

- Tourniquets may be placed proximal to the site of uncontrollable bleeding around an impaled object; under no circumstances should the tourniquet be applied over the impaled object.

- Tourniquets should not be applied over joints, or over clothing. It should also be at least 3–5 centimeters from the wound margins. The rule of the thumb the author used when teaching was to place it the width of the palm of a hand proximal to the wound whenever possible, as this provides an easy frame of reference.

### ESR essentials: arterial vascular access and closure devices-practice recommendations by the cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of Europe [^58eebd6c]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular access is the initial, very important, step of endovascular procedures. Various access sites include the common femoral artery, brachial artery, radial artery, popliteal artery, and distal tibial vessels (pedal arteries). Successful arterial access requires advanced knowledge of anatomy, as well as proper training and experience. Today, vascular access should be obtained using real-time, ultrasound guidance to reduce access time, patient discomfort, and puncture-related complications including dissection, arteriovenous communication, and bleeding. Nevertheless, high-level evidence to support this recommendation in peripheral procedures is limited and level A data are mainly derived from randomized cardiac trials investigating only radial and femoral access. Vascular closure devices (VCDs) for femoral access can be broadly categorized as active closure devices, compression assist devices, and external/topical hemostasis devices. There is high-level evidence demonstrating that their use is related to less time for ambulation and increased patient satisfaction. However, available data failed to clearly demonstrate a benefit in complications compared to standard manual compression in peripheral endovascular arterial procedures, and thrombotic and infectious complications reported following VCD use remain an issue. Heterogeneity noted in the literature, caused by the vast variety of devices, access sites, sheath sizes, clinical scenarios, and procedures, poses difficulties in data analysis and future study design. As a result, an individualized VCD use is currently suggested for ≥ 5Fr femoral artery access not only to reduce time to hemostasis and ambulation and to improve patient comfort, but also to reduce bleeding complications in cases of femoral access with increased bleeding risk, deranged coagulation, and large-bore access, though a high level of evidence to support this later recommendation is limited. KEY POINTS: US guidance is strongly recommended for femoral access and is mandatory to obtain more challenging access. The use of VCDs for femoral hemostasis is generally safe, effective, and currently supported by level I evidence. Proper training and correct VCD choice, based on the patient's individual characteristics, are imperative to optimize outcomes.

Figure 2 — management of major bleeding on OACs (including direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs] and vitamin K antagonists [VKAs]) first asks, "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC and antiplatelet agent(s); if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide local therapy/ manual compression; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no (major but not critical/life threatening), actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. After initial measures, the pathway asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and if not, it states, "Suggest administering reversal/hemostatic agents* (see Figure 3)"; once the patient is stable, it advises, "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)". Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).

2.6 Secondary endpoints

Secondary endpoints include the primary endpoint and its single components after 24 and 36 months: target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 to 5 bleeding, net clinical benefit, and cost‐effectiveness of DCB vs DES after 12, 24, and 36 months. The definition of stent thrombosis follows the recommendations of the Academic Research Consortium, 27 whereas bleeding is defined according to the BARC criteria. 28 Net clinical benefit is defined as the primary endpoint plus bleeding.

2.7 Quantitative coronary angiographic measurements

Routine or control angiography during follow‐up without a clinical indication is not allowed. However, event‐driven coronary angiographies within the first year after initial PCI will be analyzed following a separate protocol.

2.8 Randomization and baseline intervention

All patients undergoing PCI are screened for eligibility, and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria. Because the vessel size is not known before catheterization, randomization is possible only after angiography and initial balloon dilatation. Randomization to 1 of the 2 treatment arms is performed 1:1 via an interactive Internet‐based response system. In urgent or emergency cases where it is ethically not acceptable to postpone the intervention to obtain written informed consent prior to inclusion, patients are asked for oral consent before PCI, which is documented by a second medical person not being involved in the trial. Written consent is obtained after the intervention. Baseline PCI is performed according to local guidelines with predilatation of the stenosis with an angioplasty balloon. The DCB is used after successful predilatation only, in the absence of flow‐limiting dissections (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia flow ≤ 2, dissection grade C–F) 29 and a residual stenosis > 30%. Subsequently, the DCB (on each side longer than the predilatation balloon by 2–3 mm to avoid geographical mismatch) is inflated at nominal pressure (8–10 bar) for a minimum of 30 seconds. If a flow‐limiting dissection and/or a residual stenosis of > 30% after DCB occurs, spot stenting may be recommended, again avoiding geographical mismatch (stent not specified). Baseline PCI can be performed in a single intervention or in multiple steps, if planned during the index procedure. Patients with a flow‐limiting dissection or a residual stenosis > 30% after initial balloon dilatation receive a DES and enter a prospective registry with the same follow‐up procedures as in the randomized trial.

### Randomised trial of first-line bronchial artery embolisation for non-severe haemoptysis of mild abundance [^4767fc1a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

The superior efficacy of the interventional strategy on bleeding control was sustained at 90 days, with a 91.2% bleeding recurrence-free survival rate compared with 60.2% with the medical strategy. This rate is in the higher range of those reported in uncontrolled series of severe haemoptysis treated with BAE. Bleeding recurrences mostly occur in lung cancer, mycetoma or cavitary lesions, and may be related to incomplete embolisation, recanalisation of previously embolised arteries, as well as to the recruitment of new collaterals due to the progression of the underlying disease. In the present study, lung cancer accounted for only 5.6% of all etiologies. This low rate may be explained by our selection criteria that targeted non-severe acute haemoptysis of mild abundance related to a systemic arterial mechanism. Haemoptysis related to lung cancer usually involve high bleeding amounts, high rate of acute respiratory failure and shock, as well as high rate of pulmonary arterial vasculature involvement. Altogether, the spectrum of the aetiologies of haemoptysis in the present study was similar to that recently described in two large European series of haemoptysis of mild severity, including bronchiectasis, pneumonia/lung abscess, acute tuberculosis and post-tuberculosis sequels, and differed from that of haemoptysis of large abundance or associated with other severity criteria. Cryptogenic haemoptysis also accounted for a large part of our population, and BAE has been shown to provide immediate control of bleeding in most of these cases, with few recurrences at both short and long terms.

The overall rate of in-hospital complications related to the randomised strategy was 5.6%. All were reported in patients receiving BAE, including three minor complications and one major complication, all of which had favourable outcomes. These findings are in accordance with other series of the literature: BAE should be performed by experienced personnel after a rigorous and multidisciplinary evaluation of the benefit:risk ratio. Guiding the procedure with imaging, specifically MDCTA, and the use of modern ionic contrast media and superselective catheterisation of bronchial arteries are essential to decrease the rate of complications related to the procedure. There were no complications related to the medical measures, particularly intravenous terlipressin. A recent Israeli study suggested that inhaled tranexamic acid may be helpful for controlling haemoptysis of low abundance. Its place in the treatment of moderate-to-severe abundance haemoptysis should be investigated.

### Management of bleeding following major trauma: a European guideline [^55eed1ea]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have made every effort to make these guidelines applicable in daily practice in a variety of clinical settings. We wish to emphasise our conviction that a multidisciplinary approach to the management of the bleeding trauma patient will help create circumstances in which optimal care can be provided. By their very nature, these guidelines reflect the current state-of-the-art and will need to be updated and revised regularly as important new evidence becomes available.

### Effectiveness and safety of tourniquet utilization for civilian vascular extremity trauma in the pre-hospital settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c528b6c5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In emergency situations, tourniquets (TQ) are used to control severe bleeding by applying pressure on a limb or body part to restrict blood flow to the area. However, while it is useful intervention for controlling extremity hemorrhage, prolonged application poses inherent risks of complications. In the past, TQs were primarily utilized in military settings; however, recently, this intervention has been increasingly adopted in civilian settings.

The latest United States national guidelines for field triage of injured patients incorporate the identification of active bleeding, referring TQ as one of the criteria for recognizing a high risk of serious injury. Surgical intervention is commonly indicated for patients who require TQs, and a higher mortality rate is observed in cases where timely TQ placement is not implemented. However, only a few studies have investigated the efficacy of TQs in civilian settings. In military environments, where immediate life-saving measures are often crucial and medical resources may be limited, TQs are more readily employed as first-line interventions for severe extremity bleeding. In contrast, healthcare providers in civilian settings may have a more nuanced approach, aiming to balance the need for hemorrhage control with the potential risks and associated complications. In addition, the threshold for TQ use in civilian settings may be influenced by local protocols and the expertise of the healthcare providers involved. Several studies have not reported survival benefits associated with the use of pre-hospital TQs. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of pre-hospital TQ application in patients with traumatic vascular injuries of the extremities.

### Prophylactic transarterial embolization in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers following endoscopic control of bleeding [^95910f47]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Bleeding peptic ulcer is a serious condition that often requires immediate endoscopic or surgical intervention to stop the bleeding (haemostasis). Following haemostasis, patients are at risk of rebleeding, leading to reintervention and risk of morbidity or mortality. In order to prevent rebleeding and associated complications, prophylactic measures have been developed and investigated. Prophylactic transarterial embolization (TAE), where the blood vessel leading to the site of the bleeding ulcer is closed via embolization (e.g. using coils to stop blood flow), has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to address this challenge. However, a comprehensive evaluation of its efficacy and impact on patient outcomes is essential.

Objectives

To assess the effects of prophylactic transarterial embolization after successful endoscopic treatment compared with endoscopic haemostasis only on the risk of rebleeding after bleeding peptic ulcer, in patients where endoscopic haemostasis has been successful.

Search Methods

In August 2023 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed Central, Clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no language or publication status constraints.

Selection Criteria

This review included prospective randomized controlled trials that evaluated prophylactic TAE in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. The selection process involved meticulous screening, full-text reviews, and considerations of study design, intervention, and patient populations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and conducted risk of bias assessments. The outcomes of interest were rebleeding within 30 days, need for reintervention within 30 days, 30-day mortality, complications within 30 days, duration of hospitalization and success rate of the embolization. We contacted authors of included studies for missing and more detailed data, allowing us to carry out sensitivity analyses. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

The review includes two studies involving 346 participants. Prophylactic TAE may not reduce the odds of rebleeding within 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.83; 2 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no effect on reintervention rates per event (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.35; 2 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence) or per participant (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.25 to1.69; 2 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence), and there may be no reduction in 30-day mortality (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.21; 2 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence). Unfortunately, we were unable to analyze complications other than rebleeding, reintervention and mortality, as data for these outcomes were not available in the included studies. The duration of hospitalization may be shorter for participants undergoing prophylactic TAE (mean difference (days) -2.41, 95% CI -4.06 to -0.76; 2 studies, 346 participants; low-certainty evidence). Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low, but there was a high risk of performance bias and detection bias as none of the included studies were blinded. Further, one study had a high risk of selection bias as the randomization lists were created by the primary investigator.

Authors' Conclusions

In conclusion, there is low-certainty evidence that prophylactic TAE may not reduce the odds of rebleeding, reintervention or mortality for participants following peptic ulcer bleeding. It may, however, reduce the duration of hospitalization. Ultimately, due to the limited number of studies and participants, further research with larger populations is warranted to validate these findings and explore additional outcomes, including adverse events other than rebleeding, reintervention and mortality.

Major bleeding classification — critical site bleeding: If ≥ 1 of the following factors applies, the bleed is classified as major; bleeds that compromise organ function such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and other central nervous system bleeds (e.g., intraocular, spinal) are considered critical site bleeds; thoracic, airway, pericardial, intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, intra-articular, and intramuscular bleeds are considered critical as they may cause severe disability and necessitate surgical procedures; intraluminal gastrointestinal bleeding is not considered a critical site bleed, although it can result in hemodynamic compromise; Table 1 lists critical bleeding locations.
