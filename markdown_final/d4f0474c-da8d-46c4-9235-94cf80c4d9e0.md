## Question

Treatment for bleeding gastric ulcer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and transfusion thresholds. Then, I should verify pre-endoscopic risk stratification and triage. Next, I will examine pre-endoscopic pharmacology, including PPI and prokinetics. After that, I need to confirm endoscopy timing and Forrest-based risk classification. Then, I will evaluate endoscopic hemostasis techniques. Next, I should review post-endoscopic PPI strategies and transition to oral therapy. I will then consider H. pylori testing and eradication. Afterward, I must plan monitoring, diet, and discharge. Finally, I will address rebleeding pathways, secondary prevention of ulcer recurrence, and special situations including malignant ulcers and frail patients, verifying each step against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation with rapid hemodynamic assessment, two large-bore IVs, labs including CBC, coagulation profile, metabolic panel, and type and cross, all while monitoring mental status, urine output, and vital signs, because early resuscitation is foundational to outcomes in UGIB and specifically peptic ulcer bleeding, and I should maintain a restrictive transfusion strategy with hemoglobin targets around 7 g/dL unless there are compelling exceptions like active cardiac ischemia or profound instability, which aligns with WSES and contemporary UGIB reviews that emphasize a structured resuscitation approach and restrictive transfusion thresholds, along with prompt surgical and medical evaluation for unstable presentations [^111rJkRA] [^116Lkstz] [^114MbZ3P].

> Wait, let me verify the triage logic before I commit to a location of care: I should apply pre-endoscopic risk scores such as the Glasgow-Blatchford Score to identify very low-risk patients who can be discharged with outpatient endoscopy if GBS is 0–1 and there are no red flags, while higher scores warrant admission and earlier endoscopy, and I should also consider AIMS65 and pre-endoscopic Rockall to estimate mortality and resource needs, because this determines whether we aim for ICU, ward, or outpatient strategies; the ACG 2021 guideline endorses ED discharge for GBS 0–1, and the 2012 ACG criteria specify labs and vitals cutoffs corresponding to less than 1% risk of hospital-based intervention [^113B8bqY] [^114RqkRT] [^1149z5jU].

> I need to check pharmacologic measures before endoscopy: initiate PPI as soon as possible given the likelihood of an ulcer etiology, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality benefits prior to endoscopy; high-quality evidence shows pre-endoscopic PPI reduces high-risk stigmata and the need for endoscopic hemostasis but does not reduce mortality, which supports starting a PPI early for practical reasons while recognizing its limitations, and I should also consider a single dose of IV erythromycin 30–90 minutes pre-endoscopy to improve visualization in appropriate cases, while reversing anticoagulation when clinically indicated based on agent and thrombotic risk, consistent with Cochrane data and ACG guidance on pre-endoscopic care [^116VrEPo] [^1131nBXw] [^111NEbxv].

> Next, I should review timing and diagnostic goals for endoscopy: endoscopy within 24 hours for admitted patients is the standard, with escalation to within about 12 hours for those with high-risk features such as shock, ongoing hematemesis, or bloody nasogastric aspirate, and I must remember that very early endoscopy under 12 hours has not consistently shown mortality or rebleeding benefits across all comers, so risk stratification should guide urgency; once in the stomach, I must classify stigmata using the Forrest system to define rebleeding risk and direct therapy, as major SRH like active bleeding, visible vessel, or adherent clot warrant treatment, whereas clean base or flat spot typically do not require endoscopic therapy, aligning with ACG, WSES, and consensus statements on Forrest-based management [^113nvC16] [^116Wnxuj] [^1156GUyi].

> I will now examine endoscopic hemostasis choices for high-risk lesions: combination therapy is preferred, and I should double-check that epinephrine injection alone is inadequate, so pairing injection with thermal or mechanical modalities is recommended, including bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, or clips, and where appropriate I can consider hemostatic powder (TC-325) as a temporizing measure for active bleeding and use a Doppler probe to confirm hemostasis if available; for adherent clots resistant to vigorous irrigation, evidence is insufficient for a uniform mandate, so individualized decisions are needed, all of which is consistent with ACG and WSES guidance that discourage epinephrine monotherapy and encourage dual-modality approaches with selective advanced adjuncts [^113b8pjm] [^117Mvut3] [^111dvYdH].

> Hold on, I should verify the post-endoscopic acid suppression regimen because this is easy to misstate: after successful hemostasis for high-risk stigmata, high-dose IV PPI for 72 hours as an 80 mg bolus followed by 8 mg/hour continuous infusion or an evidence-based intermittent regimen is recommended, then transition to oral PPI, often twice daily for two weeks in high-risk patients, with step-down to once-daily thereafter, and overall continue PPI for 6–8 weeks to allow ulcer healing unless long-term therapy is otherwise indicated, and for clean-base or flat-spot ulcers, standard once-daily PPI suffices, which aligns with ACG 2021 and WSES recommendations as well as prior meta-analytic data showing reduced rebleeding with high-dose IV therapy after endoscopic hemostasis [^115XebaE] [^111hW3NR] [^113jnrLc].

> Let me think about etiology and eradication now because missing this step risks recurrence: all patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should be tested for H. pylori with biopsy-based tests or noninvasive testing timed appropriately around PPI use, and if positive, initiate guideline-concordant eradication such as 14-day triple therapy in areas with low clarithromycin resistance or a 10-day sequential regimen when resistance is high, and be sure to confirm eradication after therapy, since treating H. pylori substantially reduces rebleeding risk and long-term PPI is generally unnecessary once cure is documented, which is supported by WSES guidance and consensus reviews [^11779p8o] [^114SdqJB] [^117G3fjP].

> Next, I should review monitoring, diet, and discharge, ensuring I do not discharge too early: rebleeding risk is greatest in the first 72 hours, so I should observe for tachycardia, hypotension, hematemesis or melena, and hemoglobin drops, while diet can advance as tolerated after stability is achieved, with clean-based ulcers often able to resume a regular diet and be discharged if stable and reliable follow-up is ensured; for very low-risk patients meeting GBS 0–1 and the classic ACG 2012 thresholds, ED discharge with outpatient endoscopy is reasonable, provided patient education and follow-up are solid, which reflects ACG recommendations on early diet and safe discharge criteria [^111utZxK] [^114RqkRT] [^1149z5jU].

> I should double-check the rebleeding algorithm so I do not overcall surgery too soon: if rebleeding occurs, repeat endoscopy is first-line and achieves durable hemostasis in roughly three-quarters of cases, with options including over-the-scope clips or hemostatic powder as bridges when needed; if endoscopic retreatment fails, transcatheter arterial embolization is generally preferred over surgery for patients with significant comorbidity, whereas surgery remains appropriate for refractory bleeding or instability, all consistent with ASGE, WSES, and contemporary reviews quantifying the success of repeat endoscopy and outcomes of TAE versus surgery [^114JXZqZ] [^111hj219] [^114mwzGL].

> But wait, what about secondary prevention and antithrombotic decisions, which often trip us up: NSAIDs should be stopped if possible, and if they must continue, use the lowest dose COX-2 selective agent plus daily PPI; for aspirin prescribed for secondary cardiovascular prevention, I initially thought delaying for weeks might be safer for rebleeding, but I should correct that thought because evidence and guidelines favor early resumption typically within 1–3 days after hemostasis and certainly within 7 days due to lower cardiovascular mortality despite a small rebleeding trade-off, and decisions on anticoagulant resumption should balance thrombotic risk against rebleeding after hemostasis is secured, as emphasized by ACG guidance and supporting outcome data [^112DHpvo] [^111Ppvvh] [^111N2NRv].

> I will now consider special scenarios to ensure completeness: malignant ulcer bleeding frequently rebleeds due to friable neovascularity and local invasion, with high 30-day rebleeding rates despite initial hemostasis, so management is individualized with endoscopic, interventional radiology, surgical, and oncologic options, whereas elderly or frail patients and those with high comorbidity merit a lower threshold for close monitoring and preference for less invasive rescue such as TAE when feasible, in line with contemporary reviews and guideline suggestions acknowledging higher risk and the absence of strongly recommended single best therapy for malignant bleeding [^115BFPJM] [^116Lkstz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that epinephrine alone at endoscopy is acceptable because it can temporize bleeding, but I should correct that error explicitly: epinephrine monotherapy is not recommended and should be combined with a second modality such as thermal or mechanical therapy to achieve durable hemostasis and reduce rebleeding risk, which is a consistent ACG position that I must adhere to in practice [^113b8pjm].

---

Management centers on **early endoscopy within 24 hours** for diagnosis and hemostasis, plus **high-dose IV PPI** to reduce rebleeding [^113QhK8g] [^115XebaE]. Endoscopic therapy is indicated for active bleeding or high-risk stigmata and should use **dual therapy** (mechanical plus thermal or injection); **epinephrine alone is inadequate** [^113b8pjm] [^116DqzB5]. If rebleeding occurs, **repeat endoscopy is first-line**; persistent bleeding requires transarterial embolization or surgery [^114JXZqZ] [^111hj219]. Test for H. pylori and eradicate if positive, and avoid NSAIDs or use COX-2 plus PPI if necessary [^114SdqJB] [^112DHpvo]. Resume antiplatelets/anticoagulants early after hemostasis, and continue PPI for 6–8 weeks to ensure healing.

---

## Initial assessment and resuscitation

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Immediate assessment and stabilization with IV crystalloids; transfuse to hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL, higher if comorbidities [^111rJkRA] [^1147Q66X].

- **Risk stratification**: Use Glasgow-Blatchford and Rockall scores to guide urgency and level of care [^1147Q66X].

- **Laboratory evaluation**: CBC, coagulation profile, renal function, and type and crossmatch.

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy should begin with **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)** as soon as possible, using a high-dose IV regimen (e.g. 80 mg bolus then 8 mg/h infusion) to reduce rebleeding and the need for intervention [^112Nsi5N] [^114hGt97]. **H. pylori eradication** entails testing all patients and, if positive, prescribing standard triple therapy (PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin) or sequential therapy where resistance is high [^114SdqJB] [^117G3fjP].

---

## Endoscopic therapy

- **Timing**: Perform endoscopy within 24 hours; urgent endoscopy within 12 hours for high-risk patients [^113QhK8g].

- **Indications**: Treat active bleeding (Forrest Ia, Ib), non-bleeding visible vessel (Forrest IIa), and adherent clot (Forrest IIb) [^111pisY5] [^111NEbxv].

- **Techniques**: Use dual therapy (mechanical clips plus thermal or injection); epinephrine alone is inadequate [^113b8pjm] [^116DqzB5].

- **Adjunctive methods**: Consider hemostatic powder (TC-325) or over-the-scope clips for difficult cases [^111dvYdH] [^1153Snxa].

---

## Management of rebleeding

Management of rebleeding begins with **repeat endoscopy** as first-line after initial hemostasis [^114JXZqZ]. If repeat endoscopy fails or is not feasible, transarterial embolization is recommended [^111hj219]. Surgery is reserved for persistent or recurrent bleeding despite endoscopic and radiologic therapy [^111hj219].

---

## Post-endoscopic management and prevention

- **PPI therapy**: Continue high-dose IV PPI for 72 hours, then oral PPI for 6–8 weeks to promote healing.

- **NSAID management**: Avoid NSAIDs; if necessary, use COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI [^112DHpvo].

- **Antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy**: Resume early after hemostasis, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks.

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up should include **repeat endoscopy at 6–8 weeks** to confirm healing and exclude malignancy, as well as **patient education** on medication adherence, NSAID avoidance, and recognizing recurrence.

---

## Complications and outcomes

Complications — including **rebleeding, perforation, and mortality** — remain significant risks. Outcomes improve with **early endoscopy, effective hemostasis, and PPI therapy**, which reduce rebleeding, surgery, and mortality.

---

Effective management of bleeding gastric ulcer requires coordinated **resuscitation**, timely **endoscopy**, appropriate **pharmacotherapy**, and structured **follow-up** to minimize rebleeding and complications.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^112wxv7D]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

After risk assessments, patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should receive pharmacologic treatment and endoscopic examination within 24 hours. The guideline suggests intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as the first choice for gastric acid suppression, and the dose and duration depend on the endoscopic findings. The endoscopic finding of bleeding peptic ulcers can be classified by Forrest classification, which can identify high or low risk for rebleeding and mortality.

- **Major stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH)**:
	- Forrest IA (spurting vessel), IB (active oozing), IIA (non-bleeding visible vessel), and IIB (adherent clots) indicate a higher rebleeding and mortality risk, necessitating appropriate endoscopic treatment.
- **Minor SRH and no recent SRH**:
	- Forrest IIC (flat red spot) signifies a minor SRH with a lower risk, and Forrest III (clean base) indicates no recent SRH.

In combination with clinical presentation and endoscopic findings, the complete Rockall score predicts the rebleeding and mortality risk. A complete Rockall score of 0–1 is low risk, 2–4 is intermediate risk, and ⩾5 is defined as high risk.

Peptic ulcer healing is a reconstruction process of mucosa through the formation of granulation tissue. Granulation tissue formation takes place approximately 72 hours through the formation of the ulcer base, blood vessel, and re-establishment of glandular architecture after the ulcer occurs.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment initiated prior to endoscopic diagnosis in upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116VrEPo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common reason for emergency hospital admission. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production and are used to manage upper GI bleeding. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of PPIs initiated before endoscopy in people with upper GI bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of PPI treatment initiated prior to endoscopy in people with acute upper GI bleeding.

- **Search methods**: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases and major conference proceedings to October 2008 for the previous versions of this review, and in April 2018, October 2019, and June 3, 2021, for this update. We also contacted experts in the field and searched trial registries and references of trials for any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared treatment with a PPI (oral or intravenous) versus control treatment with either placebo, histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), or no treatment, prior to endoscopy in hospitalized people with uninvestigated upper GI bleeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted study data, and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes assessed at 30 days were mortality (our primary outcome), rebleeding, surgery, high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage (active bleeding, non-bleeding visible vessel, or adherent clot) at index endoscopy, endoscopic hemostatic treatment at index endoscopy, and time to discharge.

### Is early endoscopy in the emergency room beneficial in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer? A "fortuitously controlled" study [^114xwHDd]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

In previous randomized trials, early endoscopy improved the outcome in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, though most of these studies defined "early" as endoscopy performed within 24 hours after admission. Using the length of hospital stay as the primary criterion for clinical outcome, we compared the results of endoscopy done immediately after admission (early endoscopy in the emergency room, EEE) with endoscopy postponed to a time within the first 24 hours after hospitalization, but still during normal working hours ("delayed" endoscopy in the endoscopy unit, DEU).

- **Patients and methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 81 consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcer admitted in 1997 and 1998 (age range 16–90 years). Of these 81 patients, 38 underwent DEU (the standard therapy at the hospital) and 43 underwent EEE. Patients in the two groups were comparable with regard to admission criteria, were equally distributed with respect to their risk of adverse outcome (assessed using the Baylor bleeding score and the Rockall score), and differed only in the treatment they received. Endoscopic hemostasis was performed whenever possible in all patients with Forrest types I, IIa, and IIb ulcer bleeding.

- **Results**: We found similar rates in the two groups for rebleeding (16% in DEU patients vs. 14% in EEE patients), persistent bleeding (8% in DEU patients vs. none in EEE patients), medical complications (21% in DEU patients vs. 26% in EEE patients), and the need for surgery (8% in DEU patients vs. 9% in EEE patients).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varices, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause of gastric variceal bleeding, the occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in non-cirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process includes an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111FycE9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to indications for admission, ACG 2012 guidelines recommend considering discharging patients from the emergency department without inpatient endoscopy if the following criteria are met: urea nitrogen is less than 18.2 mg/dL, hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 13.0 g/dL for males (12.0 g/dL for females), systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than or equal to 110 mmHg, pulse is less than 100 bpm, and there is an absence of melena, syncope, cardiac failure, and liver disease. These patients have a less than 1% chance of requiring intervention.

### Proton pump inhibitor treatment for acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^114UusLy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer (PU) bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in peptic ulcer bleeding have yielded conflicting results.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of PPIs in the management of acute bleeding from PU using evidence from RCTs.

- **Search strategy**: We performed a search of CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), and EMBASE (1980 to February 2003), along with proceedings of recent major meetings through to February 2003. We searched the reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field for additional published or unpublished data.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs of PPI treatment (oral or intravenous) compared with either placebo or H(2)-receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) in patients with acute bleeding from PU were included if they met predefined criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted data independently on a purpose-designed data extraction form. Validity of included studies was assessed by adequacy of randomization method and other predefined criteria. Studies were summarized, and meta-analysis was undertaken. The influence of factors on the outcomes was assessed.

- **Main results**: Twenty-one RCTs with a total of 2915 participants were included. Statistical heterogeneity was found among trials for rebleeding (P = 0.05) but not for mortality (P = 0.26) or surgery (P = 0.42). There was no significant difference in mortality rates between…

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^114mwzGL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Despite adequate initial endoscopic therapy, rebleeding can occur in up to 24% of high-risk patients. Mortality after surgical salvage in the recent UK National Audit was reported at 29%. Large ulcers located in the posterior bulbar duodenum and the lesser curvature of the stomach can erode into the gastroduodenal or the left gastric artery, respectively, which are predictive of endoscopic treatment failure. These ulcers often occur in elderly patients who present with major bleeding, shock, and low initial haemoglobin concentrations.

Patients with massive bleeding who do not respond to endoscopy are often shifted to surgical treatment. Angiographic embolization is an alternative when expertise is immediately available. Loffroy et al. summarized outcomes in ten case series of 75 patients treated with embolization. The rates of clinical success, rebleeding, and mortality were 75%, 25%, and 25%, respectively.

In retrospective comparisons of angiographic embolization versus surgery in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding who do not respond to endoscopic haemostatic attempts, angiographic embolization was associated with reduced treatment-related complications (20–54% vs. 37–68%). Mortality after either treatment was similar (3–30% vs. 14–30%).

A randomized controlled trial compared surgery with further endoscopic treatment for rebleeding. In 75% of these patients, further endoscopic treatment led to durable haemostasis. Patients randomly allocated to surgery experienced substantially more postoperative complications. However, a subgroup analysis suggested that [Note: text may be incomplete].

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111NBVne]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common and potentially life-threatening condition. Defined as bleeding originating proximal to the ligament of Treitz, it can involve the oesophagus, stomach, or duodenum, and present as haematemesis, melaena, or, in cases of severe bleeding with rapid intestinal transit, haematochezia. Coffee ground vomiting, while potentially due to non-bleeding pathology like obstruction, might also indicate UGIB. Besides the externalization of blood, patients might exhibit symptoms of blood loss such as syncope, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The causes of bleeding are classified as variceal or non-variceal, with peptic ulcer bleeding being the most common non-variceal cause. This remains the case despite Helicobacter pylori (H Pylori) eradication treatment and proton pump inhibitor use. While the incidence of UGIB has been reported to be declining due to drug and endotherapeutic interventions, its emergency presentation is common, with a mortality rate between 2% and 10%.

Management of UGIB can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic management, endoscopic assessment and treatment, and post-endoscopic management. In this article, we review these stages with particular focus on initial management, including risk stratification, resuscitation, and drug treatment.

### Helicobacter pylori-related gastric outlet obstruction: is there a role for medical treatment [^111kX7zx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of duodenal and gastric ulcers, as well as ulcer recurrence, is widely known. Bleeding, perforation, and gastric outlet obstruction represent the most serious and potentially life-threatening complications of ulcer disease. At present, the effect of H. pylori eradication on complicated ulcer disease has not been fully established. Case reports exist on the resolution of gastric outlet obstruction after the eradication of H. pylori. We report the first case of H. pylori-related gastric outlet obstruction successfully treated with parenteral antibiotics.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116Lkstz]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital, with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management.

Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 hours of presentation for patients admitted to the hospital, although the optimal timing for patients at higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high-risk lesions and the use of subsequent high-dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently before endoscopy.

- **Management of oesophageal variceal bleeding**: Endoscopic band ligation is required.
- **Management of bleeding from gastric varices**: Thrombin or tissue glue injection is necessary.
- **Rebleeding management**: This requires repeat endoscopic treatment.

If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111hj219]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

- **Ongoing or rebleeding**: The term "further bleeding" encompasses both no haemostasis at index endoscopy and early rebleeding. If acute bleeding persists despite standard endotherapy, European guidelines suggest using a larger over-the-scope clip or haemostatic powder. However, due to high reported rates of rebleeding, haemostatic powder should probably be used as a temporizing measure before definitive management by other means, such as interventional radiology.

	- Rebleeding is indicated by externalisation of blood, a reduction of more than 20 g/L in haemoglobin concentration after stabilisation, or tachycardia and hypotension. All major guidelines recommend repeat endoscopy in this event. A randomised controlled trial of 100 patients comparing repeat endoscopy with surgery for rebleeding after index endoscopy showed that 35 (73%) of 48 patients who had repeat endoscopy experienced long-term control of bleeding with significantly reduced complications, no increase in mortality risk, and reduced resource costs. If bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, interventional radiology (for transarterial embolisation) or surgical input should be considered. A meta-analysis reported no difference in mortality or need for further intervention between these groups. For patients with substantial comorbidities, interventional radiology is generally a safer option than surgery.

- **Variceal bleeding**: If variceal bleeding is uncontrolled by standard endoscopic band ligation or injection techniques, balloon tamponade might be required.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^115BFPJM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite advancements in endoscopic and pharmacological therapies, a minority of patients (8%–15%) still experience refractory peptic ulcer bleeding. Predictors of rebleeding include initial hemodynamic instability, low hemoglobin levels upon presentation, greater blood transfusion requirements, high-risk endoscopic stigmata, large ulcer size, and specific ulcer locations like posterior duodenal or high lesser gastric curvature ulcers. For patients with peptic ulcers who experience rebleeding despite initial endoscopic treatment, a second-look endoscopy has shown long-term bleeding control with reduced complications, no increased mortality risk, and lower costs compared to surgery. Therefore, guidelines recommend a second-look endoscopy in such cases.

Malignancy-related ulcer bleeding is another challenge to manage. Due to local vessel invasion and friable neovascularization of tumors, malignant ulcers can rebleed even after initial hemostasis is achieved. Although surgery and endoscopic resection can remove the tumor, not all patients are appropriate candidates. Standard combination therapy with injection and thermal or mechanical treatment can reach 80%–90% initial hemostasis. However, the overall rebleeding rate of malignant ulcers is 40%, and the rebleeding rate within 30 days is 30%. Until now, there is no strongly recommended therapy for malignant bleeding in treatment guidelines.

If bleeding cannot be controlled through endoscopy, options such as transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) or surgical intervention should be considered.

### Diagnosis and management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113LCdCr]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and it is associated with increased nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Rapid assessment and resuscitation should precede diagnostic evaluation in unstable patients with severe bleeding. Risk stratification is based on clinical assessment and endoscopic findings. Early upper endoscopy, within 24 hours of presentation, is recommended for most patients because it confirms the diagnosis and allows for targeted endoscopic treatment, including epinephrine injection, thermocoagulation, application of clips, and banding. Endoscopic therapy results in reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and decreased risks of rebleeding and need for surgery. Although proton pump inhibitors do not decrease mortality, the risk of rebleeding, or the need for surgery, they reduce stigmata of recent hemorrhage and the need for endoscopic therapy. Despite successful endoscopic therapy, rebleeding can occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients; a second attempt at endoscopic therapy is recommended for these patients. Arteriography with embolization or surgery may be necessary if there is persistent and severe bleeding.

### Asia-Pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: An update 2018 [^116YwWDM]. Gut (2018). High credibility.

When endoscopic haemostasis fails to control peptic ulcer bleeding, repeated endoscopy and surgery are considered viable options to control bleeding. There is little evidence to support the use of angiographic embolisation as an alternative to surgery after endoscopic treatment has failed, except for two retrospective studies. A Scandinavian study prospectively randomised 105 patients with peptic ulcer bleeding to arterial embolisation after endoscopic therapy or to standard treatment. The authors used a composite endpoint which included transfusion requirement, development of rebleeding, need for haemostatic intervention, and mortality as the primary endpoint. While there was a trend towards less rebleeding for those who received angiography, the study reported no difference in the outcome of those who received angiography versus standard treatment.

More recently, a prospective randomised trial in Hong Kong tried to examine this by allocating patients with Forrest I/II peptic ulcer bleeding to pre-emptive angiographic embolisation or standard-of-care management without embolisation. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no demonstrable difference between the two groups in rebleeding within 30 days, need for further endoscopic or surgical interventions, hospital stay, blood transfusion requirement, and mortality. In the per protocol analysis of 90 patients who received angiographic embolisation compared with 113 patients who did not, there was a trend favouring angiography, with a significant reduction in mortality.

### Current management of peptic ulcer bleeding [^112hoFXm]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer bleeding is a common and potentially fatal condition. It is best managed using a multidisciplinary approach by a team with medical, endoscopic, and surgical expertise. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding has been revolutionized in the past two decades with the advent of effective endoscopic hemostasis and potent acid-suppressing agents.

A prompt initial clinical and endoscopic assessment should allow patients to be triaged effectively into those who require active therapy versus those who require monitoring and preventative therapy. A combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy, using a combination of injection and thermal coagulation, offers the best chance of hemostasis for those with active bleeding ulcers. Surgery, being the most effective way to control bleeding, should be considered for treatment failures. The choice between surgery and repeat endoscopic therapy should be based on the pre-existing comorbidities of the patient and the characteristics of the ulcer.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management:

- **Pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment**: We emphasize the need for personalized management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions, and the clinical setting, including available resources.

- **Endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis**: Effective management requires careful consideration of the available resources and experience at the point of care.

- **Postendoscopic management**: It is crucial to develop management strategies tailored to individual patient needs, ensuring optimal outcomes.

### Accuracy of the initial endoscopic diagnosis in the discrimination of gastric ulcers: Is endoscopic follow-up study always needed [^1137WQkv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Endoscopic follow-up study of gastric ulcers has been routinely recommended because of the possibility that a gastric neoplasm will be missed in the initial endoscopy. Some authors, mostly from areas with low gastric carcinoma incidence, have questioned this policy due to the low numbers of curable cancers detected and the high program costs.

- **Goals**: To assess the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis of gastric ulcers and to evaluate the efficacy and cost of a gastric ulcer follow-up endoscopic program in an area with an intermediate incidence rate of gastric cancer.

- **Study**: A retrospective study identified all gastroscopies diagnosing a gastric ulcer over a 6-year period. The endoscopic impression was compared with the histologic diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the likelihood ratio. Patients who completed a follow-up program were also reviewed. For each neoplasm discovered, the number of endoscopies and global cost were calculated.

- **Results**: In 741 gastroscopies, 547 gastric ulcers were diagnosed in 529 patients. Biopsies were taken in 330 patients, in whom 341 gastric ulcers were found. At the index endoscopy, 41 gastric neoplasms (12.4%) were diagnosed. The accuracy of endoscopic malignancy diagnosis was as follows: positive predictive value of 0.68, negative predictive value of 0.98, sensitivity of 0.82, and specificity of 0.95. The likelihood ratio was 16. A total of 117 patients completed the follow-up program. Three new cases of gas…

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^1156GUyi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Although emergency endoscopy should be considered in patients with severe bleeding, very early endoscopy (within 12 hours) has not been shown to provide additional benefit in terms of reduction of rebleeding, surgery, and mortality, compared with later endoscopy (within 24 hours).

The Forrest classification is often used to distinguish endoscopic appearances of bleeding ulcers: Ia is spurting active bleeding; Ib is oozing active bleeding; IIa is a visible vessel; IIb is an adherent clot; IIc is a flat pigmented spot; III is an ulcer with a clean base.

In peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), patients with active bleeding ulcers or a non-bleeding visible vessel in an ulcer bed are at the highest risk of re-bleeding and therefore need prompt endoscopic hemostatic therapy. Patients with low-risk stigmata, such as a clean-based ulcer or a pigmented spot in the ulcer bed, do not require endoscopic therapy.

Two small randomized trials and a meta-analysis suggest that a clot should be removed in search of an artery. When it is present, endoscopic treatment should be given, although the management of peptic ulcers with overlying adherent clots that are resistant to removal by irrigation is still controversial.

- **Endoscopic treatment methods**:
	- **Injection methods**: These include the use of epinephrine, sclerosants, and even normal saline solution.
	- **Thermal methods**: These include monopolar or bipolar cautery and argon plasma coagulation.
	- **Mechanical methods**: These include hemoclips.

Often, the choice of which endoscopic therapy to employ is based on local preference and expertise. Injection of diluted epinephrine alone is now judged to be inadequate.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114vvUj4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The guidelines aim to present the state-of-the-art regarding diagnosis and therapeutic options for optimal management of complicated peptic ulcers. They are intended to enhance the knowledge and awareness of physicians worldwide about complicated peptic ulcers, providing an up-to-date tool to aid in the decision-making process. As such, these guidelines are evidence-based, with a grade of recommendation summarizing the evidence present in the literature.

The population considered in these guidelines is adult patients with suspected complicated peptic ulcer disease. The practice guidelines presented in this document are not a standard of practice but rather suggested plans of care based on the best available evidence and expert consensus. They do not preclude other approaches from being within the standard of practice. For instance, they should not compel adherence to a specific method of medical management. The method should be determined after considering the conditions at the relevant medical institution, such as staff levels, experience, equipment, and the characteristics of the individual patient.

Responsibility for the treatment outcomes lies with those directly engaged in the treatment, not with the consensus group.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^1164RRp1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is the most common gastroenterological emergency and has a considerable morbidity and mortality. Management strategies have changed dramatically over recent decades due to the introduction of acid suppressive therapy, especially proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and endoscopic therapy.

The incidence rates of UGIB demonstrate a large geographic variation ranging from 48 to 160 cases per 100,000 population. Possible explanations for the reported geographic variation in incidence include differences in the definition of UGIB in various studies, population characteristics, prevalence of ulcerogenic medication (particularly aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) prevalence.

Some, but not all, time-trend studies have reported a significant decline in the incidence of acute UGIB, especially peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB), in recent years. This decline is likely due to a combination of factors, including decreasing prevalence of gastric colonization with H. pylori, the use of eradication therapy in patients with ulcer disease, and the increased use of PPI therapy, both in general and in patients using aspirin and NSAIDs in particular.

At the same time, an increasing proportion of patients presenting with UGIB are older, and a significant number of patients with UGIB consume NSAIDs and/or antiplatelet therapy to treat other medical comorbidities. Given these factors, UGIB continues to have a considerable impact.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^112ucxnT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Bleeding peptic ulcer disease is a clinical emergency requiring rapid surgical/medical evaluation to assess the stability of the clinical picture; the approach is similar to that for the bleeding trauma patient. We suggest referring to the latest edition of the European guideline on the management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma. The parameters that should be assessed at ER referral are the same as those reported in the American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) classification of blood loss. These parameters include heart rate, blood pressure, pulse pressure, respiratory rate, urine output, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and base deficit.

Moreover, it is very important to take an accurate medical history, especially regarding:

- **Drugs and diseases**: Affect coagulation status (e.g. antiplatelets, anticoagulants, hepatic failure).
- **Cardiac and pulmonary diseases**: Such as coronary artery disease, which may make patients more susceptible to the adverse effects of anemia.
- **Neurological diseases**: Including dementia, which may predispose patients to pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^1134SYrS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, individual RCTs that compared different regimens of PPIs in peptic ulcer bleeding, and even the meta-analysis of these trials, remain severely underpowered. Worse still, it is unlikely that an adequately powered RCT will be conducted in the near future due to feasibility issues and lack of funding from pharmaceutical companies facing increasing generic competition. Then, how will we be able to decide on this issue? It seems that, for the time being, a reasonable approach is the one chosen by the international consensus group. They stated that "strong evidence demonstrates the efficacy of high-dose IV PPI therapy after successful endoscopy, but it is not possible to make conclusions regarding the efficacy of either lower intravenous doses or high-dose oral therapy". This statement was largely based on the results of a 2006 Cochrane review that showed that, among patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions who had received endoscopic hemostatic therapy, high-dose IV PPI therapy (80 mg bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion) significantly reduced rebleeding and mortality, while lower doses (IV or oral) significantly reduced rebleeding but had no demonstrable effect on mortality. The 2013 update of that review showed very similar results.

It is important to note that even if the guideline recommendations are followed, a significant proportion of patients will rebleed. There is still room for improvement in the management of patients with NVUGIB, especially in those who have been found to have high-risk endoscopic lesions. A recent RCT attempted to improve outcomes, but further details on its impact are not provided.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112hTHZ8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital, with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable the identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management.

Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 hours of presentation for patients admitted to the hospital, although the optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high-risk lesions and the use of subsequent high-dose proton pump inhibitors are cornerstones of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal hemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal hemorrhage, and if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Esophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Rebleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolization or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

### Turn over the new leaf of the treatment in peptic ulcer bleeding: A review of the literature [^1147Q66X]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

A standardized assessment and timely treatment are necessary for patients with bleeding peptic ulcers (Figure 1). The initial step is stabilizing the patient's hemodynamic status and airway patency. The treatment goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain a systolic blood pressure over 100 mmHg and pulse lower than 100/min through intravenous crystalloid fluid resuscitation. Packed RBC, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma transfusion are required to maintain a hemoglobin level higher than 7 g/dL, platelet counts over 50,000/mm³, and a prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of less than 15 s.

Several risk score assessments have been designed to assist with risk stratification for peptic ulcer bleeding patients (Figure 2).

- **Glasgow–Blatchford bleeding score**: This score aims to identify the urgency of endoscopic therapy, using the patient's blood test, blood pressure, past history, and clinical presentations. A score greater than 0 necessitates medication and endoscopic intervention, while a score over 8 points indicates the need for ICU admission.

- **AIMS65 scale**: Proven to predict in-hospital mortality and length of hospitalization by using the patient's blood test, blood pressure, and clinical presentations.

- **Pre-endoscopic Rockall score**: A useful prognostic indicator to identify mortality risk, using vital signs and past history.

### Risk assessment and outpatient management in bleeding peptic ulcer [^115DGSXe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were as follows: 1) to review clinical and endoscopic variables in patients hospitalized for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to peptic gastroduodenal lesions over a period of 3 years; 2) to identify factors associated with unfavorable evolution; and 3) to evaluate characteristics of patients discharged immediately after endoscopy.

Methods: A 3-year retrospective analysis of all UGIB episodes was conducted. Patients with gastroduodenal ulcer or erosive gastritis/duodenitis at endoscopy were included. The prognostic value of several clinical, endoscopic, and analytical variables was assessed. Persistence or recurrence of bleeding, surgery, and mortality were considered outcome variables. Evolution was classified as "unfavorable" when any of these was observed.

Results: A total of 341 patients were identified, with a mean age of 62 years. Melena was the most frequent UGIB presentation (70%). Forty-five percent of patients had associated diseases, and 45% were taking gastroerosive drugs. Duodenal ulcer was the most frequent cause of UGIB (48%), followed by gastric ulcer (32%). The evolution of UGIB was unfavorable in 7% of cases. Variables associated with unfavorable evolution in the multivariate analysis included systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg, a heart rate greater than or equal to 100 bpm, and a Forrest endoscopic classification of severe. Only 10% of patients were immediately discharged with no subsequent complications. However, if predictive variables obtained in the multivariate analysis had been utilized, hospitalization could have been prevented in 115 patients (34%) without subsequent complications.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perforated or bleeding peptic ulcers: 2013 WSES position paper [^114hGt97]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy plays a second major role in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB). Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be administered orally or intravenously depending on the rebleeding risk. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 767 PUB patients treated with endoscopic therapy due to high-risk stigmata, high-dose intravenous PPIs (80 mg esomeprazole bolus plus 8 mg/h continuous infusion for 72 hours) significantly reduced rebleeding (5.9% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.03) and the need for endoscopic retreatment.

- **Meta-analysis results**: Similar findings were noted through meta-analysis; high-dose intravenous PPIs after endoscopic therapy significantly reduced rebleeding, the need for surgery, and mortality compared to placebo or no therapy. PPIs are recommended for 6–8 weeks following upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and/or endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) to allow for mucosal healing.

Once mucosal healing has been achieved, the duration of PPI use remains controversial. Studies have shown that in patients with PUD complicated by bleeding, there is a 33% risk of rebleeding in 1–2 years. Moreover, there is a 40%-50% rebleeding risk over the subsequent 10 years following the initial episode of bleeding. Randomized prospective trials have demonstrated a benefit to long-term acid-suppression therapy in two settings: chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users and Helicobacter pylori-infected patients. Testing for H. pylori is recommended for all patients with PUB. This should be followed by eradication therapy for those who are H. pylori-positive, with subsequent assessment of the effect of this therapy and renewed treatment in individuals where eradication fails.

### Asia-Pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: An update 2018 [^114y8Tt6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The question remains whether risk stratification with selection of high-risk patients may lead to a benefit from second-look endoscopy the next day, with repeated treatment in case of persistent stigmata. The Baylor Bleeding Score attempted to select high-risk patients to receive second-look endoscopy versus controls and found a 24% difference in the rate of rebleeding. A study including 699 patients from Korea showed that the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, large transfusion volume, and failure to perform second-look endoscopy were risk factors for rebleeding after endoscopic therapy. Another study from Taiwan, which enrolled 316 patients receiving a high-dose PPI after endoscopic therapy, attempted to formulate a predictive score using endoscopic monotherapy and serum albumin levels. By this score, the receiver operating characteristic curve to predict the need for second-look endoscopy appeared promising, but outcome data were lacking. At the time of writing, there is still a lack of evidence to suggest that any risk stratification method is effective in selecting patients at high risk who would benefit from second-look endoscopy and pre-emptive treatment.

The working group therefore rejected the statement that a risk stratification score may be useful to identify high-risk bleeding ulcers after endoscopic therapy for second-look endoscopy. Future studies should be conducted to verify the use of a risk stratification system.

- **Statement 5**: A Doppler endoscopic probe should be used to guide endoscopic therapy in order to ensure adequate haemostasis.

### Challenges in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding [^113UifXL]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common medical emergency worldwide, with bleeding peptic ulcers being a major cause. Endoscopic treatment and acid suppression with proton-pump inhibitors are cornerstones in the management of the disease; both treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. The role of emergency surgery continues to diminish. In specialized centers, radiological intervention is increasingly used in patients with severe and rebleeding who do not respond to endoscopic treatment. Despite these advances, mortality from the disorder has remained at around 10%.

The disease often occurs in elderly patients with frequent comorbidities who use antiplatelet agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticoagulants. The management of such patients, especially those at high cardiothrombotic risk who are on anticoagulants, is a challenge for clinicians. We summarize the published scientific literature about the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, identify directions for future clinical research, and suggest how mortality can be reduced.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^115ZAXwa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The WSES 2020 guidelines for surgical interventions in peptic ulcer disease, particularly regarding the choice of surgical intervention for perforated ulcers, emphasize a tailored approach based on ulcer location for treating patients with perforated peptic ulcers larger than 2 cm. For large gastric ulcers that may suggest malignancy, it is recommended to perform resection along with contextual operative frozen pathologic examination whenever possible. In cases of large duodenal ulcers, resections or repair with the potential addition of pyloric exclusion or external bile drainage should be considered. Duodenostomy should be reserved for extreme circumstances.

### Outcome of endoscopic treatment for peptic ulcer bleeding: Is a second look necessary? A meta-analysis [^111QDWPA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Endoscopic therapy for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is highly effective; however, bleeding recurs in 10% to 25% of cases, irrespective of the treatment method used. The clinical value of a second-look endoscopy with retreatment after initial hemostasis remains controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate whether systematic second-look endoscopy with retreatment reduces the risks of rebleeding, salvage surgery, and death in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed on randomized controlled studies published between 1990 and 2000, focusing on the value of second-look endoscopy in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Four studies were selected according to predefined criteria. Two investigators independently extracted the data. Pooled risk estimates and the number needed to treat were calculated for each procedure, and heterogeneity of effects was tested.

- **Results**: The absolute risk reduction in clinical rebleeding was 6.2% (p < 0.01). The absolute risk reduction for surgery and mortality were 1.7% and 1.0%, respectively, though these were not statistically significant. The second-look endoscopy with retreatment significantly reduced the risk of rebleeding compared to control patients (OR 0.64; 95% CI [0.44, 0.95]; p < 0.01), with a number needed to treat of 16. There was no heterogeneity among the studies. The risks of surgery and death were not significantly influenced by the second-look endoscopy with retreatment, with a number needed to treat of 58 and 97, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Systematic second-look endoscopy with retreatment significantly reduces the risk of rebleeding in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^115ZiAvn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines are an update of the 2013 WSES position paper on this topic. To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the board of the WSES to develop questions on six main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology: diagnosis, resuscitation, nonoperative management, surgery, angiography-angioembolization, and antimicrobial therapy. Leading specialists in the field were then tasked with performing a thorough search for relevant papers between 1985 and June 2018 in various databases, including MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE. A systematic review of the available literature was conducted, focusing on providing evidence-based answers with immediate practical applications. The findings were summarized in statements presented and discussed at the 5th WSES Congress held in Bertinoro, Italy, on June 28th, 2018. For each statement, consensus among the WSES panel of experts was reached, and all members contributed to the development of the manuscript, which was reviewed and approved by all authors.

The present guidelines have been developed according to the GRADE methodology.

- **Diagnosis**: In patients with a suspected perforated peptic ulcer, which are the appropriate biochemical and imaging investigations that should be requested? What is the clinical value of risk scores in patients with a perforated peptic ulcer?

### Recommencing aspirin following a peptic ulcer bleed: When is the time right [^111N2NRv]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The results demonstrated a rebleed rate of 10.3% (95% CI 3.4–17.2) in the aspirin group compared with 5.4% (95% CI 0.3–10.5) in the placebo group, showing a difference of 4.9 percentage points (95% CI -3.6–13.4) at 30 days. The authors therefore concluded that continuing aspirin was not equal to stopping aspirin therapy in terms of the risk of a reulcer bleed.

Regarding the secondary endpoints of the study, there was no significant difference in the amount of blood transfused or hospital stay between each arm of the study. However, there was a significant difference in mortality between groups at 8 weeks: 1.3% in the aspirin group (1 patient died of congestive cardiac failure) vs. 12.9% in the placebo group (including 5 participants who died of vascular complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke; 2 who died of perforated ulcer and 1 who died of uncontrolled bleeding); p = 0.005. The difference in mortality remained significant when deaths only due to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and gastrointestinal causes were included.

### Perforated and bleeding peptic ulcer: WSES guidelines [^114LyWu5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

In patients with bleeding peptic ulcer, non-operative management is recommended as the first line of management after endoscopy (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). Non-operative management incorporates principles of ABCDE:

- **Airway control**: Ensure airway patency.
- **Breathing**: Ventilation and oxygenation.
- **Circulation**: Fluid resuscitation and control of bleeding.
- **Drugs**: Pharmacotherapy with PPIs, prokinetics, etc.
- **Endoscopy or embolization**: Serve as diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

A meta-analysis by Barkun et al, which included forty-one randomized trials, showed that all endoscopic therapies decreased rebleeding rates compared to pharmacotherapy alone. Endoscopy is indicated for establishing a diagnosis and initiating therapy for bleeding peptic ulcers. In acutely bleeding ulcers, endoscopy is an integral part of resuscitation.

For endoscopic treatment, it is recommended to achieve hemostasis and reduce rebleeding, the need for surgery, and mortality (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C). Patients should be stratified based on the Blatchford score, adopting a risk-stratified management approach (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

- **Very low-risk group**: Outpatient endoscopy is suggested (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^111NEbxv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the step-wise management of patients with overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Hemodynamic status is first assessed, and resuscitation is initiated as needed. Patients are risk-stratified based on features such as hemodynamic status, comorbidities, age, and laboratory tests. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin is considered to increase diagnostic yield at first endoscopy. A pre-endoscopic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered to decrease the need for endoscopic therapy but does not improve clinical outcomes. Upper endoscopy is generally performed within 24 hours.

- **Endoscopic features and management**: The endoscopic features of ulcers direct further management. Patients with active bleeding or non-bleeding visible vessels receive endoscopic therapy (e.g. bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, sclerosant, clips), and those with an adherent clot may also receive endoscopic therapy. These patients then receive intravenous PPI with a bolus followed by continuous infusion. Patients with flat spots or clean-based ulcers do not require endoscopic therapy or intensive PPI therapy.

- **Rebleeding and further treatment**: Rebleeding after endoscopic therapy is treated with a second endoscopic treatment. If bleeding persists or recurs, treatment with surgery or interventional radiology is undertaken.

- **Prevention of rebleeding**: Prevention of rebleeding is based on the etiology of the bleeding ulcer. Helicobacter pylori is eradicated, and after cure is documented, anti-ulcer therapy is generally not given. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are stopped; if they must be resumed, a low-dose COX-2-selective NSAID plus PPI is used.
