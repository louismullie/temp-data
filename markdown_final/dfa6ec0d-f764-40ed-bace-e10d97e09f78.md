## Question

Inpatient treatment for patient with tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step inpatient management algorithm for tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and stability. Then, I should verify the ECG-based classification into narrow versus wide complex tachycardia. Next, I will consider mechanism-specific acute therapies for regular narrow-complex SVT, followed by management of wide-complex tachycardias and pre-excited AF. After that, I need to address special populations and ongoing inpatient care, including monitoring, anticoagulation, and disposition. Finally, I should double-check key safety caveats and summarize the algorithm with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid hemodynamic stability determination, because unstable patients require immediate synchronized cardioversion regardless of rhythm diagnosis, and I should not delay for drugs or detailed ECG interpretation in that scenario [^1154B5iS] [^111RB2Ve] [^111zvD9B].

> Wait, let me verify the ECG acquisition step before anything else when the patient is stable; a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is essential to distinguish narrow-complex (QRS < 120 ms) from wide-complex (QRS ≥ 120 ms) tachycardias, and I should also obtain a baseline ECG in sinus rhythm if available to help with mechanism diagnosis and aberrancy patterns [^1166JbEB] [^1152t553] [^111j5qd5].

> I will now examine the narrow-complex pathway for stable patients; vagal maneuvers are first-line and can be augmented by using a modified Valsalva with leg elevation and passive repositioning, which improves success, and I should ensure continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring during these maneuvers [^113Cggyu] [^112PRmGD] [^111te4zr].

> Hold on, I should verify adenosine dosing and administration details; the standard approach is 6 mg rapid IV push with a 12 mg repeat if needed, delivered through a proximal IV with immediate saline flush, and if still refractory, a third 12 mg dose is reasonable, with continuous ECG recording to distinguish termination from immediate recurrence; in rare refractory cases, escalation to 24–36 mg has been reported, but I need to ensure cardiology consultation before exceeding standard dosing [^111xstQ6] [^112q5YKG].

> Next, I should review second-line agents for stable narrow-complex SVT when vagal maneuvers and adenosine fail; IV diltiazem, verapamil, or beta-blockers such as metoprolol or esmolol are appropriate choices, and I need to check for contraindications like hypotension, decompensated heart failure, or pre-excitation before selecting AV nodal blockers [^112PRmGD] [^112b9Mas] [^111te4zr].

> But wait, what if the rhythm is irregular or the mechanism is uncertain; I should double-check for atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with variable block, in which case AV nodal blockade for rate control is reasonable, and I must remember that synchronized cardioversion is indicated if pharmacologic therapy fails or the patient becomes unstable [^112PRmGD] [^113g4uQF].

> Let me consider wide-complex tachycardia now; when in doubt, treat it as ventricular tachycardia because misclassification can be lethal, and I should confirm the diagnosis with AV dissociation, fusion beats, or QRS concordance when feasible while preparing for immediate synchronized cardioversion if instability develops [^111RB2Ve] [^111j5qd5] [^111zvD9B].

> I need to ensure I do not give AV nodal blockers in pre-excited atrial fibrillation; agents like diltiazem, verapamil, beta-blockers, digoxin, or amiodarone can accelerate conduction over the accessory pathway and precipitate hemodynamic collapse, so synchronized cardioversion is the preferred acute therapy when unstable, and procainamide is a reasonable pharmacologic option in stable pre-excited AF [^114s5zmA] [^111te4zr].

> For stable, regular monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia of uncertain mechanism, let me reconsider adenosine briefly; it can be diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic if the rhythm is SVT with aberrancy, but I should only attempt this with continuous monitoring and readiness to cardiovert, and I must avoid adenosine in clearly irregular wide-complex rhythms or known pre-excited AF [^113r5KTn] [^111j5qd5].

> Next, I should review ongoing inpatient management after acute stabilization; continuous telemetry is warranted for at least 24–48 hours depending on severity and recurrence risk, electrolytes and thyroid function should be corrected, and I need to check for precipitating factors such as infection, anemia, hypoxia, or stimulant use that can perpetuate sinus or inappropriate sinus tachycardia [^111poiYE] [^114fL7YJ].

> I will now examine anticoagulation decisions; for atrial flutter, I should align antithrombotic therapy with atrial fibrillation protocols, and for cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias, I need to ensure appropriate anticoagulation per AF guidelines or use transesophageal echocardiography if early cardioversion is planned, documenting CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk assessment [^115boMrw].

> Let me think about rhythm-control strategies and ablation candidacy; for recurrent AVNRT or AVRT, catheter ablation offers high success and durable results, and I should discuss this early during inpatient care, arranging EP consultation and scheduling ablation before discharge when feasible to reduce recurrence and readmissions [^112b9Mas].

> I should confirm special-population nuances; in pregnancy, vagal maneuvers and adenosine remain first-line and synchronized cardioversion is safe if needed, in older adults management should be individualized to comorbidities and frailty, and in patients with adult congenital heart disease, I need to consider anticoagulation and tailored antiarrhythmic choices with EP involvement [^1142q9dQ] [^113XtroL] [^113ssKs7].

> Hold on, I should verify medication safety pearls; amiodarone is effective for refractory SVT but requires careful attention to bradycardia, QT prolongation, pulmonary, hepatic, and thyroid toxicity, and drug interactions such as reducing warfarin and digoxin doses, so inpatient loading with telemetry and a clear outpatient monitoring plan are essential [^116zXnBx] [^115ZRH51].

> Let me reconsider disposition thresholds; patients with hemodynamic instability, high-risk features such as structural heart disease, recurrent SVT despite therapy, or unclear mechanism should remain inpatient with telemetry, whereas stable patients with a clear mechanism, successful termination, and reliable follow-up may be discharged with pill-in-the-pocket instructions and early EP referral [^1124u1iY] [^115d6Z3Y].

> Finally, I should double-check that my algorithm aligns with contemporary guidance; the ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC pathways converge on vagal maneuvers and adenosine first for stable regular narrow-complex SVT, early synchronized cardioversion for instability, cautious use of AV nodal blockers in stable SVT, avoidance of harmful agents in pre-excited AF, and a treat-wide-as-VT approach for undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia, with EP consultation integrated early for definitive therapy [^112PRmGD] [^112b9Mas] [^111RB2Ve].

---

Inpatient tachycardia management centers on **immediate hemodynamic stabilization** and **rhythm diagnosis**. For unstable patients, perform **synchronized cardioversion** without delay [^112PRmGD]. For stable patients, use vagal maneuvers and adenosine for regular narrow-complex SVT [^111xstQ6]; if these fail, use IV beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil [^112b9Mas], and consider amiodarone or procainamide for wide-complex or refractory cases [^112xcx7M]. Always obtain a 12-lead ECG [^1152t553], monitor continuously, correct electrolytes, and tailor therapy to the specific arrhythmia and comorbidities [^116Q1fVu]; avoid AV nodal blockers in pre-excited AF [^114s5zmA] and consult cardiology for complex or refractory cases [^111RB2Ve].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Assess for hypotension, shock, acute heart failure, ischemia, or altered mental status [^114itWXL].

- **Immediate cardioversion**: For unstable patients, perform synchronized cardioversion without delay [^111zvD9B] [^111RB2Ve].

- **Stable patients**: Obtain a 12-lead ECG [^1152t553] to classify tachycardia (narrow vs wide complex, regular vs irregular) [^111RB2Ve].

---

## Narrow-complex tachycardias (SVT)

### Regular narrow-complex SVT (AVNRT, AVRT, atrial flutter)

- **Vagal maneuvers**: First-line (Valsalva, carotid massage) [^117DRXt4].

- **Adenosine**: 6 mg IV bolus; if no conversion, 12 mg; repeat once if needed [^112q5YKG] [^1141yPcm].

- **Second-line agents**: IV beta-blockers (metoprolol, esmolol), diltiazem, or verapamil if adenosine fails [^112b9Mas] [^111te4zr].

- **Synchronized cardioversion**: If drugs fail or instability develops [^117DRXt4].

---

### Irregular narrow-complex SVT (atrial fibrillation, multifocal atrial tachycardia)

- **Rate control**: IV beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) [^112b9Mas].

- **Rhythm control**: Consider amiodarone or electrical cardioversion if indicated [^113g4uQF].

- **Anticoagulation**: Per AF guidelines if AF duration > 48 hours or unknown [^notfound].

---

## Wide-complex tachycardias

### Regular wide-complex tachycardia (likely VT)

Treat as VT until proven otherwise; **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is indicated if unstable [^112tiFkE]. For stable patients, use IV procainamide or amiodarone [^112xcx7M]; avoid AV nodal blockers if pre-excitation is suspected [^114s5zmA].

---

### Irregular wide-complex tachycardia (AF with aberrancy, pre-excited AF)

Avoid AV nodal blockers (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone) in pre-excited AF; use **procainamide or synchronized cardioversion** if needed [^114s5zmA] [^111te4zr].

---

## Special considerations

- **Electrolyte imbalance**: Correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Amiodarone interacts with warfarin and digoxin; adjust doses [^116zXnBx].

- **Pregnancy**: Prefer adenosine, beta-blockers, or synchronized cardioversion; avoid amiodarone and ibutilide [^notfound].

- **Elderly**: Individualize therapy based on comorbidities and tolerance [^113XtroL].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Ensure **continuous ECG, BP, and pulse oximetry** during acute management. Address underlying causes (e.g. infection, anemia, hyperthyroidism, ischemia) [^111poiYE]. Arrange cardiology follow-up and consider ablation for recurrent SVT [^115g3Mo5].

---

Inpatient tachycardia care requires **rapid stabilization**, accurate ECG diagnosis, and mechanism-specific therapy, with early cardioversion for instability and careful avoidance of harmful agents in pre-excited AF [^114s5zmA].

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS supraventricular tachycardia guideline — Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting; the guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and the recommendations should not replace clinical judgment. Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed, and adherence can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions based on individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities; consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^113L8aRS]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Over- and under-use of amiodarone is common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Because of adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for use of amiodarone and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the member of the writing committee.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^11134BoJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is common among hospitalized patients and can be fatal without appropriate pharmacologic management. Nevertheless, high-quality evidence to guide treatment decisions for inpatient AWS is lacking. Studies examining treatments for inpatient AWS are limited by small sample sizes and often exclude patients with serious medical and/or surgical comorbidities, although such conditions frequently coexist with AWS in acute care and especially critical care settings.

AWS is a continuum of neurophysiologic signs and symptoms, influenced by the severity of underlying AUD and other medical conditions that can alter brain signaling pathways. AWS has been associated with increased ICU and hospital lengths of stay, hospital-acquired infections, the risk of sepsis, and in-hospital mortality.

A Syndrome Lacking Clear Definitions

SAWS is regularly encountered and managed by ICU providers but has been inconsistently defined. Most clinicians and researchers would agree that SAWS is a progressive manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that often requires admission to intensive care settings for close monitoring and frequent administration of medications to address hyperautonomia (including but not limited to pyrexia, tachycardia, and/or hypertension), agitation, and/or delirium. These clinical features represent the hallmarks of SAWS, also called alcohol withdrawal delirium, delirium tremens, and "DTs" in the literature. Clear metrics and goals for pharmacologic treatment, addressing the clinical features found in hospitalized patients with SAWS, do not exist. Instead, acute management of SAWS has generally emphasized short-term outcomes, including prevention of seizures, improvement of autonomic instability, and relief of agitation. Longer-term treatment outcomes after episodes of SAWS such as cognitive function, engagement in care for AUD, and abstinence from alcohol remain inadequately studied.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) — ongoing pharmacologic management when ablation is not chosen: For patients without pre-excitation on their resting ECG, oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil "are indicated", with observational data noting effectiveness in "approximately 50% of patients without pre-excitation". In patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have AVRT and/or pre-excited AF and are not candidates for or decline ablation, oral flecainide or propafenone "is reasonable", with these drugs "effective in approximately 85% to 90% of patients", and with adverse effects where "Side effects occur in up to 60% of patients, and approximately 20% discontinue the medications because of adverse effects". For those not undergoing ablation, oral sotalol or dofetilide "may be reasonable", with initiation precautions that "inpatient monitoring with serial ECGs is generally performed". If others are ineffective or contraindicated, oral amiodarone "may be considered" for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — amiodarone dosing, adverse effects, and precautions are detailed as follows: initial dosing is 400–600 mg QD in divided doses (loading dose), followed by 100–200 mg QD (maintenance dose); up to 1200 mg QD may be considered in an inpatient monitoring setting (loading dose), and up to 200 mg QD maintenance is noted. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes (rare), with additional noncardiac toxicities listed. Use with caution in sinus or AV conduction disease (in absence of pacemaker) and other listed conditions, and avoid drugs with SA and/or AV nodal–blocking properties. Interactions include the need to reduce warfarin dose by 50% and reduce digoxin dose by 30%–50%, and to avoid other QT‑prolonging drugs.

Inpatient treatment of ventricular arrhythmias after LVAD implantation — Class I and Class IIa recommendations emphasize prompt assessment and targeted interventions: Patients with new ventricular arrhythmias after LVAD implantation should be promptly evaluated for hemodynamic stability using available hemodynamic monitoring, and in patients with hemodynamic instability due to new onset ventricular arrhythmia, urgent cardioversion/defibrillation and/or anti-tachycardia pacing is recommended; patients with new ventricular arrhythmias post LVAD implantation should undergo LVAD interrogation and echocardiography to assess for the possibility of suction events. In hemodynamically stable new ventricular arrhythmia post LVAD, it is reasonable to try electrolyte optimization and intravenous antiarrhythmic therapy prior to electrical cardioversion, an ECG should be obtained to capture VT morphology, and Prolonged (> 30 minutes) VT/VF in patients on isolated LVAD support should generally be avoided regardless of hemodynamic stability. Patients with refractory, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia may require catheter ablation, and catheter ablation should be performed by an electrophysiologist with experience treating DMCS patients.

Narrow-complex tachycardias are commonly seen on shift in the emergency department. Although a portion of patients present with hemodynamic instability because of arrhythmia, it is important to know that the tachycardia can be a result of an underlying condition. Rapid identification of the type and etiology of the arrhythmia is vital to directing appropriate management strategies and disposition decisions.

ACC/AHA/HRS SVT in ACHD — medical prevention of recurrent atrial arrhythmias: Oral beta blockers or sotalol therapy can be useful for prevention of recurrent AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients. Observational evidence includes a study in adults with transposition of the great arteries and prior atrial switch repairs in which an SVT preceded ventricular tachycardia in 50% of patients and beta-blocker use was associated with decreased appropriate defibrillator shocks; sotalol reports show freedom from recurrent AT in 41% to 46% during short-term follow-up. Use of either medication in significant sinus node dysfunction may exacerbate bradycardia and requires careful monitoring, and initiation of sotalol is recommended during inpatient monitoring for proarrhythmia for 48 to 72 hours.

Physiological sinus tachycardia — definition and causes: Sinus tachycardia is regarded as physiological when it is the result of appropriate autonomic influences, such as in the setting of physical activity or emotional responses. Physiological sinus tachycardia may result from pathological causes, including infection with fever, dehydration, anemia, heart failure, and hyperthyroidism, in addition to exogenous substances, including caffeine, drugs with a beta-agonist effect (eg, albuterol, salmeterol), and illicit stimulant drugs (eg, amphetamines, cocaine). In these cases, tachycardia is expected to resolve with correction of the underlying cause.

Shared decision making in SVT — "It is important that the patient be included in clinical decision-making processes, with consideration of his/her preferences and goals for therapy, as well as his/her unique physical, psychological, and social situation". "In selected cases, personalized, self-directed interventions can be developed in partnership with the patient, such as vagal maneuvers and 'pill-in-the-pocket' drug therapy". "Shared decision making is especially important for patients with SVT", and "SVT treatment can be nuanced and requires expert knowledge of EP processes and treatment options". Options "are highly specific to the exact type of arrhythmia and can depend on certain characteristics of a particular arrhythmia (eg, whether there is pre-excitation)", so "a detailed explanation of the benefits and risks must be included in the conversation", with patients "encouraged to ask questions" and clinicians using "lay terminology" to provide "the best possible understanding of all management options in terms of risks, benefits, and potential effects on quality of life".

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline — initial tachycardia management: The initial management of any tachycardia should proceed according to published AHA advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines. Immediate cardioversion should be performed for hemodynamic instability at presentation or if it develops subsequently, and an ECG should be obtained for stable rhythms. Wide-complex tachycardias, defined by a QRS duration ≥ 0.12 s, can be due to VT, SVT with aberrancy, preexcited tachycardia, or a paced rhythm such as pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, and an irregular wide-complex tachycardia may be AF with aberrancy, preexcited AF (ie, AF using an accessory pathway for anterograde conduction), atrial flutter, or VT; a diagnosis should be established, and consultation with an arrhythmia expert considered.

ASCO guideline — infusion-related reactions (IRRs) with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy — Workup includes "Physical examination including vital signs", "Pulse oximetry", and "ECG if chest pain or sustained tachycardia". For G1 "Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated", management is "Continue ICPi" and "May consider premedication with acetaminophen and an antihistamine for subsequent infusions". For G2 where "prophylactic medication [is] indicated for ≤ 24 hours", management is to "Consider holding ICPi temporarily and/or reducing the rate of infusion to 50% (or per institutional guidelines)", "Offer symptomatic treatment with antihistamines, NSAIDs, opioids, and IV fluids as clinically appropriate", and "Offer prophylactic acetaminophen and an antihistamine per institution guidelines for subsequent infusions". For G3 "Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive…); recurrence…; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae", management is to "Hold ICPi temporarily and consider resuming, at an infusion rate of 50% (or per institutional guidelines), once return to ≤ G1", with symptomatic medications as above, "Consider antihistamines and corticosteroid medications IV", and "Hospitalization for other clinical sequelae". For G4 — "Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated" — "Permanently discontinue ICPi" and provide "ICU level inpatient care". Additional considerations state that clinicians "may consider switching to an alternate agent… upon rechallenge" or desensitization "under the supervision of an allergist".

### Is tachycardia at discharge from the pediatric emergency department a cause for concern? A Nonconcurrent cohort study [^114Avttm]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the association between discharge tachycardia and (1) emergency department (ED) and urgent care revisit and (2) receipt of clinically important intervention at the revisit.

Methods

The study included a nonconcurrent cohort of children aged 0 to younger than 19 years, discharged from 2 pediatric EDs and 4 pediatric urgent care centers in 2013. The primary exposure was discharge tachycardia (last recorded pulse rate ≥ 99th percentile for age). The main outcome was ED or urgent care revisit within 72 hours of discharge. Additional outcomes included interventions received and disposition at the revisit, prevalence of discharge tachycardia at the index visit, and associations of pain, fever, and medications with discharge tachycardia. Multivariable logistic regression determined relative risk ratios for revisit and receipt of clinically important intervention at the revisit.

Results

Of eligible visits, 126,774 were included, of which 10,470 patients (8.3%) had discharge tachycardia. Discharge tachycardia was associated with an increased risk of revisit (adjusted RR 1.3; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.5), increased risk of tachycardia at the revisit (relative risk 3.1; 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 3.7), and of the receipt of certain clinically important interventions (supplemental oxygen, respiratory medications and admission, antibiotics and admission, and peripheral intravenous line placement and admission). However, there was no increased risk for the composite outcome of receipt of any clinically important intervention or admission on revisit.

Conclusion

Discharge tachycardia is associated with an increased risk of revisit. It is likely that tachycardia at discharge is not a critical factor associated with impending physiologic deterioration.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) — definition, diagnostic features, distinctions, and management: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is defined as sinus tachycardia that is unexplained by physiological demands at rest, with minimal exertion, or during recovery from exercise and is associated with symptoms that include weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, and uncomfortable sensations, such as heart racing. Patients with IST commonly show resting heart rates > 100 bpm and average rates that are > 90 bpm in a 24-hour period. It is important to distinguish IST from secondary causes of tachycardia, including hyperthyroidism, anemia, dehydration, pain, and use of exogenous substances and drugs of abuse, and to exclude structural heart disease; anxiety is also an important trigger, and patients with IST may have associated anxiety disorders. IST must also be distinguished from other forms of tachycardia, including AT arising from the superior aspect of the crista terminalis and sinus node reentrant tachycardia; patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have predominant symptoms related to a change in posture, and treatment to suppress the sinus rate may lead to severe orthostatic hypotension. Thus, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. There are no specific recommendations for acute treatment of IST, and because the prognosis of IST is generally benign, treatment is for symptom reduction and may not be necessary.

Orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) acute treatment — Vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with orthodromic AVRT, and adenosine is beneficial for acute treatment in patients with orthodromic AVRT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVRT if vagal maneuvers or adenosine are ineffective or not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVRT when pharmacological therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with pre-excited atrial fibrillation (AF). For pre-excited AF, intravenous digoxin, intravenous amiodarone, intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, and verapamil are potentially harmful for acute treatment in patients with pre-excited AF.

### Real-world characteristics and readmissions among patients undergoing ablation for ventricular tachycardia: a retrospective database analysis of commercially insured patients in the United States [^115osR5A]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for 25% of the 17 million cardiovascular disease-related deaths annually worldwide. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a frequent cause of SCD. Management of VT is a multipronged approach which includes treatments with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD/CRT-D) and catheter ablation. Use of AADs in combination with/without ICDs is currently considered as the standard of care for the management of VT, with some limitations. AADs have not demonstrated effectiveness as primary management for VT, with the exception of beta-blockers. Additionally, AADs have limited use in the prevention of recurrent VT due to their toxicity and poor efficacy. Although ICD is considered an effective option in terminating VT episodes, and is associated with mortality reduction and improved survival among high-risk patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, the painful shocks can adversely impact patient's quality of life. Catheter ablation is an effective treatment option for VT, and has been shown in randomised multicentre trials to reduce subsequent ICD shocks and VT episodes, as well as prevent recurrences at 6 months among patients with ischaemic heart disease. Furthermore, ablation has been found to be significantly better in prolonging time to first recurrence of any VT or VF as prophylactic therapy prior to ICD placement than ICD only.

Although clinical trials and observational studies have provided evidence in favour of ablation in terms of VT outcomes, most of the studies have primarily focused on patients with ischaemic VT, with relatively little information available on outcomes associated with ablation among patients with non-ischaemic VT. The primary objective of this study was to examine the characteristics and outcomes including complications and inpatient readmissions among commercially insured patients in the United States undergoing ablation for ischaemic or non-ischaemic VT.

### Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: an ED-oriented algorithmic approach [^116iPp5U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist the clinician in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of the narrow complex tachycardia, we propose 3 separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information. The static algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions. The comparative algorithm requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared. The dynamic algorithm encourages the clinician to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism. Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either "yes" or "no" for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Junctional tachycardia — definition and related rhythm — Junctional tachycardia is a rapid, occasionally irregular, narrow-complex tachycardia with rates typically of 120 bpm to 220 bpm that arises from the atrioventricular (AV) junction, and AV dissociation (often isorhythmic) when present excludes the misdiagnosis of AVRT and makes AVNRT highly unlikely. If it is irregular, junctional tachycardia may be misdiagnosed as AF or MAT, and the mechanism for junctional tachycardia is enhanced (abnormal) automaticity from an ectopic focus in the AV junction. Junctional tachycardia is uncommon in adults; it is typically seen in infants postoperatively, after cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease; as such, there is limited evidence with regard to diagnosis and management of junctional tachycardia in adult patients. A related rhythm, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (more commonly known as accelerated AV junctional rhythm), is far more common in adults than paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, is associated with automaticity or triggered activity, occurs at a slower rate (70 bpm to 130 bpm), is often due to digoxin toxicity or myocardial infarction, and treatment of this rhythm centers on addressing the underlying condition.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

Treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) includes several options with conditional strength: A regular, structured, and progressive exercise program for patients with POTS can be effective. It is reasonable to treat patients with POTS who have short-term clinical decompensations with an acute intravenous infusion of up to 2 L of saline. Patients with POTS might be best managed with a multidisciplinary approach. The consumption of up to 2–3 L of water and 10–12 g of NaCl daily by patients with POTS may be considered. It seems reasonable to treat patients with POTS with fludrocortisone or pyridostigmine. Treatment of patients with POTS with midodrine or low-dose propranolol may be considered. It seems reasonable to treat patients with POTS who have prominent hyperadrenergic features with clonidine or alpha-methyldopa.

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^114nq5KJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing the question of whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. The identification of whether WCT has a ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatment for each is different, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences. In conclusion, although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to the management of WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

### Contemporary burden and correlates of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^114BRk63]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a large, diverse, community‐based population receiving care within an integrated healthcare delivery system, we found several combinations of diagnosis codes and care settings to have acceptable predictive value for identifying valid symptomatic, sustained PSVT episodes. We estimated a prevalence of 140 per 100 000 and an incidence of 73 per 100 000 in our study population, with notably higher burden in older people, women, those of white or black race, and those with cardiovascular disease (coronary disease or heart failure) or major cardiovascular risk factors (chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension). Furthermore, we projected that at least 393 810 Americans experience symptomatic, sustained PSVT.

We found high PPV for the specific PSVT codes (427.0 in ICD‐9 and I47.1 in ICD‐10) in the emergency department because most of these encounters included ECG confirmation of sustained regular narrow‐complex tachycardia that then reverted spontaneously or after specific treatment (eg, intravenous adenosine). The PPV of ICD‐9 code 426.7 for anomalous atrioventricular conduction was also high in the emergency department setting, where it appears to identify episodes of acute, sustained, symptomatic PSVT. Among inpatients, a primary diagnosis of PSVT also appears to have higher PPV because patients were admitted for specific treatment. A secondary diagnosis of PSVT had substantially lower PPV than a primary diagnosis in the inpatient setting. Finally, all codes for PSVT in the outpatient setting had low PPV, probably reflecting a "problem list" diagnosis of uncertain reliability rather than a specific encounter for a symptomatic arrhythmia. Codes for palpitations, atrial premature contractions, unspecific tachycardias, and other specified cardiac arrhythmias all had low PPV for identifying symptomatic PSVT in all care settings. Consequently, it is important to consider the setting of care as well as the diagnostic code for reliable identification of symptomatic PSVT episodes.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^111j5qd5]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation — wide-complex tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia (VT) differentiation is aided by obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm, and a wide-complex tachycardia (QRS duration > 120 ms) may represent either VT or a supraventricular rhythm with abnormal conduction. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation with ventricular rate faster than atrial rate or fusion complexes provides the diagnosis of VT, while concordance of precordial QRS complexes suggests VT or pre-excitation and QRS complexes identical to sinus rhythm are consistent with SVT. Because the failure to correctly identify VT can be potentially life threatening and when doubt exists it is safest to assume any wide-complex tachycardia is VT, adenosine is suggested if a wide-complex tachycardia is monomorphic, regular, and hemodynamically tolerated, because it may help convert the rhythm to sinus and may help in the diagnosis.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.

### High-dose adenosine for treatment of refractory supraventricular tachycardia in an emergency department of an academic medical center: a case report and literature review [^112q5YKG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Symptomatic tachycardia is a common admission diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). This can be a life-threatening condition and requires immediate attention. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is commonly treated with adenosine, and successful treatment is limited to atrioventricular (AV) node-dependent SVTs as adenosine causes a transient heart block. However, there are limited data available for instances when the recommended dosing regimen (6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg) fails to terminate SVT.

Case Report

A 33-year old man was evaluated in the ED with an electrocardiogram revealing a regular narrow complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 180 beats/min and a rhythm consistent with SVT. He reported experiencing 3 days of fatigue, myalgias, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion, but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. Attempts at chemical cardioversion with standard doses of adenosine (6 mg, 12 mg, and 12 mg) were given without success. After consultation with the cardiology service, additional doses of 24 mg and then 36 mg of adenosine were administered. The last dose of 36 mg produced sustained conversion and return to a normal sinus rhythm. The patient later underwent radiofrequency ablation of a left-sided orthodromic reciprocating accessory pathway. After 3 months of medical management, the patient had an implantable cardiac defibrillator placed for prevention of sudden cardiac death. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Each case of SVT demands immediate attention from an emergency physician. It is imperative that providers be aware of the limitations of adenosine and when it may be appropriate to deviate from standard dosing recommendations. This is in addition to collaborating with an expert in cardiac electrophysiology when initial management tactics are not successful.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: narrow QRS complex tachycardias [^115d6Z3Y]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Narrow QRS complex tachycardia is a common dysrhythmia in Emergency Medicine practice. Diagnosis and mechanism often can be made by 12-lead electrocardiographic (EKG) analysis but may subsequently require electrophysiologic testing. The clinical manifestations are varied and dependent upon heart rate, prior cardiac disease, and general physiologic status. Patient management is directed towards the etiology and mechanism of the dysrhythmia and includes vagal maneuvers, pharmacologic therapy, and cardioversion. Hemodynamically compromised patients must be promptly treated. Patients are often admitted to the hospital but selected patients can be safely discharged from the Emergency Department for outpatient evaluation and management. Pediatric and pregnant patients are, in general, treated the same as adults. Several case examples and EKGs are presented.

11.1.2. Medical Knowledge

A detailed understanding of cardiac anatomy is required, including the conduction system, the coronary arterial and venous systems, and anatomical variations due to underlying heart disease. Knowledge is necessary of the mechanisms and pathophysiology of VAs, with a particular focus on the relationship between these arrhythmias and acquired, inherited, or SHD; sympathetic and parasympathetic tone; and drugs. This understanding, along with proficiency in electrocardiographic interpretation, helps guide appropriate mapping and ablation approaches. In addition, knowledge of patient-specific factors such as disease type, severity, and comorbidities; procedural risks; and alternative therapies such as AADs, surgery, or device therapy should be used to guide appropriate patient selection.

11.1.3. Patient Care and Procedural Skills

A comprehensive and structured approach to the clinical evaluation and management of patients with VAs undergoing catheter ablation is necessary across all settings (inpatient and outpatient) and time points (preprocedural planning, periprocedural and intraprocedural care, and postprocedural follow-up). Trainees should demonstrate and maintain these proficiencies as pertains to their practice area of focus. A clear understanding of the various approaches and systems used (mapping, ablation, and imaging) and proficient demonstration of the skills to perform VA ablations are required. Additional advanced technical skills are needed for those seeking to perform epicardial ablations or ablations in CHD. Given patients undergoing complex VA ablations often have underlying medical conditions and comorbidities, recognition of the potential need for a multidisciplinary approach and coordination with other specialists (anesthesiologists, surgeons, interventional cardiologists, cardiologists, heart failure specialists, and/or intensivists) will ensure optimal procedural outcomes.

11.1.4. Systems-Based Practice

Complications can occur in catheter ablation procedures for VAs that can range from minimal to fatal. These can include vascular injury, thromboembolic events, cardiac tamponade, malignant VA including electrical storm, acute MI, and hemodynamic instability or collapse. A careful understanding of the potential procedural complications that might arise from either the patient's underlying medical conditions or the electrophysiology procedure itself is necessary. When appropriate, the use of a multidisciplinary team for the management of high-risk patients should be in place for prevention, prompt detection, timely intervention, and optimal management of complications. Functional systems should be in place to promptly care for patients in case of unanticipated complications.

### Keeping It "Current": a review of treatment options for the management of supraventricular tachycardia [^1125UJZG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review treatment options and updates that exist for the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed was performed including articles from 1974 to June 2023 using the terms: arrhythmias, adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, beta-blockers, amiodarone, PSVT, synchronized cardioversion, methylxanthines, dipyridamole, pediatrics, heart transplant, and pregnancy. Primary literature and guidelines were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were considered if they were available in English and conducted in humans.

Data Synthesis

PSVT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that presents as a rapid, regular tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Due to frequent emergency department (ED) visits annually with symptoms of PSVT, appropriate and efficient management of these patients is vital. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of PSVT, while also describing the literature behind nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of PSVT.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review describes new literature regarding the improved success of the modified Valsalva maneuver as a nonpharmacologic therapy in PSVT. In addition, it describes a new technique in administration of adenosine that has improved outcomes, defines dose adjustments needed for drug interactions with adenosine, compares the utilization of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with adenosine, and provides management recommendations for patients in special populations.

Conclusions

With high annual rates of ED visits for SVT, providers should be aware of the data behind management and modifications of therapy based on patient-specific factors (ie, patient preference, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, and special populations).

### Prospective arrhythmia surveillance after a COVID-19 diagnosis [^113d4FDk]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although pneumonia is the most common manifestation of COVID-19 infection, a subset of patients will also develop significant cardiovascular complications. Reports have detailed a variety of cardiac pathologies associated with COVID-19, including systolic heart failure, myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome. It is hypothesised that COVID-19 can result in myocardial injury through several pathways, including direct infection of myocardial cells, vascular inflammation, thromboembolism and virus-associated cytokine release. Hospitalised patients with evidence of myocardial damage suffer a markedly increased risk of inpatient mortality.

Both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias have also been described among patients hospitalised with acute COVID-19 infection. As these inpatients are a highly select cohort of individuals most severely affected by the disease, it is likely that indirect factors, including hypoxia, myocardial ischemia, systemic inflammation, haemodynamic instability, pharmacologic therapy and electrolyte disturbances, confound the association between infection and arrhythmia. It therefore may not be appropriate to extrapolate findings observed among the most severely ill to the much more commonly seen outpatient with COVID-19. While palpitations remain a frequent symptom among the ambulatory population of COVID-19 survivors in the convalescent stage of the disease, the correlation between these symptoms and identifiable rhythm disturbances is not well studied.

We therefore used 14-day ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to determine the prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias among outpatients after a COVID-19 diagnosis. By enrolling non-hospitalised individuals, we sought to assess the residual risk of arrhythmia after recovery from acute infection while minimising the proarrhythmic bias introduced by critical illness.

### Inpatient gamma-hydroxybutyrate detoxification: a case report describing day-to-day therapeutic management [^112MEkmd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a synthetic drug increasingly used by consumers of psychoactive substances. The sought after psychoactive effects of GHB have resulted in an increase in recreational use in Europe. GHB is considered to have a high dependence potential, and abrupt discontinuation after long-term use can result in a severe withdrawal syndrome. Despite a large number of publications related to GHB withdrawal and detoxification, to date, no evidence-based protocol or consensual international therapeutic guidelines are available (over and above the administration of benzodiazepines). We hereby present a day-to-day description of inpatient GHB detoxification management, from admission to discharge.

Case Summary

This case report pertains to a 47-year-old patient hospitalized for a severe GHB use disorder. The patient had independently made several unsuccessful attempts to stop GHB use. Following to these failures, the patient was oriented to our addiction department for inpatient detoxification. Withdrawal symptoms appeared 4hours after the last dose of GHB, and consisted of diaphoresis, coenesthetic hallucinations, tremors, motor instability, tachycardia, and a hypertensive peak. Symptoms were successfully managed with diazepam titration and nonpharmacological treatment. The duration of hospitalization was 13 days. At discharge, detoxification was complete and the patient was engaged in relapse prevention therapy. Three months after discharge, the patient had maintained abstinence.

Conclusions

GHB withdrawal, which can be severe, is better prevented or attenuated by daily medical monitoring and adjustment of treatment dosage. Failure of outpatient detoxification should be included in the indication criteria in the guidelines for inpatient detoxification.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

7 If the episodes are infrequent and self-terminating, not providing treatment is an option. 27 In hospitalized patients, intravenous adenosine may be used to abort runs of narrow complex SVT, and in those with refractory episodes, verapamil, beta blockers, or antiarrhythmics may be used. 7 Radiofrequency catheter ablation is highly effective in eliminating most accessory pathways, and is also increasingly useful for a variety of tachycardias. 14 Patients with SVT or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist. In patients with a score of 2 or more, warfarin is recommended. 8 In patients with a low CHADS 2 score in whom stroke risk is very low, 81 to 325 mg of aspirin daily is sufficient. 8 Atrioventricular nodal blocking agents may be used for rate control 8; calcium channel blockers are helpful in some patients for suppressing triggers of paroxysmal AF in the absence of structural heart disease.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation and surgical approaches, particularly in high-volume health care centers, offer increasing success in eliminating AF. 6, 19 These patients often present with a heart rate of more than 250 beats per minute, which can result in life-threatening hypotension due to decreased ventricular filling time. 19 Although medical management is sometimes used, catheter ablation is now the standard of care in patients with WPW syndrome. 6, 19 Patients with WPW syndrome who present with rapid AF and wide complex tachycardia warrant judicious treatment selection. In such patients, atrioventricular nodal blocking agents may cause degeneration of the rhythm and further hemodynamic instability, which may be recognized by careful interpretation of the ECG. Approach to the Patient Evaluation of the patient presenting with palpitations begins with a history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG. Additional testing should be guided by clinical clues.

ECG monitoring and noninvasive imaging for structural heart disease can be useful in many patients to determine the cause of palpitations and guide treatment if needed. Arrhythmic etiologies may be benign and require no further therapy; patients with sustained or hemodynamically significant arrhythmias warrant consideration for immediate referral. For noncardiac causes, treatment is addressed toward the underlying disorder.

Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are recommended for the termination of regular SVT of uncertain type, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for the termination of any hemodynamically unstable SVT. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, SVT should be treated with synchronized cardioversion when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol is recommended for control of heat rate in patients with hemodynamically stable atrial flutter and for the treatment of hemodynamically stable focal atrial tachycardia.

Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol can be useful in terminating hemodynamically stable regular SVT of uncertain type, multifocal atrial tachycardia. Clinicians should be able to recognize SVT when they detect regular narrow complex tachycardia and should know how to treat patients with SVT. Key steps in the assessment and treatment of patients with SVT are determining whether a patient is hemodynamically stable and deciding whether any symptoms reported by the patient are indeed owing to the SVT. For the termination of SVT, the guideline addressed the following interventions: vagal maneuvers, adenosine, synchronized cardioversion, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic medications, and rapid atrial pacing. The potential benefits and harms of each intervention were carefully considered.

Interventions used for the termination of SVT are generally safe as long as no contraindications exist. For example, β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers should not be given in the presence of hypotension. The 1 recommendation involving harm was related to giving digoxin, amiodarone, β-blockers, or calcium-channel blockers for pre-excited atrial fibrillation.
