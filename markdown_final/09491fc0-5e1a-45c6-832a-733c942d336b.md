## Question

Discuss the indications of statin treatment for secondary prevention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications of statin treatment for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including who qualifies, how to dose by age and tolerance, what targets to use, how to monitor, and when to add nonstatin therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the secondary prevention population and confirming the strength of evidence. Then, I should verify age-stratified intensity recommendations and how to handle intolerance. Next, I will examine LDL-C targets and the "lower is better" paradigm, including when to escalate therapy. After that, I need to check monitoring intervals and safety labs. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with shared decision-making in mind [^115GAvN8] [^115vtFC5] [^1155Rc2u].

> Let me first confirm the target population for secondary prevention. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, prior myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, ischemic stroke or TIA of atherosclerotic origin, and peripheral arterial disease presumed atherosclerotic; this is the denominator for whom statin therapy is indicated unless contraindicated, and the evidence base supporting statins in this group is strong and consistent across guidelines and meta-analyses [^115GAvN8] [^111rbJ4R] [^112yuL3E].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before moving to dosing. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same conclusion: in patients with established ASCVD, statins reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality, and the absolute benefit is greatest in those at highest risk; this is reflected in Class I, Level A recommendations for statin therapy in secondary prevention across ACC/AHA documents and in systematic reviews of international guidelines [^115GAvN8] [^111rbJ4R] [^112yuL3E].

> I will now examine age-stratified intensity for adults ≤ 75 years. High-intensity statin therapy is recommended as first-line for essentially all patients ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD unless contraindicated, with expected LDL-C reduction of about 50% or more; examples include atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and this intensity choice is supported by randomized trials and guideline synthesis showing greater event reduction with more intensive LDL-C lowering [^115GAvN8] [^115vtFC5] [^111odpo2].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach when high-intensity therapy is not tolerated. If high-intensity statins are contraindicated or cause adverse effects, moderate-intensity statins are the appropriate alternative, targeting a 30–49% LDL-C reduction; this fallback is explicitly endorsed as Class I when high-intensity is not feasible, and clinicians should document the reason for downgrading intensity for quality metrics and continuity of care [^115GAvN8] [^115vtFC5].

> Next, I should review the approach for adults older than 75 years. Initially, I thought the ACC/AHA guidance uniformly favored moderate intensity for all patients over 75, but wait, let me verify that nuance. The ACC/AHA performance measures and expert consensus allow either moderate- or high-intensity statins in patients > 75 years, with decisions individualized to expected benefit, comorbidities, frailty, drug–drug interactions, and patient preferences; importantly, if a patient > 75 is already on and tolerating a statin, it is reasonable to continue it, and intensification can be considered case-by-case [^115GAvN8] [^115vtFC5] [^113yvSgn].

> Let me consider the "lower is better" paradigm and LDL-C targets. Although ACC/AHA moved away from rigid treat-to-target in 2013, contemporary guidance and trial data support aggressive LDL-C lowering in very high-risk ASCVD, with many guidelines converging on thresholds such as LDL-C < 55 mg/dL for very high risk and < 70 mg/dL for high risk; importantly, meta-analyses show a consistent log-linear relationship between LDL-C reduction and event reduction without a clear lower bound of benefit, and PCSK9 inhibitor outcomes reinforce the value of achieving very low LDL-C levels in secondary prevention [^117J6cZm] [^117XoeLQ] [^111odpo2].

> I should double-check how to operationalize escalation. If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin in very high-risk ASCVD, adding ezetimibe is reasonable; if LDL-C remains ≥ 55 mg/dL on statin plus ezetimibe, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is supported by outcomes trials and guideline pathways, with shared decision-making given cost and injection burden; this stepwise approach is reflected in ACC expert consensus and risk-stratified recommendations for nonstatin add-on therapy [^115vtFC5] [^112SYNSK] [^117J6cZm].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. A fasting lipid panel should be checked 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change to assess adherence and percent LDL-C reduction, then every 3–12 months thereafter; liver enzymes are reasonable to obtain at baseline, with symptom-triggered rechecks rather than routine periodic testing in asymptomatic patients, and clinicians should remain vigilant for myalgias and rare myopathy, adjusting therapy as needed while maintaining LDL-C lowering to the greatest extent tolerated [^114JEvLP] [^1119L2xg] [^116NaGWq].

> But wait, what about special populations and nuances. For statin-associated symptoms, I need to ensure we distinguish true intolerance from misattribution; strategies include switching agents, lowering dose, or intermittent dosing before declaring intolerance, and in truly statin-intolerant patients, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors are evidence-based alternatives or adjuncts to maintain LDL-C lowering; for women with ASCVD, benefits are comparable to men and guideline-directed statin therapy should be applied similarly; for patients with baseline LDL-C already near goal, evidence still supports statins because risk reduction tracks with LDL-C lowering independent of starting level, so I should not withhold therapy solely due to "normal" LDL-C [^115vtFC5] [^113hUQNj] [^116TgwHy].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while I keep verifying alignment with evidence. First, identify clinical ASCVD and confirm no absolute contraindication to statins. Second, if age is ≤ 75 years, start high-intensity statin unless contraindicated; if > 75 years, individualize intensity and continue if already on and tolerated. Third, reassess lipids in 4–12 weeks and titrate to the maximally tolerated dose aiming for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction in very high risk. Fourth, if LDL-C remains above threshold (≥ 70 mg/dL high risk, ≥ 55 mg/dL very high risk), add ezetimibe; if still above threshold, add a PCSK9 inhibitor with shared decision-making. Fifth, monitor adherence and lipids every 3–12 months and address side effects proactively to avoid discontinuation, which is common and costly [^115GAvN8] [^115vtFC5] [^114JEvLP].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating primary and secondary prevention guidance. The USPSTF recommendations on statins apply to primary prevention and do not supersede the strong Class I indication for statins in secondary prevention; thus, in established ASCVD, the balance of benefits and harms overwhelmingly favors statin therapy regardless of baseline LDL-C, and under-treatment remains a major quality gap that we should actively close through systematic follow-up and patient education [^1151kqFX] [^1175oaTn] [^111rbJ4R].

Statin therapy is indicated for **all patients with established ASCVD** [^115GAvN8] for secondary prevention, including those with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease [^113yvSgn]. High-intensity statins are recommended for **adults ≤ 75 years** [^115vtFC5] unless contraindicated, with moderate-intensity statins for those > 75 years or when high-intensity therapy is not tolerated [^113yvSgn]. The goal is to achieve **LDL-C < 70 mg/dL** [^1146NCUt] or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline; if this is not achieved with maximally tolerated statins, add ezetimibe [^112SYNSK] and then a PCSK9 inhibitor [^112SYNSK]. Statins are not indicated for non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as hemorrhagic stroke or valvular heart disease [^113yvSgn].

---

## Clinical indications for statin therapy in secondary prevention

Statin therapy is indicated for patients with established ASCVD, including:

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: acute coronary syndromes (ACS), stable or unstable angina, myocardial infarction (MI), and coronary revascularization procedures (PCI or CABG) [^115GAvN8].

- **Cerebrovascular disease**: ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) of atherosclerotic origin [^111U8ELZ].

- **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**: symptomatic or asymptomatic PAD, including peripheral revascularization procedures [^111rbJ4R].

---

## Recommended statin intensity and dosing

The intensity of statin therapy is determined by patient age, cardiovascular risk, and tolerance. High-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended for **adults ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD** [^115vtFC5] unless contraindicated, aiming for an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% [^115vtFC5]. Moderate-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg) are recommended for **adults > 75 years** [^115vtFC5] or those who cannot tolerate high-intensity therapy, aiming for an LDL-C reduction of 30–49% [^115vtFC5].

---

## LDL-C targets and treatment goals

Current guidelines emphasize achieving specific LDL-C targets in secondary prevention:

| **Risk category** | **LDL-C target** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Very high risk | < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) | High-intensity statin; add ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitor if needed [^111gzTdo] [^117J6cZm] |
| High risk | < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) | High-intensity statin; add ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitor if needed [^1155Rc2u] [^112SYNSK] |
| General secondary prevention | ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline | High-intensity statin; adjust therapy if target not achieved [^115vtFC5] |

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is recommended for patients who do not achieve LDL-C targets with maximally tolerated statin therapy:

- **Ezetimibe**: Recommended as first-line add-on therapy to statins [^112SYNSK].

- **PCSK9 inhibitors**: Recommended for patients who fail to achieve LDL-C targets despite statin and ezetimibe therapy, or who are statin-intolerant [^111gzTdo].

---

## Special considerations and patient populations

- **Elderly patients**: Moderate-intensity statins are generally recommended for patients > 75 years, with individualized decision-making based on patient preference, comorbidities, and tolerance [^111WV3E3].

- **Statin intolerance**: Patients experiencing statin-associated muscle symptoms or other adverse effects may require dose adjustment, switching to a different statin, or use of alternative lipid-lowering therapies such as ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors [^112SYNSK].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Patients with diabetes and established ASCVD should receive high-intensity statin therapy unless contraindicated [^115vtFC5].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of lipid levels, liver function tests, and creatine kinase is recommended to assess treatment efficacy and safety. Lipid panels should be checked within 4–12 weeks after initiating or adjusting therapy [^114JEvLP], then every 3–12 months thereafter.

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Statin therapy is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, unexplained persistent elevations in liver enzymes, or hypersensitivity to statins. Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment, myopathy, or those taking interacting medications.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **High-intensity statins**: Recommended for adults ≤ 75 years with established ASCVD [^115vtFC5].

- **Moderate-intensity statins**: Recommended for adults > 75 years or those unable to tolerate high-intensity therapy [^115vtFC5].

- **LDL-C targets**: < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^1155Rc2u].

- **Combination therapy**: Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors recommended if LDL-C targets are not achieved with statins alone [^116NaGWq].

- **Regular monitoring**: Essential to ensure efficacy and safety [^114JEvLP].

---

Statin therapy is indicated for all patients with established ASCVD, with the goal of achieving significant LDL-C reduction to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events. The intensity of statin therapy should be individualized based on age, tolerance, and cardiovascular risk, with combination therapy considered for patients who do not achieve target LDL-C levels.

Discussion

This systematic review illustrates the variation in recommendations surrounding optimal on-statin lipid monitoring within secondary prevention. Specifically, there were considerable differences in the recommendations for cholesterol targets (including their use) and the ongoing monitoring of lipid levels over the longer term. These findings reflect the fact that no guideline identified a specifically designed randomised controlled trial to assess either treatment targets or monitoring of therapy. However, such trials are likely to be expensive, although in the future advances with electronic health records may facilitate the evidence base for this. Nonetheless, this systematic review illustrates that better evidence is needed to provide an optimal approach to lipid monitoring in order to balance safety, adherence, cost, and time burden to patients.

All guideline committees are likely to be searching a broadly similar evidence base, where the efficacy and safety of statins has been well established in the prevention of further cardiovascular events. Furthermore, the WHO recommends the use of statins as part of their secondary prevention programme, with the increased risk widely accepted within this population. It is therefore not surprising that all guidelines agree that statins should be commenced as the lipid-lowering therapy with a high level of evidence, commensurate with the availability of randomised controlled trials. Guidelines that specify drugs or doses generally recommend high dose therapy and titrating down as necessary to a tolerated dose, rather than titrating up. This is in line with large randomised controlled trials over the preceding decades that have shown that higher dose statin therapy improves outcomes. Nonetheless, despite this widespread recommendation, there is some evidence to suggest that statins are not consistently prescribed within the secondary prevention population depending on the cardiovascular events experienced. Meanwhile, recommendations for the use of other lipid-lowering therapies illustrate that such guidelines are likely a reflection of the evidence available when the guidelines were created; for example, PCSK9 inhibitors were only discussed in guidelines published after 2016. Therefore, in clinical practice, consideration may need to be given to the timing of the publication where new evidence has emerged.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^113vETxB]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### Secondary cvd prevention-lipid modification strategies: a critical analysis [^117UFNSi]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Lipid modification holds the key to effective secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However there is a controversy on whether it's all about targeting specific lipid sub fractions to a particular level or a direct effect of the agent(s) used or both. This review intends to look into these important issues from an evidence-based perspective. What is the appropriate timing of testing for lipid profile after a cardiovascular event? What is the rationale behind initiating with a high dose statin after an acute coronary event? What is the role of targeting lipid sub fractions beside LDL cholesterol? Is there any role for non-statin based therapy after an acute cardiovascular event? What constitutes a long-term lipid modification strategy in patients post CVD? These are very important questions, which needs to be addressed adequately as well as scientifically. The secondary CVD preventive strategies form a lipid perspective, which requires a thorough review.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendations for the use of statin medication, cholesterol targets and the frequency of monitoring are presented in table 3.

Summary of recommendations

Treatment recommendations

All of the guidelines presented recommendations for the treatment of the secondary prevention population, with all recommending statins as the primary therapy. Only UK/Scottish guidelines suggested the specific drug and dose, namely, atorvastatin 80 mg, with many instead recommending the maximally tolerated high-intensity doses in general, with lower doses considered when contraindications were present, or they were poorly tolerated by the patients. Few caveats were stated regarding the prescription of statins. For example, all stroke guidelines recommended statins only when the cause of the stroke was likely to be atherosclerotic, with the South African Stroke Society additionally only recommending them in the case of total cholesterol > 3.5 mmol/L, and the Australia Stroke Society only considering them appropriate when the patient's life expectancy was considered reasonable. For the secondary prevention population as a whole, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society (ESCEAS) tailored their recommendations for patients whose baseline LDL was < 1.4 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, with therapy considered rather than offered to these patients. Finally, the 2018 American Consensus (ACD) guidelines stated that the benefit–risk ratio should be considered when offering medication to patients over the age of 75 years.

Statin therapy indications — statin therapy is first-line treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (≥ 190 mg/dL), those with diabetes mellitus who are 40 to 75 years of age, and those determined to be at sufficient ASCVD risk after a clinician-patient risk discussion.

Despite a totality of evidence indicating clear benefits of statin therapy in secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a large number of additional trials are currently planned or in progress to help us better understand, treat, and prevent CVD. Both monotherapy and combination statin regimens are being studied to optimize treatment of the total patient and to assess mechanisms and benefits of various components of the total lipid profile.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^114sdCdu]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The safe and optimal treatment of plasma lipids within the secondary prevention population is key to reducing the increasing burden of CVD in society. However, given the paucity of evidence for the frequency of ongoing monitoring, there is a clear need for further research in these two key areas of its management. This will improve patient care while optimising costs in an evidence-based manner.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^1155Rc2u]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The WHO recommends that those with established cardiovascular disease should be treated with lipid-lowering therapy, but there is no specific guidance regarding lipid monitoring. Unnecessary general practitioner visits may be a burden for patients and increase healthcare costs. A systematic review of the current guidelines was performed to reveal gaps in the evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring approaches.

Methods

For this systematic review, a search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for relevant guidelines published in the 10 years prior to 31 December 2019. Recommendations surrounding the frequency of testing, lipid-lowering therapies and target cholesterol values were compared qualitatively. Each guideline was assessed using the 2009 Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool.

Results

Twenty-two guidelines were included. All recommended statins as the primary lipid-lowering therapy, with a high level of supporting evidence. Considerable variation was found in the recommendations for cholesterol targets. Seventeen guidelines provided at least one cholesterol target, which for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was < 1.8 mmol/L (n = 12). For long-term follow-up, many recommended reviewing patients annually (n = 9), although there was some variation in recommendations for the interval of between 3 and 12 months. Supporting evidence for any approach was limited, often being derived from clinical opinion.

Conclusions

Further research is required to provide an evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring of the on-statin secondary prevention population.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117MxcDT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^117XoeLQ]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

The evidence that 'lower is better' for LDL and non-HDL cholesterol in terms of secondary CVD prevention is well supported by evidence, and the recent advent of PCSK9 inhibitors further supports this notion. The issue at hand is how to use this information clinically to support a testing regimen. In this regard, the use of cholesterol targets for therapy is contentious, in part because the evidence for their use is less strong. While research has shown that achieving targets is associated with better outcomes, no specific randomised controlled trial has shown that randomising patients to a target improves adherence or event rates. Indeed, it might be argued that the maximally tolerated statin should be initiated as the default, and therefore a hard target may be moot. Clearly, other lipid-lowering medications could be added to therapy. Despite the lack of strong evidence, many guidelines recommended specific lipid targets, with many choosing similar values, suggesting that guideline committees are likely to be examining the same evidence. However, one of the most recently published guidelines, the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias (ESCEAS) advised the lowest cholesterol targets of all the included guidelines (LDL < 1.4 mmol/L), with further lower levels for those with multiple recent cardiovascular events (LDL < 1.0 mmol/L). This was rated as being supported by strong and moderate levels of evidence, although the guidelines acknowledged that both targets are based on the LDL levels achieved in the trials for PCSK9 inhibitors.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^115GAvN8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guideline recommendations for statin intensity in clinical ASCVD — High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued as first-line therapy in women and men ≤ 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, unless contraindicated, and when high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or when characteristics predisposing to statin-associated adverse effects are present, moderate-intensity statin should be used as the second option if tolerated. In individuals with clinical ASCVD > 75 years of age, it is reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and for adverse effects, drug-drug interactions and to consider patient preferences when initiating a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and it is reasonable to continue statin therapy in those who are tolerating it. Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, TIA, and peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: this statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention. Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until after a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials. Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors. The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none-all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone. Future investigation in prevention should focus on improving our ability to identify these at-risk individuals.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro / con debate [^117EghdF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

All these meta-analyses support the pleiotropic properties of statins and confirm the multifactorial mechanism of action of statins. These effects may lead to statins becoming the most important cardiovascular drugs, both in primary and secondary prevention settings.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^111rbJ4R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) performance measure denominator and evidence — The target population for the ASCVD PM includes women and men between 18 and 75 years of age who have clinical ASCVD, which includes the following: ACS, history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary (including PCI) or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or PAD, and patients with clinical ASCVD represent 1 of 4 major groups identified by the writing committee of the Cholesterol Guidelines. For these patients, treatment with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, commonly known as a statin, is clearly beneficial, and the potential for reduction of risk for ASCVD with statins in these patients clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects. Meta-analyses of individual participant data from 26 RCTs demonstrated reduction in all-cause mortality, and of the 26 RCTs included, 5 trials (39 612 subjects, all of whom had CAD) compared more versus less intensive statin regimens, with more intensive regimens producing a highly significant 15% further reduction in major vascular events. On extensive examination of clinical studies from the literature, the current clinical evidence does not support the notion that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL-C levels is beneficial or safe, whereas compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy for patients at high cardiovascular risk regardless of their LDL-C levels. The recommendation to initiate statins for secondary prevention is based on strong evidence in which benefit far exceeds risk.

Risk–benefit gradient and patient discussion — The likelihood that a patient will benefit from statin use depends on their absolute risk of having a future CVD event, the higher a person's 10-year risk of a CVD event, the greater the chance of benefit from statin use, and thus the expected benefit of statin therapy for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater exceeds the expected benefit for persons with a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10%; clinicians should discuss with patients the potential risk of having a CVD event and the expected benefits and harms of statin therapy.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114zkBRW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF assessment of magnitude of net benefit — The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for adults aged 40 to 75 years with no history of CVD and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit; with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% has at least a small net benefit and the decision to initiate therapy should depend on individual patient preference; and in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cons [^116wHW7Y]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

While recent decades have seen substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart disease remains the number one cause of death both in the United States and globally. This has led many to advocate for prescribing statins even more widely, including to patients with low risk of cardiovascular disease, based on the hypothesis that any reduction in lipid levels will eventually translate to a reduction in the development of atherosclerosis and thus to subsequent mortality. However, empirical evidence to date has not substantiated the hoped for benefits of this strategy. When healthy patients without cardiovascular disease are prescribed statins they do not live longer, and they have only a marginal reduction in the risk of ischemic events. Furthermore, statins cause numerous side effects which substantially limit their net benefit. These tradeoffs are even more lopsided in elderly patients treated for primary prevention, in whom statin therapy does not lead to a reduction in mortality or ischemic events and has the potential for significant harms. Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease should therefore avoid a focus on cholesterol levels and subsequent pharmacological therapy and should instead redouble efforts to improve the lifestyle factors that are far more consequential to the development of cardiovascular disease and overall good health.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^115pQySq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

### Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia [^111WBLSe]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of hyperlipidemia in conjunction with therapeutic lifestyle changes can be used for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins have the most convincing data for primary prevention, especially for higher risk patients. Therefore, risk stratification is essential. Statin therapy is also recommended for secondary prevention in all patients with known cardiovascular disease or the risk equivalent. High-dose statins should be initiated in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Omega-3 fatty acids may be a good alternative after myocardial infarction for patients who cannot tolerate statins. Fibrates and niacin have not been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in secondary prevention, but may be useful adjuncts when statins alone cannot adequately control lipid levels. Other cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have not been shown to consistently improve patient-oriented outcomes. There is good evidence for using statins in the secondary prevention of stroke and peripheral arterial disease.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111k11S8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### How much should LDL cholesterol be lowered in secondary prevention? Clinical efficacy and safety in the era of PCSK9 inhibitors [^116k6Jam]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a strong evidence that more marked lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) leads to progressively lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The evidence on validity of this hypothesis comes from epidemiological, genetic and clinical studies. The hypothesis "the lower the better" has been recently strongly supported by the results of secondary prevention trials with PCSK9 inhibitors. The combination of PCSK9 inhibitors and statins has resulted in achieving extremely low LDL-C levels with additional reduction of CVD events in secondary prevention. However, despite large clinical benefits, the safety of aggressive LDL-C lowering should be always taken into consideration, and there is still an ongoing discussion on whether very low LDL-C might result in some non-CVD adverse events. However, based on the available knowledge, so far the serious adverse events associated with achieving of very low LDL-C levels or intensive drug therapy have not been noted. These positive clinical effects were reflected in current ESC/EAS Guidelines (2019) for dyslipidaemia management. The experts strongly recommended the LDL-C lowering to levels that have been achieved in trials of PCSK9 inhibitors. In this state of the art review, we aimed to finally justify the critical need for LDL-C reduction to very low levels in secondary prevention patients in order to be as low as possible, as early as possible, and preferably lifelong.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — intermediate and high risk targets: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended, and in intermediate risk patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more; for patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.

### Statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116ugS9h]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely used in the evidence-based lowering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention — in individuals without documented CVD — has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

### Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: controversies and clinical considerations [^111tGkFj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

A new guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol was recently released by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), serving as an update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III cholesterol guideline first released in 2001. With significant changes to key definitions, treatment strategy, and therapy selection, the guideline has transformed the treatment of blood cholesterol and also created controversy within the health care community. This controversy is largely focused on appropriate identification and treatment of patients for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Whereas statins play an integral role in the treatment and secondary prevention of ASCVD, their use for primary prevention is less clearly defined. It is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the concepts and controversies of the new guideline recommendations for primary prevention of ASCVD and can effectively assess the risks and benefits of statin therapy in this patient population.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents.

### A comparative analysis of current Lipid Treatment guidelines: nothing stands still [^113p5GKP]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Lipid treatment guidelines have continued to evolve as new evidence emerges. We sought to review similarities and differences of 5 lipid treatment guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and U.S. Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense. All guidelines utilize rigorous evidentiary review, highlight statin therapy for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and emphasize a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, there are differences in statin intensities, use of risk estimators, treatment of specific patient subgroups, and consideration of safety concerns. Clinicians should understand these similarities and differences in current and future guideline recommendations when considering if and how to treat their patients with statin therapy.

### Coronary event secondary prevention with statins irrespective of LDL-cholesterol [^116TgwHy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for statin secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in patients with near-optimal or optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-October 2003) was conducted using the search terms HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, statins, coronary disease, post-myocardial infarction, and average cholesterol.

Data Synthesis

Secondary prevention trials enrolling subjects with near-optimal (< 130 mg/dL) or optimal (< 100 mg/dL) baseline LDL-C were included. Early statin secondary prevention studies suggested attenuated benefit, but more recent trials challenge this finding.

Conclusions

Statin secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in patients near goal LDL-C is controversial, but recent trial results show promise.

ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline — secondary measures for quality improvement in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) statin care specify that the method of reporting is the proportion or percentage of patients meeting the measure during the measurement period, and a potential measure is the proportion of patients with ASCVD on statin therapy who have had 1 or more lipid panels during the 12-mo observation period. The recommendation states that adherence to medication and lifestyle, therapeutic response to statin therapy, and safety should be regularly assessed, including a fasting lipid panel performed within 4 to 12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment, and every 3 to 12 months thereafter, with other safety measurements obtained as clinically indicated; this recommendation is rated (Class I; Level of Evidence: A).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### Evaluation of the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III algorithm for selecting candidates for statin therapy: insights from the A to Z trial [^112BLTDv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommends an algorithm to integrate iterative risk-stratification information with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to identify candidates for statin therapy. We used the Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) trial, in which all patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event in the absence of previous statin therapy, to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. Of 1,750 patients with ACS included in this analysis, 1,126 (64%) had an indication for statin therapy before enrollment and 624 (36%) did not have a statin indication before enrollment. We estimate that initiating statin therapy at moderate dosages (decreasing LDL by 1 mmol/L) according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines would have prevented approximately 15% of the ACS events leading to enrollment in the A to Z trial, whereas more intensive statin therapy (decreasing LDL by 1.5 mmol/L) would have prevented > 21% of events. Aspirin use before enrollment was reported in only 38% of subjects with a statin indication. In conclusion, these observations represent missed opportunities for primary and secondary prevention and highlight the need for assessment of patient risk and better adherence to existing prevention guidelines.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

### Continuation of statin therapy and primary prevention of nonfatal cardiovascular events [^116bCdH8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Although the beneficial effect of statins in secondary prevention of cardiac events is well established, their effectiveness in primary prevention is questionable when most evidence derives from randomized controlled trials and not "real-life" data. To evaluate the association between persistent use of statins and risk of acute nonfatal cardiovascular events in primary prevention patients in community settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 171,535 adults 45 to 75 years old with no indication of cardiovascular disease who began statin therapy from 1998 to 2009 in a large health maintenance organization in Israel. Persistence with statins was measured by the proportion of days covered with dispensed prescriptions of statins during the follow-up period. Main outcome measurements were occurrence of myocardial infarction or performance of a cardiac revascularization procedure. Incidence of acute cardiovascular events during the follow-up period (993,519 person-years) was 10.22 per 1,000 person-years. Persistence with statins was associated with a lower risk of incident cardiac events (p for trend < 0.01). The most persistent users (covered with statins for ≥ 80% of their follow-up time) had a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.62) compared to nonpersistent users (proportion of days covered < 20%). Similar results were found when analyses were limited to patients with > 5 years of follow-up. Treatment with high efficacy statins was associated with a lower risk of cardiac events. In conclusion, our large and unselected community-based study supports the results of randomized controlled trials regarding the beneficial effect of statins in the primary prevention of acute cardiac events.

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^1161rx8r]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

To date, decades of research has established LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as a causal factor in the development of atherosclerotic CVD. Statin therapy, supported by a broad evidence base, has demonstrated its superior efficacy in reducing LDL-C and subsequent cardiovascular risk. It therefore currently forms the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy as recommended by international guidelines. Statin therapy is indicated in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD, as well as genetic causes of dyslipidemia (such as familial hypercholesterolemia). Although this strategy targets those most at risk, it merely addresses those most susceptible and does not account for the fact that most cardiovascular events occur in those at moderate to low risk. In addition, there is evidence for use in primary prevention such as in those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and high risk of future atherosclerotic CVD as determined by risk prediction calculators. Risk prediction tools, however, are far from perfect and do not accurately account for those at low short-term but high lifelong risk. Considering the log-linear relationship between LDL-C reductions and reductions in risk of atherosclerotic CVD, even in those at very low risk of future events, a clinical question posed is can we and should we shift the entire risk distribution by treating everyone? The present review discusses these issues in more detail outlining arguments for and against each approach.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^111mkMLv]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

A protocol which documented the prespecified analysis and the inclusion criteria for this systematic review was first registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews on 19 June 2018 (Ref: CRD42018098582).

Literature search

A search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for all guidelines published in the ten years prior to 31 December 2019. In addition, several guideline specific databases were searched: National Guideline Clearinghouse (USA), the National Library for Health Guidelines Finder (UK), the Canadian Medical Association Clinical Practice Guidelines Infobase and Guidelines International Network International Guideline Library. Finally, an additional hand search was performed to identify the most recent versions of the guidelines identified through the systematic search. A copy of the search strategy is included in the online supplemental material.

Selection process

Papers were retained if they met the Institute of Medicine's 2011 definition of a clinical guideline, 'Clinical Practice Guidelines are statement that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options'. As the focus of this systematic review was the management of patients with established CVD, guidelines were only retained within the review if their specific management was detailed, regardless of whether they covered established CVD as a whole, or for the management of patients after a specific event, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Only the most recent version of the guidelines was retained, with any previous versions removed. Finally, included guidelines had to apply to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, produced by a professional organisation, and have the full version of the guidelines available in English.

Two reviewers (REB and JL) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the results against the eligibility criteria. The same two reviewers also performed the full-text review, where the reason for exclusion of the guidelines was also documented. In both instances, any discrepancies of opinion were resolved through discussion.

### Primary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and events with statin treatments: a network meta-analysis involving more than 65, 000 patients [^117TDX54]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Background

The role of statins is well established for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) clinical events and mortality. Little is known of their role in primary cardiovascular event prevention.

Methods

We conducted comprehensive searches of 10 electronic databases from inception to May 2008. We contacted study investigators and maintained a comprehensive bibliography of statin studies. We included randomized trials of at least 12-month duration in predominantly primary prevention populations. Two reviewers independently extracted data in duplicate. We performed random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression, calculated optimal information size, and conducted a mixed-treatment comparison analysis.

Results

We included 20 randomized clinical trials. We pooled 19 trials (n = 63,899) for all-cause mortality and found a relative risk (RR) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87 to 0.99, p = 0.03 [I(2) = 5%, 95% CI: 0% to 51%]). Eighteen trials (n = 59,469) assessed cardiovascular deaths (RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.98, p = 0.01 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 41%]). Seventeen trials (n = 53,371) found an RR of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77 to 0.95, p = 0.004 [I(2) = 61%, 95% CI: 38% to 77%]) for major cardiovascular events, and 17 trials (n = 52,976) assessed myocardial infarctions (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.95, p = 0.01 [I(2) = 59%, 95% CI: 24% to 74%]). Incidence of cancer was not elevated in 10 trials (n = 45,469) (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.11, p = 0.59 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 46%]), nor was rhabdomyolysis (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.25 to 3.83, p = 0.96 [I(2) = 0%, 95% CI: 0% to 40%]). Our analysis included a sufficient sample to reliably answer our primary outcome of CVD mortality.

Conclusions

Statins have a clear role in primary prevention of CVD mortality and major events.

### Dilemmas in secondary stroke prevention [^117Qip22]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention encompasses many approaches, including antithrombotic therapy, risk factor management, and a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations are typically based on the results of randomized clinical trials that provide evidence of benefit. However, in some situations, clinicians extrapolate the results of clinical trials into everyday practice, or trials have not provided sufficient information to make treatment decisions. This review will discuss 4 scenarios: dual-antiplatelet therapy, the perils of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulation, indications for statin therapy, and therapeutic considerations for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111CzrrQ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115tijRU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients who have had established cardiovascular diseases remain at elevated risks of recurrent cardiovascular events, leading to an increased risk of death. Therefore, secondary preventions targeting the established risk factors for this group of patients represent a high priority. For decades, statins have been regarded as the first-line drugs for lowering cholesterol levels and prevention of potential cardiovascular events. But a considerable proportion of high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients do not achieve adequate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) despite of the intensive statin therapy. According to the latest US and European guidelines, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in combination with statin and ezetimibe therapy are recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular events in these patients.

PCSK9 accelerates degradation of LDL receptors, thereby inhibiting the removal of LDL from the circulation. Thereafter, by controlling the expression of LDL receptor on the surface of hepatocytes, modulators that inhibit PCSK9 could reduce LDL-C and subsequently major cardiovascular events. This therapy may be more effective in reducing LDL-C and other atherogenic lipids in high-risk patients treated with the maximum tolerated dose of statins, as well as those who are intolerant to statins. Although there are safety concerns such as the potential risk of new-onset diabetes, several meta-analyses have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibitors showed better effects in reducing LDL-C levels and improving clinical benefits than other lipid-lowering agents for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, due to the lack of direct comparisons between different medications, the optimal agent targeting PCSK9 to reduce the risk of death after cardiovascular events remains undetermined. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of different PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events.

### 2015 ACC / AHA focused update of secondary prevention lipid performance measures: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^114fkBox]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA lipid performance measures — exceptions/exclusions review and therapy approach specify that the committee "has decided not to exclude patients with a known LDL-C level < 100 mg/dL", aligning with guidance that "do not recommend an approach of treat-to-cholesterol target but rather the use of fixed doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs (specifically statins) to reduce the risk of ASCVD", consistent with evidence "showing that ASCVD events are reduced by using maximally tolerated statins", while noting dose-escalation trials "were not true tests of defining optimal goals for LDL-C".

### An assessment by the statin diabetes safety task force: 2014 update [^117W8o15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% to 30% in primary as well as secondary prevention patients. Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes. The panel advocates following recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, or other relevant guidelines if outside the United States, for screening and diagnosis as well as lifestyle modification for prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus in those with prediabetes or other risk factors.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1153NaTP]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management were a major shift in the delineation of the main patient groups that could benefit from statin therapy and emphasized the use of higher-intensity statin therapies. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^112Keb3S]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^115KV18y]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A 2016 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

Objective

To update the 2016 review on statins for primary prevention of CVD to inform the USPSTF.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to November 2021); surveillance through May 20, 2022.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials on statins vs placebo or no statin and statin intensity in adults without prior cardiovascular events; large cohort studies on harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, composite cardiovascular outcomes, and adverse events.

Results

Twenty-six studies were included: 22 trials (N = 90 624) with 6 months to 6 years of follow-up compared statins vs placebo or no statin, 1 trial (n = 5144) compared statin intensities, and 3 observational studies (n = 417 523) reported harms. Statins were significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98]; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.35% [95% CI, -0.57% to -0.14%]), stroke (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.90]; ARD, -0.39% [95% CI, -0.54% to -0.25%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.75]; ARD, -0.85% [95% CI, -1.22% to -0.47%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.81]; ARD, -1.28% [95% CI, -1.61% to -0.95%]); the association with cardiovascular mortality was not statistically significant (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.02]; ARD, -0.13%). Relative benefits were consistent in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics, although data for persons older than 75 years were sparse. Statin therapy was not significantly associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.01]), myalgias (RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.11]), or elevated alanine aminotransferase level (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13]). Statin therapy was not significantly associated with increased diabetes risk overall (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.19]), although 1 trial found high-intensity statin therapy was significantly associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). Otherwise, there were no clear differences in outcomes based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy for primary prevention of CVD was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and CVD events. Benefits of statin therapy appear to be present across diverse demographic and clinical populations, with consistent relative benefits in groups defined by demographic and clinical characteristics.

### 2017 focused update of the 2016 ACC Expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on expert consensus decision pathways [^115Da8wV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology published the first expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) on the role of non-statin therapies for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Since the publication of that document, additional evidence and perspectives have emerged from randomized clinical trials and other sources, particularly considering the longer-term efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in secondary prevention of ASCVD. Most notably, the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial and SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events), assessing evolocumab and bococizumab, respectively, have published final results of cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with clinical ASCVD and in a smaller number of high-risk primary prevention patients. In addition, further evidence on the types of patients most likely to benefit from the use of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome has been published. Based on results from these important analyses, the ECDP writing committee judged that it would be desirable to provide a focused update to help guide clinicians more clearly on decision making regarding the use of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities. In the following summary table, changes from the 2016 ECDP to the 2017 ECDP Focused Update are highlighted, and a brief rationale is provided. The content of the full document has been changed accordingly, with more extensive and detailed guidance regarding decision making provided both in the text and in the updated algorithms. Revised recommendations are provided for patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities on statin therapy for secondary prevention. The ECDP writing committee judged that these new data did not warrant changes to the decision pathways and algorithms regarding the use of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in primary prevention patients with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL with or without diabetes mellitus or patients without ASCVD and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL not due to secondary causes. Based on feedback and further deliberation, the ECDP writing committee down-graded recommendations regarding bile acid sequestrant use, recommending bile acid sequestrants only as optional secondary agents for consideration in patients intolerant to ezetimibe. For clarification, the writing committee has also included new information on diagnostic categories of heterozygous and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, based on clinical criteria with and without genetic testing. Other changes to the original document were kept to a minimum to provide consistent guidance to clinicians, unless there was a compelling reason or new evidence, in which case justification is provided.

Practice considerations — patient population under consideration specifies that these recommendations apply to adults 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not have signs and symptoms of CVD, do not apply to adults with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L) or known familial hypercholesterolemia, and note that these populations are at very high risk for CVD.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111QWr6D]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^111yBric]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality worldwide. More than 80% of the overall CVD death occurs in older people (aged ≥ 65 years). In 2015, people aged ≥ 65 years represented 8.5% (617.1 million) of the global population (7.3 billion). In 2030, this percentage is projected to reach 12% (1 billion) of the world population. In Europe, it is projected that almost 25% of its population will be aged ≥ 65 years by 2030, higher than any of the other continents. Therefore, efforts at the prevention of CVD in older people are important and will influence global healthcare policies.

The consideration of statins for primary CVD prevention in older people represents a dilemma in clinical practice unlike the secondary prevention, which is well-established and supported by a level (A) evidence, according to the most recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines. Current evidence on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in older people (especially those aged > 75 years) is still lacking. Statin therapy for primary prevention in people aged > 75 years (at high risk) was supported by level (B) evidence and considered as a class IIb recommendation in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines on dyslipidemias. The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines advocate statins for primary prevention in older people aged ≤ 75 years (i.e. 65 to 75 years) as a class I recommendation, which is unlike the 2016 guidelines with a class ΙΙa recommendation and level (B) evidence. This change in recommendation class was based on an individual participant level-meta-analysis from 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by the "Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration" that reported a significant 39% proportional reduction [rate ratio (RR) 0.61; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.73] in major vascular events for every 1 mmol/L drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by statins (or more intensive statin therapy) in participants without vascular disease, aged > 65 and ≤ 70 years. This beneficial effect of statins was statistically insignificant for primary prevention in participants aged > 70 years.

### Effectiveness of statins as primary prevention in people with different cardiovascular risk: a population-based cohort study [^114ZfXdR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Study Highlights

New guidelines to manage dyslipidemia recommend individualized prevention measures to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and focus on two benefit groups: first, secondary prevention patients, diabetics, and patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking) or with chronic kidney disease; and second, individuals with 10‐year cardiovascular risk estimates. 1, 2, 3, 4 These guidelines have lowered the estimated 10‐year cardiovascular risk threshold to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. In primary prevention, European guidelines recommend treatment in individuals with 5% or higher risk on the SCORE 10‐year fatal cardiovascular risk chart and in those with low (< 5%) risk and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels between 2.6 and 4 mmol/L. 4 US guidelines recommend treatment for individuals aged 40–75 years with 10‐year risk scores 7.5%; each guide, however, with different levels of evidence. 1, 2 In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suggests statin treatment in primary prevention for people with 10% risk. 3 The definition of high cardiovascular risk varies across guidelines and depends on the risk function used, the endpoints considered, the reference population, and the presence of comorbidities. These recommendations are based on the results from previous meta‐analyses 5, 6 and recent clinical trials, 7 which show that the efficacy of statins is similar in high and intermediate cardiovascular risk populations.

These threshold recommendations are controversial for several reasons. First, the population eligible for lifetime statin therapy would increase substantially. Second, the focus is on relative rather than absolute risk reduction. 8, 9, 10 Finally, the randomization of the clinical trials upon which the guidelines are based did not take baseline cardiovascular risk into account.

As participants in clinical trials may not represent the general population because specific groups (statin‐intolerant or poorly adherent, diabetics, women, young people) are often excluded, 11 data from electronic medical records can be used to provide population‐based evidence for cardiovascular risk management decisions and to evaluate treatment effectiveness in real‐life clinical conditions. 12

The aim of the present study was to analyze the effectiveness of statins in a general population according to their coronary risk estimation.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1148dNK8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD) is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease. The case for primary prevention, however, is less clear.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Strategy

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007) and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of statins with minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD, were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.

Main Results

Fourteen randomised control trials (16 trial arms; 34,272 participants) were included. Eleven trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Benefits were also seen in the reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83). Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no clear evidence of any significant harm caused by statin prescription or of effects on patient quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Although reductions in all-cause mortality, composite endpoints and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events, there was evidence of selective reporting of outcomes, failure to report adverse events and inclusion of people with cardiovascular disease. Only limited evidence showed that primary prevention with statins may be cost effective and improve patient quality of life. Caution should be taken in prescribing statins for primary prevention among people at low cardiovascular risk.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^1119L2xg]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

ACC nonstatin therapy — assumptions and target patient groups specify that algorithms begin with four management groups and statin use: "Adults aged ≥ 20 years with clinical ASCVD on statin therapy for secondary prevention"; "Adults aged ≥ 20 years with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (not due to secondary modifiable causes) on statin therapy for primary prevention"; "Adults aged 40–75 years without ASCVD, but with diabetes and LDL-C < 190 mg/dL, on statin therapy for primary prevention"; and "Adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes, with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD ≥ 7.5%, on statin therapy for primary prevention", and further that "the patient is currently taking the maximally tolerated dose of statin therapy or has attempted to take statin therapy" while clinician and patient decide "whether additional therapy is needed to further reduce ASCVD risk".

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^111TVtRA]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Individual randomised trials of statin therapy have previously reported significant cardiovascular risk reductions among participants older than 65 years but younger than 70 years at the time of randomisation (who were therefore aged > 70–75 years at the end of a median of 5 years of scheduled treatment). Meta-analyses among older people have consistently reported evidence for beneficial effects in secondary prevention, but the evidence has been less clear for primary prevention. Availability of individual participant data in the CTT Collaboration database has permitted more detailed assessment of the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

In our meta-analysis of data from 28 trials among 186 854 people (with 14 483 [8%] older than 75 years at randomisation), we found slightly smaller proportional risk reductions in major vascular events (p trend = 0.06) and vascular deaths (p trend = 0.004) with increasing age. The exclusion criteria for 24 trials incorporated at least one of the following: a history of heart failure, poor ejection fraction, poor prognosis (other than from atherosclerotic disease), or the requirement for renal dialysis. However, two trials exclusively enrolled patients with moderate to severe (New York Heart Association Class II–IV) heart failure, and two exclusively enrolled patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Statin therapy has not been found to reduce the risk of major vascular events or vascular deaths in either of these patient populations, and consequently is not recommended for such patients in the absence of other indications. Therefore, we did exploratory analyses that excluded these four trials, to assess their contribution to the observed trends towards smaller relative reductions with increasing age. Among people without heart or renal failure, we found little evidence of any diminution of benefit with increasing age on major vascular events (p trend = 0.3) or on vascular death (p trend = 0.2).

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: pros [^1123QQkc]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

The initiation of statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains a debated subject, despite decades worth of clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy, effectiveness, and safety. Statin therapy, in addition to blood pressure-lowering drugs and efforts to reduce cigarette smoking, was a key component of the preventive cardiology renaissance that achieved a dramatic reduction in ASCVD-related mortality from the 1950s to 2010. However, deaths attributable to ASCVD have increased by approximately 13% in recent years, which are in part driven by incomplete treatment of risk factor burden starting in youth. Statins are a cornerstone of preventive cardiology practice, not only due to their lipid-lowering properties, but also in part due to their ability to exert pleiotropic effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability which reduces the likelihood of atherothrombotic clinical events. While the benefit of statin therapy undoubtedly depends on the presence and degree of atherosclerotic plaque burden, a broader statin allocation strategy on a population-based level should be considered especially in younger communities that are disproportionately affected by ASCVD risk factors. Thus, the era of precision medicine must be balanced with a pragmatic, cost-effective approach that maximizes ASCVD prevention across the life course. Herein, we examine the pros of statin pharmacotherapy in primary prevention while examining over three decades worth of basic science, translational, and clinical research in the setting of clinical practice guidelines.

### Statins for prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^113RwmeF]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, may be potentially preventable with statin therapy.

Objective

To systematically review benefits and harms of statins for prevention of CVD to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1991), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 2005) to June 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of statins vs placebo, fixed-dose vs titrated statins, and higher- vs lower-intensity statins in adults without prior cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, CVD-related morbidity or mortality, and harms.

Results

Nineteen trials (n = 71 344 participants [range, 95–17 802]; mean age, 51–66 years) compared statins vs placebo or no statin. Statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.40% [95% CI, -0.64% to -0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I2 = 54%; ARD, -0.43% [95% CI, -0.75% to -0.11%]), stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]; I2 = 0; ARD, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.53% to -0.23%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]; I2 = 0%; ARD, -0.81% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.43%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]; I2 = 36%; ARD, -1.39% [95% CI, -1.79 to -0.99%]). Relative benefits appeared consistent in demographic and clinical subgroups, including populations without marked hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level < 200 mg/dL); absolute benefits were higher in subgroups at higher baseline risk. Statins were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04]), myalgias (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), or liver-related harms (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35]). In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of diabetes (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]), although statistical heterogeneity was present (I2 = 52%), and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there were no clear differences based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117J6cZm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk on statin therapy for secondary prevention — LDL-C thresholds and nonstatin considerations: Adults with clinical ASCVD at very high risk should be treated first at the maximally tolerated statin intensity. If patients have achieved ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non–HDL-C < 85 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue statin therapy and monitor adherence and LDL-C response. In view of trial evidence and very low LDL-C levels achieved with nonstatin therapies, a lower LDL-C threshold of LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≤ 85 mg/dL) is recommended by the writing committee, and preference should be given to therapies with demonstrated cardiovascular outcomes benefits. Individuals who achieve LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL experience lower event rates than those with higher LDL-C, there appears to be no LDL-C level below which benefit ceases, and lifelong very low LDL-C levels in the range of 15–30 mg/dL are associated with a lower incidence of ASCVD without adverse effects.

### How do we achieve optimal cardiovascular risk reduction? [^115PGbQB]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Optimizing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction requires the application of clinical evidence to patient care, as well as the refinement of risk assessment. Clinical evidence indicates that most patients are not treated to optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. Despite the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the incidence of CHD, many treated patients still experience CHD events. Targeting other lipid factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides may augment the risk reduction achieved by lowering LDL cholesterol. Refined global risk assessment can lead to more accurate determinations of absolute risk and to the identification both of high-risk patients needing aggressive intervention and intermediate-risk patients who appear to be at low risk. Previous global risk assessment measures failed to identify a substantial proportion of primary prevention patients who would benefit from therapy. However, revised guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program introduce new criteria for more precise risk assessment and advocate use of the Framingham scoring system to calculate absolute risk. Although intensified treatment is recommended for high-risk patients, cost considerations may limit drug therapy for some lower-risk individuals.

Statin therapy evidence and FDA dosing cautions — boldface type indicates specific statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and italic type indicates statins and doses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but not tested in the RCTs reviewed; across these studies and the Cholesterol Treatment Trialsists 2010 meta-analysis, all RCTs demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Individual responses to statin therapy varied, with evidence from 1 RCT only supporting down-titration if unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg in the IDEAL study, and although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Are we aggressive enough in lowering cholesterol? [^1171w2Ha]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

To date, 5 major randomized, placebo-controlled statin trials — the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial, Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease, and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study — have convincingly shown that total mortality and major coronary events can be significantly reduced by lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy. These results were achieved in a broad range of patients including those with and without a history of coronary artery disease and with elevated or average LDL-C levels. The results also support the large body of epidemiologic evidence demonstrating that the lower the cholesterol level, the lower the cardiovascular risk. Evidence now substantially supports the urgency of physicians to aggressively target the lowering of LDL-C levels for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^117SzPjZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112ctU9U]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Other major guideline documents — older patients: The 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline includes different treatment regimens for individuals > 75 years of age compared to younger persons, recommending moderate intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in those > 75 years versus high intensity in younger individuals, using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equations and provider–patient discussion for primary prevention without a specific intensity recommendation for those > 75 years. The International Atherosclerosis Society recommends for persons > 65 years the use of short-term (10-year) Framingham risk scoring (recalibrated for country) to estimate CHD risk and elevation of the estimated value by 1/3 to estimate total ASCVD risk, suggesting statins for moderately-high or high estimated risk while considering polypharmacy, drug–drug interactions, and cost. The European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology advocate secondary prevention in the same manner as in younger patients (class I, level of evidence B), starting at low dosage and titrating to the same targets (class I, level of evidence C), and recommend primary prevention for those with 1 or more additional risk factors aside from age (class IIb, level of evidence B). The Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends statins without specific upper age cutoffs for secondary prevention and, for primary prevention, 10-year Framingham scoring for men ages 40–75 years and for women ages 50–75 years.

### Effect of statins and non-statin LDL-lowering medications on cardiovascular outcomes in secondary prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111odpo2]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Current evidence on dyslipidaemia management has expanded to novel treatments and very low achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We sought to compare the clinical impact of more-intensive vs. less-intensive LDL-C lowering by means of statins and currently recommended non-statin medications in secondary prevention.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for randomized controlled trials of statins, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, or bile acid sequestrants with > 500 patients followed for ≥ 1year. We employed random-effects models using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare outcomes. We included 19 trials (15 of statins, 3 of PCSK9 inhibitors, and 1 of ezetimibe) with 152507 patients randomly assigned to more-intensive (n = 76678) or less-intensive treatment (n = 75829). More-intensive treatment was associated with 19% relative risk reduction for the primary outcome, major vascular events (MVEs; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77–0.86). Risk reduction was greater across higher baseline levels and greater achieved reductions of LDL-C. The clinical benefit was significant across varying types of more-intensive treatment and was consistent for statins (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.86) and non-statin agents (PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94) as active (more-intensive) intervention (P-interaction = 0.38). Each 1.0mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated with 19% relative decrease in MVE. Death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization also favoured more-intensive treatment.

Conclusion

Reduction of MVE is proportional to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering across a broad spectrum of on-treatment levels in secondary prevention. Statin intensification and add-on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe are associated with significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity in this very high-risk population.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^115btkts]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors for the treatment of dyslipidemia. However, evidence of the optimal PCSK9 agents targeting PCSK9 for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events is lacking. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the benefit and safety of different types of PCSK9 inhibitors.

Methods

Several databases including Cochrane Central, Ovid Medline, and Ovid Embase were searched from inception until March 30, 2022 without language restriction. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing administration of PCSK9 inhibitors with placebo or ezetimibe for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with statin-background therapy were identified. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. The primary safety outcome was serious adverse events.

Results

Overall, nine trials totaling 54,311 patients were identified. Three types of PCSK9 inhibitors were evaluated. The use of alirocumab was associated with reductions in all-cause mortality compared with control (RR 0.83, 95% CrI 0.72–0.95). Moreover, evolocumab was associated with increased all-cause mortality compared with alirocumab (RR 1.26, 95% CrI 1.04–1.52). We also found alirocumab was associated with decreased risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CrI 0.90–0.99).

Conclusions

In consideration of the fact that both PCSK9 monoclonal antibody and inclisiran enable patients to achieve recommended LDL-C target, the findings in this meta-analysis suggest that alirocumab might provide the optimal benefits regarding all-cause mortality with relatively lower SAE risks, and evolocumab might provide the optimal benefits regarding myocardial infarction for secondary prevention in patients with high-risk of cardiovascular events. Further head-to-head trials with longer follow-up and high methodologic quality are warranted to help inform subsequent guidelines for the management of these patients.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

In adults with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

Current Practice

Most guidelines emphasise LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, to achieve these goals in very high risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible, so physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention, nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms and potential treatment burdens.

Recommendations

The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but recommends against adding it in people at low cardiovascular risk. For adults who are intolerant to statins, the panel recommends using a lipid-lowering drug in people at very high and high cardiovascular risk but against adding it in those at low cardiovascular risk. When choosing to add another lipid-lowering drug, the panel suggests ezetimibe in preference to PCSK9 inhibitors. The panel suggests further adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to ezetimibe for adults already taking statins at very high risk and those at very high and high risk who are intolerant to statins.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel identified four risk groups of patients (low, moderate, high, and very high cardiovascular risk) and primarily applied an individual patient perspective in moving from evidence to recommendations, though societal issues were a secondary consideration. The panel considered the balance of benefits and harms and burdens of starting a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe, making assumptions of adults' average values and preferences. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids accompany multi-layered recommendations, developed in an online authoring and publication platform (www.magicapp.org) that also allows re-use and adaptation.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (14 trials including 83660 participants) of benefits found that PCSK9 inhibitors or ezetimibe probably reduce myocardial infarctions and stroke in patients with very high and high cardiovascular risk, with no impact on mortality (moderate to high certainty evidence), but not in those with moderate and low cardiovascular risk. PCSK9 inhibitors may have similar effects to ezetimibe on reducing non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke (low certainty evidence). These relative benefits were consistent, but their absolute magnitude varied based on cardiovascular risk in individual patients (for example, for 1000 people treated with PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins over five years, benefits ranged from 2 fewer strokes in the lowest risk to 21 fewer in the highest risk). Two systematic reviews on harms found no important adverse events for these drugs (moderate to high certainty evidence). PCSK9 inhibitors require injections that sometimes result in injection site reactions (best estimate 15 more per 1000 in a 5 year timeframe), representing a burden and harm that may matter to patients. The MATCH-IT decision support tool allows you to interact with the evidence and your patients across the alternative options: https://magicevidence.org/match-it/220504dist-lipid-lowering-drugs/.

Understanding The Recommendations

The stratification into four cardiovascular risk groups means that, to use the recommendations, physicians need to identify their patient's risk first. We therefore suggest, specific to various geographical regions, using some reliable risk calculators that estimate patients' cardiovascular risk based on a mix of known risk factors. The largely weak recommendations concerning the addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors reflect what the panel considered to be a close balance between small reductions in stroke and myocardial infarctions weighed against the burdens and limited harms. Because of the anticipated large variability of patients' values and preferences, well informed choices warrant shared decision making. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids linked to the recommendations can facilitate such shared decisions. The strong recommendations against adding another drug in people at low cardiovascular risk reflect what the panel considered to be a burden without important benefits. The strong recommendation for adding either ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors in people at high and very high cardiovascular risk reflect a clear benefit. The panel recognised the key uncertainty in the evidence concerning patient values and preferences, namely that what most people consider important reductions in cardiovascular risks, weighed against burdens and harms, remains unclear. Finally, availability and costs will influence decisions when healthcare systems, clinicians, or people consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

Brief review of cholesterol guidelines

The management of hypercholesterolemia has undergone significant evolution since the first major U.S. national cholesterol guidelines were introduced in 1988. This progress has been driven by the advent of statin therapy and numerous clinical trials demonstrating substantial reductions in cardiovascular events. A brief review of the most recent international guidelines is essential. These include the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) multisociety guidelines, with subsequent updates reflected in the 2021 and 2022 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) on hypertriglyceridemiaand nonstatin therapies, respectively; the 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines; and the 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines. Table 2, provides an overview of the guidelines.

Table 2
Comparison of Recent International Cholesterol Statements

Two of the most significant differences across these guidelines are the approach to risk classification and treatment.

The AHA/ACC and CCS guidelines make an initial distinction between primary and secondary prevention; the AHA/ACC guidelines also separately provide recommendations for those with diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL). In contrast, the ESC guidelines delineate patients from those with established ASCVD to those with low-calculate 10-year risk; however the guideline does make note of primary and secondary prevention in discussions of treatment.

In regard to treatment and nonstatin use, the ESC overall is more aggressive in LDL-C treatment thresholds and recommends LDL-C ≤ 55 mg/dL for all secondary and very-high-risk primary prevention patients. In contrast, the AHA/ACA guidelines reserve this for very-high-risk secondary prevention patients. Similarly, treating to LDL-C ≤ 70 mg/dL is recommended for a wide group of patients in ESC guidance.

In terms of therapeutic options, the biggest divergence is on the use of PCSK9 inhibitors. These are recommended for secondary and select primary prevention patients in ESC guidelinesalthough it is noteworthy that evidence of benefit in nonsecondary prevention and non-FH patients is lacking although clinical trials are ongoing. In contrast, use is limited in the ACC ECDP to secondary-prevention patients and those with likely FH.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^113hUQNj]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Secondary ASCVD prevention in women — statin therapy: In patients with a definite history of ASCVD, proportional risk reductions with statins were similar in women and men (heterogeneity unadjusted P = 0.098, adjusted P = 0.431). For each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, statins reduced major vascular events by about 20%, major coronary events by 25%, coronary revascularizations by 25%, and ischemic stroke by just under 20%. In a meta-analysis including 40,275 women, benefit was more pronounced in secondary prevention (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.72–0.91; P < .0001) than primary prevention (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.75–0.98; p = 0.0209), though the interaction was not significant (P for interaction = .3397). Women also had significant reductions in stroke (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.55–0.99; p = 0.0396) and CHD events (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.67–0.94; p = 0.0090), and all-cause mortality showed no significant interaction by gender (P for interaction = .4457). Consistent evidence indicates a statistically significant benefit at all levels of risk in women, and statin therapy should be a consideration for patients at very high risk of either gender.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112UD3pm]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Candidates for statin combination therapy — indications and decision factors: More intensive atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be indicated in high or very high risk patients with a less-than-desirable response to moderate or high intensity statin therapy; in patients who have recurrent ASCVD events or progressive atherosclerotic vascular symptoms in spite of high intensity statin therapy; in patients with FH, especially with ASCVD or poorly controlled non-lipid risk factors and less than optimal non-HDL-C or LDL-C levels; and in patients after acute coronary syndromes on at least moderate intensity statin therapy. Generally, if a patient in the categories above at high or very high ASCVD risk is not at non-HDL-C and LDL-C goals, strong consideration should be given to statin combination therapy (i.e., a statin with an additional lipid-altering agent). Clinical ASCVD event benefits of combination therapy were demonstrated in a recent clinical trial of ezetimibe added to statin therapy and with investigational PCSK9 inhibitors added to statin therapy. The clinician should determine whether statin combination therapies are indicated based on re-evaluation of the patient's risk factor status and quantitative risk scoring, reconsideration of the nature of the patient's history of vascular events, reconsideration of possible genetic dyslipidemias, examination of affordability and polypharmacy risks, and consideration of the patient's preferences.

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^111WV3E3]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

ACC/AHA statin therapy performance measure for chronic stable coronary artery disease defines the "Percentage of patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were offered moderate- to high-intensity statin", with a numerator including those who "Have been offered* high-intensity statin†" or "Have been offered* moderate-intensity statin† and have documentation of a medical reason for not prescribing high-intensity statin". A statin is "offered" if it is prescribed or if a patient reason exception is documented. The denominator is "All patients 18–75 y of age with CAD who were seen within a 12-mo period", with "Denominator Exclusions: None" and "Denominator Exceptions: Documentation of medical reason(s) for not prescribing a statin (e.g., allergy, intolerance to statin(s), other medical reasons)". The period of assessment is "12 mo", attribution is "Clinician practices caring for patients with CAD", and "Moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin doses are defined in Table 5 of the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults (5)".

Summary of recommendations for lipid management from the 2015 NLA Expert Panel on older patients — secondary and very high risk prevention (ASCVD or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end organ damage) recommends consideration of moderate or high intensity statin therapy for those individuals age ≥ 65 to ≤ 75 years of age with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus; secondary prevention patients who are > 75 to < 80 years of age may be treated with similar regimens after a careful consideration of the risk-benefit ratio; in those ≥ 80 years of age, moderate intensity statin therapy should be considered based upon provider–patient discussion including drug–drug interactions, polypharmacy, concomitant medical conditions including frailty, cost considerations and patient preference; combination therapy evidence from IMPROVE-IT indicates individuals (mean age 64 years) with acute coronary syndrome were more likely to benefit from simvastatin–ezetimibe than simvastatin alone, and in those older than age 65 years the ASCVD event rate was 34.6% vs 39.9% with an absolute risk reduction of 3.5%.

Data extraction

Data extraction was performed initially by one reviewer (REB) with accuracy checked by a second reviewer (JL). Data extracted included the target population, the publishing society, the country or region the guideline applied to and the year it was published. Recommendations specifically for the secondary prevention population surrounding the frequency that plasma lipid monitoring should be performed, therapies that should be used, and any lipid target values were also extracted if given within the guideline. The strength and the level of evidence of each recommendation were also extracted. Once extracted, the recommendations were compared by all authors.

Quality assessment

The quality of the development processes of each of these guidelines was then assessed using the 2009 Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool by two reviewers (REB and JL). The AGREE II tool consists of 23 questions covering six domains (Scope and Purpose, Stakeholder Involvement, Rigour of Development, Clarity of Presentation, Applicability, and Editorial Independence) and an overall assessment of the quality of the guideline. Each of the items, including the overall quality assessment, is scored on a seven-point scale (1, Strongly Disagree; 7, Strongly Agree), with scaled domain scores then calculated. As the AGREE II tool does not facilitate an aggregated score across the domains nor a specific cut point for high or low quality, scores for all domains are presented.

### Life-saving medications: the urgent need for guideline adherence and patient acceptance [^1175oaTn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Slightly over half of the patients had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), while the others were primary prevention patients with an indication for statin therapy. Over one quarter of patients reported they were not on treatment, which included 566 secondary prevention patients. Most concerning, of the 894 patients who were never offered a statin, 30% had ASCVD. Clinical practice guidelines clearly state that high‐intensity statin therapy is a Class 1 recommendation for patients with clinical ASCVD since statins reduce major vascular events and cardiovascular mortality. 2, 3, 4 Furthermore, more intensive low density lipoprotein cholesterol‐lowering is associated with a greater reduction in risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, particularly in trials of patients with higher baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 5

A purpose of clinical practice guidelines is to synthesize the best available evidence to support clinical decision making, which improves quality of care, patient outcomes, and provides the most cost‐effective care. However, guideline publication does not guarantee guideline implementation and clinician adherence. A recent study 6 examined trends in the use of moderate‐ and high‐intensity statins before and after publication of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline in 161 cardiology practices in the PINNACLE (Practice Innovation And Clinical Excellence) registry. The postpublication period was from February 2014 to April 2015. Unfortunately, even in cardiology practices where 97% of patients had ASCVD, only two thirds of patients were treated with moderate‐ to high‐intensity statin therapy before the 2013 guideline publication (62.1%), and this improved only modestly postpublication (66.6%). The results observed in the PALM registry were somewhat more encouraging since 73% of eligible patients were currently on statin therapy among practices that also included primary care and endocrinology.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^116VZyqu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115FsguN]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — management of primary severe hypercholesterolemia notes that patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]) have a high risk of ASCVD and premature and recurrent coronary events, and although no randomized, placebo-controlled trials have been done exclusively in this group, a placebo-controlled primary-prevention study in men with mean baseline LDL-C of 192 ± 17 mg/dL showed reduced MI and cardiovascular death with pravastatin 40 mg daily. These findings were extended in a post hoc analysis of 2,560 exclusively primary-prevention subjects and in a 20-year observational post-trial long-term follow-up study, and maximally tolerated statin therapy should be administered to patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Statins and LDL-C in secondary prevention-so much progress, so far to Go… [^116aLHq6]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Elevated circulating concentrations of low-density lipoproteins have been definitively demonstrated to be a cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Increasing recognition is given to the importance of reducing lifetime exposure to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1 according to the rule of "the lower the better, " but also "the earlier the better" and "the longer the better". Statin therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events by approximately a quarter for each reduction in low-density lipoprotein level of 38. 6 mg/dL, and long-term LDL-C reduction might even be associated with a reduction of cardiovascular mortality by 50% to 55%. The largest absolute benefits of statin therapy occur in individuals at the greatest risk, such as those who have already experienced an ASCVD event. 2 Taken together, these facts might lead us to expect near-universal coverage of statin therapy in the secondary prevention of ASCVD.

However, Yao and colleagues3 shed light on how and why this is not the case in an actual setting. Their 10-year retrospective cohort study using administrative data from 2007–2016 in the US demonstrated increases in the proportion of secondary prevention patients receiving statins and high-intensity statins during the study period. The proportion of patients adherent to statin therapy also increased, from 58. 7% to
70. 5%. It is especially true after the publication of the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society 2019 lipid guidelines, which decreased the LDL-C target to less than 55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients, and which defined patients with extremely high cardiovascular disease risk as. those with a second vascular event within 2 years while receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, and recommended an LDL-C goal of less than 40 mg/dL.

4 This target is unlikely to be achieved without good adherence to maximally tolerated statin therapy, and recent data suggest that the goal. of less than 55 mg/dL is achieved in only 18% of patients. 5 Thus, to meet these targets, experts have recently proposed initial combination therapy with statins and ezetimibe, or triple therapy with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, especially for patients with high baseline LDL-C levels and for those at extreme cardiovascular disease risk with the precise definition of this risk group. 4, 6, 7. Of particular concern was the finding by Yao and colleagues3 that women and ethnic minorities were less likely to receive and adhere to statins. The reasons for these discrepancies need to be explored and addressed as a matter of priority. Cost is probably not a major contributor to these differences.

The study included only privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients, which limits the eternal validity of the work but reduces the potential for confounding by expense. 3 In any event, the availability of generic statins led to reductions in the cost of statin therapy during the course of the study, which were far more significant than the corresponding increase in statin use. The same phenomenon has been noted with generic ezetimibe; despite that the cost decreased substantially 3 years ago, it is used by only 15% to 20% of patients with indications for combination therapy. Could different susceptibilities to statin nonadherence/intolerance explain the differences in the extent of statin use. This question cannot easily be answered from an administrative data set; however, it is clear that further research is needed to determine the risk factors for statin intolerance and how these can be addressed.

### Dyslipidemia management for cardiovascular disease… [^113kNSbh]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In primary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended when treatment is indicated.
- In secondary prevention, moderate-dose statins are recommended with intensification by increasing statin dose, adding ezetimibe, or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in higher-risk patients.
- Because cholesterol values are stable over 10 years, new measurements are not needed for each risk assessment. From the AFP Editors Cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis causes significant morbidity and mortality, which can be improved by controlling risk factors through lifestyle interventions and lipid-lowering medications. The U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense have updated recommendations for evaluation and management of dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Primary Prevention Without known cardiovascular disease, treatment decisions should be based on estimated 10-year risk calculators such as the pooled cohort equations. Treatment is recommended at a 10-year risk of 12%, which matches the populations that experienced benefit in clinical trials. People with diabetes mellitus and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg per dL are also at high risk and should be offered treatment regardless of estimated risk. Shared decision-making is recommended with 10-year risk between 6% and 12%, which represents populations less studied in clinical trials. Moderate-dose statins are the sole medication recommended for primary prevention. The group recommends against high-dose statins, citing lack of additional benefit and an increase in risks. The guideline does not suggest one statin over another.

Because moderate dosing is recommended for all patients, the guideline does not recommend titrating dosage to a specific cholesterol level. There is no evidence that ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, icosapent ethyl, fibrates, bempedoic acid, or niacin is beneficial in primary prevention. Secondary Prevention Patients with known coronary artery disease are at high enough risk to require treatment. Moderate-dose statins are the baseline in this group because no other treatment has a greater impact on mortality. The guideline recommends considering more intense treatment, especially in higher-risk patients. High-dose statin therapy reduced major cardiovascular events in the higher-risk patients studied. Adding ezetimibe to moderate- or high-dose statins reduces non-fatal cardiovascular events to a similar extent as high-dose statins.

PCSK9 inhibitors also decrease nonfatal cardiovascular events in high-risk individuals on maximal tolerated therapy to a similar extent. Because of high cost and uncertain long-term safety, PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended only after increasing statin dose and adding ezetimibe. Icosapent ethyl appears to reduce cardiovascular events and mortality with elevated triglyceride levels, although the single trial results are controversial because of high rates of cardiovascular events in the control group. Target cholesterol levels are not recommended to guide these decisions. Diet One diet has clinical evidence of decreasing risk in primary and secondary prevention. A dietitian-led Mediterranean diet decreases rates of cardiovascular events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been studied extensively but does not reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention… [^112AGZFQ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although elevated low-density lipoprotein is associated with higher rates of CVD, 2 there is uncertainty regarding the net benefit to risk ratio of using statins to reduce LDL among persons without CVD. This contrasts with the established role of LDL reduction for persons with established CVD. The US Preventive Services Task Force has updated its 2016 recommendations on the use of statins for the primary prevention of clinical CVD. 3 Two of us wrote about the 2016 recommendations, 4 and in this Editorial we update our comments for the 2022 recommendations.
5.

First, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or higher based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled cohort equations and at least 1 risk factor — dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and/or smoking — are likely to derive moderate benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin. Second, the Task Force concludes with moderate certainty that those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to less than 10% and at least 1 risk factor are likely to experience small net benefit from initiation of a moderate-intensity statin, and thus clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making.

Third, the Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to fully assess the net harms and benefits of initiating statins in adults 76 years and older, regardless of estimated 10-year CVD event risk or presence of risk factors. The details of the updated recommendations merit further consideration. 5 The systematic review6 that accompanies the 2022 USPSTF recommendations examined 22 randomized clinical trials that compared statin therapy vs placebo or no statin, with a mean follow-up duration of 3 years. The updated evidence synthesis6 found that statins yielded a slightly smaller, but still statistically significant, reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as for myocardial infarction and stroke.

The USPSTF recommendations should be considered in the context of a meta-analysis, published in 2010, 8 which included only trials that enrolled patients receiving high-risk primary prevention; this study showed no benefit on all-cause mortality with statins. The null result was robust in sensitivity analyses that excluded trials that stopped early, trials that included patients receiving secondary prevention, good-quality trials, trials with at least 3 years of follow-up, and trials with participants with a median baseline LDL lower than 160 mg/dL. 6 The lack of benefit on CVD mortality found in the 2022 evidence review6 and the lack of benefit on all-cause mortality in the purely high-risk primary prevention meta-analysis8 call into question the reliability of the all-cause mortality benefit reported in the systematic review that accompanies the 2022 USPSTF recommendations.

### Screening and statin use in… [^112TjC8L]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a moderate amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that use of low- to moderate-dose statins reduces the probability of CVD events and mortality by at least a small amount in adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10%. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to conclude whether initiating statin use in adults 76 years and older who are not already taking a statin is beneficial in reducing the incidence of CVD events and mortality.

POTENTIAL HARMS OF STATIN USE The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms of low- to moderate-dose statin use in adults aged 40 to 75 years are small. Randomized, clinical trials of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events have largely used low and moderate doses; under these conditions, statin use was not associated with serious adverse events such as cancer, severely elevated liver enzyme levels, or severe muscle-related harms. USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater has at least a moderate net benefit.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating use of low- to moderate-dose statins for the prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years without a history of CVD who have 1 or more CVD risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 7. 5% to 10% has a small net benefit. The decision to initiate therapy in this population should reflect an assessment of patients' specific circumstances and their preference for a potential small benefit relative to the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a lifelong daily medication. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events and mortality in adults 76 years and older without a history of CVD.

As such, the USPSTF does not recommend for or against the use of CRP alone as a risk factor in screening to prevent CVD events in asymptomatic adults without a history of CVD. 12 In JUPITER, most of the trial participants either also had hypertension or were smokers 10 — risk factors the USPSTF prioritized for determining potential suitability for statin therapy. In the recent HOPE-3 trial, there was no difference in the effects of statins among participants with or without elevated CRP levels.
8. Use of low- or moderate-dose statins was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (RR,

54. Given similar relative risk reductions, the absolute magnitude of benefit that an intervention with demonstrated efficacy can have in a specific population directly depends on the incidence of disease over time in that population.
