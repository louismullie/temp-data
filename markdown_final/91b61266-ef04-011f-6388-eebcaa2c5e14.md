## Question

A 19-day-old previously healthy male infant was admitted to the hospital with a fever of 38.5°C. On admission, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were obtained, and empiric antibiotics were started. The infant has remained clinically stable, afebrile for the past 36 hours, is feeding well, and has no abnormal examination findings. After 36 hours, all cultures remain negative. There are no social or logistical barriers to discharge, and the family is reliable with follow-up.

Based on current guideline recommendations, is it appropriate to discharge this infant at this time? Justify your answer according to the specific discharge criteria for this age group.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 19-day-old, well-appearing, previously healthy infant with fever can be discharged now that he has been afebrile for 36 hours, is feeding well, and has negative blood, urine, and CSF cultures at 36 hours, with reliable follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the infant's age group and whether the AAP 2021 guideline applies. Then, I should verify the exact discharge criteria for 8–21 day olds, including culture duration, clinical status, and whether any other reason for hospitalization exists. Next, I will check the role of HSV testing and whether it affects discharge in this scenario. Finally, I will confirm follow-up requirements and ensure the benefit–harm balance supports discharge now rather than waiting longer [^0387675f] [^542e8969].

> Let me first confirm the age category and guideline applicability. At 19 days old, this infant falls into the 8–21 day group addressed by the AAP 2021 guideline for well-appearing, term infants 8–60 days with fever ≥ 38.0°C, so the guideline's discharge criteria directly apply here [^0387675f] [^43ed4adc].

> Now, I need to verify the specific discharge criteria for 8–21 day olds. The AAP recommends discontinuing parenteral antimicrobials and discharging hospitalized infants 8–21 days old when all of the following are met: culture results are negative for 24–36 hours or only positive for contaminants, the infant continues to appear clinically well or is improving (for example, fever and feeding), and there are no other reasons for hospitalization; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Quality B [^2c0aa3a2] [^542e8969] [^dd869f6b].

> Wait, let me verify each element against the case. Cultures have been negative for 36 hours, which satisfies the 24–36 hour window; the infant is afebrile for 36 hours, feeding well, and has no abnormal exam findings, which meets "clinically well or improving"; and there is no mention of another infection requiring treatment or other indication for continued hospitalization, so there are no other reasons for hospitalization; thus, all discharge criteria are met [^2c0aa3a2] [^542e8969].

> Hold on, I should verify the HSV consideration because I initially thought an HSV PCR might be required before discharge in this age group. Let me reconsider that. The AAP 8–21 day algorithm advises obtaining CSF for bacterial analysis and culture, starting parenteral antimicrobials, and actively monitoring in hospital; it also instructs discontinuing antimicrobials and allowing discharge if cultures are negative at 24–36 hours and, if HSV testing was sent, the HSV PCR is negative, but it does not mandate that HSV testing must be obtained in all 8–21 day olds before discharge; in the absence of HSV risk features or clinical suspicion, discharge after 24–36 hours of negative cultures is appropriate without waiting for HSV results that were not obtained, so I should not delay discharge solely for missing HSV testing in this scenario [^a781ec0c] [^ea7c316c].

> Next, I should review follow-up requirements to ensure safe outpatient care. The AAP recommends that infants discharged after initial hospital evaluation have documented phone or telecommunication contact and a scheduled clinical re-evaluation within 24 hours, with clear return precautions; given reliable follow-up and no logistical barriers, arranging reassessment within 24 hours is appropriate and aligns with best practice [^52d9e04c].

> I will now examine the benefit–harm balance to confirm that earlier discharge is favored. Benefits of discharge at 24–36 hours with negative cultures include reduced exposure to hospital-acquired infections, less family disruption, and lower costs, while the main risk is delayed recognition if a pathogen grows after discharge; however, large studies show that a meaningful proportion of pathogens, if present, grow by 24 hours and even more by 36 hours, and the benefit–harm assessment favors discharge when criteria are met, which supports discharge now rather than extending observation unnecessarily [^3003ebae] [^16e15dda] [^bdf844a3].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final recommendation. Yes, it is appropriate to discharge this 19-day-old infant now because all AAP discharge criteria are satisfied: cultures are negative at 36 hours, the infant is clinically well and improving, and there are no other reasons for hospitalization; ensure reliable 24-hour follow-up and provide clear return precautions, and discontinue parenteral antibiotics prior to discharge per guideline [^2c0aa3a2] [^542e8969] [^52d9e04c].

---

It is appropriate to discharge this 19-day-old infant now because he meets all AAP discharge criteria: **negative cultures at 24–36 hours** [^542e8969], **clinically well/improving** (afebrile 36 hours, feeding well, no abnormal exam) [^2c0aa3a2], and **no other reason for hospitalization** [^dd869f6b]. Discharge is safe with **24-hour follow-up** [^52d9e04c] and clear return precautions [^d366b674]. Prolonged observation is not indicated when these criteria are met [^3003ebae].

---

## AAP guideline discharge criteria

The AAP provides **specific discharge criteria** for well-appearing febrile infants aged 8–21 days [^2c0aa3a2]:

- **Negative cultures**: All bacterial cultures (blood, urine, and CSF) are negative at 24–36 hours or only positive for contaminants [^542e8969] [^bdf844a3].

- **Clinical stability**: The infant is clinically well or improving (afebrile, feeding well, no abnormal examination findings) [^2c0aa3a2].

- **No other indications**: There are no other reasons for hospitalization (e.g. otitis media, pneumonia, or other infections) [^dd869f6b].

---

## Application to the current case

The infant meets **all AAP discharge criteria**:

| **Criterion** | **Current case status** |
|-|-|
| Negative cultures at 24–36 hours | All cultures negative at 36 hours |
| Clinically well or improving | - Afebrile for 36 hours <br/> - Feeding well <br/> - No abnormal examination findings |
| No other reasons for hospitalization | No other indications identified |

---

## Evidence supporting early discharge

Recent evidence supports **early discharge** of well-appearing febrile infants with negative cultures:

- **Safety**: Early discharge after 24–36 hours of negative cultures is safe, with low risk of missed invasive bacterial infection (IBI) [^16e15dda] [^70a0b7bc].

- **Benefits**: Early discharge reduces hospital-acquired infections, family disruption, and healthcare costs [^3003ebae] [^9323da21].

- **Follow-up**: Reliable follow-up within 24 hours is essential to ensure continued clinical stability [^52d9e04c].

---

## Recommended follow-up and precautions

Upon discharge, the following **follow-up and precautions** are recommended:

- **Follow-up**: Arrange a clinical re-evaluation within 24 hours [^52d9e04c].

- **Parent education**: Provide clear instructions on signs of deterioration and when to seek immediate medical attention [^d366b674].

- **Communication**: Ensure reliable communication between the family and healthcare providers [^d366b674].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The infant meets all AAP discharge criteria, and **early discharge is safe and appropriate**. Prolonged hospitalization is unnecessary and may increase risks such as hospital-acquired infections and family disruption [^3003ebae]. Discharge now with **24-hour follow-up** and clear return precautions is recommended.

Outpatient follow-up and reevaluation after initial hospital evaluation: For infants discharged from the hospital after initial evaluation, phone or other telecommunication contact should be attempted and documented at appropriate intervals after returning home, and infants should be scheduled for repeat clinical evaluation within the next 24 hours or sooner, if deemed appropriate. If at 24 hours, the parents report no clinical worsening and all culture results are negative, a phone conversation may be sufficient for follow-up; given transportation barriers, we recommend institutions consider travel vouchers (taxi or ride-share) for families with transportation insecurity, and telemedicine is increasingly being used for follow-up visits and may be appropriate in some situations. If the reevaluation will be performed at another location or by a different clinical evaluator, it is recommended that the site for medical reevaluation be arranged in advance and clinician-to-clinician communication be direct, and clear written and documented instructions should be given to parents as to the time and place of the return visit.

### Approach to the febrile infant [^b30d0b36]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Evaluation and management of the febrile infant has long been an area of variability. Recent guidelines were released by the American Academy of Pediatrics in August 2021 to help provide evidence-based clinical guidelines to decrease variability and improve outcomes.1 These guidelines largely focus on management and treatment guidelines for 3 age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. The inclusion criteria for these guidelines are previously healthy, term infants born at 37 weeks gestation or later, with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. The most significant changes to historical practice are in the 22- to 28-day and 29- to 60-day age groups. If initial laboratory work is reassuring, patients may not need cerebrospinal fluid studies, and patients may be monitored at home or at the hospital using shared decision-making with the family.

### Evaluation and management of young febrile infants: an overview of the new AAP guideline [^d455c821]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics released a clinical practice guideline for the management of febrile infants in August 2021 to compile nearly 40 years of research into a cohesive text that would provide a framework for the clinician in safely managing these patients in a variety of settings. (1) This guideline incorporates shared decision-making with the caregiver to guide treatment when appropriate and provides algorithms for 3 age groups: 8 to 21 days, 22 to 28 days, and 29 to 60 days. This guideline applies to previously healthy, well-appearing infants born at 37 weeks' gestation or later who have a temperature of at least 100.4°F (≥ 38.0°C) in the previous 24 hours at home or in a clinical setting. Infants younger than 8 days and those with diagnosed focal infections are excluded. The highlighted changes to historical practice are in the 2 older age groups. In 22- to 28-day-old infants, if initial laboratory work is normal, shared decision-making is used to direct lumbar puncture and hospital admission with the possibility of monitoring the patient at home or in the hospital. In 29- to 60-day-old infants, admission to the hospital is indicated only if laboratory evaluation is concerning for meningitis or based on clinician judgment. The occurrence of invasive bacterial infection in a febrile infant with a positive viral test is still not well-measured, as broad viral panels are more recently developed technology. As this research evolves and expected advancements in early detection of infectious organisms and biomarkers occur, this new information will need to be incorporated into the existing evidence.

Panel deliberations.

The panelists considered the potential for antibiotic-associated adverse effects and development of antibiotic resistance, and agreed that the persistence of fever alone is insufficient justification for antimicrobial changes.

13. The panel RECOMMENDS stopping empirical antibiotics in high-risk pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who have negative blood cultures at 48 hours, are afebrile for at least 24 hours, and have evidence of marrow recovery (Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).
14. The panel RECOMMENDS stopping empiric antibiotics in low-risk pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who have negative blood cultures at 72 hours, have assured follow-up, and are afebrile for at least 24 hours, regardless of marrow recovery status (Quality of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Three studies, none performed in an LMIC, addressed this issue in the low-risk population (139 patients).- The recommendation for the high-risk population is based on indirect inference from the low-risk population. Pooled results showed no significant difference between early discontinuation and continuation of treatment with regard to overall mortality, hospital readmission, favorable clinical outcome, or any adverse events (Data Supplement).

Panel deliberations.

The panel valued the avoidance of antibiotic-associated adverse effects and the development of antibiotic resistance. The definition of bone marrow recovery was not consistent across studies; therefore, the panel recommends that clinicians follow institutional definitions. A shorter duration of empirical therapy may be possible under favorable clinical circumstances.

15. The panel RECOMMENDS early discharge (within 24–36 hours) for low-risk pediatric patients with febrile neutropenia who have negative blood cultures at 24–36 hours and have been afebrile for at least 24 hours, regardless of marrow recovery status, provided follow-up is reliable (Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: strong).

Two studies addressed this issue in a low-risk population (159 patients; 211 episodes). Neither was performed in an LMIC. Pooled results showed no significant difference between early discharge and continued hospitalization with regard to overall mortality, treatment success, and treatment duration (Data Supplement).

KAS 11a — Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in well-appearing febrile infants 22 to 28 days: Clinicians may obtain a CSF analysis on infants 22 to 28 days of age even if all of the following criteria are met — urinalysis result is negative or positive, no inflammatory marker (IM) obtained is abnormal, blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and the infant is hospitalized — and this is an Evidence Quality: B; Moderate Recommendation. Benefit–harm assessment is described as benefit in specified situations, and shared decision-making is emphasized because parents must provide consent and may opt not to obtain CSF based on consensus about meningitis risk and benefits versus harms. A normal CSF analysis helps in the decision whether to discharge infants at 24–36 h, and because the prevalence of bacterial meningitis declines in 22- to 28-d-old infants, the committee's recommendation differs from that for 8- to 21-d-old infants. When results are not reported in a timely fashion, the committee recommends using a fever of ≥ 38.5°C with other IMs for risk stratification.

Managing fever in pediatric patients has always been a high-risk aspect of emergency medicine, and this is especially true of infants. The task of correctly discerning "well" versus "ill" can be difficult for these patients because they cannot describe their symptoms and have not developed normal social behaviors. Recent studies, however, have greatly enhanced physicians' understanding of how best to manage these young patients. With this research comes an array of new recommendations for diagnosing and treating febrile infants, which can be incorporated into the practice of every emergency physician who cares for pediatric patients.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^0387675f]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days — this clinical practice guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C; it derives 21 key action statements with assessed and graded strength of recommendations and summarizes recommendations in three algorithms for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The guideline states that parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making, that the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test and provided numbers needed to treat, and that the recommendations do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care, with variations, taking into account individual circumstances, potentially appropriate.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^43ed4adc]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Population addressed — Eligibility and exclusions for this guideline are defined as follows: This guideline addresses febrile infants who are well appearing; infants appearing moderately or severely ill are at higher risk for invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) and are NOT addressed, and we recommend that when clinicians are uncertain as to whether an infant is well appearing, this guideline should not be applied. For eligibility, infants must be well appearing, have documented rectal temperatures of ≥ 38.0°C or 100.4°F at home in the past 24 hours or determined in a clinical setting, have a gestation between ≥ 37 and < 42 weeks, and be 8 to 60 days of age and at home after discharge from a newborn nursery or born at home. The algorithms are intended to exclude preterm infants (< 37 weeks' gestation).

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^8beef1ee]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

This guideline addresses the evaluation and management of well-appearing, term infants, 8 to 60 days of age, with fever ≥ 38.0°C. Exclusions are noted. After a commissioned evidence-based review by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, an additional extensive and ongoing review of the literature, and supplemental data from published, peer-reviewed studies provided by active investigators, 21 key action statements were derived. For each key action statement, the quality of evidence and benefit-harm relationship were assessed and graded to determine the strength of recommendations. When appropriate, parents' values and preferences should be incorporated as part of shared decision-making. For diagnostic testing, the committee has attempted to develop numbers needed to test, and for antimicrobial administration, the committee provided numbers needed to treat. Three algorithms summarize the recommendations for infants 8 to 21 days of age, 22 to 28 days of age, and 29 to 60 days of age. The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.

### FeBRILe3: safety evaluation of febrile infant guidelines through prospective Bayesian monitoring [^70a0b7bc]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite evidence supporting earlier discharge of well-appearing febrile infants at low risk of serious bacterial infection (SBI), admissions for ≥ 48 hours remain common. Prospective safety monitoring may support broader guideline implementation.

Methods

A sequential Bayesian safety monitoring framework was used to evaluate a new hospital guideline recommending early discharge of low-risk infants. Hospital readmissions within 7 days of discharge were regularly assessed against safety thresholds, derived from historic rates and expert opinion, and specified a priori (8 per 100 infants). Infants aged under 3 months admitted to 2 Western Australian metropolitan hospitals for management of fever without source were enrolled (August 2019-December 2021), to a prespecified maximum 500 enrolments.

Results

Readmission rates remained below the prespecified threshold at all scheduled analyses. Median corrected age was 34 days, and 14% met low-risk criteria (n = 71). SBI was diagnosed in 159 infants (32%), including urinary tract infection (n = 140) and bacteraemia (n = 18). Discharge occurred before 48 hours for 192 infants (38%), including 52% deemed low-risk. At study completion, 1 of 37 low-risk infants discharged before 48 hours had been readmitted (3%), for issues unrelated to SBI diagnosis. In total, 20 readmissions were identified (4 per 100 infants; 95% credible interval 3, 6), with > 0.99 posterior probability of being below the prespecified noninferiority threshold, indicating acceptable safety.

Conclusions

A Bayesian monitoring approach supported safe early discharge for many infants, without increased risk of readmission. This framework may be used to embed safety evaluations within future guideline implementation programs to further reduce low-value care.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^6d771bd6]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Algorithm for 22- to 28-day-old febrile infants — well-appearing infants with temperature ≥ 38.0°C are first evaluated with urinalysis, blood culture, and inflammatory markers (IMs); IMs are considered abnormal at temperature > 38.5°C, procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/mL, CRP > 20 mg/L, and ANC > 4000–5200 per mm3. A positive urinalysis prompts bladder catheterization or suprapubic aspiration urine culture. Lumbar puncture (LP) is recommended before administration of antimicrobial agents, with pathway branches labeled "Perform LP" or "May perform LP", after which management options include "Administer parenteral antimicrobial(s)" with "Observe in hospital", or "May administer parenteral antimicrobial(s)" with "Observe at home" and "Reassess in 24 hours". If no pathogen/source is identified and cultures and HSV PCRs are negative, clinicians may "Discontinue antimicrobials and may discharge hospitalized infant(s) if all cultures are negative at 24 to 36 hours… ", then follow for duration of illness. For herpes simplex virus evaluation, recommended studies include CSF PCR, HSV surface swabs or PCR assay, alanine aminotransferase, and blood PCR.

### Evaluation and management of the febrile young infant [^0d8e4efb]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Fever (≥ 38°C) in young infants (< 90 days of age) represents a common clinical challenge for pediatricians in both outpatient and inpatient settings. While the majority of febrile infants will ultimately be determined to have no serious infection, serious infections when present can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Since the evaluation and empiric treatment of presumptive serious infection has associated risks (e.g. medication side effects, stress/disruption of hospitalization, nosocomial infection, etc.) as well as substantial costs, attempts have been made to clearly define an accurate method that enables clinicians to correctly stratify which infants are at relatively low risk for serious bacterial infection (SBI) and may therefore be safely managed less aggressively. Although this topic has been extensively studied and discussed, no single protocol has been universally adopted and clinical practices continue to vary. This paper discusses multiple distinct protocols currently in use, as well as the evidence upon which they are based and the points on which the evidence is not yet definitive.

### Decreasing hospital observation time for febrile infants [^9e1b1973]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Febrile infants aged 0 to 60 days are often hospitalized for a 36-to-48 hour observation period to rule out invasive bacterial infections (IBI). Evidence suggests that monitoring blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures for 24 hours may be appropriate for most infants. We aimed to decrease the average culture observation time (COT) from 38 to 30 hours among hospitalized infants 0 to 60 days old over 12 months.

Methods

This quality improvement initiative occurred at a large children's hospital, in conjunction with development of a multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline for the management of febrile infants. We included infants aged 0 to 60 days admitted with fever without a clear infectious source. We excluded infants who had positive blood, urine, or CSF cultures within 24 hours of incubation and infants who were hospitalized for other indications (eg, bronchiolitis). Interventions included guideline dissemination, education regarding laboratory monitoring practices, standardized order sets, and near-time identification of failures. Our primary outcome was COT, defined as time between initiation of culture incubation and hospital discharge in hours. Interventions were tracked on an annotated statistical process control chart. Our balancing measure was identification of IBI after hospital discharge.

Results

In our cohort of 184 infants aged 0 to 60 days, average COT decreased from 38 hours to 32 hours after structured guideline dissemination and order-set standardization; this decrease was sustained over 17 months. IBI was not identified in any patients after discharge.

Conclusions

Implementation of an evidence-based guideline through education, transparency of laboratory procedures, creation of standardized order sets, and near-time feedback was associated with shorter COT for febrile infants aged 0 to 60 days.

Well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 29 to 90 days presenting with fever (≥ 38.0°C [100.4°F]) — patient management recommendations are as follows: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified. Admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the ED is needed. (Consensus recommendation).

### Outcomes of infants who are febrile aged 29–90 Days discharged from the emergency department [^6a7c54cc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of infants aged 29–90 days who are febrile discharged from the pediatric emergency department (ED).

Study Design

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of infants aged 29–90 days who visited any of the 7 Clalit Health Services pediatric EDs in Israel between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022. Infants who were febrile discharged from the ED after having blood and urine cultures taken were included. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of return visit (RV) to an ED. Secondary outcome measures were the incidence of invasive bacterial infection, urinary tract infection, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, and deaths. We assessed variables associated with the primary outcomes.

Results

A total of 1647 infants were included. Their median (IQR) age at ED visit was 58.5 (47.7, 72.7) days, 53.1% were male. A total of 329 patients (20%) returned to the ED within 120 hours. Overall, 7.8% of discharged infants had a positive urine culture, 4 (0.2%) had a positive blood culture, and none had meningitis. One patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, and there was no death. Abnormal C-reactive protein was associated with RV among 61- to 90-day-old infants.

Conclusions

Infants aged 29–90 days who were febrile and discharged following a protocol-driven pathway from the pediatric ED had a relatively high RV rate. However, the rate of urinary tract infection was relatively low, and rate of invasive bacterial infection was extremely low. There were no deaths or serious sequelae.

### Trends and variation in length of stay among hospitalized febrile infants ≤ 60 days old [^79942315]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Researchers in recent studies suggest that hospitalized febrile infants aged ≤ 60 days may be safely discharged if bacterial cultures are negative after 24–36 hours of incubation. We aimed to describe trends and variation in length of stay (LOS) for hospitalized febrile infants across children's hospitals.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of febrile infants aged ≤ 60 days hospitalized from 2016 to 2019 at 39 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System database. We excluded infants with complex chronic conditions, bacterial infections, lower respiratory tract viral infections, and those who required ICU admission. The primary outcomes were trends in LOS overall and for individual hospitals, adjusted for patient demographics and clinical characteristics. We also evaluated the hospital-level association between LOS and 30-day readmissions.

Results

We identified 11868 eligible febrile infant encounters. The adjusted mean LOS for the study cohort decreased from 44.0 hours in 2016 to 41.9 hours in 2019 (P < .001). There was substantial variation in adjusted mean LOS across children's hospitals, range 33.5–77.9 hours in 2016 and 30.4–100.0 hours in 2019. The change from 2016 to 2019 in adjusted mean LOS across individual hospitals also varied widely (-23.9 to +26.7 hours; median change -1.8 hours, interquartile range: -5.4 to 0.3). There was no association between hospital-level LOS and readmission rates (P = 0.70).

Conclusions

The LOS for hospitalized febrile infants decreased marginally between 2016 and 2019, although overall LOS and change in LOS varied substantially across children's hospitals. Continued quality improvement efforts are needed to reduce LOS for hospitalized febrile infants.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^3cb1f7bb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### Incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of clinically undetected bacteremia in children discharged home from the emergency department [^5315b362]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite a recent decline in the rates of invasive infections, bacteremia in young children remains a significant challenge. We aimed to describe patient characteristics, microbial etiology, and outcomes of bacteremic, well-appearing children 3–36 months of age who were discharged home from the pediatric emergency department (PED) on their index visit.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study in the PED of a tertiary children's hospital from 1 June 2015 until 30 June 2021. We included all well appearing, immunocompetent infants 3–36 months old evaluated for fever and discharged home from the PED after a blood culture was drawn. We extracted demographic, clinical and laboratory data from the patient's electronic medical records for the index visit and subsequent encounters.

Results

During the study period, 17,114 children evaluated for fever met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-two patients (0.42%) had positive cultures for known pathogens. Thirty-six (50%) were male and 36 (50%) younger than 1 year. The most common isolates were S. pneumonia 26%. (n = 19), K. Kingae 25%. (n = 18) and Salmonella spp. 13.9% (n = 10). Sixty patients (85.7%) were recalled to the ED or had a scheduled appointment, 10 (14.3%) returned spontaneously and two were followed up by phone. The median time between visits was 28.7 hours (IQR 19.1–41.1). One patient was admitted to intensive care during the course of hospitalization. There were no deaths.

Conclusion

The rate of undetected true bacteremia in our study was low and our data suggest that significant clinical deterioration during the first 24 hours is rare.

### Risk stratification and management of the febrile young child [^85ced8fa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Febrile young children present frequently to the emergency department. While most febrile children recover uneventfully, certain subgroups are at higher risk of serious infection. Febrile neonates require extensive diagnostic testing, antibiotic therapy, and hospital admission. Diagnostic testing can be utilized in older patients to identify children at low risk and high risk for serious infection. This information may assist in determining the treatment and disposition of these febrile children.

### Disposition and follow-up for low-risk febrile infants: a secondary analysis of a multicenter study [^a60bbb44]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines recommend that febrile infants at low risk for invasive bacterial infection be discharged from the emergency department (ED) if primary care provider (PCP) follow-up occurs within 24 hours. We aimed to (1) assess the association between having electronic health record (EHR) documentation of a PCP and ED disposition and (2) describe documentation of potential barriers to discharge and plans for post-discharge follow-up in low-risk febrile infants.

Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of a multicenter, cross-sectional study of low-risk febrile infants. Descriptive statistics characterized ED disposition on the basis of the day of the visit, EHR documentation of PCP, scheduled or recommended PCP follow-up, and barriers to discharge.

Results

Most infants (3565/4042, 90.5%) had EHR documentation of a PCP. Compared with discharged infants, a similar proportion of hospitalized infants had EHR documentation of PCP (90.3% vs 91.2%, P = 0.47). Few infants (1.5%) had barriers to discharge documented. Of the 3360 infants (83.1%) discharged from the ED, 1544 (46.0%) had documentation of scheduled or recommended 24-hour PCP follow-up. Discharged infants with weekday visits were more likely than those with weekend visits to have documentation of scheduled or recommended 24-hour follow-up (50.0% vs 35.5%, P < .001).

Conclusions

Most infants had a documented PCP, yet fewer than half had documentation of a scheduled or recommended 24-hour follow-up. A dedicated focus on determining post-ED care plans that are safe and patient-centered may improve the quality of care for this population.

One case report from Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, describes a previously healthy 11-year-old who presented with status epilepticus and cerebrospinal fluid evidence of encephalitis after a 2-day history of generalized weakness and no respiratory symptoms. Nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 and rhinovirus/enterovirus; however, cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative for the latter, which suggests possible COVID-19 etiology. However, it is unclear whether the patient's cerebrospinal fluid was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Management of status epilepticus required 4 anticonvulsant therapies, but the child recovered fully after 6 days without further treatment. Dugue et aldescribed a 6-week-old term infant with a family history of simple febrile seizures, who presented with fever, cough, and 2 brief episodes of sustained upward gaze deviation and bilateral leg stiffening. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus C. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. The infant was discharged after 1 day without further complications. A case report by Chacón-Aguilar et aldescribed a 26-day-old infant who presented after several minutes of upward gaze deviation and generalized hypertonia, followed by another several minute episode of generalized hypertonia and facial cyanosis. The infant had a 12-hour history of fever, rhinorrhea, and vomiting at presentation. Extended (36-hour) electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring found no evidence of seizure activity. PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARs-CoV-2, and all other infectious workup was negative. After a 6-day hospitalization, the infant was discharged without further complications. Bhatta et alreported a previously healthy 11-year-old boy who presented initially with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure witnessed by his mother, followed by another seizure in the emergency department necessitating 2 mg intravenous lorazepam. Of note, he was afebrile and did not feel unwell. PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Furthermore, head computed tomograph and chest radiograph were both normal. He was treated with levetiracetam 500 mg twice daily and discharged the next day. No other symptoms or recurrence of seizures were reported at a 1-week follow-up. This case highlights an unusual presentation of new-onset seizure in the absence of any other COVID-19 symptoms.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infant, more specifically with respect to urine tests, ACEP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining urinalysis and urine culture to identify UTI in well-appearing infants and pediatric patients aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever (≥ 38.0 °C or 100.4 °F), especially with a higher risk for UTI (such as females aged < 12 months, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever lasting > 24 hours, higher fever of ≥ 39 °C, negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection).

### Supporting decisions to increase the safe discharge of children with febrile illness from the emergency department: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e181a19c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite fewer serious infections presenting to the children's emergency department (ED), hospital admissions of children with febrile illness have increased. We review evidence for the use of decision rules to increase the safe discharge of these children from the ED.

Methods

A systematic review of prospective studies of decision rules for the discharge of children with febrile illness, and prediction rules for the diagnosis of serious infections in children presenting to ED. We reviewed the MEDLINE database, Cochrane Library and hand searched the bibliographies of related studies. The search was limited to the English language.

Results

Thirty-three studies were identified. Fourteen reported low-risk criteria to rule out serious bacterial infection (SBI) in infants less than 3months of age. In this group, clinical tools such as the Rochester and Philadelphia criteria support the safe discharge of low-risk infants without empirical antibiotics. Seventeen studies reported prediction rules in older children, though only four included children over 3years. Two impact studies based upon multivariable prediction models failed to demonstrate any impact on rates of discharge from ED.

Conclusions

The use of clinical prediction models can improve discrimination between serious and self-limiting infections in children. The application of low-risk thresholds may help to rule out serious infections and discharge children from the ED without empirical antibiotics. A growing evidence base for prediction rules has so far failed to translate into validated rules to aid decision-making. Future work should evaluate decision rules in well designed impact studies, focusing on the need for hospital admission and antibiotic therapy.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^15497a12]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Fever in well-appearing immunocompetent full-term infants aged 1 to 3 months (29 to 90 days) — predictors of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid testing: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: Although there are no predictors that adequately identify full-term well-appearing febrile infants aged 29 to 90 days from whom cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained, the performance of a lumbar puncture may still be considered. In the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days diagnosed with a viral illness, deferment of lumbar puncture is a reasonable option, given the lower risk for meningitis. When lumbar puncture is deferred in the full-term well-appearing febrile infant aged 29 to 90 days, antibiotics should be withheld unless another bacterial source is identified, and admission, close follow-up with the primary care provider, or a return visit for a recheck in the ED is needed (Consensus recommendation).

KAS 20a — clinicians should hospitalize 29- to 60-day-old infants with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in a unit with experienced nurses and staff, as explicitly stated: "Clinicians Should Hospitalize Infants in a Unit With Nurses and Staff Experienced in the Care of 29- to 60-Day-Old Infants if CSF Analysis, if Obtained, Is Abnormal. Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation". Benefits include that "An infant with a positive CSF analysis requires hospitalization for treatment and monitoring" and that "Having the infant immediately available facilitates antimicrobial changes when culture and sensitivity results are reported, particularly if the organism is not sensitive to antimicrobial agents being administered", with the benefit–harm assessment noted as "Preponderance of benefit". Risks, harm, cost include "Hospitalization increases risk of hospital-acquired infections", "Increased risk of iatrogenic events related to intravenous catheters", "Parental anxiety about infant's condition and financial strain", "Stress to mothers because of breastfeeding challenges and separation from other children", and "Substantial cost", with "Key references 57".
