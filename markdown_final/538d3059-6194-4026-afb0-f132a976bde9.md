## Question

What is the pattern of liver enzyme elevations in cirrhosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about liver enzyme patterns in cirrhosis and how to interpret them in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational paradox that normal enzymes do not exclude cirrhosis. Then, I should characterize the typical enzyme patterns in stable, chronic cirrhosis and the AST/ALT ratio. Next, I will separate chronic patterns from acute-on-chronic spikes. After that, I need to address why enzyme magnitude does not track prognosis. Then, I will integrate complementary markers and imaging. I should also review limitations of reference ranges. Finally, I will synthesize a concise clinical takeaway that avoids common pitfalls while aligning with current guidelines [^116VZBsx] [^117MpALN].

> Let me first confirm the foundational paradox: patients with compensated cirrhosis can have completely normal ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin, so normal enzymes do not exclude cirrhosis; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is specifically true in compensated disease where structural injury outpaces biochemical leakage, and it is well documented in guideline-level sources and in cohorts of HBV/HCV and NAFLD where significant fibrosis can coexist with persistently normal ALT [^116VZBsx] [^115UN9Jy].

> Now, I will characterize the typical chronic pattern; in stable cirrhosis, when abnormalities are present, they are usually mild to moderate rather than marked, and I should double-check the AST/ALT ratio because an AST/ALT ratio above 1 is often associated with advanced fibrosis and was incorporated with platelets and INR in the HALT-C prediction model, whereas ALP in uncomplicated cirrhosis is often normal or only mildly elevated — wait, I initially called these "liver function tests", but I need to correct myself; the enzymes primarily reflect injury patterns rather than liver function per se, with cholestatic patterns (disproportionate ALP elevation) prompting evaluation for diseases like PBC or PSC rather than cirrhosis alone [^117VSnab] [^113rP69K] [^117MpALN] [^115AgRSj].

> Hold on, I should distinguish chronic patterns from acute extremes; markedly elevated aminotransferases around or above 1000 IU/L are not the baseline in chronic cirrhosis and usually signal acute-on-chronic injury such as ischemic hepatitis, drug injury, or procedure-related insults, often with high short-term mortality in ischemic etiologies — wait, let me verify the acute-on-chronic framework and precipitating factors; ACLF guidance underscores searching for hepatic triggers (alcohol, viral flares, DILI, autoimmune hepatitis) and extrahepatic triggers (infection, hemorrhage, surgery) when such spikes occur [^113xL4GQ] [^112hVa6M] [^112J3ukT] [^114h9YzH].

> I need to emphasize the prognostic disconnect; the height of enzyme elevation does not reliably correlate with severity or outcomes in chronic disease, and I should confirm that ALT is not a "function" assay but rather an injury biomarker — this means a patient with mild or even normal enzymes can harbor advanced disease, while a patient with very high enzymes from an acute injury can recover fully; thus, prognosis hinges more on diagnosis, synthetic function, and decompensation status than on enzyme magnitude alone [^117VSnab] [^116xdYTr] [^116VZBsx].

> Next, I should review complementary markers and noninvasive tools because enzymes alone are unreliable; I need to check for thrombocytopenia as an early portal hypertensive signal, consider indices like the Lok components or HALT-C variables when appropriate, assess synthetic function (bilirubin, albumin, INR), and use elastography to stage fibrosis — let me verify the compensated-cirrhosis VCTE threshold that prompts variceal screening; guidance suggests a vibration-controlled transient elastography cutoff around 19.5 kPa to guide endoscopic evaluation for varices in suspected compensated cirrhosis [^116VZBsx] [^112hkzh2] [^113rP69K] [^112Re2yM].

> I will now examine the AST/ALT ratio nuance; a higher AAR associates with increased risk of cirrhosis development in chronic HBV cohorts, but wait, I should verify whether this holds when enzymes are normal — stratified analyses show the predictive effect is apparent with abnormal enzymes and is masked when both AST and ALT are normal, reinforcing that AAR must be interpreted in the clinical and biochemical context rather than in isolation [^112diGup].

> But wait, what if the "normal range" itself is misleading; I should double-check the upper limits — ALT reference intervals used by many labs are likely too high, and healthy "normal" ALT is roughly 29–33 IU/L in men and 19–25 IU/L in women, so values inside some lab "normals" may still warrant evaluation in context of risk factors and imaging [^117MpALN] [^117VSnab].

> Let me consider NAFLD-specific implications; patients with NAFLD, including those with advanced fibrosis, can have normal enzymes, so I need to ensure risk stratification does not depend solely on ALT/AST and instead leverages noninvasive fibrosis biomarkers and elastography, and I should remember that NAFLD with increased liver enzymes carries higher long-term risks for cirrhosis and HCC than NAFLD with normal enzymes, which influences surveillance thresholds and counseling [^1122aq7b] [^117XzfZz].

> To synthesize, I should confirm a practical approach: do not rule out cirrhosis when enzymes are normal, avoid overinterpreting enzyme height as a severity gauge, integrate platelet count, synthetic function, and elastography to stage disease, and when enzymes are dramatically elevated, I should promptly evaluate for acute-on-chronic precipitants; in short, persistently mild abnormalities or an AAR > 1 in the right context are more informative than intermittently normal values, whereas marked spikes suggest superimposed acute injury rather than the baseline cirrhotic state [^116VZBsx] [^113rP69K] [^112Re2yM] [^112J3ukT].

---

In cirrhosis, liver enzymes typically show a **modest AST/ALT rise** (AST > ALT, often 1.5–2.0) due to chronic hepatocyte injury and mitochondrial AST release, with ALT often normal or mildly elevated [^1114dVvt] [^117VSnab]. Marked transaminase elevations (> 5× ULN) are uncommon and suggest **superimposed acute injury** (e.g. ischemic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, acute viral hepatitis) [^113xL4GQ] [^117MpALN]. ALP and GGT are usually normal or mildly elevated unless cholestasis or biliary disease is present [^117MpALN]. As cirrhosis advances, enzyme levels may normalize or decline due to reduced hepatocyte mass, so **normal enzymes do not exclude advanced disease** [^116VZBsx] [^115UN9Jy].

---

## Typical pattern of liver enzyme elevation in cirrhosis

- **AST and ALT**: In cirrhosis, AST and ALT are typically mildly elevated, usually less than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) [^117MpALN]. AST levels are generally higher than ALT levels, resulting in an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1, often between 1.5 and 2.0 [^114h9YzH] [^1114dVvt].

- **AST/ALT ratio**: The AST/ALT ratio is a useful marker in cirrhosis [^113rP69K]. A ratio greater than 1 is commonly observed in cirrhosis, particularly in alcohol-related liver disease [^117JDhKB]. This pattern is due to the release of mitochondrial AST from damaged hepatocytes and decreased ALT synthesis in advanced liver disease.

- **ALP and GGT**: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are usually normal or mildly elevated in cirrhosis unless there is significant cholestasis or biliary obstruction [^112RBbyZ].

---

## Variations in liver enzyme levels based on cirrhosis etiology

The pattern and degree of liver enzyme elevation **vary by etiology**, reflecting the underlying cause of cirrhosis [^117MpALN]:

| **Etiology** | **AST/ALT pattern** | **ALP/GGT pattern** |
|-|-|-|
| Alcoholic cirrhosis | AST > ALT (ratio > 2) | Mild elevation |
| Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) | - Mild elevation <br/> - AST > ALT [^113rP69K] | Mild elevation |
| Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) | - Mild elevation [^1122aq7b] <br/> - AST > ALT | Mild elevation |
| Cholestatic cirrhosis (PBC, PSC) | Mild elevation | Significant elevation [^117VSnab] |

## Clinical significance of liver enzyme elevation in cirrhosis

Elevated liver enzymes in cirrhosis indicate **ongoing hepatocellular injury** [^117MpALN] and inflammation. Persistent AST and ALT elevation suggests active liver damage and a higher risk of disease progression [^111HEq2g]. However, normal or mildly elevated enzymes do not exclude advanced liver disease [^115UN9Jy], as significant fibrosis and cirrhosis can occur with minimal enzyme elevation [^114h9YzH].

---

## Liver enzyme levels in compensated vs. decompensated cirrhosis

Comparing liver enzyme levels, **compensated cirrhosis** typically shows mildly elevated or normal enzymes because the liver still maintains its synthetic and metabolic functions despite structural damage [^116VZBsx]. In contrast, **decompensated cirrhosis** may show an initial rise due to acute hepatocellular injury [^113xL4GQ] but often normalizes or decreases as liver function deteriorates and hepatocyte mass declines. Importantly, normal enzyme levels in decompensated cirrhosis indicate severe liver dysfunction and poor prognosis.

---

## Prognostic implications of liver enzyme elevation in cirrhosis

Elevated liver enzymes, particularly AST, are **associated with increased mortality** and poor prognosis in cirrhosis. The AST/ALT ratio correlates with disease severity and prognosis, particularly in viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis [^1178nVN8]. However, enzyme levels alone are insufficient for prognosis; comprehensive clinical assessment is necessary [^116xdYTr].

---

## Clinical guidelines for monitoring liver enzymes in cirrhosis

Guidelines recommend **regular monitoring** of liver enzymes in patients with cirrhosis to assess disease progression and treatment response [^117MpALN]. Monitoring frequency depends on the clinical context, disease severity, and presence of complications. Regular monitoring helps identify acute exacerbations or superimposed liver injury and guides therapeutic interventions.

---

## Limitations of liver enzyme tests in cirrhosis

Liver enzyme tests have several limitations in cirrhosis:

- **Non-specificity**: Elevated enzymes are non-specific and can occur in various liver and non-liver conditions [^116xdYTr].

- **Normal levels**: Normal enzyme levels do not exclude advanced liver disease or cirrhosis [^115UN9Jy].

- **Limited prognostic value**: Enzyme levels alone do not accurately predict disease severity or prognosis [^117VSnab].

Liver enzymes in cirrhosis typically show a **modest AST/ALT rise** (AST > ALT, often 1.5–2.0) due to chronic hepatocyte injury and mitochondrial AST release, with ALT often normal or mildly elevated [^1114dVvt] [^116VZBsx]. Marked transaminase elevations (> 5× ULN) are uncommon and suggest **superimposed acute injury** (e.g. ischemic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, acute viral hepatitis) [^113xL4GQ]. ALP and GGT are usually normal or mildly elevated unless cholestasis or biliary disease is present [^117MpALN]. As cirrhosis advances, enzyme levels may normalize or decline due to reduced hepatocyte mass, so **normal enzymes do not exclude advanced disease** [^115UN9Jy].

### Key insights and clinical pearls in the identification and management of cirrhosis and its complications [^116VZBsx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cirrhosis is a prevalent, chronic condition with an asymptomatic compensated phase, in which patients may feel well, and a decompensated phase that begins with the onset of complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding. Because patients with cirrhosis may appear healthy with normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin levels, awareness of clinical signals is important. For example, patients with thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Early recognition and management of cirrhosis-related complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and/or variceal bleeding, are important given their association with hospitalization and poor prognosis, including increased odds of short-term mortality.

- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: This can be the most subtle cirrhosis-related complication, and associated cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed. Because hepatic encephalopathy can be associated with hospital readmissions, reducing readmission rates after hepatic encephalopathy-related hospitalizations is critical. This includes incorporating ongoing therapy, such as rifaximin plus lactulose, in postdischarge management plans to reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy recurrence.

Strategies that mitigate cirrhosis progression and prevent the development of cirrhosis-related complications are key to improving patient outcomes.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^115UN9Jy]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages, and significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present even in individuals with persistently normal ALT levels. This is particularly true for HBV and HCV carriers and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of individuals in the general population who may harbor clinically significant liver disease behind the screen of normal alanine aminotransferase levels, more attention should be devoted to future research on alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

### The primary cause of markedly elevated aminotransferases in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis in ischemic hepatitis [^113xL4GQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Marked elevation in aminotransferases (≥ 1000 IU/l) is typically associated with acute liver injury. Here, we hypothesized that the cause of elevation in aminotransferases ≥ 1000 in patients with cirrhosis is likely due to a limited number of disorders and may be associated with poor outcomes.

- **Aim**: We aimed to investigate the most common etiologies of acute elevations in aminotransferases in patients with cirrhosis and to examine their associated outcomes.

- **Methods**: From May 2012 to December 2022, all hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and an aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase ≥ 1000 IU/l were identified through the Medical University of South Carolina's Clinical Data Warehouse. Complete clinical data were abstracted for each patient, and in-hospital mortality was examined.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 152 patients, who were 57 ± 12 years old, with 51 (34%) being women. Underlying liver disease included mainly hepatitis C cirrhosis, alcohol-related cirrhosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis cirrhosis, autoimmune cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis cirrhosis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. The most common cause of marked elevation in aminotransferases in cirrhotic patients was ischemic hepatitis (71%), followed by chemoembolization (7%), autoimmune hepatitis (6%), drug-induced liver injury (3%), post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (3%), rhabdomyolysis (3%), and hepatitis C (2%). During hospitalization and over a 1-month follow-up period, the mortality rate in patients with ischemic hepatitis was 73% (79/108).

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests, such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions.

Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies.

Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement in a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason, threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used to direct the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature. Prognosis is more clearly determined by the diagnosis and the context within which the tests are requested.

To illustrate, consider two patients: a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval. Yet, ten years later, the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C, if not investigated and diagnosed, is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease, and hepatitis C — are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the upper limit of normal for many liver enzymes (for example, ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges.

MARC1 p. A165T associates with protection from cirrhosis, fatty liver, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated blood cholesterol levels.

Having established that an analysis of all-cause cirrhosis would provide improved statistical power, we sought to identify novel genetic determinants of all-cause cirrhosis through a discovery genome-wide association analysis followed by replication. In the discovery analysis, we analyzed 3,754 all-cause cirrhosis cases and 444,791 controls from five cohorts. Baseline characteristics and distribution of ancestry in each cohort are provided. Mean ages across the studies ranged from 45 years to 57 years. The proportion of female gender was similar in hospital and population-based studies (53.8% to 54.6%) but lower in the alcoholic cirrhosis case-control studies (8.0% and 27.2%). The proportion of individuals with cirrhosis was higher in Partners Biobank (3.9%), a hospital-based cohort, than in UK Biobank (0.4%) or ARIC (0.9%), which are population-based cohorts.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^1147CaUE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

In this study, we evaluated the predictive role of the AAR value in the development of cirrhosis in a prospectively enrolled cohort of hospitalized CHB patients. We collected their clinical and follow-up data after at least six months. We concluded that patients with a higher AAR value exhibited a significantly increased risk of cirrhosis development, independent of other host characteristics such as gender, age, drinking history, smoking history, and ALBI grade. Moreover, the effect remained prominent with increasing follow-up time.

Cirrhosis is a multi-stage process involving many pathological changes, manifested as extensive liver parenchyma damage, liver cell necrosis, fibrous tissue proliferation, normal liver structure disorder, and hard texture. Consequently, it is often accompanied by abnormal liver function. Hepatic function plays a significant role in predicting the development and prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Serum ALT and AST are two common liver enzymes routinely detected in the clinical setting, originating from damaged hepatocytes. Their activities are widely considered the most common markers reflecting the severity of liver injury, monitoring CLD prognosis and treatment response, and aiding clinical strategy decisions. For example, normalized enzyme levels for a prolonged period prompt the discontinuation of treatment in patients with hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis, and overlap syndrome. AAR value is an effective hallmark for reflecting the extent of liver damage.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^116BAFs1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the final stage of liver fibrosis characterized by extensive degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, diffuse proliferation of fibrous tissue, and the formation of regenerative nodules. It is identified as a perpetuated wound-healing process following chronic liver injury, with chronic HBV infection playing a dominant role. Nearly 257 million people worldwide suffer from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, with approximately 444,000 people dying from cirrhosis annually. In 2019, cirrhosis was estimated to account for 560.4 age-standardized deaths per 100,000 population globally, imposing a significant burden on individuals and public health infrastructure, along with escalating financial costs. The presence of cirrhosis is a key factor impacting the prognosis and management of chronic liver diseases (CLDs), prompting surveillance programs for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices inpatients.

Accordingly, the early identification of cirrhosis is of great importance and cost-effectiveness. While liver biopsy has been considered the standard for diagnosing cirrhosis, its clinical application is limited due to its invasiveness, lack of clear accuracy, and high cost. Various non-invasive approaches have been proposed, based on detecting individual serum markers that indicate either the deposition or removal of the extracellular matrix in the liver or through simple routine blood tests.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the management of hepatorenal syndrome with pharmacotherapy, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend administering albumin solution (20%) at a dose of 20–40 g/day. Consider obtaining serial measurements of central venous pressure or other measures of assessing central blood volume, apart from routine monitoring, to prevent circulatory overload by optimizing fluid balance and titrating the albumin dose.

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^111HEq2g]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Liver disease and its most serious complications — acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer — are leading and rising causes of mortality worldwide. Liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the most commonly used laboratory indicators of liver disease and are increased in most common liver diseases. ALT and AST are traditionally considered markers of hepatocellular injury, and ALP is a marker of cholestasis. Liver enzyme elevations have been associated with greater liver-related mortality and are used in clinical practice guidelines to direct treatment decisions in liver disease. Beyond liver disease, the presence of elevated liver enzymes has been associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Liver enzymes are partially genetically determined, with heritability estimated around 0.5 based on twin studies. Previously published exome- or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of genetic variants influencing liver enzyme concentrations identified loci in or near genes affecting bile acid transport, lipid/carbohydrate metabolism, glycobiology, and the immune system. A more detailed understanding of genetic risk factors for liver enzymes may identify further mechanisms and pathways, yielding deeper insight into the biology of liver diseases and identifying those at high risk due to their genome. However, existing studies on this topic utilized relatively small cohorts.

We aimed to further characterize the genetic architecture…

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^112diGup]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

A stratified analysis of liver enzymes AST and ALT status demonstrated that a higher AAR level conferred a significant risk in cases with abnormal liver enzymes, but no risk was observed with normal enzyme levels. This suggests that the predictive effect of the AAR value on cirrhosis may be masked by normal liver enzymes. Individuals with abnormal AST or ALT are the beneficiaries who can gain clinical utility from a higher AAR value when predicting cirrhosis. This result might be influenced by the small number of patients with cirrhosis in the sub-cohort with normal liver enzymes. In a related finding, Fredrik Åberg developed a dynamic AAR model (dAAR) based on age, ALT, and AAR, discovering that dAAR performed well in predicting severe liver disease. This indicates that combining AAR with other useful variables could enhance predictive performance.

Another important finding of our study is that AAR had an AUC value of 0.654 in predicting cirrhosis development, significantly improving the accuracy of host variables. As suggested by Nyblom H's study, AAR appeared to provide a clue for diagnosing cirrhosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. It was also reported that AAR has a predictive performance in the development of esophageal varices (EVs) in cirrhotic patients, with an AUC value of 0.726 for general EVs and 0.648 for high-risk EVs. Behnaz Amernia's study indicates that AAR may effectively differentiate fibrosis in NAFLD patients with an AUC value.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^114EhjV8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Demographic, clinical data, and laboratory test results were acquired for each patient by medical chart review and consultation with competent physicians. Demographic parameters collected included gender, age, smoking status, and drinking status. Clinical variables included whether patients received antiviral treatment, such as oral entecavir, tenofovir dipivoxil, or injecting interferon α-2b. Imaging examinations included computed tomography (CT) or MRI, and clinical presentations like ascites, encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding were also noted. Laboratory tests recorded included albumin (ALB), total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and HBV antigen and antibody detection at the initial visit during this study.

Hepatitis viral infection status was clinically determined before or at enrollment. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients were defined as being infected by HBV for at least six months. The albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) score, a simple index reflecting underlying liver function, was calculated using the formula: ALBI score = 0.66 × log10 bilirubin - 0.085 × albumin, where bilirubin is in μmol/L and albumin in g/L. ALBI grade was assessed based on the ALBI score: ALBI grade 1 was determined when the score was ≤ -2.60, grade 2 when it ranged from -2.60 to 1.39, and grade 3 when the score was > 1.39. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR) was defined as AST divided by ALT, using baseline laboratory test data. Liver cirrhosis was primarily diagnosed through imaging studies, characterized by medial segment atrophy of the left lobe and caudate lobe hypertrophy.

### Predicting cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis C based on standard laboratory tests: Results of the HALT-C cohort [^113rP69K]. Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the presence of cirrhosis is important for the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Most models for predicting cirrhosis were derived from small numbers of patients and included subjective variables or laboratory tests that are not readily available. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of cirrhosis in patients with CHC based on standard laboratory tests.

Data from 1,141 CHC patients, including 429 with cirrhosis, were analyzed. All biopsies were read by a panel of pathologists, blinded to clinical features, and fibrosis stage was determined by consensus. The cohort was divided into a training set (n = 783) and a validation set (n = 358).

Variables that were significantly different between patients with and without cirrhosis in univariate analysis were entered into logistic regression models, and the performance of each model was compared. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the final model, comprising platelet count, AST/ALT ratio, and INR in the training and validation sets, was 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. A cutoff of less than 0.2 to exclude cirrhosis would misclassify only 7.8% of patients with cirrhosis, while a cutoff of greater than 0.5 to confirm cirrhosis would misclassify 14.8% of patients without cirrhosis.

The model performed equally well in fragmented and nonfragmented biopsies and in biopsies of varying lengths. Use of this model might obviate the requirement for a liver biopsy in 50% of patients with CHC. In conclusion, a model based on standard laboratory test results can be used to predict cirrhosis effectively.

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: A concise review [^116QR8Ei]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of liver fibrosis has traditionally relied on liver biopsy. However, recent studies have suggested that there can be up to a 33% error in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. In this article, we review the status of liver biopsy as a gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and discuss the radiological and serum tests that have been proposed as potential adjuncts or alternatives to biopsies. Indirect markers of liver fibrosis, which reflect alterations in liver function and/or inflammation, are discussed as well as more direct markers of liver fibrosis. The limitations of utilizing these markers for both cross-sectional diagnosis of fibrosis and monitoring disease progression or regression are discussed.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112Jid2z]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, specifically in the evaluation of renal impairment, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend completing the diagnostic process by staging chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) levels and by investigating its cause. It is essential to recognize that any serum creatinine-based formula tends to overestimate the GFR in patients with cirrhosis.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: a nationwide cohort study [^117F6tYb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Liver injury or liver disease is usually asymptomatic until complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. Thus, liver function tests, including bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and aminotransferase levels, are the mainstay for identifying early liver injury or liver disease. While alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be produced by organs other than the liver, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is exclusively produced in hepatocytes and is widely used as a specific biomarker of liver injury or liver disease.

Because serum ALT measurement is relatively inexpensive, it is frequently used to screen for, or exclude liver disease, and it is common to find asymptomatic individuals with abnormally elevated ALT levels. Subjects with elevated ALT levels are recommended to undergo additional workup to establish the etiology of liver injury. In these individuals, the most common causes of elevated ALT levels are alcohol-associated liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and NAFLD. When alcohol-associated liver disease or chronic viral hepatitis are identified as the causes of elevated ALT, evidence and practice guidelines recommend complete abstinence. In subjects with other causes of elevated ALT levels (mostly those with NAFLD), it is controversial whether they require complete abstinence, and information regarding this issue is limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association of light to moderate alcohol intake on liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality among individuals with elevated ALT levels.

### Liver decompensation after bariatric surgery in the absence of cirrhosis [^1146hWDH]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease-related cirrhosis is possible at the time of bariatric surgery, complicated by further liver decompensation. Hepatic decompensation can also occur in the absence of cirrhosis, but the presentation is less clear.

- **Methods**: We analyze the clinical characteristics, histological findings, and management of patients without cirrhosis who developed hepatic decompensation after bariatric surgery in our single tertiary-care hospital.

- **Results**: From 2014 to 2019, six patients underwent a transvenous liver biopsy for liver decompensation after bariatric surgery. The mean age at diagnosis was 44 years. The time between bariatric surgery and the onset of symptoms varied widely, with a minimum of 8 months and a maximum of 17 years. The mean percentage of weight loss was high at 43%. The clinical presentation was as follows: fatigue and jaundice in 5 out of 6 patients, leg edema in 3 out of 6, and ascites in 1 out of 6. Blood tests showed increased transaminases (mean ALT 53 UI/L, mean AST 130 UI/L), elevated bilirubin (mean 6 mg/dL), and INR (mean 1.5) with a low albumin level (mean 27 mg/dL). The hepatic venous pressure gradient was high (mean 10 mmHg). Histology revealed steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, portal inflammation with polymorphonuclear cells, and bile duct alterations. The mean fibrosis score was 2. The clinical course was favorable with nutritional support, with a mean follow-up of 36 months.

- **Conclusion**: Liver decompensation in the absence of cirrhosis can occur after bariatric surgery with a highly variable delay. A special histological signature is present with the coexistence of steatosis.

### The role of noninvasive biomarkers in diagnosis and risk stratification in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1122aq7b]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronically elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD remain clinically challenging, as patients with NAFLD are either asymptomatic or present with nonspecific complaints and may have normal liver enzyme levels. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the clinically aggressive variant of NAFLD, is particularly difficult to differentiate noninvasively, necessitating a liver biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Thus, the definitive diagnosis and risk stratification of NAFLD rely on the histological assessment of the liver.

Several clinical aids have been investigated to risk stratify and identify patients noninvasively, as performing liver biopsies on all patients with NAFLD is not feasible. These biomarkers cannot differentiate NASH from non-NASH but leverage biochemical changes within the liver as patients progress to varying degrees of hepatic fibrosis. They aim to identify patients with moderate fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or greater) and advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage 3 or greater) to guide the need for additional and more definitive workup. These clinical aids range from by-products of apoptosis to statistical modeling of clinically available data to identify 'at-risk' patients with NAFLD. This review focuses on the diagnostic performance of these noninvasive serum-based biomarkers in NAFLD.

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Indicated as a potential need for paracentesis.
- **Shock**: Urgent evaluation may be required if shock is present.
- **Fever or other signs of systemic inflammation**: Considered as a necessary condition for investigation.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Presence warrants diagnostic procedure.
- **Hepatic encephalopathy**: Encephalopathy is a criterion for further diagnostic action.
- **Worsening liver or renal function**: Any decline in function should prompt paracentesis.

### AST to ALT ratio as a prospective risk predictor for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic HBV infection [^117DPPKG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR) is one of the most frequent indicators used to discriminate between fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, results have remained controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive effect of AAR on the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis.

- **Method**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 1,754 chronic HBV-infected patients. Clinical variables at their initial visit and follow-up data were collected. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to evaluate the predictive value of AAR on cirrhosis risk, and its discrimination accuracy was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The time-dependent effect was assessed using a Fine and Gray competing risk model.

- **Results**: Compared to patients with lower AAR, those with elevated AAR levels had a higher risk of cirrhosis development. By adjusting for host characteristics, dichotomized analyses showed a hazard ratio of 2.77 (P = 8.25 × 10⁻⁴), while tertile analyses showed a hazard ratio of 2.95 (P = 1.61 × 10⁻³), with an increasing risk trend (P trend = 4.56 × 10⁻⁴). This effect remained significant when ALT or AST was abnormal, while no significant risk was observed when both AST and ALT were simultaneously normal. Time-dependent effect analysis demonstrated a persistently higher risk, with an average hazard ratio equivalent to 1.92. AAR level could improve the discrimination efficacy of host variables, with the area under the curve increasing from 0.684 to 0.711 (P = 0.039).

- **Conclusion**: A higher AAR was significantly associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis development.

### The emergency medicine evaluation and management of the patient with cirrhosis [^112EEBDv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is a significant cause of death in the U.S. and has a variety of causes, most commonly hepatitis C and alcohol. Liver fibrosis and nodule formation result in significant complications due to portal system hypertension. There are several deadly complications emergency physicians must consider.

- **Objective of the review**: Provide an evidence-based update for the resuscitation of decompensating cirrhotic patients and an overview of cirrhosis complications.

- **Discussion**: Cirrhosis is a common condition in the U.S. and leads to several deadly complications. The disease develops from liver fibrosis, elevating portal pressures and modifying patient hemodynamics. Cirrhosis results in significant anatomic and physiological modifications involving the gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, neurologic, renal, immunologic, and hematologic systems. The disease can be divided into compensated and decompensated states, with decompensation associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Complications include variceal hemorrhage, ascites, increased risk of bacterial infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome, umbilical hernia, and hepatic hydrothorax. Resuscitation, including airway and circulation measures, is paramount in these patients, and several new techniques are offered for the approach to intubation and resuscitation for patients with severe cirrhosis.

- **Conclusions**: Decompensating cirrhotics may require extensive resuscitation, and knowledge of the evaluation and management of complications is critical.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs; yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason, this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice.

Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation, convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin, and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline, an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is emerging literature suggesting that the reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises both the unconjugated and conjugated fractions.

### Portia [^112kiBaR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Liver disease**: Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females with acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops. Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until the liver tests return to normal and COC causation has been excluded.

- **Liver tumors**: Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females with benign or malignant liver tumors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). COCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas, with an estimated attributable risk of 3.3 cases per 100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (> 8 years) COC users. The attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users.

- **Hypertension**: Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). For all females, including those with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The effect of COCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin.

### Type 1 interferon auto-antibodies are elevated in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis [^114jcAVY]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Our data highlight that an intrinsic defect in antiviral protein expression is not present in the serum of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. However, auto-antibodies (AAb) targeting type I interferons (IFNs) are highly prevalent in these decompensated patients, and high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) scores are associated with the presence of neutralizing AAb. Our results suggest that the presence of neutralizing AAb targeting type I IFN may explain the increased likelihood of severe COVID-19 in chronic liver disease patients upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and are of relevance to other viral infections in this patient population.

### Type 1 interferon auto-antibodies are elevated in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis [^111tDdEn]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that cirrhosis may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection in two ways: firstly, by altering innate antiviral proteins in the serum and enhancing viral infectivity; and secondly, by dysregulating antiviral signaling pathways. In the present study, we demonstrate that viral infectivity is not altered in the presence of serum from patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis; however, these patients do have elevated levels of auto-antibodies capable of neutralizing type I IFN.

### Age-specific protective effects of statins against cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver enzyme elevation associated with metabolic dysfunction: A retrospective cohort study of electronic health records [^1122f9i2]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

The cumulative incidence of cirrhosis during the follow-up period showed distinct differences based on age and sex. The median follow-up time was 9.6 years (IQR: 4.1–10.0). Stratified by sex and age 50 years, the median follow-up times were as follows:

- **Women ≤ 50 years**: 9.8 years (IQR: 5.4–10.0)
- **Women > 50 years**: 9.4 years (IQR: 4.2–10.0)
- **Men ≤ 50 years**: 9.8 years (IQR: 4.7–10.0)
- **Men > 50 years**: 9.5 years (IQR: 3.9–10)

Younger patients had slightly longer follow-up durations. However, no clinically significant differences in follow-up times were observed between sexes. During the 10-year follow-up, 9944 (2.96%, 95% CI: 2.9–3.0%) out of 335,991 patients developed cirrhosis, including 1112 aged ≤ 50 years (141 women and 971 men) and 8832 aged > 50 years (397 women and 8435 men). A significant sex-difference in incidence was observed, with male patients being more likely to develop cirrhosis than female patients (3.07% [95% CI: 3.0–3.1%], N = 306,717 vs. 1.84% [95% CI: 1.7–2.0%], N = 29,274).

- **Age-stratified Incidence**:
	- Among male patients aged > 50 years, the incidence of cirrhosis was significantly higher than those ≤ 50 years (3.5% vs. 1.6%).
	- Female patients showed a similar trend, but the difference was not statistically significant (1.9% vs. 1.6%).
	- Among patients ≤ 50 years, the incidence was comparable between male and female patients.
	- In those aged > 50 years, male patients had a significantly higher incidence than female patients (3.5% vs. 1.9%).

The cumulative incidence of cirrhosis, stratified by age 50 years and sex, is summarized in Table 2.

### Ocaliva [^114AhE63]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosage and administration instructions**: Prior to the initiation of Ocaliva, healthcare providers should determine whether the patient has decompensated cirrhosis (e.g. Child-Pugh Class B or C), has had a prior decompensation event, or has compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension (e.g. ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) because Ocaliva is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Recommended dosage regimen**: The recommended dosage of Ocaliva for PBC patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who do not have evidence of portal hypertension, who have not achieved an adequate biochemical response to an appropriate dosage of UDCA for at least 1 year or are intolerant to UDCA [see Clinical Studies (14)] follows below:
	- Start with a dosage of 5 mg once daily for the first 3 months.
	- After the first 3 months, for patients who have not achieved an adequate reduction in ALP and/or total bilirubin and who are tolerating Ocaliva, increase to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily.

- **Monitoring to assess safety, need for Ocaliva discontinuation**: Routinely monitor patients during Ocaliva treatment for biochemical response, tolerability, and progression of PBC. Closely monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis, concomitant hepatic disease (e.g. autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease), and/or severe interIllness for new evidence of portal hypertension (e.g. ascites, gastroesophageal varices, persistent thrombocytopenia) or increases above.

### Elevidys [^114j8AEj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Acute serious liver injury has been observed with Elevidys. Administration may result in elevations of liver enzymes (e.g. GGT, ALT) and total bilirubin, typically seen within 8 weeks. Patients with preexisting liver impairment, chronic hepatic conditions, or acute liver diseases (e.g. acute hepatic viral infection) may be at higher risk of acute serious liver injury. It is advisable to postpone Elevidys administration in patients with acute liver disease until it is resolved or controlled. Notably, patients with hepatic impairment, acute liver disease, chronic hepatic conditions, or elevated GGT have not been included in clinical trials of Elevidys [see Specific Populations (8.6)].

In clinical studies, increases in liver function tests (including GGT, GLDH, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) were commonly reported, typically within 8 weeks following Elevidys infusion. The majority of cases were asymptomatic [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These cases resolved spontaneously or with systemic corticosteroids, without clinical sequelae within 2 months. No cases of liver failure were reported.

Prior to Elevidys administration, it is essential to perform a liver enzyme test [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor liver function (clinical exam, GGT, and total bilirubin) weekly for the first 3 months following Elevidys infusion. Continue monitoring, if clinically indicated, until results are unremarkable and near baseline levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Systemic corticosteroid treatment is recommended to manage elevated liver enzymes.

### Cirrhosis: Diagnosis and management [^117JDhKB]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that early cirrhosis may be reversible. Only one in three people with cirrhosis is aware of their condition. Most patients with cirrhosis remain asymptomatic until the onset of decompensation. When clinical signs, symptoms, or abnormal liver function tests are discovered, further evaluation should be pursued promptly. The most common causes of cirrhosis are viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

Initial workup includes viral hepatitis serologies, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and abdominal ultrasonography, as well as complete blood count, liver function tests, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, if not already ordered. Additional testing is based on demographics and risk factors. Common serum and ultrasound-based screening tests to assess fibrosis include the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index score, Fibrosis 4 score, FibroTest/FibroSure, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, standard ultrasonography, and transient elastography. Generally, noninvasive tests are most useful in identifying patients with no to minimal fibrosis or advanced fibrosis.

Chronic liver disease management includes directed counseling, laboratory testing, and ultrasound monitoring. Treatment goals are preventing cirrhosis, decompensation, and death. Varices are monitored with endoscopy and often require prophylaxis with nonselective beta-blockers. Ascites treatment includes diuresis and salt restriction.

### The 1-year and 3-month prognostic utility of the AST/ALT ratio and model for end-stage liver disease score in patients with viral liver cirrhosis [^1178nVN8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The AST/ALT ratio has shown good diagnostic accuracy in patients with chronic viral liver disease; however, its prognostic utility has never been tested. Recently, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been proposed as a simple and effective tool to predict survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to assess the 3-month and 1-year prognostic ability of the AST/ALT ratio in a series of patients with virus-related liver cirrhosis, evaluate the relationship between the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score, and compare their prognostic ability.

- **Methods**:
	- The AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores of 99 patients with liver cirrhosis of viral etiology (73 patients with hepatitis C virus and 26 with hepatitis B virus) who had been followed-up for at least 1 year were retrospectively calculated and correlated with the patients' 3-month and 1-year prognosis. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the AST/ALT ratio and the MELD score cut-offs with the best sensitivity (SS) and specificity (SP) in discriminating between patients who survived and those who died. Univariate survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method using the cut-offs identified by means of receiver operating characteristic curves.

- **Results**:
	- AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores showed a significant correlation (r(s) = 0.503, p = 0.0001). In all, 8% and 30% of the patients had died after 3 months and 1 year of follow-up, respectively. AST/ALT ratios and MELD scores were significantly higher among the patients who died during both 3-month and 1-year follow-ups.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^115AgRSj]. Gut (2025). Low credibility.

Biochemistry: Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation are typically about 10 times higher than normal, though they can be modestly raised or occasionally normal. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may be mildly elevated in active disease, but a marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes.

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients tend to be younger than Caucasian patients and have a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients often present with more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, which is not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

- **Severity assessment**: Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate understanding of acute and chronic liver disease, determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

	- Asymptomatic disease:
		- (a) mild
		- (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, the severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis is similar, as is the rate of death or transplantation. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival.

Chronic hepatitis is the most common form of AIH, with an insidious onset.

### Age-specific protective effects of statins against cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver enzyme elevation associated with metabolic dysfunction: a retrospective cohort study of electronic health records [^111NoXz2]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

We first applied a validated EHR algorithm designed to identify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic liver enzyme elevation. This was defined as elevations occurring on two or more occasions within a two-year period, at least six months apart. Those with other chronic liver diseases were excluded. The cohort was then further assessed for coexisting cardiometabolic disorders indicative of metabolic dysfunction (see Results).

The baseline period spanned from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, allowing for a 10-year follow-up period ending in 2019. After identifying patients with chronic liver enzyme elevation and applying exclusion criteria, the cohort was defined as depicted in Fig. 1.

- **Algorithm used to define the study cohort**: ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase; UNL: upper limit normal; HBV: hepatitis B virus; HCV: hepatitis C virus. Using EHR data from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, patients with elevated chronic liver enzymes associated with metabolic dysfunction were identified following the existing algorithm for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Chronic liver enzyme elevation was defined as elevated ALT occurring on two or more occasions within a two-year period, at least six months apart. Patients with active hepatitis B, defined as positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] or detectable HBV DNA, or active hepatitis C, defined as positive HCV antibody and detectable HCV RNA, were excluded. Additionally, those with other chronic liver diseases (CLDs) based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes or alcoholism were excluded.

### Type 1 interferon auto-antibodies are elevated in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis [^112fH7iW]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Low credibility.

Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, specifically those classified as Child-Pugh class C, are at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The biological mechanisms underlying this increased risk are unknown. Our study aimed to examine the levels of serum intrinsic antiviral proteins and alterations in the innate antiviral immune response in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Serum samples from 53 SARS-CoV-2 unexposed and unvaccinated individuals with decompensated liver cirrhosis, who were undergoing assessment for liver transplantation, were screened using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle and SARS-CoV-2 virus assays. A cell-based reporter assay was used to assess the ability of serum to inhibit interferon (IFN) signaling. The severity of liver disease was assessed using two clinical scoring systems, the Child-Pugh class and the MELD-Na score.

- **Assessment results**: In the presence of serum from SARS-CoV-2 unexposed patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, there was no association between SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle infection or live SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and severity of liver disease. Type I IFNs are a key component of the innate antiviral response.

Serum from patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis contained elevated levels of auto-antibodies capable of binding IFN-α2b compared to healthy controls. High MELD-Na scores were associated with the ability of these auto-antibodies to neutralize type I IFN signaling by IFN-α2b but not IFN-β1a. Our results demonstrate that neutralizing auto-antibodies targeting IFN-α2b are present in these patients.

### Inflammasomes in chronic liver disease: Hepatic injury, fibrosis progression and systemic inflammation [^114GcsBj]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammasome activity in end-stage liver disease

In cirrhosis, particularly in the context of acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), a high-grade systemic inflammatory phenotype has been observed in both experimental studies and patient populations. Early studies identified elevated circulating levels of IL-1β, an indicator of inflammasome activation, in cases of acute alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) and in stable cirrhosis compared to non-cirrhotic conditions. Subsequent research detected inflammasome activation in the livers of AH patients, linking it to the formation of Mallory-Denk bodies.

In AH, activation of non-canonical CASP11 (in mice) and CASP4 (in humans) occurs, unlike the canonical CASP1/IL-1β pathway, which contrasts with chronic alcohol liver disease models and healthy controls. This activation results in increased GSDMD, contributing causally to neutrophil infiltration and hepatocyte death. A recent demonstration showed that ASC protein specks accumulate in the liver of a murine AH model and the circulation of AH patients. Notably, these ASC specks persist in plasma and liver post-binge episode, suggesting their role in sustained inflammation in AH.

Sterile inflammasome activation markers were found in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who had negative ascitic fluid and blood cultures. These patients exhibited elevated serum levels of IL-18, but not IL-1β, when compared to healthy controls. Additionally, AIM2 inflammasome activation through bacterial DNA exposure resulted in increases.

### Influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with increased liver enzyme levels on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [^117XzfZz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on the long-term risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian populations has not been widely investigated.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 129,374 adults aged 30 years and older, all of whom participated in a health screening program from 2008 through 2013, were seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies, and had limited daily alcohol consumption (< 20 g/d for men and < 10 g/d for women). Abdominal ultrasonography was performed to determine the presence of NAFLD. The participants were divided into the following groups: NAFLD with increased or normal liver enzyme levels, and non-NAFLD with normal liver enzyme levels. The incidences of cirrhosis and HCC were determined through computerized data linkage with nationwide registries. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios of NAFLD on the risks of cirrhosis and HCC.

- **Results**: The incidence rates of cirrhosis and HCC increased as follows: non-NAFLD with normal liver enzyme levels (n = 66,801; 51%), NAFLD with normal liver enzyme levels (n = 41,461; 32%), and NAFLD with increased liver enzyme levels (n = 21,112; 16%). In the NAFLD group with increased liver enzyme levels and the NAFLD group with normal liver enzyme levels, the corresponding multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for cirrhosis were 3.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.36–5.22) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.46–1.16), and for HCC were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.08–3.38) and 0.57 (95% CI: 0.31–1.04), respectively, compared with the non-NAFLD group.

### From nafld to nash to cirrhosis-new insights into disease mechanisms [^115573uU]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

NAFLD has evolved as a serious public health problem in the United States and worldwide. In fact, NASH — the most serious form of NAFLD — is predicted to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States by 2020. The pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH, particularly the mechanisms responsible for liver injury and fibrosis, results from a complex interplay between host and environmental factors, which is the center of intense investigation.

In this review, we focus on recently uncovered aspects of the genetic, biochemical, immunological, and molecular events responsible for the development and progression of this highly prevalent and potentially serious disease. These studies provide new insights into this complex disorder and have led to the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies that might enable a personalized approach to managing this disease.

### Does this patient with liver disease have cirrhosis [^112hkzh2]. JAMA (2012). Low credibility.

Among adult patients with liver disease, the ability to identify those most likely to have cirrhosis noninvasively is challenging. The objective is to identify simple clinical indicators that can exclude or detect cirrhosis in adults with known or suspected liver disease.

Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to December 2011) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks. From the study selection process, 86 studies of adequate quality were retained that evaluated the accuracy of clinical findings for identifying histologically proven cirrhosis.

Two authors independently extracted data on sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) and assessed methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary LRs across studies. Results show that among the 86 studies, 19,533 patients were included in this meta-analysis, among whom 4725 had biopsy-proven cirrhosis (prevalence rate, 24%; 95% CI, 20%-28%).

Many physical examination and simple laboratory tests increase the likelihood of cirrhosis. However, the presence of ascites (LR, 7.2; 95% CI, 2.9–12) and a platelet count under 100,000 (LR, 9.4; 95% CI, 2.6–37) are the most frequently studied, reliable, and informative results. For lowering the likelihood of cirrhosis, the most useful finding is a Lok index < 0.2 (a score created from the platelet count and serum aspartate aminotransferase).

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^112J3ukT]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for liver cirrhosis, particularly concerning patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (diagnosis), EASL 2018 guidelines recommend investigating potential precipitating factors. These factors can be hepatic, such as heavy alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Additionally, extrahepatic factors like infections, hemodynamic derangements following hemorrhage, and surgery should be considered. It is also recognized that in a significant proportion of patients, a precipitant factor may not be identified.

### Age-specific protective effects of statins against cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver enzyme elevation associated with metabolic dysfunction: A retrospective cohort study of electronic health records [^114n12bX]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, the VA cohort was predominantly male, with females comprising less than 10% of the sample. The lack of observed disparities by sex or menopause may be attributed to the small female sample size. Second, our exposure variables were derived from prescription records rather than actual drug administration. Although statin adherence in the VA system is reportedly high, with a medication possession ratio of 0.84, prescription fills may not fully reflect medication adherence. Third, cirrhosis was defined using ICD codes, which may have led to an underestimation of cirrhosis diagnoses. Based on our sensitivity analysis, up to 15% misclassification of cirrhosis would result in at most a 2% difference in the effect size. Nonetheless, our findings should be interpreted within the context of the chosen outcome definition.

Additionally, the validated EHR algorithm designed to identify NAFLD in large longitudinal datasets defined the cohort based on chronic liver enzyme elevation, potentially omitting patients with steatotic liver disease who have persistently normal liver enzymes. Nearly all the patients in the cohort (∼99%) had at least one cardiometabolic feature at baseline, reflecting underlying metabolic dysfunction. Thus, our findings are most applicable to individuals with chronic liver injury (elevated liver enzymes) linked to metabolic dysfunction. Given the observational nature of the data, we were also unable to completely rule out a collider effect among variables, potentially resulting in a non-causal association.

### Alanine aminotransferase: A clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come in a given person, nor is it a valid measure of the severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: Part I. Diagnosis and evaluation [^114Huvyo]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension.

Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal.

Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only following a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as a disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin, and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality.

A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/L for males and 19 to 25 IU/L for females; levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and/or AST in the clinical setting helps guide evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes: testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be considered.
