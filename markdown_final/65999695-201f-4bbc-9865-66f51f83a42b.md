## Question

If a patient who was previously on lithium had their creatinine increase to 1.35, but after stopping it returned to 1.15, would that be a contraindication to resuming lithium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a prior lithium-associated creatinine rise to 1.35 mg/dL that normalized to 1.15 mg/dL after stopping lithium constitutes a contraindication to restarting lithium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the creatinine pattern implies about renal susceptibility and current CKD staging. Then, I should verify what counts as an absolute versus relative contraindication in the FDA label. Next, I will review evidence on kidney trajectory after lithium discontinuation and after lithium re-challenge. After that, I should consider a risk–benefit framework and relevant guideline principles. Finally, I need to determine concrete monitoring steps, drug–drug interactions, and a conclusion with shared decision-making recommendations.

> Let me first interpret the clinical pattern: creatinine rose on lithium and fell after discontinuation, which strongly suggests a lithium-attributable, at least partially reversible nephrotoxic effect, consistent with lithium-associated chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy risk over time and the labeling admonition to re-evaluate treatment when renal function changes, even within the normal range [^1116dpVc]. Wait, let me verify the current impairment severity: I initially thought a creatinine of 1.15 mg/dL might correspond to an eGFR of 45–60 mL/min/1.73 m², but hold on, I should double-check because eGFR depends on age, sex, and race; in many adults 1.15 mg/dL may still yield an eGFR above 60, so I need to calculate using CKD-EPI and confirm chronicity over 3 months before assigning a CKD stage as per KDIGO definitions and lab reporting practices [^115Mg2Kk].

> Next, I should review whether this situation is an absolute contraindication per FDA labeling, and I need to ensure I'm precise here: lithium is not recommended in severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, while mild-to-moderate impairment, defined as CrCl 30–89 mL/min, is not an absolute contraindication but requires lower starting doses, slower titration, and frequent monitoring of lithium levels and renal function, which means the current case is not automatically excluded from lithium but is high risk given the prior lithium-associated rise in creatinine [^1177veaM] [^116CzAef].

> I will now examine the evidence on kidney function after stopping and then restarting lithium; let me verify the slope data carefully: in the LiSIE mirror-image cohort, eGFR decline slowed from a pre-discontinuation mean annual −1.58 mL/min/1.73 m²/year to essentially flat after discontinuation, but in those who restarted lithium, the mean annual decline reverted to −1.71 mL/min/1.73 m²/year, which was statistically indistinguishable from the pre-discontinuation rate, indicating that lithium re-challenge reinstates the prior rate of decline; this is compelling, though I should note it is observational and subject to limitations, yet it directly addresses the clinical question of restarting [^116ZW1Lu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to place this within a risk–benefit framework: risks include predictable resumption of renal decline and potential progression toward CKD, increased susceptibility to lithium toxicity due to reduced clearance, and the pathologic signature of chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy with long-term exposure, while benefits may include mood stabilization if lithium has been uniquely effective; the FDA labeling and pathology summaries reinforce the renal risks I'm weighing here [^1116dpVc] [^115zwJ5V].

> Next, I should review guiding principles from authoritative recommendations; I need to ensure alignment with both labeling and CKD guidance: the FDA label advises re-evaluation when renal function changes and mandates cautious dosing and close monitoring in CrCl 30–89 mL/min, while KDIGO 2024 emphasizes minimizing nephrotoxic exposure when feasible and intensifying GFR and albuminuria monitoring when risk of progression is higher; given the prior lithium-associated change, a shared decision-making process with nephrology and psychiatry is prudent, and although case-based literature is lower quality, it consistently underscores collaborative planning when lithium is no longer clearly safe [^1177veaM] [^113PibFs] [^111rAoay] [^113PibFs].

> If, after careful deliberation, lithium is restarted, I need to specify a monitoring plan and double-check drug–drug interactions; let me be concrete and conservative: start at a lower dose than usual, obtain a 12-hour trough lithium level about 3 days after initiation and after each dose change until stable, then maintain frequent monitoring, while checking serum creatinine/eGFR and electrolytes early and at regular intervals, with earlier rechecks within 2–4 weeks after changes that can affect renal hemodynamics; avoid nephrotoxic and interacting agents where possible, recognizing that ACEi/ARBs and NSAIDs can increase lithium concentrations and worsen renal function, and that SGLT2/SGLT1 inhibition may decrease lithium levels such that serum lithium may fall during initiation, necessitating closer level checks and clinical correlation; include periodic urinalysis to screen for tubular dysfunction and proteinuria, and escalate monitoring frequency immediately with any change in renal function or clinical status [^115zwJ5V] [^112qjeRY] [^1149fizo] [^117LHBtG] [^1139k4hx] [^111r1RRr] [^115s65rN] [^1116dpVc].

> But wait, what if the current eGFR is under 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min; I should confirm that before any decision, because that threshold constitutes an effective contraindication in labeling, in which case lithium should not be used; if the eGFR is at or above this threshold but the patient demonstrated lithium sensitivity with a creatinine rise, it becomes a strong relative contraindication wherein the default should be to avoid lithium unless psychiatric considerations are compelling and alternatives have clearly failed or are intolerable, and even then only with exceptional justification, lower dosing, and stringent surveillance [^116CzAef] [^1177veaM].

> Finalizing the clinical stance, I need to ensure the conclusion matches the evidence and guidance: this is not an absolute contraindication unless CrCl is below 30 mL/min, but the prior lithium-associated creatinine rise indicates renal susceptibility, and the best available cohort evidence suggests that restarting will likely resume the previous rate of eGFR decline, so the default recommendation is to avoid restarting lithium, pursue alternative mood stabilizers, and reserve re-challenge for scenarios of compelling psychiatric necessity after specialist consultation and shared decision-making with a clearly documented monitoring plan and risk mitigation strategy [^116ZW1Lu] [^1116dpVc] [^113PibFs].

No, a transient creatinine rise from 1.15 to 1.35 mg/dL that returns to baseline after stopping lithium is **not a contraindication** to restarting lithium [^1177veaM]. However, it signals increased renal risk and warrants **cautious reinitiation** [^116CzAef] with lower starting doses, slow titration [^1177veaM], and close monitoring of serum lithium, creatinine, and eGFR [^115zwJ5V]. Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACEi/ARBs, diuretics) and reassess if creatinine rises > 30% [^notfound] or eGFR falls < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115Mg2Kk]. If renal function declines again, discontinue lithium and consider alternatives [^113PibFs].

---

## Clinical significance of transient creatinine elevation

- **Transient creatinine rise**: A reversible increase from 1.15 to 1.35 mg/dL suggests hemodynamic or tubular effects rather than permanent structural injury.

- **Reversibility**: Return to baseline after stopping lithium indicates no irreversible nephropathy [^116ZW1Lu].

- **Risk marker**: Even transient rises signal higher susceptibility to lithium-related renal effects and merit closer monitoring [^111rAoay].

---

## Lithium and renal function: clinical guidelines

Lithium is renally cleared; therefore, impaired renal function increases toxicity risk [^116CzAef], making **dose adjustments and monitoring** essential.

- **Pre-treatment assessment**: Check renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid before starting lithium [^115zwJ5V].

- **Renal impairment**: For CrCl 30–89 mL/min, use lower doses, titrate slowly, and monitor lithium and renal function frequently [^1177veaM].

- **Severe impairment**: Avoid lithium if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^116CzAef].

- **Monitoring**: Check serum lithium and renal function regularly during treatment [^115zwJ5V] [^116CzAef].

## Risks associated with restarting lithium after transient creatinine elevation

Restarting lithium following a transient creatinine rise carries an **increased risk** of recurrent renal impairment or chronic kidney disease [^114fZ27y]. Lithium can cause recurrent renal dysfunction, especially in susceptible patients [^112zPy48], and long-term exposure is linked to chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy and CKD [^1116dpVc]. Regular renal function checks are critical to detect early decline [^111rAoay].

---

## Clinical recommendations for restarting lithium therapy

When restarting lithium following a transient creatinine rise, follow these **precautions**:

- **Lower dose**: Start at a reduced dose and titrate slowly [^116CzAef] [^1177veaM].

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check serum lithium, creatinine, and eGFR regularly [^116CzAef] [^115zwJ5V].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize or avoid NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics [^111r1RRr] [^1149fizo].

- **Reassess promptly**: If creatinine rises > 30% or eGFR falls < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², reconsider lithium [^113LV5s7] [^115Mg2Kk].

---

## Alternative mood stabilizers

If lithium is contraindicated or renal function declines, consider these **alternatives** [^113PibFs]:

| **Medication** | **Renal considerations** | **Monitoring requirements** |
|-|-|-|
| Valproate | - Hepatic metabolism <br/> - Minimal renal impact | - Liver function <br/> - Platelets <br/> - Valproate levels |
| Carbamazepine | - Hepatic metabolism <br/> - Minimal renal impact | - Liver function <br/> - CBC <br/> - Carbamazepine levels |
| Lamotrigine | Minimal renal impact | Minimal monitoring |
| Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. quetiapine, olanzapine) | Minimal renal impact | Metabolic monitoring |

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision

A transient creatinine rise that normalizes after stopping lithium is **not a contraindication** to restarting, but it signals **increased renal risk** [^1177veaM]. Restart **cautiously** with lower doses, slow titration, and close monitoring; avoid nephrotoxic drugs and reassess if renal function worsens [^116CzAef]. If decline recurs, discontinue lithium and use alternatives.

- **Dosage adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period**: If the decision is made to continue lithium treatment during pregnancy, monitor serum lithium concentrations and adjust the dosage as needed in a pregnant woman because renal lithium clearance increases during pregnancy. Avoid sodium restriction or diuretic administration. To decrease the risk of postpartum lithium intoxication, decrease or discontinue lithium therapy two to three days before the expected delivery date to reduce neonatal concentrations and reduce the risk of maternal lithium intoxication due to the change in vascular volume which occurs during delivery. At delivery, vascular volume rapidly decreases and the renal clearance of lithium may decrease to pre-pregnancy concentrations. Restart treatment at the preconception dose when the patient is medically stable after delivery with careful monitoring of serum lithium concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

- **Dosage adjustments for patients with renal impairment**: Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 30 to 89 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) with dosages less than those for patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and monitoring for signs of lithium toxicity. Lithium is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault) [see Use in Specific Populations].

### Lithium carbonate [^116CzAef]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

As lithium is eliminated primarily through the kidney, its renal clearance is decreased in patients with abnormal renal function, considerably increasing the risk of lithium intoxication in this setting. Lithium should not be used in cases of severe renal insufficiency, where creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, as evaluated by Cockcroft-Gault, especially if the condition requires adherence to a low-sodium diet [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Start patients with mild to moderately impaired renal function, where creatinine clearance is between 30 to 89 mL/min, with lower doses of lithium. Titrate slowly while frequently monitoring serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Lithium carbonate [^1116dpVc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Lithium-induced chronic kidney disease is predominantly associated with long-term lithium treatment, presenting as a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy (CTIN). Biopsy findings in patients with lithium-induced CTIN include tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, sclerotic glomeruli, tubular dilation, and nephron atrophy with cyst formation. However, the relationship between renal function and morphologic changes, and their association with lithium treatment, has not been fully established. CTIN patients may present with nephrotic proteinuria (> 3.0 g/dL), worsening renal insufficiency, and/or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Postmarketing reports also include cases consistent with nephrotic syndrome in patients with or without CTIN. In patients with nephrotic syndrome, biopsy findings often show minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Discontinuation of lithium in such patients has resulted in remission of nephrotic syndrome.

Kidney function should be assessed prior to and during lithium treatment. Routine urinalysis and other tests may be used to evaluate tubular function (e.g. urine specific gravity or osmolality following a period of water deprivation, or 24-hour urine volume) and glomerular function (e.g. serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, or proteinuria). During lithium treatment, progressive or sudden changes in renal function, even within the normal range, indicate the need for re-evaluation of treatment.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114GQe2G]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Long-term lithium treatment decreases kidney function, but it remains unclear whether stopping lithium improves kidney function.

- **Objectives**: To study kidney function in patients who stopped and subsequently restarted lithium treatment.

- **Methods**: A mirror-image design was used with data from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study. The mirror was set to when lithium was stopped, with a 5-year pre- and post-mirror period. Adult patients with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or unipolar depression, who had lithium for ≥ 4.5 years in the pre-mirror period, were included. Creatinine measurements were available from 1997 to 2017. The main outcome was the difference in mean annual change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) adjusted for sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

- **Results**: A total of 168 participants (94 women, 74 men) were included. Mean annual eGFR change was -1.58 (-1.87 to -1.28) mL/min/1.73 m²/year before and -0.023 (-0.49 to +0.44) mL/min/1.73 m²/year after lithium discontinuation (p < 0.05). The mean annual eGFR change was 1.20 (0.86–1.55) mL/min/1.73 m²/year for participants with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 3.03 (2.15–3.92) mL/min/1.73 m²/year for participants with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The effect was persistent over the 5-year post-mirror study period. For participants restarting lithium, the mean annual eGFR change was -1.71 (-2.26 to -1.16) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, a setback compared to their lithium-free post-mirror period (p < 0.0001). We did not see any difference compared to the pre-mirror period (p = 0.51).

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, specifically with respect to burosumab for adults and monitoring, the XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend discontinuing the dose if the fasting serum phosphate level is above the ULN. It is strongly recommended (Grade X) to restart burosumab at approximately half the previous dose when the serum phosphate concentration falls below the normal range.

### Lanoxin [^117XgXLk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Renal impairment**: The clearance of digoxin is primarily correlated with renal function as indicated by creatinine clearance. Tables 3 and 5 provide the usual daily maintenance dose requirements for digoxin based on creatinine clearance [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Digoxin is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, patients with impaired renal function require smaller than usual maintenance doses of digoxin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Due to the prolonged elimination half-life, a longer period of time is required to achieve an initial or new steady-state serum concentration in patients with renal impairment as compared to those with normal renal function. Without proper dose reduction, such patients are at high risk for toxicity, and toxic effects will last longer than in patients with normal renal function.

- **Hepatic impairment**: Plasma digoxin concentrations in patients with acute hepatitis generally fall within the range of profiles observed in a group of healthy subjects.

- **Malabsorption**: The absorption of digoxin is reduced in some malabsorption conditions, such as chronic diarrhea.

### Dasetta 1/35 [^1151WYzV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after the delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding or four weeks following a second trimester abortion. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on Breast Feeding in General Precautions.)

The risk of circulatory disease in oral contraceptive users may be higher in users of high-dose pills and may be greater with longer duration of oral contraceptive use. Some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. For women aged 20 to 44, it is estimated that about 1 in 2,000 using oral contraceptives will be hospitalized each year because of abnormal clotting, whereas among nonusers in the same age group, about 1 in 20,000 would be hospitalized each year.

### Prolia [^1169wZoC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture**: Prolia is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. This high risk is defined as having a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, Prolia reduces the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis**: Prolia is indicated for increasing bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. This includes men with a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

- **Treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis**: Prolia is indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women at high risk of fracture. This group includes those who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and are expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 6 months. High risk is defined as the presence of a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

### Phosphate restriction prevents metabolic acidosis and curbs rise in FGF23 and mortality in murine folic acid-induced AKI [^114XStyp]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Pi restriction diminished the AKI-induced rise in plasma iFGF23 and cFGF23:

Twenty-four hours after AKI induction, indicators such as kidney weight, plasma urea and creatinine, urinary NGAL, and renal expression of Havcr1 (kidney injury molecule 1) were significantly elevated. Body weight decreased similarly in both FA groups, confirming the induction of AKI. The efficacy of Pi restriction was confirmed by a significantly lower urinary Pi per creatinine ratio in the LP compared with NP groups, independent of FA treatment. Plasma Pi was elevated after FA treatment in the NP group, as previously reported; however, it was unchanged in the LP group. Conversely, plasma total Ca2+ was increased in the LP-FA group but unchanged in the NP-FA group.

- **Kidney injury markers and Pi 24 hours after FA-AKI**: WT male C57BL6/JRj mice were fed either a normal (NP, 0.6% Pi) or low Pi (LP, < 0.1% Pi) diet for 4 days before being treated with FA or NaHCO3 (vehicle) and sacrificed after 24 hours.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^1119gocY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Our study had several strengths. First, we included a relatively large number of participants with proven lithium exposure of at least 4.5 years, with a mean exposure of over 15 years. Second, we meticulously validated our data with medical records going back as far as the 1960s. Therefore, contrary to registry studies, we could accurately determine lithium treatment times and check for other causes of increased creatinine. Third, the mirror‐image design was akin to a natural experiment. By letting participants act as their own controls, we adjusted for potential confounders. Studying the annual change of eGFR in terms of slopes has advantages over absolute eGFR change as an outcome, allowing for sufficient power in smaller populations with shorter follow‐up.

Our study also had limitations. It was retrospective and observational in nature. Reliance on medical records meant that the quality of our data depended on the documentation quality. Further, the study was conducted in a single geographical area in an ethnically relatively homogeneous population and was not designed to specifically address sex differences. We possibly had a selection bias as participants discontinuing lithium might have had a steeper GFR slope than those continuing lithium. This could have led to an overestimation of the magnitude of eGFR loss during lithium treatment.

In 25% of participants, lithium was stopped due to low eGFR. Serum creatinine tends to fluctuate over time, primarily due to changes in hydration and muscle activity.

### Zolgensma [^114u5ByE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) and increases in alanine aminotransferase in the four studies (data cut-off date: September 27, 2018) are summarized in Table 2.

One death occurred in a patient who received Zolgensma at the age of 5 months (6 kg) in a completed non-United States clinical trial (NCT03461289). The patient initially presented with respiratory insufficiency 12 days after Zolgensma infusion and was found to have RSV and parainfluenza in respiratory secretions. The patient had episodes of serious hypotension, followed by seizures, and was found to have leukoencephalopathy (brain white matter defects) approximately 30 days after Zolgensma infusion. The patient died after the withdrawal of life support 52 days after Zolgensma infusion.

- **Immunogenicity**: In Zolgensma clinical trials, patients were required to have baseline anti-AAV9 antibody titers of ≤ 1:50, measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evidence of prior exposure to AAV9 was uncommon. The safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in patients with anti-AAV9 antibody titers above 1:50 have not been evaluated. Perform baseline testing for the presence of anti-AAV9 antibodies prior to Zolgensma infusion. Retesting may be performed if anti-AAV9 antibody titers are reported as > 1:50 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].

Following Zolgensma infusion, increases from baseline in anti-AAV9 antibody titers occurred in all patients. In Study 2, anti-AAV9 antibody titers reached at least 1:102,400 in every patient and titers exceeded 1:819,200 in most patients.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112ffxNr]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetic nephropathy, specifically in laboratory follow-up, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend monitoring increased serum creatinine and serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used. Additionally, they recommend monitoring for hypokalemia when diuretics are used. These should be evaluated at routine visits and 7–14 days after initiation or following a dose change.

### Arbli [^1149fizo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Co-administration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. It is essential to monitor serum potassium in such patients.

- **Lithium**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It is crucial to monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. It is recommended to monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy. Additionally, the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

### Lithium carbonate [^115zwJ5V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Before initiating treatment with lithium, renal function, vital signs, serum electrolytes, and thyroid function should be evaluated. Concurrent medications should be assessed, and if the patient is a woman of childbearing potential, pregnancy status and potential should be considered.

- **Recommended dosage**:
	- See Table 1 for dosage recommendations for acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult and pediatric patients (7 to 17 years). Obtain serum lithium concentration assay after 3 days, drawn 12 hours after the last oral dose, and regularly until the patient is stabilized. Fine hand tremor, polyuria, and thirst may occur during initial therapy for the acute manic phase and may persist throughout treatment. Nausea and general discomfort may also appear during the first few days of lithium administration. These adverse reactions may subside with continued treatment, concomitant administration with food, or temporary reduction or cessation of dosage.

Each 5 mL of lithium oral solution contains 8 mEq of lithium ion (Li+), which is equivalent to the amount of lithium in 300 mg of lithium carbonate.

- **Serum lithium monitoring**:
	- Blood samples for serum lithium determination should be drawn immediately prior to the next dose, when lithium concentrations are relatively stable (i.e. 12 hours after the previous dose). Total reliance must not be placed on serum concentrations alone.

Control for bias and missing data was achieved in LiSIE by accounting for selection bias with key parameters available in anonymized form. These parameters included age, sex, and, where applicable, maximum recorded concentrations of lithium and creatinine. In accordance with the ethics approval granted, these parameters were compared between consenting and non-consenting participants. No significant differences were observed between the two groups. The data were complete for included participants concerning the defined outcome.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112SQfB4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

There have been many proposed mechanisms for the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients taking valacyclovir. The most commonly agreed mechanism among various papers includes crystal nephropathy, which causes obstructive and cellular necrosis. Another mechanism involves the effect of acyclovir aldehyde on tubular dysfunction. Valacyclovir causes direct cell damage, leading to increased membrane permeability. The destruction of mitochondria inhibits key enzymatic activity, leading to cell necrosis.

The patient described in our case study had multiple risk factors that increased her risk of developing AKI. These factors included underlying chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and usage of ACE inhibitors. This combination, in addition to a history of nephrectomy, heightened the risk for acute renal failure. Our case is unique in that it was the first at the time of writing to describe a patient with a history of nephrectomy and use of valacyclovir who developed acute renal failure with neurotoxicity. The patient fits the demographic of an elderly female patient prone to valacyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity.

To rule out other etiologies of acute kidney injury and allow for a definitive diagnosis, a kidney biopsy should be performed. Kato et al. describe renal biopsy findings in an elderly woman with neuronic and nephrotoxic manifestations induced by valacyclovir, which included acute tubular injury with eosinophilic material in the tubular lumen as well as arteriosclerosis, without glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis. However, a limitation in our case was the inability to obtain a renal biopsy due to the patient's condition.

### Espen practical guideline on clinical nutrition in hospitalized patients with acute or chronic kidney disease [^112nY6Hq]. Clinical Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning nutritional support timing, ESPEN 2024 guidelines recommend initiating early nutritional support (within 48 hours from hospital admission). This approach is favored over later nutritional support in polymorbid medical inpatients to decrease sarcopenia and improve self-sufficiency.

### Managing bipolar affective disorder in chronic kidney disease when lithium is no longer an option [^113477UC]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This is the case of a woman in her 70s on lithium maintenance therapy for BPAD while on haemodialysis for ESRD. Similar to case 1, she experienced multiple inpatient admissions for manic episodes in her twenties and then remained stable in her mental state for many years on maintenance lithium therapy. She was diagnosed with CKD stage 3B (eGFR 30, creatinine 164, urea 13.5) while maintaining lithium levels ranging from 0.84 to 0.94. She was referred to nephrology, and her lithium dose was reduced with continued decline in renal function.

Due to continued kidney function decline, lithium was discontinued, and olanzapine and carbamazepine were commenced as alternative mood-stabilizing agents. Her mental health then deteriorated, which led to a prolonged inpatient admission for manic relapse. This necessitated a combination of olanzapine, carbamazepine, and clonazepam to stabilize her mental state. Following discharge home, her mental state failed to return to baseline, and she experienced significant anxiety symptoms and subjective memory impairment.

As she was approaching ESRD, she was referred for consideration of a renal transplant. She was initially listed for transplantation; however, her mental state remained anxious with depressive symptoms. After a protracted assessment and support from nephrology, psychiatry, transplant services, and her family, she was deemed no longer suitable and was delisted for transplant. Renal decline progressed, and she was commenced on haemodialysis. She continues to experience significant depressive symptoms following extensive collaboration.

### Xolair [^114du8pw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Anaphylaxis: Based on spontaneous reports and an estimated exposure of about 57,300 patients from June 2003 through December 2006, the frequency of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair use was estimated to be at least 0.2% of patients.

Diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis were skin or mucosal tissue involvement, and either airway compromise and/or reduced blood pressure with or without associated symptoms, and a temporal relationship to Xolair administration with no other identifiable cause. Signs and symptoms in these reported cases included bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, angioedema of the throat or tongue, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness, and/or cutaneous angioedema. Pulmonary involvement was reported in 89% of the cases. Hypotension or syncope was reported in 14% of cases. Fifteen percent of the reported cases resulted in hospitalization. A previous history of anaphylaxis unrelated to Xolair was reported in 24% of the cases.

Of the reported cases of anaphylaxis attributed to Xolair, 39% occurred with the first dose, 19% occurred with the second dose, 10% occurred with the third dose, and the rest after subsequent doses. One case occurred after 39 doses; after 19 months of continuous therapy, anaphylaxis occurred when treatment was restarted following a 3-month gap. The time to onset of anaphylaxis in these cases was up to 30 minutes in 35%, greater than 30 and up to 60 minutes in 16%, greater than 60 and up to 90 minutes in 2%, greater than 90 and up to 120 minutes in 6%, greater than 2 hours and up to 6 hours in 5%, greater than 6 hours and up to 12 hours.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115Mg2Kk]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to requirements for laboratories, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend flagging an eGFR creatinine level. Laboratories should conduct a thorough examination for markers when the eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for over 3 months and monitor kidney function at least annually unless further kidney damage is suspected. For patients younger than 18 years, it is critical to consult a pediatric nephrology expert for evaluations.

- **Clinical parameters**: Facilities should maintain a detailed record of blood pressure, urine albumin, and creatinine levels, ensuring consistency and accuracy in measurements.
- **Monitoring protocols**: It is advised that any abnormalities noted in the eGFR readings are corroborated with parallel tests such as cystatin C measurements to ensure the diagnosis' accuracy.

The guidelines emphasize that patient education is pivotal. Informing patients about the significance of kidney health and the implications of eGFR readings can greatly contribute to the prevention and management of renal deterioration.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to the initiation of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend offering these inhibitors after iron repletion. This applies to patients with symptomatic anemia (hemoglobin < 105 g/L) in CKD (stages 3–5, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m²) who are not receiving dialysis at the start of therapy. These patients are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function, and avoiding blood transfusion is particularly emphasized for those considered suitable for transplantation.

### Risk of chronic kidney disease in individuals on lithium therapy in Iceland: A nationwide retrospective cohort study [^114fZ27y]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

The association between lithium use and chronic kidney disease, and the effect of comorbidities on this association, are poorly understood. Our aim was to examine the risk of developing stage 3 or higher chronic kidney disease among people receiving lithium therapy.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all adults (aged ≥ 18 years) in Iceland treated with lithium for a mood disorder who had two or more serum creatinine measurements available in the years 2008–2017, irrespective of the duration of lithium therapy. These individuals were identified from the Prescription Medicines Register of the Directorate of Health or through blood lithium measurements. The control group comprised all eligible outpatients with mood disorders (ICD-10 codes F30-F39) who had not been prescribed lithium and who had attended the national tertiary referral centre in 2014–2016. Individuals with chronic kidney disease (identified by ICD codes or an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) before January 1, 2008, or those with glomerular disease, genetic or congenital kidney disease, or small kidneys diagnosed before or after 2008, were excluded. Chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher were defined according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. The eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine. All ICD-10 and ICD-9 diagnosis codes, serum creatinine and blood lithium concentrations, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios were obtained from healthcare institutions.

### Sulindac [^111r1RRr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Cyclosporine**: Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.

- **Diflunisal**: The concomitant administration of sulindac and diflunisal in normal volunteers resulted in a lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.

- **Diuretics**: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that sulindac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to ensure diuretic efficacy.

- **DMSO**: DMSO should not be used with sulindac. Concomitant administration has been reported to reduce the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite and potentially reduce efficacy. Additionally, this combination has been reported to cause peripheral neuropathy.

- **Lithium**: NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased by 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114STYkA]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to renal replacement therapy (RRT), the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating dialysis in the presence of one or more of the following conditions, often but not invariably occurring in the glomerular filtration rate range of 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- **Symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure**: Such symptoms include neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities.

- **Inability to control volume status or blood pressure (BP)**.

- **Progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention, or cognitive impairment**.

### Effects of long-term lithium therapy on kidney functioning in mood disorders: A population-based historical cohort study [^116YHgG8]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Lithium is Food and Drug Administration-approved for bipolar disorder (BD) and is also used in depressive disorders, but it is underutilized due to concerns about chronic kidney disease (CKD). We explored the clinical and demographic profiles of patients on long-term lithium therapy (LTLT) and assessed kidney function. Our aims were to identify the predictors for CKD stage ≥ 3 and the impact of lithium discontinuation post-CKD diagnosis.

We conducted a population-based historical cohort study of adult patients with mood disorders on LTLT at the Marshfield Clinical Health System from 1990 to 2019. Data on lithium therapy and kidney-related information, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate and CKD, were extracted from electronic medical records.

Among 1603 patients with mood disorders (mean age 42.1 years, 60% females), 15.3% (n = 246) developed CKD stage ≥ 3. Patients without CKD were on lithium for 4.5 years, compared to 6.6 years for those with CKD. Hypertension, age, and BD were significant CKD risk factors. Kidney function declined linearly with lithium duration, returning to the pre-treatment trajectory in patients without CKD, but showed no improvement in those with CKD after lithium discontinuation.

These findings suggest that CKD occurs in 15% of patients with mood disorders receiving LTLT, with its progression potentially influenced by existing comorbidities rather than lithium alone. These results underscore the importance of monitoring kidney function in patients on LTLT and considering individual risk factors for CKD development.

### Managing bipolar affective disorder in chronic kidney disease when lithium is no longer an option [^113PibFs]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Should a decision to continue lithium and 'watch and wait' be made, a shared care plan involving nephrology, psychiatry, the patient, their carer, and their General Practitioner is useful in guiding management. A decision to stop lithium can be made following discussion with relevant parties and consideration of the physical health risks vs. the risk of major relapse. Factors that may affect this decision include the rate of deterioration in renal function, other physical health comorbidities, the patient's previous response to alternative agents, and the patient's typical course of illness.

There are many alternative agents to lithium that can be considered for the treatment of acute relapse or maintenance.

- **Anticonvulsants and antipsychotic medications**: Sodium valproate was commonly used, either as an alternative to, or in conjunction with lithium for many years. However, the use of valproate has fallen significantly in recent years due to international guidelines introduced to mitigate the risk of teratogenic effects. Carbamazepine can be considered an alternative to lithium for the management of mania but is considered second-line due to tolerability.

- **Atypical antipsychotics**: Risperidone, haloperidol, and olanzapine are highly efficacious alternatives as monotherapy.

- **Benzodiazepines**: These are often used to manage acute episodes and may be used as polytherapy for maintenance, but longer-term use carries a significant risk of dependence.

While monotherapy is associated with improved tolerability and compliance, polytherapy has been shown to be more efficacious.

### Hyzaar [^117LHBtG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

- **Lithium**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazide diuretics. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving Hyzaar and lithium.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors**:

	- **Losartan potassium**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, the coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

	- **Hydrochlorothiazide**: The administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing, and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when Hyzaar and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

### Triumeq PD [^115yEYef]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Due to the potential for severe, serious, and possibly fatal hypersensitivity reactions with abacavir, all patients should be screened for the HLA‑B✱5701 allele prior to initiating therapy with Triumeq or Triumeq PD, or reinitiation of therapy with Triumeq or Triumeq PD, unless patients have a previously documented HLA‑B✱5701 allele assessment. Triumeq and Triumeq PD are contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir and in HLA‑B✱5701‑positive patients.

Before starting Triumeq or Triumeq PD, review medical history for prior exposure to any abacavir-containing product. Never restart Triumeq or Triumeq PD or any other abacavir-containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, regardless of HLA‑B✱5701 status.

To reduce the risk of a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction, regardless of HLA‑B✱5701 status, discontinue Triumeq or Triumeq PD immediately if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, even when other diagnoses are possible (e.g. acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or influenza; gastroenteritis; or reactions to other medications). Clinical status, including liver chemistries, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated.

If a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out, do not restart Triumeq or Triumeq PD or any other abacavir-containing products, because more severe symptoms, which may include life-threatening hypotension and death, can occur within hours. Clinically, it is not possible to determine whether a hypersensitivity reaction with Triumeq or Triumeq PD…

### Operando real-space imaging of a structural phase transformation in the high-voltage electrode LiNiMnO [^115Kx67z]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1c–j presents the central slice of the measured operando 3D diffraction data as a function of depth of discharge (DoD, in equilibrium equivalent to x in Li x Ni 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4) for the 111 Bragg peak of both phases (see Fig. S4 for the full dataset with 50 measurements). At 0% DoD, corresponding to the fully charged state, only one Bragg peak surrounded by interference fringes appears at the larger momentum transfer, normal to the (111) planes (Fig. 1c).

During the initial stages of discharge, spanning from 0% to 35% DoD, the main peak shows variations in its interference fringes, suggesting local structural changes within the nanoparticle due to lithium intercalation (Figs. 1d and S4). From 0% to 15.3% DoD (Fig. S4), a flare appears on the main peak. We interpret this flare as x-ray interference due to changes in the displacement field from Li intercalation, rather than the emergence of a second structural phase. There is a slight decrease of the peak position, indicating solid solution behavior during the initial introduction of lithium.

Starting between 41.5% and 50.5% DoD (Fig. 1e, f), a secondary peak emerges, steadily gaining intensity at the cost of diminishing intensity in the primary peak (Fig. 1e–i). This is the hallmark of a discontinuous structural phase transformation, characterized by a substantial variation in the order parameter (namely, the lattice constant). The presence of both diffraction peaks emanating from an individual sub-micrometer crystal indicates phase coexistence.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114F7tQL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Lithium discontinuation slowed down the mean eGFR decline in the whole study group. This observation was consistent throughout the 5-year observation period following lithium discontinuation. The effect was more pronounced in participants with lower eGFR at the time of lithium discontinuation. In participants who restarted lithium, the mean annual decline of eGFR reverted to pre-lithium discontinuation levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a bi-directional association between lithium treatment and kidney function, indicating that the decline of eGFR improves when lithium is discontinued and worsens again when lithium is reinstated.

In our literature review, we found 10 other studies exploring the effect of lithium discontinuation on kidney function, reported either as GFR or creatinine clearance (Supporting Information Table A1). Two additional studies re-analyzed datasets from the previous 10 studies. Of all identified studies, three showed significant improvement, eight demonstrated no significant difference after stopping lithium, and one report found kidney function decline to be significantly accelerated after discontinuation. This report is an update on a previous study. The original study did not find any difference when comparing eGFR over 4 years in participants with eGFR < 45 in whom lithium was continued compared to participants in whom lithium was reduced or discontinued. The later follow-up found a difference in favor of continuing lithium. Details on the statistical analysis and characteristics of participants were not reported.

### Trazimera [^114HK1Ya]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Immunogenicity**: As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other trastuzumab products may be misleading. Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer, human anti-human antibody (HAHA) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This patient did not experience an allergic reaction. Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer.

- **Post-marketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], immune thrombocytopenia, and tumor lysis.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^114KDVSw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The mirror periods were set to begin when lithium was stopped. If lithium was tapered, the date of the first dose reduction was used. The pre-mirror period was established as 5 years. The post-mirror period was also set to 5 years unless another event interfered, such as:

- **Events affecting assessment**:
	- The start of chronic renal replacement therapy
	- Death
	- The end-of-study date, 31 December 2017
	- Restarting lithium, defined as continuous treatment for longer than 90 days
	- The occurrence of other somatic diseases either affecting kidney function or leading to a loss of muscle mass, impeding the interpretation of creatinine-based eGFR

If a participant was diagnosed with a somatic disease affecting creatinine interpretation during the pre-mirror period, data were included only up to the time of diagnosis, with all following post-mirror data excluded. For the analysis of eGFR changes after restarting lithium, the observation time was extended to a further minimum of 2 years after reinstatement, resulting in a maximal observation time of 7 years in participants who had discontinued and then reinstated lithium (Supporting Information Fig. A1).

### Descovy [^112wkFes]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Immune reconstitution syndrome**: Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including FTC, a component of Descovy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.

- **New onset or worsening renal impairment**: Postmarketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure, proximal renal tubulopathy (PRT), and Fanconi syndrome, have been reported with TAF-containing products. While most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events, it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir-related adverse events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Descovy is not recommended in individuals with estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL per minute, or in individuals with estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL per minute who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis.

### Treximet [^116wu4WE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:

	- Drugs that interfere with hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking Treximet with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. The concomitant use of Treximet and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.

	- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Concomitant use with Treximet in the elderly, volume-depleted patients, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high-risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function.

	- **Diuretics**: NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of loop and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to ensure diuretic efficacy, including antihypertensive effects.

	- **Digoxin**: Concomitant use with Treximet can increase serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels.

	- **Lithium**: Increases lithium plasma levels.

	- **Methotrexate**: Increases methotrexate plasma levels.

- **Clinically significant drug interactions with Treximet**: See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with NSAIDs or Sumatriptan.

- **Drug/laboratory test interactions**:

	- **Blood tests**: Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined.

	- **Urine tests**: Administration of naproxen sodium may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^116xHSgd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

We could not fully account for the differences in the treatment of CKD that took place during the study period. Sodium-glucose transporter protein 2 inhibitors had not been generally adopted or promoted during the observation period. Around 35% of the participants had CKD stage G3b or worse. In these cases, it can be expected that improvements were made in the treatment of hypertension and diabetes, including a widespread adoption of RAAS-inhibitors. There was indeed a higher prescription rate of RAAS-inhibitors in the post-mirror period, which might have led to an underestimation of the benefit of discontinuation in participants with CKD in the short run and/or to an overestimation of the effect in the long run. Yet, the absolute difference in RAAS-inhibition was small, and we believe that this only had a marginal effect.

Finally, there was a loss of participants for follow-up in the post-mirror period. This was mainly due to lithium having been reinstated following a short lithium-free period or lithium having been discontinued because of severe physical illness. In participants discontinuing lithium because of severe illness, creatinine-based eGFR could have either declined more rapidly due to comorbidities or more slowly due to weight and muscle loss. To avoid this, we excluded measurements that coincided with significant weight loss. In this respect, measured GFR or cystatin-C-based eGFR would have been better but was available in only a few participants.

Importantly, potential renal benefits of lithium discontinuation need to be weighed against potential risks to mental health.

### Voraxaze [^1173LN83]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or other glucarpidase products may be misleading.

In clinical trials, 121 patients who received one (n = 99), two (n = 21), or three (n = 1) doses of Voraxaze were evaluated for anti-glucarpidase antibodies. Twenty-five of these 121 patients (21%) had detectable anti-glucarpidase antibodies following Voraxaze administration, of which 19 received one dose and six received two doses. Antibody titers were determined using a bridging enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-glucarpidase antibodies.

Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 11 of the 25 patients who tested positive for anti-glucarpidase binding antibodies. Eight of these 11 patients had received a single dose of Voraxaze; however, the development of neutralizing antibodies may be underreported due to lack of assay sensitivity.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide**: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or thiazides. Monitor lithium levels in patients taking Diovan HCT.

	- **Valsartan**:
		- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium, and in heart failure patients, to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.

		- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy.

### A first-in-class Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein activator with antitumor activity in hematologic cancers [^114V6iaE]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

Gene expression profiling was conducted on the REC1 cell line, which was exposed to DMSO and EG-011 (500 nM) for 8 hours. This was performed using the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Data processing and statistical analysis were carried out with R/Bioconductor as previously described, with transcript mapping based on HG19 using manufacturer-supplied annotation. Data analysis was facilitated using the omics playground platform (https://bigomics.ch).

- **Kinase assay screening**: EG-011 was evaluated against 468 human kinases at a concentration of 1 μM using the KINOMEscan assay, which is ATP independent (Discoverx, CA, USA). Additionally, it was assessed at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μM against 320 kinases through a regular ATP-related assay (Wildtype-Profiler, ProQinase, Freiburg, Germany).

- **Thermal proteome profiling, surface plasmon resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance**: Thermal proteome profiling experiments were conducted as described by Franken et al, with some modifications. Further details regarding these experiments are provided in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

- **Functional Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein experiments and pyrene actin assembly assays**: Full methodological details are provided in the Online Supplementary Materials and Methods.

- **Immunofluorescence**: Due to protocol incompatibility, the VL51 sensitive cell line was used in immunofluorescence studies, instead of the REC1 cell line. Complete information on the immunofluorescence studies is available in the Online Supplementary Materials.

### Ilumya [^116Uk3E1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the comparison of the incidence of antibodies to tildrakizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.

Up to Week 64, approximately 6.5% of subjects treated with Ilumya 100 mg developed antibodies to tildrakizumab. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, approximately 40% (2.5% of all subjects receiving Ilumya) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. The development of neutralizing antibodies to tildrakizumab was associated with lower serum tildrakizumab concentrations and reduced efficacy.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^112zPy48]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In total, 48 participants reinstated lithium following a median of 0.51 (IQR 1.05) years of lithium discontinuation. Thereafter, data were included for a median of 2.81 (IQR 3.56) years, with 732 creatinine samples available for analysis. Events ending the observation period after restarting lithium are presented in Supporting Information Table A3. The annual eGFR change after restarting lithium was −1.71 (CI 95% −2.26 to −1.16) mL/min/1.73 m²/year. The difference compared to the lithium‐free post‐discontinuation slope was −1.52 (CI 95% −2.08 to −0.96) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, p < 0.0001. The difference in annual change of eGFR compared to the pre‐mirror slope was non‐significant, with −0.15 (CI 95% −0.61 to +0.30) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, p = 0.51. The findings are illustrated in a model for eGFR changes with or without lithium in comparison to the expected physiological changes (Fig. 3).

### Besremi [^111zdnxb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving interferon alfa products, including Besremi. These toxicities may include increases in serum ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin. Besremi is contraindicated in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) or severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

Increases in serum ALT ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), AST ≥ 3 times the ULN, GGT ≥ 3 times the ULN, and bilirubin > 2 times the ULN have been observed in patients treated with Besremi.

In the clinical development program of Besremi, 36 patients (20%) experienced liver enzyme elevations, 33 of whom had elevations of 1.25–5× ULN. Patients were able to resume Besremi upon resolution of liver enzyme elevations. Liver enzyme elevations have also been reported in patients after long-term Besremi therapy.

Monitor liver enzymes and hepatic function at baseline and during Besremi treatment. Reduce Besremi dosage by 50 mcg for increased AST/ALT/GGT, then monitor AST/ALT/GGT weekly until the values return to baseline or grade 1. Consider permanent discontinuation if increased liver enzyme levels persist after four dose reductions. Discontinue Besremi in patients who develop evidence of significant hepatotoxicity.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^116ZW1Lu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Long-term lithium treatment decreases kidney function, yet it remains unclear whether stopping lithium improves kidney function. This study aimed to evaluate kidney function in patients who discontinued and later restarted lithium treatment.

The study used a mirror-image design with data from the LiSIE retrospective cohort study. The mirror was set to the point when lithium was stopped, with a 5-year pre- and post-mirror period. Adult patients with bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or unipolar depression who had lithium treatment for at least 4.5 years in the pre-mirror period were included. Creatinine measurements were collected from 1997 to 2017. The primary outcome was the difference in mean annual change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), adjusted for sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.

A total of 168 participants (94 women, 74 men) were included. Before discontinuation, the mean annual eGFR change was −1.58 (−1.87 to −1.28) mL/min/1.73 m²/year. After lithium discontinuation, it was −0.023 (−0.49 to +0.44) mL/min/1.73 m²/year for participants with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 3.03 (2.15–3.92) mL/min/1.73 m²/year for those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The effect persisted over the 5-year post-mirror study period. For participants who restarted lithium, the mean annual eGFR change was −1.71 (−2.26 to −1.16) mL/min/1.73 m²/year, a noticeable setback compared to their lithium-free post-mirror period (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference compared to the pre-mirror period (p = 0.51).

### Inpefa [^115s65rN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **Digoxin**: Monitor digoxin levels.
	- Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase inducers (e.g. rifampin): Sotagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider monitoring of clinical status.
	- **Lithium**: Monitor serum lithium concentrations.

- **Digoxin**: There is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with Inpefa 400 mg. Patients taking Inpefa with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) inducer**: Glucuronidation by UGT1A9, to form the 3-O-glucuronide, was identified as a major metabolic pathway for sotagliflozin. The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with a single dose of 400 mg sotagliflozin, resulted in a decrease in the exposure to sotagliflozin. This decrease in exposure may decrease efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Lithium**: Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during Inpefa initiation and dosage changes.

### Kidney function decline improves after lithium discontinuation [^117QA6ot]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Our results suggest a more favorable renal prognosis after lithium discontinuation, even at low eGFR. The beneficial effect of lithium discontinuation seems to persist for at least 5 years. In terms of long-term kidney outcome, earlier rather than later lithium discontinuation will probably be more favorable. Once lithium is restarted, the eGFR decline can be expected to resume to previous levels. We need to better understand which factors put lithium-treated patients on steep trajectories of eGFR decline and how best to counter such factors. Equally, we need to better understand which patients can discontinue lithium safely in terms of mental health and which cannot. The potential for an improved kidney prognosis must be weighed against the potential for a worse psychiatric course with an increased risk of relapse into an affective episode and suicide. A patient-centered, not a kidney-centered approach is needed to find the best balance between mental and renal health.

### Elzonris [^113M2aVF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Elzonris with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Immune response to Elzonris was evaluated by assessment of serum binding reactivity against Elzonris (anti-drug antibodies; ADA) and neutralizing antibodies by inhibition of functional activity.

Immune response to Elzonris was assessed using two immunoassays:

- **Anti-drug antibodies (ADA)**: The first assay detected reactivity directed against Elzonris (ADA).
- **Interleukin-3 (IL-3) portion**: The second assay detected reactivity against the interleukin-3 (IL-3) portion of Elzonris.

Two cell-based assays were used to investigate the presence of neutralizing antibodies by inhibition of a cell-based functional activity.

In 130 patients treated with Elzonris in four clinical trials:

- 96% (115/120) of patients evaluable for the presence of pre-existing ADA at baseline before treatment were confirmed positive, with 21% being positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. The high prevalence of ADA at baseline was anticipated due to diphtheria immunization.
- 99% (107/108) of patients evaluable for treatment-emergent ADA tested positive, with most patients showing an increase in ADA titer by the end of Cycle 2.

### Lithium carbonate [^113DfM28]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Lactation**: Limited published data report the presence of lithium carbonate in human milk, with breast milk levels measured at 0.12 to 0.7 mEq or 40 to 45% of maternal plasma levels. Infants exposed to lithium during breastfeeding may have plasma levels that are 30 to 40% of maternal plasma levels. Signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity, such as hypertonia, hypothermia, cyanosis, and ECG changes, have been reported in some breastfed neonates and infants. Increased prolactin levels have been measured in lactating women, but the effects on milk production are not known. Breastfeeding is not recommended with maternal lithium use. However, if a woman chooses to breastfeed, the infant should be closely monitored for signs of lithium toxicity. Discontinue breastfeeding if a breastfed infant develops lithium toxicity.

- **Clinical considerations**: Consider regular monitoring of lithium levels and thyroid function in a breastfed infant.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of lithium for monotherapy treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder and maintenance monotherapy of bipolar I disorder in pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years have been established in an acute-phase clinical trial of 8 weeks in duration, followed by a 28-week randomized withdrawal phase [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of lithium have not been established in pediatric patients less than 7 years of age with bipolar I disorder.

### Combination blood pressure lowering therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes: Messages from the ADVANCE trial [^1115Qbtp]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Hirakawa et al. assessed the association between the discontinuation of study BP lowering treatment and adverse clinical outcomes in ADVANCE. Although discontinuation of active treatment was uncommon in ADVANCE (only 1% lower adherence in active versus placebo), patients who permanently discontinued randomized BP lowering medication during the study period (n = 1557), compared to those who continued active treatment (n = 9583), experienced an increased risk of combined macrovascular and microvascular events (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.96–2.57) and all-cause mortality (HR 7.99, 6.92–9.21). These findings highlight the importance of adherence to therapy in at-risk individuals, and any discontinuation of therapy should flag patients for urgent investigation and management.

Transient increases in serum creatinine are a known and expected effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and treatment discontinuation is recommended if patients experience a ≥ 30% increase in serum creatinine after commencement of therapy. However, the long-term effects of continued or discontinued treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors following a creatinine rise were unknown. The ADVANCE trial included a six-week active run-in period where all patients received perindopril and indapamide, after which patients were then randomized to continue treatment or discontinue treatment and start placebo. Ohkuma et al. studied the association between increases in serum creatinine during the 6-week active run-in period, and the benefit of continued randomized therapy with perindopril and indapamide versus placebo.

### Managing bipolar affective disorder in chronic kidney disease when lithium is no longer an option [^1153j3H6]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, necessitating individualized medication dosing and frequent serum lithium level assessments during acute titration. Levels should be checked 1 week after each dose change and weekly until stable. In stable patients, serum lithium concentrations and renal function monitoring should occur at a minimum of every 3–6 months, with target serum lithium trough concentrations between 0.6 and 1.2 mmol/L. Enhanced monitoring is recommended if kidney function is declining; however, these guidelines do not provide advice for those approaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or on hemodialysis.

According to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD), serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are used as markers of CKD. If an adult without a history of kidney function impairment has an eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², the test should be repeated in 2 weeks. For those with a confirmed eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria should be assessed using the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR).

CKD is classified using a combination of ACR and eGFR categories, which together indicate the risk of adverse outcomes, including CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. A renal ultrasound is indicated if the eGFR is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². It is essential to address other risk factors contributing to the progression of CKD, including lifestyle factors (such as NSAID use and smoking) and comorbidities (such as hypertension and diabetes). Referral to a specialist service is indicated if there is accelerated CKD progression, defined as a sustained decrease in kidney function.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111k56ZZ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning the initiation of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron-replete to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs.

- **Iron status criteria**: Percentage of hypochromic red cells < 6%, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration < 31 pg. Ferritin and transferrin saturation should be > 100 mcg/L and > 20% for patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis, and > 200 mcg/L for patients on hemodialysis.

- **Pediatric guidelines**: Ferritin should be > 100 mcg/L for children with CKD on dialysis as well as for children with CKD not on ESAs.

- **Iron administration considerations**: Administer iron when ferritin is < 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation is < 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Trintellix [^114G3m2N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: Advise patients and caregivers to monitor for the emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviors, especially early during treatment or when the dosage is adjusted. They should report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Concomitant medication**: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or planning to take, any prescription or over-the-counter medications due to potential interactions. Patients should not take TRINTELLIX with an MAOI or within 14 days of stopping an MAOI, and they must allow 21 days after stopping TRINTELLIX before starting an MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, especially with the concomitant use of TRINTELLIX and certain medications, such as triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan supplements, buspirone, and St. John's Wort, as well as drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin, particularly MAOIs, including those for psychiatric disorders and other uses like linezolid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome.

- **Increased risk of bleeding**: Inform patients about potential risks.

### Apadaz [^116nGmYR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydrocodone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This approach reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and the presence of concomitant disease or other drug therapies.

Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Apadaz slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Hydrocodone and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.

- **Hepatic impairment**: The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Apadaz has not been determined. Patients with hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function. Use a low initial dose of Apadaz in patients with hepatic impairment or active liver disease and regularly evaluate for adverse events such as respiratory depression and hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions].
