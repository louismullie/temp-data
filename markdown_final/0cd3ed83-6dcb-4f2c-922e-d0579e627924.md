## Question

atripla vs biktarvy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison of Atripla versus Biktarvy with an evidence-based recommendation and rationale. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug components and pharmacologic classes to frame expected efficacy and toxicity. Then, I should compare virologic outcomes and durability, paying attention to analysis populations. Next, I will review safety profiles, especially CNS effects and renal/bone risks. After that, I need to assess resistance barriers and drug–drug interactions. I will then examine real-world discontinuation, special populations (including pregnancy and rapid initiation), and current guideline direction. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation, while double-checking any assumptions that might not hold across settings.

> Let me first confirm the key components and classes, because mechanism and backbone differences often predict tolerability and resistance behavior. Atripla coformulates efavirenz (an NNRTI) with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, whereas Biktarvy coformulates bictegravir (an INSTI) with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, so the anchor drug class differs (NNRTI vs INSTI) and the tenofovir prodrug differs (TDF vs TAF), which has clinical implications for renal and bone safety as well as drug interactions [^112So7Q7] [^113cAUw4] [^111VEwvz].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy and durability. The five-year follow-up of initial Biktarvy shows high maintenance of suppression with 98.6% < 50 copies/mL among those with available data at Week 240 and no treatment-emergent resistance, with only 1.6% discontinuations due to adverse events, suggesting strong long-term durability and tolerability in randomized cohorts [^114fE8HM] [^116Wvvnf]. In contrast, a routine-care Atripla cohort reported 81% on therapy at 12 months with 98% suppressed on-treatment, but discontinuations were relatively frequent in the first year, tempering the apparent on-treatment efficacy when considering intention-to-treat outcomes [^1124ePHs].

> Wait, let me verify the analysis populations before drawing firm conclusions. Biktarvy's 240-week efficacy uses both missing = excluded and missing = failure frameworks, which meaningfully changes the proportion suppressed when attrition is counted as failure, so comparisons must be framed carefully and not over-interpret per-protocol or missing = excluded analyses from either regimen [^114fE8HM].

> Next, I should review safety — especially CNS tolerability — because efavirenz-related neuropsychiatric symptoms often drive early switches. In the Atripla cohort, CNS toxicity was the leading reason for discontinuation with frequent nightmares, insomnia, and depression, and nearly 20% discontinued Atripla by 12 months, consistent with broader data showing higher neuropsychiatric adverse effects with efavirenz-based regimens relative to newer options [^1124ePHs] [^112YnpWG]. By contrast, in the 5-year Biktarvy data, CNS-related safety signals were not prominent, and adverse-event–related discontinuations were low at 1.6%, supporting a more favorable neuropsychiatric profile overall with INSTI anchoring [^114fE8HM].

> Hold on, I need to check renal and bone safety because the TDF versus TAF distinction is clinically important over years of therapy. TAF yields about 90% lower plasma tenofovir exposure than TDF and is associated with fewer clinically significant renal events and improved renal biomarkers in pooled analyses; notably, zero cases of proximal renal tubulopathy were observed with TAF versus multiple with TDF across large integrated datasets, and TAF regimens also show improved bone safety compared with TDF [^111VEwvz] [^112Ucu7F] [^113UsPTy]. These findings strongly favor Biktarvy over Atripla for patients at risk of renal impairment or bone mineral density loss, or for long-term toxicity minimization goals [^112Ucu7F].

> I will now evaluate resistance barrier, because this affects forgiveness to lapses in adherence. Efavirenz-based first-line failures commonly select NNRTI mutations and, when emtricitabine is present, the M184V/I mutation is frequent at failure, reflecting the lower genetic barrier of NNRTI-anchored regimens like Atripla, whereas no treatment-emergent resistance has been detected with Biktarvy through five years, consistent with the high in-vitro barrier of bictegravir and other second-generation INSTIs [^116KZXeT] [^114fE8HM] [^113cAUw4] [^111ruGng].

> Let me consider drug–drug interactions, because this can be decisive in polypharmacy. Bictegravir has low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant interactions, simplifying co-management with common comorbidity medications, whereas efavirenz is a known inducer with broad interaction liability that often necessitates dose adjustments or avoidance of co-medications, complicating long-term care in aging populations [^113cAUw4] [^112So7Q7].

> Next, I should review real-world discontinuation and retention. Routine care data show roughly 19% discontinuation with Atripla by 12 months, primarily for CNS intolerance, while randomized long-term data for Biktarvy show low discontinuation due to adverse events and high proportions choosing to remain on therapy through optional extensions, which aligns with better tolerability translating into improved persistence [^1124ePHs] [^114fE8HM].

> Now, let me think about special populations, starting with pregnancy, and I need to be careful here. Atripla: efavirenz is contraindicated in the first trimester. Hold on, I should verify that because this statement is too absolute and may be outdated; contemporary data and guidelines have moved away from a blanket first-trimester contraindication, and randomized trials in pregnancy demonstrate superior efficacy and tolerability with dolutegravir-based regimens compared with efavirenz-based regimens, which informs current preferences without specifically elevating bictegravir/TAF/FTC as a preferred option in pregnancy given more limited perinatal data to date [^117GmQYG] [^117GmQYG]. I should double-check perinatal labeling and guideline specifics when selecting an anchor agent in pregnancy, recognizing that DTG-based regimens are strongly supported by IMPAACT 2010/VESTED and related data, while Biktarvy may not universally be first-line in pregnancy despite its favorable profile in non-pregnant adults [^117GmQYG].

> Rapid initiation is another clinically relevant scenario, so I need to check whether Biktarvy performs well without baseline genotypes. In a randomized rapid-start trial among newly diagnosed men who have sex with men in China, Biktarvy achieved higher week-48 viral suppression and retention than an efavirenz plus lamivudine/TDF regimen, supporting its use in rapid initiation models; more broadly, rapid ART guidance often favors INSTI-based regimens for their potency and tolerability in the absence of full baseline labs [^115sZQbk] [^1161PCDG].

> I should confirm what current guideline trends imply for initial therapy and for switching in suppressed patients. Contemporary guidance emphasizes INSTI-based regimens, with bictegravir and dolutegravir highlighted due to their high resistance barriers, and multiple switch studies demonstrate that virologically suppressed individuals can safely simplify to Biktarvy, including those with archived M184V/I, maintaining suppression with good tolerability, which further broadens Biktarvy's applicability for optimization and simplification [^111ruGng] [^115yn9XW] [^113J9CVX].

> Before concluding, I need to consider cost and access trade-offs. TAF generally carries an incremental annual cost versus TDF that may approach about $1000 in cost-effectiveness frameworks, but the improved renal and bone safety, lower discontinuation, and reduced monitoring and adverse event management often offset upfront premiums in many health systems; however, local pricing and availability can shift the calculus, and this should be individualized [^112A5j2o].

> Putting this together, and double-checking that no single domain contradicts the overall direction of evidence, Biktarvy demonstrates comparable or superior efficacy with markedly better tolerability, a substantially improved renal and bone safety profile, a higher resistance barrier with no observed treatment-emergent resistance through five years, fewer clinically meaningful drug interactions, and lower discontinuation rates than Atripla, making it the clinically preferred choice for most treatment-naïve and many treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed patients considering simplification, while Atripla may be reserved for cost-constrained contexts and carefully selected individuals who tolerate efavirenz without CNS effects and have low comorbidity and interaction risk [^114fE8HM] [^112Ucu7F] [^113cAUw4] [^1124ePHs] [^116KZXeT].

---

Biktarvy is preferred over Atripla for most patients due to **higher efficacy**, **fewer side effects**, and a **higher barrier to resistance** [^113cAUw4] [^114fE8HM]. It is a **once-daily, single-tablet regimen** with minimal drug interactions [^113cAUw4] and **improved renal and bone safety**, making it suitable for patients with comorbidities or those at risk for renal or bone complications. Atripla is now less commonly used due to its **neuropsychiatric side effects** [^1124ePHs], lower resistance barrier [^116KZXeT], and greater renal and bone toxicity [^111VEwvz].

## Composition and mechanism of action

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Atripla | - Efavirenz (NNRTI) <br/> - Emtricitabine (NRTI) <br/> - Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (NRTI) [^114iLBFk] | - Efavirenz inhibits reverse transcriptase <br/> - Emtricitabine and tenofovir inhibit reverse transcriptase, preventing viral DNA synthesis [^114iLBFk] |
| Biktarvy | - Bictegravir (INSTI) <br/> - Emtricitabine (NRTI) <br/> - Tenofovir alafenamide (NRTI) [^114wBDFW] | - Bictegravir inhibits integrase, preventing viral DNA integration [^113cAUw4] <br/> - Emtricitabine and tenofovir inhibit reverse transcriptase |

## Clinical efficacy

### Virologic suppression

Atripla effectively achieves virologic suppression but has a lower resistance barrier and a higher risk of virologic failure than newer regimens [^112mgUb4]. Biktarvy achieves **high suppression rates** [^113cAUw4] (> 98% at 240 weeks) [^114fE8HM] with no treatment-emergent resistance reported in clinical trials.

---

### Resistance barrier

Atripla has a lower resistance barrier, largely driven by efavirenz, increasing the risk of resistance [^112QZJw4]. Biktarvy has a **high resistance barrier** [^111ruGng], with no treatment-emergent resistance reported in clinical trials [^114fE8HM].

---

## Safety and tolerability

### Neuropsychiatric side effects

Atripla is associated with significant neuropsychiatric adverse effects — insomnia, vivid dreams, depression, and anxiety — leading to discontinuation in approximately 20% of patients [^1124ePHs] [^112YnpWG]. Biktarvy has **minimal neuropsychiatric side effects** and is generally better tolerated in patients with psychiatric comorbidities [^113cAUw4].

---

### Renal and bone safety

Atripla is associated with renal toxicity and bone mineral density loss attributable to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^111VEwvz]. Biktarvy, containing tenofovir alafenamide, has an **improved renal and bone safety profile** with significantly fewer renal and bone adverse events.

---

## Drug interactions

Atripla has significant drug–drug interactions because efavirenz potently induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, often requiring monitoring and dose adjustments. Biktarvy has **minimal drug interactions**, making it suitable for patients taking multiple medications.

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Atripla is dosed once daily, but adherence can be compromised by neuropsychiatric side effects [^1115VdHr] and the need to take it on an empty stomach. Biktarvy is **once daily with no dietary restrictions**, has minimal side effects, and is associated with improved adherence and quality of life [^114RGSrc].

---

## Special populations

### Pregnant women

Atripla is **less suitable in pregnancy** [^117GmQYG] due to teratogenicity concerns with efavirenz. Biktarvy has limited pregnancy data but is **generally considered safer** than efavirenz-containing regimens.

---

### Patients with renal impairment

Atripla is not recommended for significant renal impairment because it contains tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^114iLBFk]. Biktarvy is **suitable for patients with renal impairment** given tenofovir alafenamide's improved renal safety profile [^112Ucu7F].

---

## Cost and accessibility

Atripla is **available as a generic**, improving affordability and access in resource-limited settings. Biktarvy is currently available only as a branded product, which increases cost and may limit accessibility in some settings.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Atripla is no longer recommended as a first-line regimen because of safety and tolerability concerns [^114RGSrc]. Biktarvy is **recommended as a first-line regimen** by major guidelines due to its efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^113cAUw4].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Parameter** | **Atripla** | **Biktarvy** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | High, but lower barrier to resistance | High, with no reported resistance |
| Neuropsychiatric side effects | Significant | Minimal |
| Renal and bone safety | Lower | Higher |
| Drug interactions | Significant | Minimal |
| Adherence | Compromised by side effects | High adherence |
| Cost | Lower (generic) | Higher (branded) |
| Clinical guidelines | Not recommended first-line | Recommended first-line |

---

Biktarvy is **generally preferred** over Atripla due to its superior efficacy, safety, and tolerability [^114fE8HM] [^113cAUw4]. It is particularly suitable for patients with psychiatric comorbidities, renal impairment, or those taking multiple medications [^112Ucu7F]. Atripla may still be considered in resource-limited settings due to its lower cost and accessibility [^112A5j2o].

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^114fE8HM]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (vs. dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (vs. DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF to 240 weeks.

Of the 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506 of 634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444 of 506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240, using both missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses (Study 1489: EudraCT 2015–004024–54; Study 1490: EudraCT 2015–003988–10).

Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%–99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%–70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (10 of 634) of participants (5 with events considered drug-related).

### Discontinuation of Atripla as first-line therapy in HIV-1 infected individuals [^1124ePHs]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events are common with the initiation of efavirenz, but these are often described as transient. We aimed to describe the outcomes of individuals commencing Atripla (Gilead Sciences Inc, Foster City, California; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, New Jersey, USA) as a first-line regimen.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective case-based analysis of all individuals within our HIV cohort who had received Atripla as their first antiretroviral combination. In individuals who discontinued Atripla, data was collected on the evolution of adverse events.

- **Results**: Four hundred and seventy-two individuals commenced Atripla as first-line therapy. At 12 months, 383 individuals (81%) remained on Atripla with 98% achieving HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml (on treatment analysis). CNS toxicity was the commonest reason for switching therapy in 63 (71%) cases. The median duration of the first reported CNS toxicity was 27 days (IQR 7–104 days), with the most common symptoms being nightmares or vivid dreams in 28 (44%), insomnia in 27 (43%), and depression in 22 (35%). In those with CNS toxicity, six (10%) switched at 0–4 weeks, four (6%) at 4–12 weeks, 30 (48%) at 12–52 weeks, and 23 (36%) changed regimen 52–96 weeks after commencing Atripla. Among those with available documentation, 25 of 63 (40%) had reported improvement or resolution of their CNS side effects.

- **Discussion**: One-fifth of all individuals commencing Atripla will need to switch therapy, often due to adverse events. The most common reason for the switch in our cohort was CNS toxicity, which although prevalent, appeared to have at least a partial resolution in a proportion of affected individuals.

### Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, coformulated with elvitegravir, cobicistat, and emtricitabine, for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection: two randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trials [^111VEwvz]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can cause renal and bone toxic effects related to high plasma tenofovir concentrations. Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel tenofovir prodrug with a 90% reduction in plasma tenofovir concentrations, and regimens containing tenofovir alafenamide may have improved renal and bone safety compared to those containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: In these two controlled, double-blind phase 3 studies, we recruited treatment-naive HIV-infected patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of 50 mL per minute or higher from 178 outpatient centres in 16 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily oral tablets containing 150 mg elvitegravir, 150 mg cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine, and 10 mg tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/tenofovir alafenamide) or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (E/C/F/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with a matching placebo. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size 4) and was stratified by HIV-1 RNA, CD4 count, and region (USA or ex-USA). Investigators, patients, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were blinded to the treatment group. All participants who received one dose of the study drug were included in the primary intention-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses.

The main outcomes were the proportion of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm (pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 12%), and pre-specified renal and bone endpoints at 48 weeks.

### Switching to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir versus continuation of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with emtricitabine and tenofovir in virologically suppressed adults with HIV (STRATEGY-NNRTI): 48 week results of a randomised, open-label, phase 3b non-inferiority trial [^1115VdHr]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2014). High credibility.

Coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) might be a safe and efficacious switch option for virologically suppressed patients with HIV who have neuropsychiatric side effects on a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or who are on a multitablet NNRTI-containing regimen and desire regimen simplification. We assessed the non-inferiority of such a switch compared with the continuation of an NNRTI-containing regimen.

- **Methods**: STRATEGY-NNRTI is a 96-week, international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority trial enrolling adults (≥ 18 years) with HIV-1 and plasma HIV RNA viral load below 50 copies per mL for at least 6 months on an NNRTI plus emtricitabine and tenofovir regimen. Using a computer-generated randomization sequence, we randomly allocated participants (2:1; blocks of six, stratified by efavirenz use at screening) to switch to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir (switch group) or continue the NNRTI plus emtricitabine and tenofovir regimen (no-switch group). Key eligibility criteria included no history of virological failure and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 70 mL per min or greater. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma viral loads below 50 copies per mL at week 48 based on a snapshot algorithm with a non-inferiority margin of 12% (assessed by modified intention to treat). This trial is ongoing and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01495702.

### Bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection (GS-US-380–1489): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^113cAUw4]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) are recommended components of initial antiretroviral therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Bictegravir is a novel, potent INSTI with a high in-vitro barrier to resistance and low potential as a perpetrator or victim of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bictegravir coformulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide as a fixed-dose combination versus coformulated dolutegravir, abacavir, and lamivudine.

- **Methods**: We conducted this double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial at 122 outpatient centres in nine countries in Europe, Latin America, and North America. We enrolled HIV-1 infected adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who were previously untreated (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 500 copies per mL); HLA-B✱5701-negative; had no hepatitis B virus infection; screening genotypes showing sensitivity to emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, and abacavir; and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min or more. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated allocation sequence (block size of four), to receive coformulated bictegravir 50 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg or coformulated dolutegravir 50 mg, abacavir 600 mg, and lamivudine 300 mg, with matching placebo, once daily for 144 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ 100000 copies per mL, > 100000 to ≤ 400000 copies per mL, or > 400000 copies per mL), and CD4 count (< 50 cells per μL, 50–199 cells per μL, or ≥ 200 cells per μL).

### The epi-TAF for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112A5j2o]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately 84% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected US residents on antiretroviral therapy currently receive some form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as part of their HIV treatment regimen. The TDF analogue tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has demonstrated equal efficacy but with decreased renal injury and bone mineral density loss compared with TDF. We examine how much more society ought to be willing to pay for TAF over TDF, in exchange for its improved toxicity profile. Using cost-effectiveness methods, we find that conditions warrant an annual premium of up to $1000 over the average wholesale price (AWP) of TDF. Once generic coformulations of tenofovir/lamivudine become accessible, however, the appropriate premium for TAF will likely merit a downward adjustment, using generic TDF-based costs as the benchmark.

### Dolutegravir plus two different prodrugs of tenofovir to treat HIV [^112mgUb4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Two drugs considered for inclusion in antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF). There are limited data on their use in low- and middle-income countries.

- **Methods**: We conducted a 96-week, phase 3, investigator-led, open-label, randomized trial in South Africa, comparing a triple-therapy combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and DTG plus either of two tenofovir prodrugs — TAF (TAF-based group) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (TDF-based group) — against the local standard-of-care regimen of TDF-FTC-efavirenz (standard-care group). Inclusion criteria included an age of 12 years or older, no receipt of ART in the previous 6 months, a creatinine clearance of more than 60 mL per minute (> 80 mL per minute in patients younger than 19 years of age), and an HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of 500 copies or more per milliliter. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 48-week HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter (as determined with the Snapshot algorithm from the Food and Drug Administration; noninferiority margin, -10 percentage points). We report the primary (48-week) efficacy and safety data.

- **Results**: A total of 1053 patients underwent randomization from February 2017 through May 2018. More than 99% of the patients were Black, and 59% were female. The mean age was 32 years, and the mean CD4 count was 337 cells per cubic millimeter. At week 48, the percentage of patients with an HIV-1 RNA level of less than 50 copies per milliliter was analyzed.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^112QZJw4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Study 934 of treatment-naïve subjects (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + EMTRIVA + efavirenz versus zidovudine (AZT)/lamivudine (3TC) + efavirenz) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], genotypic analysis performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with more than 400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation showed that the development of efavirenz resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms. The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to EMTRIVA and lamivudine, was observed in 2 out of 19 analyzed subject isolates in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets + EMTRIVA group and in 10 out of 29 analyzed subject isolates in the zidovudine/lamivudine group. Through 144 weeks of Study 934, no subjects developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.

- **Cross resistance**: Cross-resistance among certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been recognized. The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and lamivudine. Therefore, cross resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution. HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N = 20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three zidovudine-associated reverse transcriptase substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) showed a 3.1-fold decrease.

### Efficacy and safety of dolutegravir with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate HIV antiretroviral therapy regimens started in pregnancy (IMPAACT 2010/VESTED): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^117GmQYG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy is crucial for both maternal health and the prevention of perinatal HIV-1 transmission; however, adequate data on the safety and efficacy of different ART regimens for pregnant women are scarce. In this trial, we compared the safety and efficacy of three antiretroviral regimens started in pregnancy: dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate; dolutegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; and efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.

- **Methods**: This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 22 clinical research sites in nine countries (Botswana, Brazil, India, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, the United States, and Zimbabwe). Pregnant women (aged ≥ 18 years) with confirmed HIV-1 infection and at 14–28 weeks' gestation were eligible. Women who had previously taken antiretrovirals were excluded (up to 14 days of ART during the pregnancy was permitted), as were women known to be pregnant with multiple fetuses or those with known fetal anomalies or a history of psychiatric illness. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a central computerised randomisation system. Randomisation was done using permuted blocks (size six) stratified by gestational age (14–18, 19–23, and 24–28 weeks' gestation) and country. Participants were assigned to receive either once-daily oral dolutegravir 50 mg, and once-daily oral fixed-dose combination emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^112YnpWG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

In summary, DOR/3TC/TDF demonstrated robust antiretroviral efficacy that was statistically non-inferior to that of EFV/FTC/TDF, with immunologic efficacy similar to that of EFV/FTC/TDF, and a low rate of treatment-emergent viral drug resistance. DOR/3TC/TDF was superior to EFV/FTC/TDF in terms of neuropsychiatric adverse effects, changes in LDL-C and non–HDL-C, and was associated with lower rates of rashes, drug-related adverse effects, and discontinuation due to adverse effects. The favorable safety profile of DOR/3TC/TDF may reduce the likelihood of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation. Overall, DOR/3TC/TDF is a promising new treatment option for adults with HIV-1 infections.

### Switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide from dolutegravir-based therapy [^114RGSrc]. AIDS (2024). High credibility.

The number of people with HIV accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been increasing, from 7.8 million in 2010 to 28.7 million in 2021. Furthermore, increased longevity on HIV therapy means that people will require decades of ART. Managing emerging comorbidities and drug interactions as people age on ART is an increasing challenge. Simplification of treatment regimens and treatment switches to optimize care may be needed. There are many different reasons why a provider or patient may want or need to switch their ART regimen. Evaluating medium and long-term clinical trial outcomes, where available, can guide decisions on optimal treatment options for specific subpopulations.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a three-drug, fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen containing an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, bictegravir, and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine and TAF. Clinical trial results have shown that B/F/TAF is highly effective and well tolerated in adults. There is also growing evidence supporting the use of B/F/TAF in routine clinical practice.

B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) is approved for adults in many countries around the world and is recommended in international HIV guidelines in high-income countries, both as a first-line and as a switch regimen for those with virologic suppression.

Study 1489 and Study 1490 are randomized, double-blinded, phase 3 clinical trials that evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of either dolutegravir (DTG)-based treatment or B/F/TAF over 144 weeks.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^112Ucu7F]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

Compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is associated with improvements in markers of renal dysfunction in individual randomized trials; however, the comparative incidence of clinically significant renal events remains unclear.

- **Design**: We used a pooled data approach to increase the person-years of drug exposure analyzed, maximizing our ability to detect differences in clinically significant outcomes.

- **Methods**: Clinical renal safety data were pooled across 26 treatment-naive and antiretroviral switch studies to compare the incidence of proximal renal tubulopathy and discontinuation due to renal adverse events between participants taking TAF-containing regimens and those taking TDF-containing regimens. Secondary analyses from seven large randomized studies (two treatment-naive and five switch studies) compared the incidence of renal adverse events, treatment-emergent proteinuria, changes in serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinary biomarkers (albumin, beta-2-microglobulin, and retinol binding protein-to-creatinine ratios).

- **Results**: The integrated analysis included 9322 adults and children with HIV (n = 6360 TAF, n = 2962 TDF) with exposure of 12519 person-years to TAF and 5947 to TDF. There were no cases of proximal renal tubulopathy in participants receiving TAF compared to 10 cases in those receiving TDF (P < 0.001). Additionally, fewer individuals on TAF (3/6360) compared to TDF (14/2962) discontinued due to a renal adverse event (P < 0.001). Participants initiating TAF-based regimens had more favorable changes in renal safety markers compared to those on TDF-based regimens.

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^111ruGng]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) as preferred initial therapy. Among INSTIs, the agents dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC, B) have a low incidence of treatment-emergent resistance. This higher resistance barrier is evident in the results of prospective clinical trials, which demonstrate no incident resistance among those experiencing virologic failure if they received either DTG or BIC plus 2 NRTIs. Based in part on these results, International AIDS Society (IAS)–USA guidelines recommend only BIC or DTG as INSTIs for initial therapy.

This resistance benefit translates into advantages in treatment-experienced individuals as well. In the DAWNING study of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) failing first-line treatment with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus 2 NRTIs, the strategy of DTG plus at least 1 active NRTI was superior to lopinavir/ritonavir plus 1 active NRTI. Many participants in this study had extensive NRTI resistance. In an earlier study, DTG was superior to raltegravir in treatment-experienced people failing treatment; some of these participants also had extensive NRTI resistance but were still successfully treated with DTG plus NRTIs.

These results demonstrate that individuals who harbor some NRTI resistance can achieve and maintain viral suppression with DTG plus 2 NRTIs, even if not all NRTIs in the regimen are fully active. Bictegravir is a novel INSTI co-formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide.

### Darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in a rapid-initiation model of care for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection: Primary analysis of the DIAMOND study [^1161PCDG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

In 2016, only 64% of people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the United States received care, 49% were retained in care, and 53% were virologically suppressed. The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines recommend that certain laboratory testing be performed to help guide initial treatment selection; some tests, such as genotypic resistance testing and testing for HLA-B✱5701, may require several days or weeks for results, potentially contributing to patient attrition and delayed treatment.

In rapid-initiation models of care, therapy is started prior to the availability of baseline laboratory assessments, sometimes on the day of diagnosis. Improved retention, reduced time to virologic suppression, and decreased morbidity and mortality have been observed with this model in low-income countries and select US centers. The World Health Organization (WHO) and International Antiviral Society–USA guidelines recommend rapid initiation for the majority of newly diagnosed patients. Although the US DHHS considers this approach investigational, the guidelines recognize the importance of prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation for some patients.

Moreover, while US DHHS guidelines recommend an integrase inhibitor (INI)-based regimen as initial ART, in certain clinical situations, such as those encountered when rapidly initiating therapy, a boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen is a recommended option. As less clinical information is available in a rapid-initiation model of care, it is important to consider a regimen's effectiveness in this setting.

### Outcomes in people with HIV who resume or switch to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide following a treatment interruption [^112K4dzJ]. AIDS (2025). Low credibility.

Results

- **Characteristics of study population with treatment interruptions**: Of 2710 individuals with ART dispensing included in the study, 2439 (90%) were on an STR, and 2466 (91%) were treatment-experienced at baseline. The majority were suppressed at initiation of the ART regimen (82%). Overall, 765 (28%) had a treatment interruption [Fig. 1].

	- Fig. 1 Study population selection.

	- The median duration of observation was 19 months (IQR 12–26). Among individuals with treatment interruption, the median treatment interruption length was 165 days (IQR 113–273). Compared to individuals without treatment interruptions, those with treatment interruptions were younger (mean age 45 vs. 47 years; P < 0.01), more likely to be women (24 vs. 19%; P = 0.02), Black (50 vs. 35%; P < 0.01), have a documented substance use history at baseline (14 vs. 9%; P = 0.02), have baseline CD4+ and nadir CD4+ cell count less than 200 cells/mm³ (15 vs. 8%; P < 0.01, 22 vs. 15%; P < 0.01, respectively), and less likely to be commercially insured (48 vs. 62%; P < 0.01) or virologically suppressed at baseline (76 vs. 85%; P < 0.01). Demographics and clinical characteristics of the sample are summarized in Table 1.

	- Table 1 Baseline characteristics.

- **B/F/TAF resumption or switch**: Of 765 individuals with treatment interruption, 379 (50%) either restarted B/F/TAF (370, 98%) or switched to B/F/TAF (9, 2%), with the remainder restarting or switching to other heterogeneous regimens. The mean observation period after B/F/TAF resumption or switch was 7.5 months (median 5; IQR 1–12).

### Improvements in patient-reported outcomes after 12 months of maintenance therapy with cabotegravir + rilpivirine long-acting compared with bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in the phase 3b SOLAR study [^115ave8b]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). High credibility.

The SOLAR study is a Phase 3b, randomized, open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority study evaluating the efficacy and safety of switching to CAB + RPV LA versus continuing BIC/FTC/TAF. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, and procedures have been published in the primary clinical manuscript. Briefly, eligible participants were ≥ 18 years of age and currently receiving an uninterrupted treatment regimen of BIC/FTC/TAF with an undetectable HIV-1 viral load (< 50 copies/mL) for ≥ 6 months prior to screening; BIC/FTC/TAF had to have been the participant's first or second treatment regimen.

After screening, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either CAB (600 mg) + RPV (900 mg) LA IM injections Q2M or to continue daily oral BIC (50 mg)/FTC (200 mg)/TAF (25 mg). Participants randomized to CAB + RPV LA Q2M could choose, in consultation with their healthcare provider, to switch straight to IM CAB + RPV LA Q2M (starting with injection) or to receive an induction regimen of oral CAB (30 mg) + RPV (25 mg) (oral lead-in) for one month before switching to the LA regimen.

Endpoints were assessed at Month 6 and Month 12 for CAB + RPV LA OLI and BIC/FTC/TAF participants, and at Month 5 and Month 11 for CAB + RPV LA Q2M SWI participants (hereafter referred to as Month 6 and Month 12). Irrespective of whether participants received an OLI, all participants receiving LA therapy who completed the Maintenance Phase received seven doses of CAB + RPV LA by the time of the primary analysis endpoint.

### Switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed patients with chronic hepatitis B: A randomised, double-blind, phase 3, multicentre non-inferiority study [^111FibiR]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with renal toxicity, reductions in bone mineral density, or both, in some patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir alafenamide is a tenofovir prodrug with high intrahepatic concentrations of active drug and reduced systemic tenofovir exposures compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In patients with chronic HBV, tenofovir alafenamide has shown efficacy non-inferior to that of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with improved renal and bone safety. This non-inferiority study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with HBV infection switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who are virally suppressed.

- **Methods**: Patients with chronic HBV infection who had been receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 48 weeks or more and who had HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for at least 12 weeks were recruited to this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once a day or to continue tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was loss of virological control, defined as the proportion of patients who received at least one dose of study drug who had HBV DNA of at least 20 IU/mL at week 48 by the modified US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) snapshot algorithm. Key safety endpoints were changes in hip and spine bone mineral density and estimated creatinine clearance.

### Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial treatment for HIV-1: Five-year follow-up from two randomized trials [^116Wvvnf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a single-tablet regimen recommended for HIV-1 treatment. The safety and efficacy of B/F/TAF as initial therapy were established in two Phase 3 studies: 1489 (vs. dolutegravir [DTG]/abacavir/lamivudine) and 1490 (vs. DTG + F/TAF). After 144 weeks of randomized follow-up, an open-label extension evaluated B/F/TAF up to 240 weeks.

- **Methods**: Of 634 participants randomized to B/F/TAF, 519 completed the double-blinded treatment, and 506/634 (80%) chose the 96-week open-label B/F/TAF extension, which was completed by 444/506 (88%) participants. Efficacy was based on the secondary outcome of the proportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 by missing = excluded and missing = failure methods. All 634 participants who were randomized to B/F/TAF and received at least one dose of B/F/TAF were included in efficacy and safety analyses. (Study 1489: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02607930; EudraCT 2015–004024–54. Study 1490: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02607956; EudraCT 2015–003988–10).

- **Findings**: Of those with available virologic data, 98.6% (95% CI [97.0%-99.5%], 426/432) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 240 (missing = excluded); when missing virologic data were considered as failure, 67.2% (95% CI [63.4%-70.8%], 426/634) maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. Mean (SD) change in CD4+ count from baseline was +338 (236.2) cells/μL. No treatment-emergent resistance to B/F/TAF was detected. Adverse events led to drug discontinuation in 1.6% (n = 10/634) of participants, with 5 events considered drug-related.

### Co-formulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate versus ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus co-formulated emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial [^1119LTdh]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

The HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) has been co-formulated with the CYP3A4 inhibitor cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) into a once-daily, single tablet. We compared EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF with a ritonavir-boosted (RTV) protease inhibitor regimen of atazanavir (ATV)/RTV+FTC/TDF as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection.

- **Methods**: This phase 3, non-inferiority study enrolled treatment-naive patients with an HIV-1 RNA concentration of 5000 copies per mL or more and susceptibility to atazanavir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF or ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF plus matching placebos, administered once daily. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence, accessed via an interactive telephone and web response system. Patients, and investigators and study staff who gave treatments, assessed outcomes, or analysed data were masked to the assignment. The primary endpoint was HIV RNA concentration of 50 copies per mL or less after 48 weeks (according to the US FDA snapshot algorithm), with a 12% non-inferiority margin. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01106586.

- **Findings**: 1017 patients were screened, 715 were enrolled, and 708 were treated (353 with EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF and 355 with ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF). EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF was non-inferior to ATV/RTV+FTC/TDF for the primary outcome (316 patients [89.5%] vs 308 patients [86.8%], adjusted difference 3.0%, 95% CI -1.9% to 7.8%). Both regimens had favourable safety and tolerability.

### Lower prevalence of drug resistance mutations at first-line virological failure to first-line therapy with Atripla vs. tenofovir + emtricitabine/lamivudine + efavirenz administered on a multiple tablet therapy [^116KZXeT]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combination antiretroviral therapy administered as a single-tablet regimen (STR) may improve virologic suppression rates. The effect of STRs on the development of resistance when virologic failure occurs on STRs is not known.

- **Objectives**: To compare the rate of emergent drug resistance mutations (DRMs) on first-line therapy with coformulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/emtricitabine (FTC)/efavirenz (EFV) as an STR versus TDF, lamivudine (3TC) or FTC, and EFV given as non-STR.

- **Methods**: Patients from eight cohorts and four randomized clinical trials who received first-line antiretroviral therapy with Atripla (STR group) or with TDF + FTC/3TC + EFV (non-STR group) were eligible if a genotypic resistance test was available immediately after the first episode of viral failure. The DRM list from the 2013 version of IAS-USA was used.

- **Results**: One hundred and eighty-six patients were included in the final analysis, 122 (65.6%) from eight cohorts and 64 (34.1%) from four randomized clinical trials. The overall proportion of patients with at least one DRM at viral failure was 67.7%, including 53.4% (31 of 58) in the STR group vs. 74.2% (95 of 128) in the non-STR group (P = 0.005). Among patients exclusively from cohorts, at least one DRM was detected in 53.4% (31 of 58) in the STR group vs. 78.1% (50 of 64) in the non-STR group (P = 0.004). DRMs for individual drugs were: TDF, 15.5% vs. 16.4% (P = 0.87); 3TC/FTC, 31% vs. 35.2% (P = 0.58); and NNRTI, 51.7% vs. 65.6% (P = 0.07). The proportion of patients with an M184V/I mutation among the 128 patients who received FTC was 32.8%.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^1149iHud]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets are nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors used for treating HIV-1 infection and chronic hepatitis B (HBV). They are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. They are also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.

- **HIV-1 infection**: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. It should not be used with ATRIPLA®, BIKTARVY®, COMPLERA®, DESCOVY®, GENVOYA®, ODEFSEY®, STRIBILD®, TRUVADA®, or VEMLIDY® [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Chronic hepatitis B**: These tablets are also indicated for treating chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. The indication in adults is based on safety and efficacy data from subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve and subjects who were treatment experienced.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^116bVk5F]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The efficacy of DOR/3TC/TDF was found to be non-inferior to EFV/FTC/TDF on the primary efficacy endpoint, with 84.3% (307/364) and 80.8% (294/364) of participants, respectively, achieving HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48. Among participants with baseline HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/mL, 81.2% (56/69) in the DOR/3TC/TDF group and 80.8% (59/73) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group achieved HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48.

- **Proportion of participants**: The proportion of participants with Human Immunodeficiency Virus–1 RNA of < 50 copies/mL was assessed over time using the Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; DOR/3TC/TDF, doravirine at 100 mg, lamivudine at 300 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg; EFV/FTC/TDF, efavirenz at 600 mg, emtricitabine at 200 mg, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg.

Similar results were observed for virologic endpoints with HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL (83.8% for DOR/3TC/TDF vs. 79.7% for EFV/FTC/TDF; difference, 4.1%; 95% CI, -1.5 to 9.7) and HIV-1 RNA < 200 copies/mL. The mean change in CD4+ T-cell count from baseline to week 48 was similar in the DOR/3TC/TDF and EFV/FTC/TDF groups (198 vs. 188 cells/mm³; difference, 10.1; 95% CI, -16.1 to 36.3).

Subjects who were responders at Week 48 or Week 96 (HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL) but did not consent to continue the trial after Week 48 or Week 96 were excluded from analysis. Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL through Weeks 48 and 144. This includes confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed < 400 copies/mL through Weeks 48 and 144. Also included are cases of loss to follow-up, subject withdrawal, noncompliance, protocol violation, and other reasons.

Through Week 48, 84% and 73% of subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and the zidovudine/lamivudine group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL (71% and 58% through Week 144). The difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL through 48 weeks largely results from the higher number of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the zidovudine/lamivudine group in this open-label trial. In addition, 80% and 70% of subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and the zidovudine/lamivudine group, respectively, achieved and maintained HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL through Week 48 (64% and 56% through Week 144). The mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 190 cells/mm³ in the EMTRIVA + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 158 cells/mm³ in the zidovudine/lamivudine group at Week 48 (312 and 271 cells/mm³ at Week 144).

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^113WDnfZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Through 48 weeks, 7 subjects in the emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets group and 5 subjects in the zidovudine/lamivudine group experienced a new CDC Class C event, totaling 10 and 6 subjects respectively through 144 weeks.

- **Treatment-experienced adult patients study 907**: Study 907 was a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets added to a stable background regimen of antiretroviral agents in 550 treatment-experienced subjects. After 24 weeks of blinded trial treatment, all subjects continuing on trial were offered open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets for an additional 24 weeks. Subjects had a mean baseline CD4+ cell count of 427 cells/mm³ (range 23 to 1385), median baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA of 2340 (range 50 to 75,000) copies/mL, and the mean duration of prior HIV-1 treatment was 5.4 years. The mean age of the subjects was 42 years; 85% were male, 69% Caucasian, 17% Black, and 12% Hispanic.

The percent of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL and outcomes of subjects through 48 weeks were intended to be summarized in Table 20.

- **Table 20 outcomes of randomized treatment (Study 907)**:
	1. Subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL and no prior study drug discontinuation at Week 24 and 48, respectively.
	2. Subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL efficacy failure or missing HIV-1 RNA at Week 24 and 48, respectively.
	3. Includes lost to follow-up, subject withdrawal, noncompliance, protocol violation, and other reasons.

At 24 weeks of therapy, there was a higher proportion of subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets arm.

### A maintenance 3-day-per-week schedule with the single tablet regimen efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is effective and decreases sub-clinical toxicity [^117T4YBN]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral drugs contained in the single tablet Atripla have pharmacokinetic properties that could allow for dosing less frequently than once daily. We hypothesized that simplifying Atripla from once daily to a 3-day-per-week regimen would be feasible, maintain viral suppression, and result in reduced toxicity.

- **Methods**: Virologically suppressed (≥ 2 years) HIV+ adults on Atripla once daily, with a CD4 count greater than 350 cells/μl at inclusion, and no prior documented virological failure or evidence of resistance mutations to efavirenz, tenofovir, or emtricitabine, were randomized. Participants either maintained their once-daily (OD) regimen or reduced it to three days a week (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) (A-TRI-WEEK pilot trial). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients free of treatment failure (noncompleter = failure) at 24 weeks. CD4 and CD8 cell counts, ultrasensitive HIV-1 RNA levels, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), bone mineral density, plasma efavirenz levels, and fasting blood and urine chemistries were measured at baseline and again at 24 weeks. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01778413.

- **Results**: Sixty-one patients were randomized. All patients in both study arms remained free of treatment failure (estimated difference 0%; 95% confidence interval -14.1 to 14.1). Ultrasensitive plasma HIV-1 RNA was below the detection threshold, showing no significant difference between the two arms (70% in the 3-day-per-week arm vs. 71% in the once-daily arm, P = 0.933) at 24 weeks. In the 3-day-per-week arm, total cholesterol and femur T-score significantly increased. In contrast, PSQI, plasma efavirenz levels, albumin/creatinine ratio and beta-2-microglobulin levels in urine significantly decreased.

### Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy with coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus efavirenz, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV-positive men who have sex with men in China: Week 48 results of the multicenter, randomized clinical trial [^115sZQbk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Most international treatment guidelines recommend rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, but experiences with rapid ART initiation remain limited in China. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of efavirenz (400 mg) plus lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV + 3TC + TDF) versus coformulated bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) in rapid ART initiation among men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been diagnosed with HIV.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled MSM aged ≥ 18 years to start ART within 14 days of confirmed HIV diagnosis. The participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive EFV (400 mg) + 3TC + TDF or BIC/FTC/TAF. The primary endpoint was viral suppression (< 50 copies/mL) at 48 weeks per US Food and Drug Administration Snapshot analysis.

- **Results**: Between March 2021 and July 2022, 300 participants were enrolled; 154 were assigned to receive EFV + 3TC + TDF (EFV group) and 146 to BIC/FTC/TAF (BIC group). At week 48, 118 (79.2%) and 140 (95.9%) participants in the EFV and BIC groups, respectively, were retained in care with viral suppression. Additionally, 24 (16.1%) and 1 (0.7%) participant in the EFV and BIC groups, respectively, discontinued treatment due to adverse effects, death, or being lost to follow-up (P < .001). The median increase of CD4 count was 181 and 223 cells/μL (P = 0.020), respectively, for the EFV and BIC groups at week 48.

### Simplification to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir versus continuation of ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor with emtricitabine and tenofovir in adults with virologically suppressed HIV (STRATEGY-PI): 48 week results of a randomised, open-label, phase 3b, non-inferiority trial [^114jKskp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with HIV on antiretroviral therapy might benefit from regimen simplification to reduce pill burden and dosing frequency. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of simplifying the treatment regimen for adults with virologically suppressed HIV infection from a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir) regimen to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.

- **Methods**: STRATEGY-PI is a 96-week, international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3b trial in which HIV-infected adults with a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load of less than 50 copies per mL for at least 6 months, who were taking a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor with emtricitabine plus tenofovir, were randomly assigned (2:1) either to switch to coformulated elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir or to continue on their existing regimen. Key eligibility criteria included no history of virological failure, no resistance to emtricitabine and tenofovir, and creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or higher. Neither participants nor investigators were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with a viral load of less than 50 copies per mL at week 48, based on a US Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm for the modified intention-to-treat population, which excluded major protocol violations (prohibited resistance or not receiving a protease inhibitor at baseline). We prespecified non-inferiority with a 12% margin.

### Abacavir-lamivudine versus tenofovir-emtricitabine for initial HIV-1 therapy [^111YAdjR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Use of fixed-dose combination nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor is recommended as initial therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, which NRTI combination has greater efficacy and safety is not known.

- **Methods**: In a randomized, blinded equivalence study involving 1858 eligible patients, we compared four once-daily antiretroviral regimens as initial therapy for HIV-1 infection: abacavir-lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF)-emtricitabine plus efavirenz or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomization to virologic failure. This was defined as a confirmed HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 1000 copies per milliliter at or after 16 weeks and before 24 weeks, or ≥ 200 copies per milliliter at or after 24 weeks.

- **Results**: A scheduled interim review by an independent data and safety monitoring board showed significant differences in virologic efficacy, according to the NRTI combination, among patients with screening HIV-1 RNA levels of 100,000 copies per milliliter or more. At a median follow-up of 60 weeks, among the 797 patients with screening HIV-1 RNA levels of 100,000 copies per milliliter or more, the time to virologic failure was significantly shorter in the abacavir-lamivudine group than in the tenofovir DF-emtricitabine group (hazard ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 3.72; P < 0.001), with 57 virologic failures (14%) in the abacavir-lamivudine group.

This retrospective study evaluated bictegravir (BIC)/emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) in 24 persons with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2, PWHIV-2): 5 naive individuals and 19 pretreated. After a median follow-up of 37.5 months, all PWHIV-2 had a plasma viral load of < 40 copies/mL. The median CD4 count increased significantly from 580 to 625 cells/mm³, suggesting the effectiveness of BIC/FTC/TAF in treating HIV-2 infection.

### Genvoya [^116JdyYn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In Study 109, the efficacy and safety of switching from ATRIPLA, TRUVADA plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), or STRIBILD to GENVOYA once daily were evaluated in a randomized, open-label trial of virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) HIV-1-infected adults (N = 1436). Subjects must have been suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months and had no known resistance-associated substitutions to any of the components of GENVOYA prior to study entry. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either switch to GENVOYA at baseline (N = 959) or stay on their baseline antiretroviral regimen (N = 477). Subjects had a mean age of 41 years (range 21–77), 89% were male, 67% were White, and 19% were Black. The mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 697 cells per mm³ (range 79–1951).

Subjects were stratified by prior treatment regimen. At screening, 42% of subjects were receiving TRUVADA plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), 32% were receiving STRIBILD, and 26% were receiving ATRIPLA.

- **Treatment outcomes**: Treatment outcomes of Study 109 through 96 weeks are presented in Table 17. Outcomes were similar across subgroups receiving ATRIPLA, TRUVADA plus atazanavir (given with either cobicistat or ritonavir), or STRIBILD prior to randomization. In Study 109, the mean increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 96 was 60 cells per mm³ in GENVOYA-treated subjects and 42 cells per mm³ in subjects.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^113UsPTy]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

The mechanism for the improved renal safety profile of TAF is likely related to the approximately 90% lower plasma levels of TFV seen in participants receiving TAF compared with those receiving TDF. This mechanism is supported by the reported association between declines in renal tubular function and higher TFV plasma concentrations.

Conversely, the use of boosting agents such as RTV and COBI increases TFV exposure, and accordingly, the use of boosting agents has been associated with an increased risk of renal adverse events. A recent meta-analysis sought to compare the renal safety profiles of TDF-containing regimens in the presence and absence of boosting agents and suggested that unboosted TDF could have a similar renal safety profile as TAF. However, the aforementioned meta-analysis is limited by a relatively small number of participants and short duration of follow-up.

In the findings presented here, nine out of ten PRT cases occurred in participants receiving boosted regimens; however, one severe case of PRT occurred in a participant receiving TDF without a boosting agent. Our data support the principle that boosting agents increase the risk of TFV-associated renal adverse events. However, our ability to make robust conclusions about the renal safety of unboosted TDF is limited by the comparatively small number of participants taking such regimens (of 9322 total participants, 2962 were on TDF, and of those, 1101 were on TDF without a boosting agent). Although the question of renal safety of TDF in unboosted regimens warrants more evaluation, the available data indicate…

### Switching to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with human immunodeficiency virus [^115yn9XW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In summary, our study demonstrated that people with HIV who are virologically suppressed on DTG plus F/TAF or F/TDF can safely switch to the simpler single-tablet regimen of B/F/TAF. By including participants regardless of treatment or resistance history other than INSTI resistance, these data continue to support the high resistance barrier of both BIC and DTG when they are combined with 2 NRTIs, and the safety of switching to B/F/TAF in individuals with viral suppression.

### Effects on immune system and viral reservoir of a short-cycle antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed HIV-positive patients [^116fhRsd]. AIDS (2019). High credibility.

Atripla dose reduction decreases subclinical toxicity and maintains viral suppression in HIV+ individuals, but the virological efficacy and immunological safety of this strategy need to be further confirmed.

- **Methods**: Virologically suppressed HIV-infected adults on Atripla once daily were randomized 1:1 to reduce therapy to 3 days a week (3W, n = 30) or to maintain it unchanged (once daily, n = 31). The HIV-1 reservoir (total and integrated HIV-1 DNA in CD4 cells), immunological cell activation (CD38 and HLA-DR), senescence (CD57 and CD28), apoptosis (annexin V), and populations of T-naive, effector memory (TEM) (CCR7, CD45RA), and stem cell memory (TSCM) (CD954 and CD27) were measured at baseline, 24 weeks, and 48 weeks.

- **Results**: No differences in activation, senescence, or apoptosis of both CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed on follow-up. The naive CD4 T-cell proportion showed a significant decrease in the 3W group (mean ± SD): 24.6 ± 13.7 vs. 20.5 ± 12.9 (P = 0.002). No differences in both plasma viral load and HIV reservoir were detected on follow-up. CD4 TSCM levels at 48 weeks correlated with basal integrated HIV-1 DNA in the 3W group but not in the once-daily group. A post hoc analysis of data prior to study entry revealed a higher viral load zenith and a trend toward a lower CD4 nadir in the 3W group compared to the once-daily group.

- **Conclusion**: No significant immunological or viral changes were induced in the 3W group, confirming the virological efficacy and immunological safety of this strategy. In-depth virological and immunological analyses are useful in providing additional information in antiretroviral therapy strategies.

### Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is non-inferior to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in treatment-naive adults with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection: Week 48 results of the DRIVE-AHEAD trial [^115KYS8D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection has been successfully treated with a wide array of antiretroviral therapies, which can vastly improve life expectancy and reduce the risk of HIV-1 transmission, although they cannot eradicate the infection. Because lifelong treatment is required, safeguarding against toxicity and comorbidity is important. Adverse events that may lead to treatment discontinuation include neuropsychiatric toxicities, skin rashes, gastrointestinal toxicities, abnormal serum lipid levels, abnormal renal or bone parameters, and drug-drug interactions. Therefore, new antiretroviral therapies with fewer unwanted side effects are needed.

Doravirine (DOR), a novel non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1, is active in vitro against both wild-type virus and the most common NNRTI-resistant variants at concentrations achieved with 100 mg once-daily (QD) dosing and has a favorable in vitro resistance profile that is unique among NNRTIs. Because it is not a metabolic inducer or inhibitor, DOR is not a perpetrator of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. No clinically meaningful interactions were observed when DOR was co-administered with atorvastatin, an oral contraceptive, a magnesium-based antacid, or a proton-pump inhibitor in healthy volunteers. As a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, exposure to DOR is reduced in the presence of moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4. DOR can be taken once daily without regard to food, and its bioavailability is not affected by age, gender, or moderate hepatic impairment.

### Renal safety of tenofovir alafenamide vs. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a pooled analysis of 26 clinical trials [^112ctKeY]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

We included 26 phase 2 and 3 multicenter, multinational clinical studies of TAF-containing regimens in PLH, including adults, adolescents, and children (aged ≥ 6 years) who were either ART-naive or virologically suppressed on stable ART regimens containing TDF. These studies were conducted between 28 December 2011 and 4 December 2017. The study design and inclusion criteria, including minimum renal function for each trial, are described in Appendix Table 1. Of the 26 studies, 14 were double-blinded and randomized, six were open-label and randomized, and six were single-arm. All trials were undertaken in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by central or site-specific review boards or ethics committees. All participants or their legal guardians (if minors) provided written, informed consent.

- **Procedures**: Postbaseline study visits were conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and every 12 weeks thereafter until week 96. Renal laboratory tests included serum creatinine (SCr), CrCl by Cockcroft–Gault, treatment-emergent proteinuria by dipstick, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and tubular proteinuria (urine retinol binding protein-to-creatinine ratio [RBP: Cr] and β2-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio [β2M: Cr]) (Covance Laboratories, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA).

- **Renal safety**: Renal safety was assessed by recording adverse events, which were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 18.1–19.1) (Appendix Table 2).

### High efficacy of switching to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in people with suppressed HIV and preexisting M184V/I [^115vhJRA]. AIDS (2022). High credibility.

The single tablet regimen bictegravir/FTC/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) is a guideline-recommended initial therapy for HIV. It is also approved as a replacement regimen when switching therapies in virologically suppressed people with HIV (PWH) who have no known substitutions associated with resistance to its individual components. Given the high prevalence of M184V/I and the widespread use of B/F/TAF in clinical practice, whether suppressed PWH with this substitution can be switched to B/F/TAF is of interest. We summarize here the results of a comprehensive review of PWH enrolled in clinical trials of switching therapy to B/F/TAF, with a focus on those with M184V/I.

### Doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) once-daily compared to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as initial HIV-1 treatment: 48-week results from a phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial [^114om4WK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Doravirine/islatravir is an investigational, once-daily regimen being studied for HIV-1 treatment.

- **Methods**: In this phase 3, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, previously untreated people with HIV-1 (≥ 18 years) were randomized (1:1) and stratified by HIV-1 RNA (≤ / > 100,000 copies/mL) and CD4 count (< / ≥ 200 cells/µL) to doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (50/200/25 mg) orally once daily, with matching placebos (NCT04233879). The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48 (FDA snapshot; non-inferiority margin 10%).

- **Results**: 597 participants were randomized and treated; enrollment stopped early due to decreases in CD4 and lymphocyte counts observed in other islatravir studies. At week 48, doravirine/islatravir (100/0.75 mg) was non-inferior to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide: 265/298 (88.9%) versus 264/299 (88.3%) had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (difference 0.5%, 95% CI -4.7 to 5.6). Mean change from baseline in CD4 count was +182 and +234 cells/µL (difference -50, 95% CI -79 to -21) with doravirine/islatravir versus bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide. Mean change in lymphocyte count was 0.01 and 0.21 x 10⁹/L (difference -0.20, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.10). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 90.6% and 87.3% of participants, with COVID-19 being the most common (14.1%, 16.4%). Treatment-related AEs were similar (28.9%, 25.8%). AEs leading to discontinuations were higher with doravirine/islatravir (8.7%, 3.7%) due to protocol-specified criteria.
