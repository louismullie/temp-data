## Question

can you get fever with autoimmune hemolytic anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fever can occur in autoimmune hemolytic anemia and what it means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how AIHA typically presents and whether fever is a recognized symptom. Then, I should verify if fever signals hemolysis itself or an underlying driver like infection, malignancy, or drug exposure. Next, I will check guideline and case-based frequencies of fever in AIHA cohorts and specific phenotypes. After that, I should review mechanisms that plausibly link AIHA to fever. Finally, I will synthesize a practical clinical approach to evaluating fever in AIHA and summarize the bottom line with appropriate cautions and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: fever is not considered a universal or defining feature of AIHA, but it can be part of the presentation and warrants careful interpretation in context, especially because it may reflect the underlying etiology rather than hemolysis per se [^114HSFL4] [^114ASFnb].

> Wait, let me verify whether authoritative guidelines list fever among common features. The ASCO guideline for immune-related adverse events notes that immune-related hemolytic anemia may present with weakness, pallor, jaundice, dark urine, fever, and heart murmur, indicating that fever can accompany AIHA in immune-oncology settings, although it is not pathognomonic [^113GnCWz]. Similarly, in a multicenter ICU cohort of severe AIHA, fever was present in 40.5% of admissions, suggesting that clinically significant inflammation and systemic manifestations can co-occur in acute, severe disease presentations [^114HSFL4].

> I should double-check whether fever tracks with secondary drivers of AIHA rather than primary disease. Case-based evidence and reviews describe fever in secondary AIHA contexts such as HIV-associated hemolysis, infectious triggers including brucellosis, EBV, tuberculosis, and leishmaniasis, and drug-induced AIHA, all of which plausibly generate systemic inflammatory responses and fever as part of the underlying process rather than the hemolysis mechanism itself [^1154fbJy] [^115N5zzs] [^111fzP2H] [^113TBFQM].

> Hold on, I should verify whether primary AIHA can still present with fever even without a clear secondary trigger. A pediatric series of warm AIHA reported fever in 39% of cases, suggesting that fever can appear in idiopathic disease as well, albeit less consistently than in secondary forms, and that fever is a recognized but nonspecific constitutional symptom in hemolytic processes [^114ASFnb]. Let me also note that the immune checkpoint inhibitor literature documents fever in AIHA presentations, reinforcing that systemic inflammatory activation can accompany antibody-mediated hemolysis in certain clinical contexts [^113GnCWz].

> Let me consider mechanistic links that could plausibly generate fever. First, the underlying driver itself may be pyrogenic, such as infection, malignancy, or drug-induced immune activation, with fever reflecting that process rather than hemolysis per se [^113TBFQM]. Second, hemolysis liberates damage-associated molecular patterns and activates complement, which can propagate inflammation; complement-mediated AIHA has been associated with elevated nucleosomes and neutrophil activation markers consistent with systemic inflammatory states, supporting a mechanistic link to fever in some patients [^114cEtmW]. Third, cytokine release from immune activation in warm AIHA and the systemic immune milieu of mixed AIHA may contribute to constitutional symptoms including fever, though fever is not a reliable standalone indicator of hemolysis severity.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that fever is not simply due to transfusion reactions or infection risk from immunosuppression. That is true, and clinicians should always rule out transfusion reactions and iatrogenic or opportunistic infections in febrile AIHA patients; nonetheless, even after accounting for these, fever remains a reported feature across diverse AIHA cohorts and etiologies, supporting a real association in a subset of cases [^114HSFL4] [^113GnCWz].

> Next, I should review a practical approach when fever accompanies suspected AIHA. First, confirm hemolysis with appropriate labs and direct antiglobulin testing, then immediately search for secondary causes of AIHA that commonly produce fever, including infection, lymphoproliferative disease, and drugs or immune therapies, using history, exam, and targeted testing; management should prioritize treating the underlying cause alongside hemolysis-directed therapy [^113GY3Zj]. If fever persists without a source, I need to ensure vigilance for complications of hemolysis and its treatment, and reassess for evolving or occult drivers that may not have been apparent initially [^115AvKhB].

> I will now examine specific AIHA phenotypes where fever may be particularly relevant. In paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, guidelines emphasize avoiding active cooling for fever, implying that fever management must be individualized and that systemic temperature control can influence hemolysis dynamics in cold-reactive disease, which underscores the nuanced relationship between fever and hemolysis in this subtype [^117EBjcB]. In cold agglutinin disease, maintaining normothermia is recommended perioperatively and in daily care, again highlighting how temperature and systemic inflammatory states can interact with pathogenic cold antibodies and potentially with fever physiology in these patients [^116wh6Zc] [^116GQ3Ky].

> But wait, what if fever is the dominant symptom and hemolysis is subtle. I should confirm that fever alone should not be attributed to AIHA without corroborative hemolytic evidence; fever in AIHA is typically contextual and coexists with anemia-related symptoms, hemolytic labs, and often a secondary driver, so isolated fever mandates a broader infectious, malignant, and rheumatologic differential before anchoring on AIHA as the cause [^113GY3Zj].

> Bottom line, after reviewing guidelines, cohort data, and case series, fever can occur in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but it is not universal and is more commonly seen when AIHA is secondary to infection, malignancy, or drug exposure, or in severe presentations requiring ICU care; mechanistically, fever likely reflects the underlying inflammatory driver, complement-mediated inflammation, or systemic immune activation rather than hemolysis alone, so clinicians should treat fever as a red flag to search for and address the precipitating cause while managing hemolysis appropriately [^113GnCWz] [^114HSFL4] [^114cEtmW].

Fever is **not a core feature** of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) [^notfound], but it can occur, especially in secondary AIHA from infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases [^111mucx9] [^1154fbJy] [^117UDB5W]. Fever is more common in **secondary AIHA** and in severe hemolytic crises, reflecting systemic inflammation or the underlying cause [^114cEtmW] [^114HSFL4]. When fever is present, evaluate for infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease, and manage the underlying cause while providing supportive care [^113GY3Zj] [^111rnJR6].

---

## Frequency of fever in AIHA

Fever is **not a hallmark** of AIHA; when present, it usually reflects the underlying cause or severity [^114HSFL4] [^1154fbJy]. The frequency varies by etiology and clinical context:

- **Primary AIHA**: Fever is uncommon; patients typically present with fatigue, pallor, jaundice, and dark urine [^1138DFyR] [^111mucx9].

- **Secondary AIHA**: Fever is more frequent, especially with infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases [^1154fbJy] [^117UDB5W].

- **Severe hemolytic crises**: Fever can occur in acute, severe hemolysis, reflecting systemic inflammation or cytokine release [^114cEtmW] [^114HSFL4].

---

## Clinical evidence of fever in AIHA

Several studies and case reports document fever in AIHA, particularly in secondary forms or severe cases:

- **Pediatric AIHA**: A study reported fever in 39% of children with warm AIHA, often associated with infections or autoimmune diseases [^114ASFnb].

- **Secondary AIHA**: Fever is common in AIHA secondary to infections (e.g. Mycoplasma, EBV, HIV) [^111fzP2H] [^1154fbJy], malignancies (e.g. lymphoma, leukemia), and autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE) [^117UDB5W].

- **Severe hemolytic crises**: ICU cohorts of severe AIHA report fever in ~40% of cases, reflecting systemic inflammation or cytokine release [^114HSFL4].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking fever to AIHA

Fever in AIHA is **not directly caused by hemolysis** but by associated inflammatory processes:

- **Cytokine release**: Hemolysis releases pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α), causing fever and systemic inflammation [^notfound].

- **Secondary infections**: AIHA increases infection risk, especially with immunosuppressive therapy; infections can cause fever [^112pTJv5] [^115AvKhB].

- **Autoimmune inflammation**: Autoimmune diseases causing AIHA (e.g. SLE) can trigger fever via immune activation [^115hKoCD] [^117ChGb5].

---

## Clinical implications of fever in AIHA

Fever in AIHA **signals a more complex clinical course** and requires careful evaluation:

- **Underlying cause**: Fever suggests secondary AIHA; evaluate for infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases [^113GY3Zj] [^111rnJR6].

- **Disease severity**: Fever may indicate severe hemolysis or systemic inflammation, requiring urgent management [^115AvKhB] [^114HSFL4].

- **Treatment response**: Fever can signal treatment failure or relapse, prompting therapy adjustment [^114wMJq8].

---

## Management of fever in AIHA

Management focuses on the **underlying cause** and supportive care:

- **Identify and treat underlying cause**: Address infections, malignancies, or autoimmune diseases causing AIHA and fever [^111rnJR6] [^111Zfcuq].

- **Supportive care**: Use antipyretics, hydration, and transfusion as needed [^116F3Mgs].

- **Monitor complications**: Watch for infections, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction, especially in severe cases [^115AvKhB].

---

Fever is **not a core feature** of AIHA but can occur, especially in secondary forms or severe hemolysis. It reflects systemic inflammation or the underlying cause and requires evaluation and targeted management.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^115StMcR]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an uncommon entity that presents diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic dilemmas despite being a well-recognized entity for over 150 years. This is because of significant differences in the rates of hemolysis and associated diseases and because there is considerable clinical heterogeneity. In addition, there is a lack of clinical trials required to refine and update standardized and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. To aid the clinician in AIHA management, we present four vignettes that represent and highlight distinct clinical presentations with separate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways that we use in our clinical practice setting. We also review the parameters present in diagnostic testing that allow for prognostic insight and present algorithms for both diagnosis and treatment of the AIHA patient in diverse situations. This is done in the hope that this review may offer guidance in regard to personalized therapy recommendations. A section is included for the diagnosis of suspected AIHA with negative test results, a relatively infrequent but challenging situation, in order to assist in the overall evaluation spectrum for these patients.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1138DFyR]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on autoimmune hemolytic anemia:

- Definition: AIHA is an acquired disorder where the immune system produces antibodies against RBC antigens, leading to hemolysis.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of AIHA involves warm antibody-mediated and cold agglutinin disease. In warm type, IgG antibodies bind to RBCs at normal body temperature, leading to their destruction primarily in the spleen and liver. Cold type involves IgM antibodies that bind to RBCs at colder temperatures, typically in the extremities, causing destruction mainly in the peripheral circulation.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of AIHA in the US is estimated at 17 per 100,000 population.
- Disease course: Clinically, AIHA usually presents with fatigue and other constitutional symptoms due to anemia. Other signs and symptoms may include jaundice due to the breakdown of RBCs and shortness of breath. Physical examination may reveal pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of AIHA can vary widely. It can run a chronic course with severe intermittent exacerbations. The response to treatment can also influence the prognosis.

### Coexistent sickle-cell anemia and autoimmune disease in eight children: pitfalls and challenges [^1175fheF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common inherited condition in African, Caribbean, and Mediterranean countries. Production of abnormal hemoglobin S is responsible for the sickling of red blood cells in deoxygenated conditions. SCD manifests itself as chronic intravascular hemolysis, vaso-occlusion and painful crises. Over time, multiple organ damage can develop. Patients with SCD display a defective activation of the alternate complement pathway, leading to an increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria (pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae). It was suggested that complement abnormalities could predispose to autoimmune disease (AID). However, the frequency of coexisting SCD and AID has not been evaluated, and most data come from case reports. Manifestations of AID, such as fever, polyarthritis, and multiorgan involvement, can also be caused by SCD, leading to a delay in diagnosing the AID. Furthermore, antiinflammatory drugs such as steroids and immunosuppressive therapy used to treat AID can induce severe SCD complications.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113YZYZW]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) autoantibodies are a relatively uncommon cause of anemia. However, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) must be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemolytic anemias, especially if the patient has a concomitant lymphoproliferative disorder, autoimmune disease, or viral or mycoplasmal infection. Classifications of AIHA include warm AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed-type AIHA, and drug-induced AIHA. Characteristics of the autoantibodies are responsible for the various clinical entities. As a result, diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and a serologic work-up. For each classification of AIHA, this review discusses the demographics, etiology, clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment options.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^1146TPFu]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and clinically complex hematologic disorder defined by the simultaneous presence of both warm and cold autoantibodies, resulting in severe and often treatment-resistant hemolysis. Due to variability in diagnostic criteria and limited data, a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management remains incomplete. To address these gaps, we performed a systematic literature review employing stringent diagnostic criteria to evaluate epidemiologic patterns, clinical features, and therapeutic outcomes. Our analysis included 81 patients identified across 35 studies, revealing a median age of 45years and a notable female predominance (2.25:1). Autoimmune diseases constituted the most frequent underlying etiology, followed by hematologic malignancies and infections. Patients exhibited significant anemia, with median nadir hemoglobin levels reaching 5.6g/dL. Corticosteroids represented the most common therapeutic intervention; however, only 43% of patients achieved remission, while 37% experienced chronic hemolysis, and mortality reached 11%. Many patients required multiple lines of therapy, including rituximab and cytotoxic agents, highlighting the disease's refractory nature and management complexity. The substantial variability in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches emphasizes an urgent need for standardized diagnostic criteria, earlier integration of combination therapies, and exploration of innovative treatment modalities. Future prospective, multicenter studies are essential to refine disease recognition, optimize therapeutic strategies, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in mixed AIHA.

### Complications of autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^115AvKhB]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHIA) is the group of acquired autoimmune conditions resulting from the development of autologous antibodies directed against autologous red blood cell antigens resulting in red cell lysis. Beyond the presence, severity, and duration of hemolysis which can lead to symptomatic anemia, additional complications at presentation and during treatment require a high degree of clinical vigilance. These include among others cutaneous, thrombotic, renal disorders, and infectious disorders. Complications can be due to the presence of the pathologic antibody itself, the process of hemolysis, or attributed to treatment. Comprehensive management of AIHA requires awareness and assessment of complications at diagnosis, during, and following treatment.

The causes of hemolytic anemia are numerous and a systematic approach is critical for proper identification and classification. The direct antiglobulin test can establish the diagnosis and subclassify the majority of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Further testing to identify the driver of AIHA can have significant implications in overall management. Advanced testing for rare nonimmune acquired hemolytic anemias or hereditary hemolytic anemias may be necessary if DAT testing is negative.

### Protracted febrile illness and coma in an adolescent with sickle cell disease and malaria [^117APFfT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

A 15-year-old adolescent with sickle cell disease (SCD) presented at a tertiary care children's hospital with severe hemolysis after returning from West Africa. Over a period of 5 weeks, the patient experienced recurrent hemolysis, fever, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, with worsening conditions despite immunosuppressive and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Eventually, cerebral malaria (CM) was diagnosed and treated, leading to a prompt recovery; however, another episode of hemolysis occurred 12 days after artesunate treatment. The unusually prolonged course of CM in this case illustrates the complex interplay among malaria, SCD, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and various treatments. Furthermore, the case highlights challenges related to managing severe malaria in non-endemic countries and underscores the importance of timely malaria testing, especially in vulnerable patients with a suitable travel history. A thorough travel history is essential for the early diagnosis and appropriate management of malaria. Heightened awareness is needed among both high-risk travelers and healthcare providers to reduce malaria-related morbidity and mortality.

Uncompensated autoantibody-mediated red blood cell (RBC) consumption is the hallmark of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Classification of AIHA is pathophysiologically based and divides AIHA into warm, mixed or cold-reactive subtypes. This thermal-based classification is based on the optimal autoantibody-RBC reactivity temperatures. AIHA is further subcategorized into idiopathic and secondary with the later being associated with a number of underlying infectious, neoplastic and autoimmune disorders. In most cases AIHA is confirmed by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). The standard therapeutic approaches to treatment of AIHA include corticosteroids, splenectomy, immunosuppressive agents and monoclonal antibodies.

ABSTRACT

Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and clinically complex hematologic disorder defined by the simultaneous presence of both warm and cold autoantibodies, resulting in severe and often treatment‐resistant hemolysis. Due to variability in diagnostic criteria and limited data, a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management remains incomplete. To address these gaps, we performed a systematic literature review employing stringent diagnostic criteria to evaluate epidemiologic patterns, clinical features, and therapeutic outcomes. Our analysis included 81 patients identified across 35 studies, revealing a median age of 45 years and a notable female predominance (2.25:1). Autoimmune diseases constituted the most frequent underlying etiology, followed by hematologic malignancies and infections. Patients exhibited significant anemia, with median nadir hemoglobin levels reaching 5.6 g/dL.

Conclusions

AIHA can be life threatening if not treated promptly. It is always prudent to exclude any inciting factor, particularly drugs because cessation of the drug is often sufficient to resolve the hemolysis. Immunotherapy agents have been approved in several solid and hematologic malignancies, therefore, it is important for all health care professionals caring for cancer patients to recognize the adverse effects of immunotherapy, especially AIHA as depicted in our case.

Hematologic toxicities — conditions and timing: Immune-related hematologic toxicities include hemolytic anemia, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, lymphopenia, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and acquired hemophilia A. The median time to onset is 5.7 weeks but can range from 1 to 84 weeks. Hemolytic anemia may present with weakness, paleness, jaundice, dark-colored urine, fever, and heart murmur; immune-related TTP can present as fever, mild renal failure, and neurologic manifestations such as seizures, hemiplegia, and visual disturbances; presenting symptoms of immune therapy–induced hemolytic uremic syndrome may include bloody diarrhea, decreased urination or blood in the urine, abdominal pain, vomiting and occasionally fever, and pallor.

### How I treat autoimmune hemolytic anemias in adults [^113CYTxn]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a heterogeneous disease with respect to the type of the antibody involved and the absence or presence of an underlying condition. Treatment decisions should be based on careful diagnostic evaluation. Primary warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias respond well to steroids, but most patients remain steroid-dependent, and many require second-line treatment. Currently, splenectomy can be regarded as the most effective and best-evaluated second-line therapy, but there are still only limited data on long-term efficacy and adverse effects. The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab is another second-line therapy with documented short-term efficacy, but there is limited information on long-term efficacy and side effects. The efficacy of immunosuppressants is poorly evaluated. Primary cold antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias respond well to rituximab but are resistant to steroids and splenectomy. The most common causes of secondary autoimmune hemolytic anemias are malignancies, immune diseases, or drugs. They may be treated in a way similar to primary autoimmune hemolytic anemias, by immunosuppressants or by treatment of the underlying disease.

Following his acute treatment during that hospital admission, he was lost to follow-up. During his subsequent admission, 5years later, he was found to have a systemic autoimmune disorder with a superimposed acute bacterial infection leading to a second case of haemolytic anaemia and at this time with both cold and warm antibodies present. While his diagnosis was initially difficult to make due to both derangements in expected laboratory values and the mixed pattern of the haemolytic anaemia, he was promptly treated with intravenous immune globulin and steroids and was able to make a full recovery.

Anemias

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)

In autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), autoantibodies (IgG, IgM, or both) against red blood cells (RBCs) are formed, substantially decreasing the RBCs' lifespan (Table 2). Although AIHA is an unusual event, it is the most common hematologic ICI-related adverse event. It occurs in 0.15 to 0.25% of patients treated with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and is less common in patients treated with CTLA-4 inhibitors, occurring in only 0.06%⁶. AIHA most often occurs in patients who have malignant melanoma, followed by those with lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma. It can develop up to 78 weeks after the last exposure to ICI, with a 10-week median time to occurrence. Approximately 15% of ICI-related AIHA cases are fatal, although definitive causality could not always be established⁷.

Table 2
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)

The two types of drug-induced AIHA are warm AIHA and cold AIHA. Warm AIHA is modulated by IgG, with autoantibodies active at > 37 °C. Cold AIHA is modulated by IgM, with autoantibodies active at 0–4 °C. The warm type is the most common ICI-related AIHA. Patients who develop ICI-related AIHA may have an existing lymphoproliferative disorder or present with other conditions such as babesiosis, viral infections, or prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings — fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, jaundice, tachycardia, pallor, and splenomegaly. Severity correlates with the degree of hemolysis. Cold AIHA has additional features, including cold-induced acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and livedo reticularis.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^115hKoCD]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical findings and establishing diagnosis

AIHA can be diagnosed in a stepwise manner. First, the anaemia must be established as haemolytic, which can be ascertained by serum biochemistry of haemolytic markers (eg, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin), presence of reticulocytosis and by examination of the peripheral blood smear. Second, using direct antiglobulin test, the clinician should determine whether autoimmunity against red blood cells is triggering haemolysis. Lastly, identification of the type of antibody responsible for haemolysis has to be defined. Warm-acting-AIHA and cold-acting-AIHA are based on the optimal temperature of antigen–antibody reactivity. This multitiered approach should lead to diagnosis or exclusion of the diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE.

Patients with AIHA present with constitutional signs and symptoms of anaemia, including fatigue and dyspnoea on exertion. Patients with SLE with AIHA can have other concomitant autoimmune haematological manifestations. For example, patients with SLE can present with AIHA and thrombocytopenia concomitantly or sequentially, which is known as Evans syndrome. Patients with Evans syndrome may have frequent relapses, once glucocorticoids have been tapered or stopped. Hence, when a diagnosis of AIHA in patients with SLE has been established, monitoring for the development of thrombocytopenia is important.

1 Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by the premature destruction of autologous red blood cells (RBCs) due to autoantibody‐mediated hemolysis. The etiology of AIHA is multifaceted. Cases are typically considered either primary or secondary to conditions such as autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancies, or drug exposure. AIHA may be categorized based on the optimal thermal reactivity of the autoantibodies involved, resulting in distinct subtypes including warm AIHA, cold AIHA (i.e. cold agglutinin disease or cold agglutinin syndrome), mixed AIHA, and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH). Among these, warm AIHA is the most prevalent, accounting for over two‐thirds of adult cases, whereas mixed AIHA, although less common, remains clinically significant.

Mixed AIHA is characterized by the presence of both warm (IgG)‐ and cold (IgM)‐reactive autoantibodies, resulting in a complex and often treatment‐resistant clinical presentation. Reports suggest that mixed AIHA accounts for fewer than 10% of AIHA cases, though its true incidence is difficult to ascertain due to inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria across studies. Some studies have proposed that mixed AIHA imparts a more severe clinical course, often necessitating multiple lines of therapy and leading to increased transfusion dependence. However, the rarity of the condition — coupled with the variability in laboratory definitions and diagnostic methodologies — continues to hinder a comprehensive understanding of its epidemiology and optimal management.

Previous literature reviews on mixed AIHA have been limited by inconsistent case definitions and methodological challenges. Many studies have diagnosed mixed AIHA using broad or non‐specific diagnostic criteria, such as a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) for both IgG and complement (C3), without further confirmatory testing. Critical assessments, including elution studies to verify warm autoantibodies and thermal amplitude testing to identify pathologic cold autoantibodies, are often absent. To address these limitations, we conducted a systematic review of the available literature on mixed AIHA using strict diagnostic criteria published by the British Society of Hematology and the First International Consensus Meeting, aiming to refine our understanding of its epidemiology, clinical presentation, and responses to treatment.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patients with β-thalassemia major [^1125wymg]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Hemolysis is a common feature in patients with β-thalassemia major. As a result, autoimmune hemolytic anemia complicating β-thalassemia is easily overlooked. Here, the authors described the clinical features and management of 7 patients with β-thalassemia major and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. These patients had fever, cough, and tea-colored urine on admission. The laboratory investigations showed a significant drop in hemoglobin and increased serum bilirubin. Coombs' tests revealed that anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-C3 was positive in 7 and 5 cases, respectively, whereas anti-Rh E alloantibody was positive in 3 cases. All the patients received corticosteroids treatments and blood transfusions. Patients with anti-Rh E alloantibodies also received immunoglobulin treatments. Six of the patients responded well to the management, but 1 patient developed recurrent autoimmune hemolytic anemia that required cyclosporin A treatment. All the patients remained well by following up for more than 6 months.

### Kala-azar associated with coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the patients coming from the endemic area of this disease and successful treatment of these patients with liposomal amphotericin B [^113TBFQM]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Kala-azar is an intracellular parasitic infection that infects and multiplies in the macrophages of the liver, the spleen, and the bone marrow. It is characterized by intermittent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Although anemia is a usual finding, Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) has rarely been reported with this disease. Pentavalent antimonial compounds remain the mainstay of treatment worldwide. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is currently preferred in the treatment of kala-azar because of the resistance to pentavalent antimonals. The authors diagnosed kala-azar associated with Coombs-positive AIHA in 3 patients and treated them with L-AmB (1–5 mg/kg/day) for 30–36 days. Now, all of these patients are healthy following up at the outpatient base for 18–34 months. Kala-azar must be considered in patients with Coombs-positive AIHA and living in and coming from the endemic region for this disease, and it can be successfully treated with L-AmB.

### Cold AIHA and the best treatment strategies [^116xTvBh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Cold-reactive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is rare among the hemolytic anemias. It results when 1 of a variety of processes causes the generation of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies against endogenous erythrocytes, resulting in complement activation and predominantly intravascular hemolysis. Cold AIHA is typically a primary lymphoproliferative disorder with marrow B-cell clones producing pathogenic IgM. More rarely, secondary cold AIHA (cAIHA) can develop from malignancy, infection, or other autoimmune disorders. However, in children cAIHA is typically post infection, mild, and self-limited. Symptoms include a sequelae of anemia, fatigue, and acrocyanosis. The severity of disease is variable and highly dependent on the thermal binding range of the autoantibody. In adults, treatment has most commonly focused on reducing antibody production with rituximab-based regimens. The addition of cytotoxic agents to rituximab improves response rates, but at the expense of tolerability. Recent insights into the cause of cold agglutinin disease as a clonal disorder driven by complement form the basis of newer therapeutic options. While rituximab-based regimens are still the mainstay of therapy, options have now expanded to include complement-directed treatments and other B-cell-directed or plasma-cell-directed therapies.

### Brief report: how Do patients with newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus present? A multicenter cohort of early systemic lupus erythematosus to inform the development of new classification criteria [^117ChGb5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms that are also found in other conditions. This study aimed to evaluate manifestations at disease onset and to compare early SLE manifestations to those of diseases mimicking SLE.

Methods

Academic lupus centers in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America collected baseline data on patients who were referred to them during the previous 3 years for possible SLE and who had a symptom duration of < 1 year. Clinical and serologic manifestations were compared between patients diagnosed as having SLE and those diagnosed as having SLE-mimicking conditions. Diagnostic performance of the 1997 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) SLE classification criteria and the 2012 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) SLE classification criteria was tested.

Results

Data were collected on 389 patients with early SLE and 227 patients with SLE-mimicking conditions. Unexplained fever was more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions (34.5% versus 13.7%, respectively; P < 0.001). Features less common in early SLE included Raynaud's phenomenon (22.1% versus 48.5%; P < 0.001), sicca symptoms (4.4% versus 34.4%; P < 0.001), dysphagia (0.3% versus 6.2%; P < 0.001), and fatigue (28.3% versus 37.0%; P = 0.024). Anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-β 2 -glycoprotein I antibodies, positive Coombs' test results, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypocomplementemia, and leukopenia were more common in early SLE than in SLE-mimicking conditions. Symptoms detailed in the ACR and SLICC classification criteria were significantly more frequent among those with early SLE. Fewer patients with early SLE were not identified as having early SLE with use of the SLICC criteria compared to the ACR criteria (16.5% versus 33.9%), but the ACR criteria demonstrated higher specificity than the SLICC criteria (91.6% versus 82.4%).

Conclusion

In this multicenter cohort, clinical manifestations that could help to distinguish early SLE from SLE-mimicking conditions were identified. These findings may aid in earlier SLE diagnosis and provide information for ongoing initiatives to revise SLE classification criteria.

### Severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in ICU: a place for emergency plasma exchange? A French multicenter retrospective study [^115F7Kt5]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by autoantibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells. Its estimated prevalence is about 17 per 100,000 individuals. Severe hemolytic crises requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission represent a life-threatening acute complication, with reported mortality rates ranging from 13 to 30%. These cases present significant therapeutic challenges, as standard treatments often fail to rapidly control hemolysis and stabilize patients.

First-line corticosteroid therapy induces an initial response in approximately 80% of patients; however, it may take up to 2 weeks to be efficient. Second-line options, including Rituximab and other immunosuppressive agents, while effective, are also limited by their delayed onset of action. Besides, red blood cell transfusions, although essential in managing severe anemia and safe in most cases, are often reportedly ineffective, limiting their role in severe AIHA management.

In this context, plasma exchange (PlEx) therapy has emerged as a potential rescue treatment for severe hemolytic crises. By rapidly removing circulating autoantibodies and complement components, PlEx offers a theoretical advantage in stabilizing critically ill patients. However, clinical evidence supporting its efficacy in AIHA remains scarce and controversial. Current American guidelines classify PlEx as a category II recommendation for cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and category III for warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), reflecting the lack of robust data.

Despite advances in understanding AIHA, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding patients with severe hemolytic crises requiring ICU admission, particularly those with profound anemia and organ failure due to active hemolysis. This study aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of severe AIHA in ICU, describing epidemiology, prognostic factors, and the potential role of PlEx in this high-risk population.

### How I treat warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^114wMJq8]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is caused by increased erythrocyte destruction by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, with or without complement activation. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by macrophages/activated lymphocytes occurs in the lymphoid organs and spleen (extravascular hemolysis). The ability of the bone marrow (BM) to compensate determines clinical severity. The different pathogenic mechanisms, their complex interplay, and changes over time may explain wAIHA's great clinical heterogeneity and unpredictable course. The disease may be primary, drug induced, or associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasms, autoimmune and infectious diseases, immunodeficiencies, solid tumors, or transplants. Therapeutic interventions include steroids, splenectomy, immunosuppressants, and rituximab; the latter is increasingly used in steroid-refractory cases based on evidence from the literature and a few prospective trials. We present 5 patient case studies highlighting important issues: (1) the diagnosis and proper use of steroid therapy, (2) the concerns about the choice between rituximab and splenectomy in second-line treatment, (3) the need of periodical re-evaluation of the disease to assess the possible evolution of relapsed/refractory cases in myelodysplastic and BM failure syndromes, and (4) the difficulties in managing cases of severe/acute disease that are at high risk of relapse. Incorporating novel targeted therapies into clinical practice will be an exciting challenge in the future.

### A rare presentation of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^111fzP2H]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus spread by intimate contact. It is known to cause infectious mononucleosis. Complications, including hematologic pathology and splenic rupture, are uncommon. This report is a case of EBV-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis.

Case Report

An 18-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. He did not have risk factors for liver injury or hepatitis. His vital signs were notable for a fever. On examination, he was obviously jaundiced, but not in distress. Laboratory evaluation showed hemolytic anemia and biliary stasis. Ultimately, his inpatient workup yielded positive EBV serology and a positive direct agglutinin test with cold agglutinins. He made a full recovery with supportive care. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? EBV is a widely disseminated herpesvirus. Infectious mononucleosis is a common presentation of acute infection, and treatment of EBV-related diseases are largely supportive. Complications, such as splenic rupture and hematologic pathology, are uncommon. Biliary stasis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia in the form of cold agglutinin disease secondary to EBV is rare, and typically resolves with supportive care and cold avoidance. More advanced treatment methods are available in the setting of severe hemolysis. Elevated transaminases, direct hyperbilirubinemia, or evidence of hemolytic anemia in the setting of a nonspecific viral syndrome should raise suspicion for EBV infection. Rapid recognition can lead to more prompt prevention and treatment of other EBV-related complications.

### Clinical and epidemiological features of paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria: a systematic review [^114h18td]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an uncommon disorder affecting between ∼1 and 3 per 100 000 patients per year and is characterized by the development of autoantibodies directed against erythrocyte antigens. Originally described by Dressler in 1854, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is among the rarest forms of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias, with an estimated annual incidence of 0.04 cases per 100 000 persons.,

Historically, PCH was often described as a chronic condition in patients afflicted with tertiary or congenital syphilis who presented with "paroxysms" of hemoglobinuria after exposure to cold temperatures and subsequent rewarming. However, the advent and widespread use of effective antitreponemal therapy is believed to have significantly altered the epidemiology and clinical course of this condition.

Today, the medical consensus derived from anecdotal reports and small case series is that PCH typically presents acutely with intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria after an infectious insult, predominantly in the pediatric population. Although resolution of hemolysis is thought to occur within a relatively short timeframe, the anemia may be abrupt and severe, frequently necessitating blood transfusion to prevent hemodynamic collapse. In addition to blood transfusion, various interventions including corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, as well as patient warming have been attempted to ameliorate the hemolysis, however, controversy remains as to whether medical therapy is effective in these patients.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^111kLtJd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Hemolytic anemia is defined by the premature destruction of red blood cells, and can be chronic or life-threatening. It should be part of the differential diagnosis for any normocytic or macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis may occur intravascularly, extravascularly in the reticuloendothelial system, or both. Mechanisms include poor deformability leading to trapping and phagocytosis, antibody-mediated destruction through phagocytosis or direct complement activation, fragmentation due to microthrombi or direct mechanical trauma, oxidation, or direct cellular destruction. Patients with hemolysis may present with acute anemia, jaundice, hematuria, dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and possibly hypotension. Laboratory test results that confirm hemolysis include reticulocytosis, as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. The direct antiglobulin test further differentiates immune causes from nonimmune causes. A peripheral blood smear should be performed when hemolysis is present to identify abnormal red blood cell morphologies. Hemolytic diseases are classified into hemoglobinopathies, membranopathies, enzymopathies, immune-mediated anemias, and extrinsic nonimmune causes. Extrinsic nonimmune causes include the thrombotic microangiopathies, direct trauma, infections, systemic diseases, and oxidative insults. Medications can cause hemolytic anemia through several mechanisms. A rapid onset of anemia or significant hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period should prompt consideration of a hemolytic anemia.

### Early diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma: clues from routine blood smear morphologic findings [^117UDB5W]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a mature B-cell neoplasm characterized by malignant lymphoid cells within the lumina of blood vessels and capillaries. Given its varied and nonspecific clinical manifestation, this aggressive disease is often not diagnosed until an advanced clinical stage or even at autopsy. This case highlights a patient presenting with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and fevers. Atypical circulating cells on a screening peripheral smear lead to flow cytometric studies highlighting an increase in large, light chain restricted CD20 positive cells. A diagnostic bone marrow biopsy was performed and trephine cores demonstrated predominantly intrasinusoidal lymphoma cells. In conjunction with additional immunophenotypic data, these studies strongly supported a diagnosis of IVLBCL. Judicious use of flow cytometry and morphology resulted in an early-stage diagnosis and likely contributed to the patient's current complete remission status following anti-CD20 therapy. Differential diagnoses for this presentation are discussed in light of serologic, immunophenotypic, histologic, and cytogenetic findings.

### Mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a systematic review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, therapies, and outcomes [^113soQaw]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We identified 35 reports encompassing 81 patients who met strict criteria for mixed AIHA, with a significant overrepresentation of females. The severity of anemia was notable, with a median hemoglobin level below 6.0 g/dL, aligning with previous findings. Treatment approaches were heterogeneous, and more than half of patients received at least two therapeutic interventions, with corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide among the most frequently used therapies. Fewer than half of the patients achieved remission, underscoring the complex nature and treatment challenges of this rare condition and emphasizing the need for standardized diagnostic and management strategies.

One of our key findings was the lack of a significant difference in remission rates independent of cold antibody titer, suggesting that cold agglutinin titer alone may not reliably predict disease severity or treatment response. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of thermal amplitude rather than titer levels alone in determining the pathogenicity of cold agglutinins. However, many studies identified in the literature diagnosed mixed AIHA based solely on a positive DAT and red cell agglutination (e.g. such as at immediate spin or as observed on peripheral blood smear examination), precluding their inclusion in our analysis. The mere presence of a cold agglutinin does not establish pathogenicity. Indeed, Petz and Garratty reported that 35% of patients with WAIHA have strong cold agglutinins that, when tested appropriately, display low titers at 4°C and are non‐reactive at physiologic body temperature (i.e. narrow thermal amplitude), indicating a lack of clinical significance. Therefore, identifying a pathologic cold autoantibody that reacts at body temperature (≥ 30°C) appears to be a more relevant marker when clinical significance is in question.

### C1-inhibitor treatment in patients with severe complement-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^114cEtmW]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to look at the markers of systemic inflammation in severe CM-AIHA. We observed significantly elevated nucleosomes and neutrophil activation as evidenced by EA complexes at baseline. The nucleosome levels found in patients with CM-AIHA are in between levels of patients with deep venous thrombosis, fever, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome on the lower end and sepsis and septic shock on the higher end. A previous study found that nucleosomes, but not EA complexes, were increased in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria if they had a history of thrombosis. In our study, we saw no change in inflammatory markers after C1-INH administration. This might be related to the lack of durable effect of C1-INH treatment on systemic complement activation or hemolytic activity, because their products are considered main activators of neutrophil activation. Taken together, nucleosome and EA complexes are potential biomarkers in CM-AIHA to assess systemic inflammation and possibly prothrombotic state. It would be interesting to prospectively study these in a larger cohort in which correlations with thrombotic markers and disease activity can be made.

### Brucellosis-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia treated with rituximab [^115N5zzs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a case of brucellosis-induced severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) that was refractory to traditional corticosteroid treatment and eventually treated with rituximab apart from antibiotic therapy and to discuss the potential role of rituximab in similar cases of AIHA triggered by an underlying reversible cause.

Case Summary

A 79-year-old woman was diagnosed with severe AIHA (reticulocyte count 21.5%, hemoglobin 6 g/dL). Initial treatment with prednisone in a regional hospital was not efficacious. Brucellosis was diagnosed by serology; the disease was further complicated by hepatic and splenic granulomatous involvement and sacral bone localization. Due to the severity of AIHA as demonstrated by reticulocyte count and hemoglobin levels, the initial unresponsiveness to corticosteroid therapy, the potential of the underlying infectious cause to relapse along with AIHA, and the localization of the pathogen in a focal site (bone involvement) that could act as a constant AIHA trigger, the patient was treated aggressively with rituximab, apart from the typical antimicrobial therapy.

Discussion

Brucellosis can induce autoimmunity and mimic primary hematologic diseases. We reviewed reports on the unique forms of Brucella-induced hemolysis available in the literature. Massive hemolysis, though, is rare, and in the case of a pathogen such as brucellosis, one cannot ignore the potential for infection relapse accompanied by hemolysis relapse. Cases refractory to corticosteroids are typically treated with invasive amputative procedures such as splenectomy. However, in cases where an underlying therapeutically reversible cause of infection can be identified, the proven short-term efficacy and safety profile of rituximab can be of significance.

Conclusions

Novel therapeutic approaches with molecular agents such as rituximab may assist in treatment of considerably severe infectious pathogen-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia that is refractory to first-line therapy.

### Development and consequences of red blood cell autoantibodies: warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113TcFw7]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare disorder caused by loss of tolerance to red blood cell (RBC) antigens, leading to their destruction by autoantibodies. AIHA can occur as a primary condition or secondary to infections, malignancies, or immune-modulating therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. This review focuses on the roles of B and T cells in disease initiation and progression of warm AIHA. We discuss recent studies highlighting the importance of dysregulated CD4+ T cells in driving autoreactive B cell responses and autoantibody production and highlight a new role for purinergic signaling in contributing to T cell dysfunction. This dysfunction results in an imbalance between T regulatory cells and proinflammatory Th17 cells, further exacerbating the autoimmune response. Treatment strategies have variable success, with relapse rates of up to 50% and mortality in ∼11%. As such, we also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies, which may potentially lead to more effective and targeted treatments for this serious condition.

### Unusual presentation of rosai-dorfman disease in a 14-month-old Italian child: a case report and review of the literature [^117QZUhz]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

The onset of the disease is generally subtle, with an average of 3–6 months between the beginning of signs and symptoms and the diagnosis. Non-specific systemic symptoms can be present, including fever, malaise, weight loss, and night sweats. They are more frequent in case of an important nodal involvement, but cases of patients with systemic symptoms in which RDD was purely extranodal have been reported. In case of extranodal localizations, the clinical picture will depend on the affected organ or apparatus. In our case, the only systemic symptom was the low-grade fever, appearing approximately 40 days after the first observation of the parotid swelling.

Laboratory findings in RDD are non-specific. The most frequent features include leukocytosis, elevated ESR and CRP levels, and polyclonal gammopathy. Normochromic normocytic anemia and elevated serum ferritin levels have also been described. Less common laboratory abnormalities include positivity for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies, and a reversal of the CD4/CD8 ratio in peripheral lymphocytes. There are also reports on RDD complicated by the development of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, especially in children, for which the pathogenetic mechanism is not known.

5 Limitations

Our study has limitations, primarily related to the reliance on published case reports and small retrospective studies, which may be subject to publication bias and incomplete reporting. Further, the diagnostic heterogeneity (e.g. different testing platforms, methodologies, and reagents; various immunohematologic criteria for diagnosing mixed AIHA) across studies complicates direct comparisons. Many reports defined mixed AIHA based on a positive DAT for both IgG and complement, without stringent thermal amplitude testing or additional immunohematologic assessments, such as serum and elution studies, precluding further analysis. Acutely ill patients may exhibit a positive DAT that is not necessarily due to an autoantibody, making it essential to differentiate true mixed AIHA from incidental serologic findings. Given the variability in diagnostic approaches, the true prevalence and clinical impact of mixed AIHA remain uncertain. Although a strict framework was used to identify reviewed cases, the diagnosis of mixed AIHA remains controversial given the range of immunohematology and clinical findings described with the condition. Furthermore, the broad timeframe over which the included studies were published (1975–2024) poses challenges in comparing treatment strategies, as advancements in medical management have evolved significantly over time. Finally, while some patients with acute, severe disease may be treated with faster‐acting therapies including bendamustine, eculizumab, and therapeutic plasma exchange, our review did not separately analyze these patients due to small sample size and inconsistent reporting.

Evans syndrome (ES) is a simultaneous or subsequent development of two haematological disorders, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with an underlying disease). Primary Evans is a diagnosis of exclusion and has a poorer prognosis than AIHA or ITP alone. We present a 55-year-old man who presented with weakness and lethargy and was diagnosed to be suffering from primary ES.

### Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^113HRzaU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare and heterogeneous disease that affects 1 to 3/100000 patients per year. AIHA caused by warm autoantibodies (w-AIHA), ie, antibodies that react with their antigens on the red blood cell optimally at 37°C, is the most common type, comprising ∼70% to 80% of all adult cases and ∼50% of pediatric cases. About half of the w-AIHA cases are called primary because no specific etiology can be found, whereas the rest are secondary to other recognizable underlying disorders. This review will focus on the postulated immunopathogenetic mechanisms in idiopathic and secondary w-AIHA and report on the rare cases of direct antiglobulin test-negative AIHA, which are even more likely to be fatal because of inherent characteristics of the causative antibodies, as well as because of delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Then, the characteristics of w-AIHA associated with genetically defined immune dysregulation disorders and special considerations on its management will be discussed. Finally, the standard treatment options and newer therapeutic approaches for this chronic autoimmune blood disorder will be reviewed.

6 Future Research Directions

Future research efforts should focus on the development and implementation of standardized diagnostic criteria for mixed AIHA and the establishment of prospective, multicenter registries to better characterize this rare condition. Immunohematology evaluation should include characterization of both the warm and cold components, including serum and elution studies, cold agglutinin titers, and thermal amplitude testing. While antibody titer testing may be more widely available, titers are subject to wide inter‐ and intra‐laboratory variation, and future research should investigate the effect of changes in thermal amplitude over the course of therapy on clinical outcomes.

Importantly, there is a pressing need for clinical recommendations that guide a standardized diagnostic approach, not only to improve case definitions for research but also to inform treatment selection and monitor therapeutic response. Diagnostic inconsistencies across studies have contributed to challenges in interpreting treatment efficacy, as the lack of detailed immunohematologic characterization obscures whether observed outcomes reflect true therapeutic effects or underlying diagnostic heterogeneity. Future recommendations should emphasize incorporating comprehensive immunohematology testing into both initial and longitudinal patient evaluations, ideally with defined testing protocols that can be adopted across institutions. Without such diagnostic rigor, clinicians and researchers cannot reliably determine whether treatments are effective or ineffective, hindering both evidence synthesis and patient care. Establishing clear diagnostic benchmarks will enhance the interpretability of future studies and may facilitate biomarker development to predict treatment response.

### A 66-year-old woman with fever, cough, and a tongue lesion [^112ejWRf]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old woman presented with acute onset of fever, chills, and productive cough associated with right-sided chest pain. During a recent hospitalization for dyspnea, she had been diagnosed with Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and had been taking a tapering dose of prednisone starting approximately 6 weeks prior to admission. In the interim, her dyspnea had resolved on treatment with steroids. At the time of presentation, her prednisone dose was 40 mg. Additional medical history included VTE, for which the patient was receiving anticoagulation therapy, and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. Many years earlier, she had been treated for TB in her home country. The patient had immigrated to Queens, New York, from a Nepalese village 8 years prior. While still in Nepal, she had worked on a farm and had been in close proximity to cows. In Queens, she lived with her family in a house with a small garden but had no pets. Recent travel included a visit to Nepal 9 months ago and a trip to Syracuse, New York, one month prior to presentation. She was a never smoker and did not consume alcohol.

### Impact and management of warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus [^114kp2m8]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (wAIHA) is a rare autoantibody-mediated disorder that may occur in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The clinical course of wAIHA is highly variable, ranging from anaemia compensated adequately by reticulocytosis to severe, life-threatening cases. While insights into the pathogenesis of wAIHA in SLE remain limited, emerging evidence highlights the risk factors and impact of wAIHA in the context of SLE. Management of wAIHA associated with SLE remains challenging as there is limited clinical evidence to support treatment decisions. New therapies, some that target underlying disease mechanisms relevant to both conditions, are in development. In this review, we examine the impact of wAIHA on clinical outcomes for patients with SLE, summarise the current management strategies along with unmet needs, and provide an update on novel therapeutic strategies.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children [^114ASFnb]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical and hematological profile and treatment outcome of children with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) were assessed using retrospective case record analysis. There were 26 (17 idiopathic; 9 secondary) patients with a median age of 11 years. Pallor (100%), fever (39%), and jaundice (59%) were the main presenting complaints. Jaundice was much more common in idiopathic (70%) compared to secondary (44%). Direct antiglobulin test was negative in 3 patients. Oral prednisolone produced remission in 81% patients. Four patients relapsed after a median period of 7 months (2 months to 2 year) after response. All responded to a second course of steroids in median 14 days. One child required cyclosporin A in addition. No correlation was found between response and parameters such as age, sex, jaundice, low pretreatment hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, total leukocyte count, platelet count, subtype of AIHA, and hepatosplenomegaly. Relapse correlated with increased duration between the onset of symptoms and treatment. This study indicates that oral prednisolone is an effective therapy for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In refractory cases cyclosporine A may be useful.

### Low-dose rituximab and alemtuzumab combination therapy for patients with steroid-refractory autoimmune cytopenias [^1136rHQy]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment of autoimmune cytopenias remains unsatisfactory for patients refractory to first-line management. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of low-dose rituximab plus alemtuzumab in patients with steroid-refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Nineteen of 21 included patients were assessable for response (11 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 8 with autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Treatment with 10 mg of alemtuzumab subcutaneously on days 1 to 3, plus 100 mg of rituximab intravenously weekly in 4 doses, was administered. The overall response rate was 100%, with complete response in 58%. The median response duration was 46 weeks (range, 16–89 weeks). Median follow-up was 70 weeks (range, 37–104 weeks). Most toxicity was grade 1 fever related to the first dose. Six patients developed infections. The combination of rituximab and alemtuzumab is feasible and has an acceptable safety profile and remarkable clinical activity in this group of patients. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00749112.

### Treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemias [^115xhXYa]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a relatively uncommon disorder caused by autoantibodies directed against self red blood cells. It can be idiopathic or secondary, and classified as warm, cold (cold hemagglutinin disease (CAD) and paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria) or mixed, according to the thermal range of the autoantibody. AIHA may develop gradually, or have a fulminant onset with life-threatening anemia. The treatment of AIHA is still not evidence-based. The first-line therapy for warm AIHA are corticosteroids, which are effective in 70–85% of patients and should be slowly tapered over a time period of 6–12 months. For refractory/relapsed cases, the current sequence of second-line therapy is splenectomy (effective approx. in 2 out of 3 cases but with a presumed cure rate of up to 20%), rituximab (effective in approx. 80–90% of cases), and thereafter any of the immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil). Additional therapies are intravenous immunoglobulins, danazol, plasma-exchange, and alemtuzumab and high-dose cyclophosphamide as last resort option. As the experience with rituximab evolves, it is likely that this drug will be located at an earlier point in therapy of warm AIHA, before more toxic immunosuppressants, and in place of splenectomy in some cases. In CAD, rituximab is now recommended as first-line treatment.

Discussion and conclusions

TTP is a very rare, progressive, life-threatening form of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which can be inherited or acquired. Thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, renal impairment and central nervous system involvement are the so-called TTP pentad. However, TTP can present without the full pentad, up to 35% of patients do not have neurological signs at presentation and renal abnormalities or fever are not prominent features. The diagnosis of TTP is often based on clinical and laboratory finds, especially the test of ADAMTS13 activity and ADAMTS13 antibody. With the absence of ADAMTS13, leading to the accumulation of platelet-hyperadhesive and spontaneous formation of microthrombi within the microcirculation. ADAMTS13 deficiency may be due to either recessively inherited mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene (hereditary TTP, also termed Upshaw–Schulman syndrome) or due to autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 (acquired autoimmune TTP). Certainly, the possibility of acquired autoimmune TTP cannot be completely ruled out, even if autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 are negative. Acquired TTP is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy with an incidence of approximately 2.2 cases per million per year. And, the inherited TTP represents less than 5% of all cases of TTP. In the absence of treatment, TTP is a rapidly fatal disease (mortality rate > 90%). During the past two decades, the introduction of therapeutic plasma exchange and plasma infusion has led to a decrease in the mortality rate to around 15%. The etiology of acquired TTP including HIV infection, pregnancy, autoimmune disease (SLE), organ transplantation, drugs (quinine, interferon, cyclosporine, ticlopidine and mitomycin C), malignancy and so on.

d Three patients were allocated to the incorrect risk stratum according to their risk profile presented here. Two of those cases (one Hi-W&W and one Lo-W&W) were caused by entry/capture errors for assigned risk factors in the database; and, these patients were stratified in the correct risk subset. Only one Lo-W&W patient was truly misstratified as a low-risk case, despite the fact that two risk factors had been found present by central diagnostics.

Early FCR treatment and safety

Eighty-two percent of 100 Hi-FCR patients received at least one dose of FCR, and were included in the safety analysis (safety population). Eighteen percent patients withdrew their consent for early therapy after randomization and before FCR had been initiated. The median number of administered treatment cycles was 6 (range, 1–6) and 67 patients (81.7%) completed six cycles of study therapy. The documented reasons for discontinued FCR (< 6 cycles, 15 patients, 18.3%) were hematotoxicity (6 patients, predominantly neutropenia), fever/infections (2 patients; 1 CMV reactivation, 1 infection of unknown origin), consent withdrawal or allergic exanthema (2 patients each), 1 hospitalization due to rupture of an aortic aneurysm, 1 thrombosis with consecutive pulmonary embolism, and 1 autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

### Cold hemolytic syndrome [^1165dZUR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

In most cases, immune-mediated hemolysis occurs extravascularly and is associated with IgG antibodies on the surface of red cells. Rare syndromes include IgG antibodies that cause direct intravascular hemolysis, such as paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. Also rare are extravascular hemolytic syndromes caused by IgM polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that demonstrate red cell agglutination at 3 degrees C, so-called cold antibodies. Because cold agglutinin disease has a high association with several lymphoproliferative disorders and IgM monoclonal gammopathies, its management differs significantly from that associated with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. This case-based presentation is designed to guide the reader to the diagnosis and to the initiation of prompt, effective therapy.

Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria is a rare cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia predominantly seen as an acute form in young children after viral illnesses and in a chronic form in some hematological malignancies and tertiary syphilis. It is a complement mediated intravascular hemolytic anemia associated with a biphasic antibody against the P antigen on red cells. The antibody attaches to red cells at colder temperatures and causes red cell lysis when blood recirculates to warmer parts of the body. Treatment is mainly supportive and with red cell transfusion, but immunosuppressive therapy may be effective in severe cases.

### Targeted ITP strategies: do they elucidate the biology of ITP and related disorders? [^113EqkLs]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

An elusive goal in hematology is a detailed understanding of autoimmune blood disorders including idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), and Evans Syndrome. While it is clear that these disorders have an autoimmune pathophysiology, the exact mechanisms are not clear. Agents that target the immune system specifically, such as rituximab and tacrolimus, are currently being used clinically with favorable results. Targeted therapy may be useful not only in treating these difficult diseases, but also may provide clues to the underlying disease pathophysiology. Carefully designed studies using targeted therapy may provide biologic predictors of disease severity, as well as predictors of response to therapy.

### A20 haploinsufficiency in a neonate caused by a large deletion on chromosome 6q [^111kyGm6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

At present, only 11 patients with HA20 molecularly confirmed to be caused by deletion of chromosome 6q have been reported since 2016. The initial clinical characteristics and genetic evaluation of all 12 patients are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Of all patients, eigtht were female, and five presented with de novo deletions on chromosome 6q. Nine patients experienced early-onset symptoms before the age of 1 year old; in seven patients, the initial symptoms were unprovoked and recurrent episodes of fever. Additionally, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability were reported sporadically, contributing to the complex phenotype. Intriguingly, it was assumed that the symptoms of HA20 may depend on genetic background and environmental factors; indeed, patients with A20 mutations widely distributed from the OTU to the ZnF7 domains from East Asia presented more frequently with recurrent fever. Correspondingly, to some extent, unprovoked and recurrent episodes of fever as the initial symptoms were slightly more frequently observed in these patients from East Asia harboring deletion of 6q involving the TNFAIP3 gene. More cases are warranted to consolidate this phenomenon.

### Hemolytic anemia: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^116F3Mgs]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Immune Hemolytic Anemia AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA AIHA is caused by autoantibody-mediated destruction. The hallmark of AIHA is a positive DAT result. 3 AIHA is organized into two primary subgroups based on binding temperatures, referred to as cold and warm agglutinins. Many causes of AIHA are idiopathic; however, viral and bacterial infections, autoimmune conditions, connective tissue disorder, lymphoproliferative malignancies, blood transfusions, and transplantations have been associated with AIHA. Warm AIHA is more common than cold AIHA and involves immunoglobulin G antibodies, usually to the Rh complex, that react with the RBC membrane at normal body temperatures. The IgG-coated RBCs are then removed by reticuloendothelial macrophages and sequestered in the spleen, sometimes leading to splenomegaly.

Treatment of warm AIHA typically includes the use of glucocorticoids, management of the underlying condition, blood transfusion, and supportive care. 4 Cold AIHA involves IgM antibodies that react with polysaccharide antigens on the RBC surface at low temperatures and then cause lysis on rewarming by complement fixation and intravascular hemolysis. Development of these antibodies is associated with infectious or malignant processes. Mycoplasmal pneumonia and mononucleosis are the two most common processes. Treatment of patients who have cold AIHA typically involves supportive measures, avoidance of triggers, and underlying disease management. 10 Once a presumptive diagnosis is made, treatment with plasma exchange and glucocorticoids should begin immediately. Plasma exchange removes affected platelets and autoantibodies while replenishing ADAMTS13 enzyme levels.

Although plasma exchange is superior, fresh frozen plasma infusion is beneficial and should be started if transfer to a plasma exchange–capable center is delayed.
11. Oxidative Hemolytic Anemia Oxidative hemolysis occurs when normal processes are unable to reduce ferric iron, also known as methemoglobin, to ferrous iron, which carries oxygen. This results in methemoglobinemia, leading to premature RBC destruction by phagocytosis.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemias | NEJM resident 360… [^114gtgLh]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published October 6, 2021 Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is defined as increased destruction of red cells through autoimmune mechanisms, usually mediated by autoantibodies against erythrocyte surface antigens. Read the NEJM Review Article here. A: Cold agglutinin disease is an AIHA in which the autoantibody is a cold agglutinin and no underlying clinical disorder is present. Newer studies have shown that affected patients, who previously would have received a diagnosis of primary or idiopathic cold agglutinin disease, have a clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disease that can be difficult to recognize. A: The distinction between cold agglutinin disease and secondary cold agglutinin syndrome has been increasingly accepted.

The latter is a rare, heterogeneous group of cold agglutinin–mediated AIHA disorders that are secondary to other diseases — most often, specific infections or cancers. A: In warm AIHA, antibodies have the highest affinity to the antigen at 37°C. The autoantibodies are polyclonal. They are usually of the IgG class, but IgM warm antibodies may be involved, and in rare cases, IgA warm antibodies may be involved. The pathogenesis of warm AIHA is complex. The mononuclear phagocytic system in the spleen plays a major role in the breakdown of opsonized erythrocytes. The complement system, activated by the classical pathway, is involved in approximately half the cases.

In nearly 50% of cases of warm AIHA, no underlying or associated disorder can be identified, and the hemolytic disease is classified as primary. Slightly more than 50% of the cases are secondary to immunologic or lymphoproliferative disorders. Occasionally, a lymphoproliferative disease develops several years after the diagnosis of AIHA.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia… [^111eaaZL]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia exhibits two important characteristics: shortened red blood cell survival and presence of autoantibodies directed toward autologous RBCs, usually demonstrated by a positive direct antiglobulin test. AIHA is classified by the temperature at which autoantibodies bind optimally to RBCs. In warm antibody AIHA, which constitutes about 80–90% of adult cases, hemolysis is mediated by antibodies which bind to RBCs at 37 °C isotype. In children, cold hemolysins are most common. Unusual patients with mixed AIHA exhibit both cold-reactive and warm-reactive autoantibodies. Diagnosis The signs and symptoms of AIHA are nonspecific and common to all types of anemia.

The primary symptoms include exertional dyspnea, dyspnea at rest, varying degrees of fatigue, and signs and symptoms of the hyperdynamic state, such as bounding pulses, palpitations… etc The laboratory findings of drug-induced AIHA may resemble those of warm antibody AIHA or a cryopathic hemolytic syndrome, depending on the mechanism of the autoantibody induction and the target antigen. A high index of suspicion on the part of the clinician and discussions with blood bank personnel can usually reveal the role of the drug. Serum lactate dehydrogenase study: Serum LDH elevation is a criterion for hemolysis, but is not specific Serum haptoglobin: A low serum haptoglobin level is a criterion for moderate-to-severe hemolysis. Indirect bilirubin: Unconjugated bilirubin is a criterion for hemolysis, but it is not specific, the level of indirect bilirubin usually is less than 3 mg/dL.

Direct antiglobulin test: The DAT result is usually positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but it may occasionally be negative in this disorder. DAT-negative AIHAs have been reviewed. From 5–10% of all AIHAs are DAT negative. The polybrene test can detect DAT-negative AIHA.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia with both cold and warm autoantibodies… [^115iN5hx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Of 144 patients with a positive direct antiglobulin test and having autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 12 satisfied diagnostic criteria for both warm antibody AIHA and cold agglutinin syndrome. All 12 patients had IgG and C3d sensitizing their erythrocytes, and samples of their serum contained IgM cold autohemagglutinins optimally reactive at 4 °C, but with a high thermal amplitude to 37 °C, and IgG warm autoantibodies. All red blood cell eluates contained IgG warm autoantibodies. The 12 patients had severe hemolytic anemia that responded dramatically to corticosteroid therapy, with the mean hemoglobin level increasing from 6. 3 to
12. 9 g/dL. Five patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, one patient had a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and six patients had idiopathic AIHA; four patients had concomitant thrombocytopenia. Nine patients were female.

Four patients had unexpected alloantibodies potentially capable of in vivo hemolysis of transfused blood. Because of the severe hemolysis, the serologic findings, and the dramatic initial clinical response to corticosteroid therapy, these patients represent a distinct catagory of AIHA and should be given corticosteroid therapy quickly.
