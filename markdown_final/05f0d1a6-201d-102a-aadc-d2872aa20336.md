## Question

kidney stone size

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how kidney stone size influences diagnosis, management, and outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how stone size is measured and why that matters. Then, I should verify how size thresholds guide treatment decisions for ureteral versus renal stones. Next, I will examine the evidence for spontaneous passage by size and location. After that, I need to check how size affects surgical modality selection and outcomes. Finally, I should consider special populations, residual fragments, and the role of imaging accuracy, and synthesize a practical clinical framework with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: stone size is the principal determinant of management in most algorithms, but I need to ensure we are measuring it correctly because treatment hinges on a few millimeters. Noncontrast CT is the gold standard for size and location, and linear measurements are commonly used, though volumetric or multiplanar assessments can outperform simple diameter for predicting outcomes, so I should keep that in mind when decisions are borderline [^4863ffb8] [^b63db2e4].

> Now, for ureteral stones, I should double-check the classic size thresholds. Stones ≤ 5 mm have a high likelihood of spontaneous passage, often cited around 68–98% depending on width and location, whereas stones 6–10 mm have intermediate chances and often benefit from medical expulsive therapy, and stones > 10 mm generally require intervention; wait, let me verify the exact figures. Large cohort data show 98% passage for 0–2 mm, 98% for 3 mm, 81% for 4 mm, 65% for 5 mm, 33% for 6 mm, and only 9% for ≥ 6.5 mm, reinforcing that width and location, especially distal ureter, are key predictors [^57cb67c3] [^27e08c02] [^952297e5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for renal stones, because size thresholds differ from ureteral stones. For renal calculi, most guidelines stratify decisions at < 10 mm, 10–20 mm, and > 20 mm, with > 2 cm stones favoring percutaneous nephrolithotomy as first-line due to superior stone-free rates; I should confirm that this applies broadly across guidelines. Yes, both contemporary AUA and EAU guidance align on PCNL first-line for stones > 2 cm, while 1–2 cm stones often involve shared decision-making between mini-PCNL and URS, and < 1 cm stones may be observed or treated with SWL or URS depending on location and patient factors [^49c8b1ef] [^863675c9] [^39351efa].

> I need to check the evidence for spontaneous passage of asymptomatic renal stones, because clinicians often label ≤ 5 mm stones as "insignificant". Observational data show that about 20% of ≤ 5 mm asymptomatic renal stones ultimately require surgery over roughly 3–5 years, and randomized data suggest that proactively removing small asymptomatic stones during endoscopic surgery for another stone reduces relapse by about 82%, so I should caution against overconfidence in small renal stones remaining quiescent [^1dc89fe1] [^74018a3d].

> Next, I should review how size influences surgical modality selection and expected outcomes. For ureteral stones, SWL is generally favored for smaller, more proximal stones with favorable parameters, URS offers higher stone-free rates but more invasive, and MET is reasonable for ≤ 10 mm distal stones; for renal stones, SWL is less effective as size increases, URS becomes advantageous in the 1–2 cm range, and PCNL achieves the best stone-free rates for > 2 cm stones, albeit with greater invasiveness; let me verify that these align with guideline algorithms and meta-analyses, which they do [^159e4ef5] [^49c8b1ef] [^39351efa].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has ADPKD or is pregnant; I should confirm size-based nuances in these special populations. In pediatrics, ultrasound-first is standard, and for stones > 15 mm, PCNL outperforms URS for stone-free status, while EAU allows SWL up to 20 mm in children; in ADPKD, obstructing stones are more challenging, so size thresholds guide modality, with SWL or URS preferred for < 10 mm and PCNL reserved for larger or complex stones; in pregnancy, low-dose CT can be considered when necessary, and size still guides urgency and modality selection with multidisciplinary input [^dca7d4f0] [^fc634bd1] [^96870533] [^7bb7d1e0].

> I should double-check the impact of residual fragment size after treatment, because this often determines recurrence risk. Fragments > 4 mm after SWL, URS, or PCNL are associated with a 50% greater odds of unplanned secondary procedures, and guidelines recommend considering secondary endoscopic removal of residual fragments, with post-PCNL CT helping detect underestimated fragments; this reinforces why accurate size assessment postoperatively matters for counseling and follow-up [^b8643286] [^b570767b] [^26a39702].

> Hold on, I should verify imaging accuracy and variability, because a 1–2 mm error can shift management across thresholds. CT overestimates size compared with caliper-validated standards by about 10–20% in some phantom studies, and reader variability can approach 1–2 mm, while reduced-dose CT maintains high sensitivity for clinically significant ureteral stones; thus, I need to ensure consistent measurement techniques, consider volumetrics for irregular stones, and, when decisions are borderline, reconcile with clinical context or repeat imaging [^dd5b3f7e] [^0b7d52ad] [^0f03c397].

> Let me synthesize a practical framework, but I should confirm it aligns with guidelines. For ureteral stones, use ≤ 5 mm, 6–10 mm, and > 10 mm to triage observation with MET, MET with close follow-up, or intervention, respectively, integrating width, location, and patient factors; for renal stones, use < 10 mm, 10–20 mm, and > 20 mm to guide SWL/URS versus mini-PCNL versus standard PCNL, with shared decision-making for 1–2 cm stones; for asymptomatic renal stones, avoid assuming insignificance when ≤ 5 mm, and discuss surveillance versus proactive removal in shared decision-making, especially if multiple or metabolically active [^159e4ef5] [^49c8b1ef] [^74018a3d].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats so we do not overgeneralize. Stone composition, location, skin-to-stone distance, infundibular anatomy, and patient comorbidities can override size thresholds, and emerging technologies like suction URS, mini-PCNL variants, and ultrasonic propulsion may shift size-based algorithms; therefore, I need to ensure decisions remain individualized and evidence-updated, and I should communicate uncertainty transparently with patients during shared decision-making [^159e4ef5] [^9ce85d1f] [^4f1ba294].

Kidney stone size is the **most critical factor** in determining management: stones ≤ 5 mm have a **high likelihood of spontaneous passage** [^57cb67c3] and are typically managed conservatively with hydration and analgesia [^cdf5d7ff], whereas stones 6–10 mm may require medical expulsive therapy and closer follow-up [^2c8490a1]. Stones > 10 mm or > 2 cm in the kidney [^863675c9] generally warrant surgical intervention (URS, SWL, or PCNL) [^49c8b1ef] due to low passage rates and higher risk of complications [^notfound]. Size also guides imaging choice: ultrasound is preferred for initial assessment and follow-up, while non-contrast CT is the gold standard for precise sizing and treatment planning [^6a14fa8d] [^4863ffb8]. Accurate size measurement is essential because even small errors can alter management and outcomes [^c32bf3c9].

## Classification of kidney stones by size

Kidney stones are commonly classified by **maximum diameter** [^6a14fa8d]:

| **Size category** | **Diameter** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Small | ≤ 5 mm | High likelihood of spontaneous passage [^57cb67c3] |
| Medium | 6–10 mm | Moderate likelihood of spontaneous passage; may require medical expulsive therapy [^2c8490a1] |
| Large | > 10 mm | Low likelihood of spontaneous passage; surgical intervention often required [^cdf5d7ff] |
| Very large | > 2 cm (20 mm) | Typically requires surgical intervention (PCNL) [^863675c9] |

---

## Clinical implications of stone size

### Spontaneous passage

- **Stones ≤ 5 mm**: 68–98% likelihood of spontaneous passage within 4–6 weeks [^57cb67c3]; conservative management is standard [^cdf5d7ff].
- **Stones 6–10 mm**: 47–65% likelihood of spontaneous passage; medical expulsive therapy (alpha-blockers) may be considered [^2c8490a1].
- **Stones > 10 mm**: < 10% likelihood of spontaneous passage; surgical intervention is typically recommended [^cdf5d7ff].

---

### Surgical intervention

- **Stones > 10 mm**: Ureteroscopy (URS), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are considered based on stone location, composition, and patient factors [^159e4ef5].
- **Stones > 2 cm**: PCNL is the preferred first-line therapy due to higher stone-free rates and lower retreatment rates [^49c8b1ef] [^863675c9].
- **Residual fragments**: Fragments > 4 mm after treatment are associated with higher rates of secondary procedures and should be managed actively [^b8643286].

---

## Imaging modalities for measuring kidney stone size

Accurate size assessment is critical for management; **imaging modality selection** depends on clinical context:

| **Imaging modality** | **Accuracy** | **Radiation exposure** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast CT | High (gold standard) | Moderate | Preferred for acute presentation, precise sizing, and treatment planning [^4863ffb8] |
| Ultrasound | Moderate | None | Preferred for initial assessment, follow-up, and radiation-sensitive populations (pregnant, pediatric) [^6a14fa8d] [^83776228] |
| Plain radiography (KUB) | Low | Low | Useful for tracking radiopaque stones; limited by obesity and bowel gas [^f5601bb6] |

---

## Factors influencing stone size assessment

Several factors can **affect accuracy** of stone size measurement:

- **Imaging modality**: CT provides the most accurate sizing; ultrasound may underestimate size, especially for small or non-obstructing stones [^4863ffb8] [^61ffdd75].
- **Reader variability**: Inter-observer differences can lead to discrepancies in size estimation, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols [^0b7d52ad] [^c32bf3c9].
- **Stone composition**: Uric acid stones may be radiolucent and difficult to visualize on plain radiography, complicating size assessment [^8329fd83].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with stone size

Stone size significantly **impacts clinical outcomes**:

- **Spontaneous passage**: Inversely correlated with size; smaller stones pass more readily [^57cb67c3].
- **Surgical intervention**: Larger stones require more invasive procedures and have higher complication rates [^notfound].
- **Recurrence**: Larger stone burden is associated with higher recurrence rates and may necessitate more aggressive preventive strategies [^8719bfaf].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Ultrasound is preferred for initial assessment; size thresholds for intervention are similar to adults, but techniques may differ [^83776228] [^dca7d4f0].
- **Pregnancy**: Ultrasound is first-line; low-dose CT may be considered if ultrasound is inconclusive and the clinical situation demands it [^7bb7d1e0].
- **Multiple stones**: Aggregate stone burden influences management decisions, with larger cumulative size favoring surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

Kidney stone size is the **primary determinant of management strategy**, influencing the likelihood of spontaneous passage, the need for surgical intervention, and the choice of imaging modality. Accurate size assessment is essential for optimal clinical outcomes and requires careful consideration of patient-specific factors and available resources.

### Leave no stone unturned: defining recurrence in kidney stone formers [^8719bfaf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Established guidelines provide recommendations on the management of kidney stones to prevent recurrence. However, clear and clinically useful terminology for recurrence of kidney stones is needed. This review describes the various manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and the reported rates of kidney stone recurrence in various clinical settings.

Recent Findings

Kidney stone recurrence has a wide range of symptomatic and radiographic presentations. Symptomatic recurrence may include characteristic symptoms of stone passage via the ureter (renal colic and gross hematuria). This may be self-managed or result in clinical care, with or without confirmation of an obstructing stone on imaging. Radiographic recurrence has been variably defined as new stone formation, stone growth, or stone disappearance (from passage with or without symptoms). Studies have used inconsistent definitions of recurrence, and recurrence rates vary substantially. Stone free rates and residual stone fragment size after surgical interventions are useful predictors of symptomatic recurrence.

Summary

The recurrence rate of kidney stones has been assessed in stone formers from sub-specialty clinics, the general community, and clinical trials. The definition of recurrence is quite heterogenous between studies, but the rate of recurrence generally increases as more manifestations are included in the definition.

### Do kidney stone formers have a kidney disease? [^60651ad6]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a highly prevalent disorder affecting approximately one in eleven people and is associated with multiple complications including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Significant epidemiologic associations with chronic kidney disease and ESRD have been noted and are reviewed herein, but debate persists in the literature as to whether kidney stone formation is a pathogenic process contributing to kidney disease. Corroborating evidence supporting the presence of kidney disease in stone formers includes the variability of renal function by stone type, the positive association of stone size with renal dysfunction, the presence of markers of renal injury in the urine of even asymptomatic stone formers, and direct evidence of renal tissue injury on histopathology. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms include recurrent obstruction and comorbid conditions such as recurrent urinary tract infections and structural abnormalities. Recent work evaluating the renal histopathology of different groups of stone formers adds further granularity, suggesting variability in mechanisms of renal injury by stone type and confirming the pathogenic effects of crystal formation. Genetic abnormalities leading to stone formation including cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria, among others, contribute to the burden of disease in the stone-forming population.

### Do organic substances act as a degradable binding matrix in calcium oxalate kidney stones? [^3cb90faa]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

We emphasize here that the findings from this systematic survey do not rule out the possibility (1) that some agents, such as potassium citrate or EDTA, may have a softening or slow dissolution effect on existing CaOx kidney stones, over longer time periods, and/or (2) that some of these agents, as well as others, may be beneficial in inhibiting or preventing formation of entirely new stones. [We note parenthetically, too, but in a different context, that natural, in vivo dissolution may occur over thin, nanometer layers of CaOx stones, with estimated time scales of hours.]

A unique feature of this study—systematic analysis of the effects of a wide range of potential dissolution agents on actual CaOx kidney stones—has an inherent limitation, namely, the lack of uniform stone size, structure, and composition among real stone samples even from the same patient. On the other hand, synthetically-grown kidney stones are relatively homogeneous, and in particular do not contain the potentially critical impurities, including organic matter, present in real stones. To reduce the uncertainty and variability in our survey, stone fragments from the same patient were tested where possible, in parallel. We also mediated the size differences by keeping a constant ratio of solution to stone mass. We emphasize, too, that stone fragments were employed, so that possible dissolution—a surface phenomenon—was maximized by solution exposure to both internal and external portions of each stone. In spite of the inherent variability in surface area, and use of replicates, similar behavior (essentially no dissolution or disintegration) was found among treatments.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^4e9f1c9c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study challenges the assumption that the stone size alone should determine the priority of follow-up for kidney stones. Indeed, we observed no significant difference in the size of kidney stones that passed spontaneously between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This implies that stone size might not be the sole determining factor for symptoms or the necessity of interventions. Instead, it is crucial to consider other factors such as stone composition, location, and individual patient characteristics when determining follow-up strategies. Larger stones may generally carry a higher risk of complications and warrant closer monitoring or intervention. However, smaller stones, particularly when multiple, should not be overlooked as they can also pose a risk for symptoms or potential progression. Asymptomatic ureteral stones may lead to permanent kidney impairment, especially when larger stones are not passing spontaneously, as their presentation is often delayed.Although the spontaneously passed stones in this study were small, the absence of symptoms might justify closer imaging surveillance for patients prone to difficulties in passing future ureteral stones. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of various factors is necessary to guide follow-up approaches in patients with kidney stones.

D'Costa et al. evaluated first-time symptomatic stone formers clinically and radiologically during a follow-up of at least 5 yearsand reported a combined symptomatic and asymptomatic/radiographic 5-year recurrence rate of 67%. In addition, they found that 51% of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones had spontaneous stone passage (range, 2–9 mm) at 5 years, with half of these events being asymptomatic. In contrast to their findings, the annual recurrence rate in the NOSTONE trial was considerably higher, with a 3-year recurrence rate of 59%.Moreover, 55% of the patients presented with spontaneous stone passage within 3 years in the NOSTONE trial, and 42% of them were asymptomatic. This higher rate of recurrence and spontaneous passage is explained by the fact that the patients selected in the NOSTONE trial were known to have recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones.

### Determining the true burden of kidney stone disease [^9ad805f6]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2020). High credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of kidney stones have increased over the past four decades. However, the diagnosis of 'kidney stone' can range from an incidental asymptomatic finding of limited clinical significance to multiple painful episodes of ureteral obstruction with eventual kidney failure. Some general strategies may be useful to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. In particular, greater attention to kidney stone classification, approaches to assessing the risk of recurrence and individualized prevention strategies may improve the clinical care of stone formers. Although there have been some advances in approaches to predicting the recurrence of kidney stones, notable challenges remain. Studies of kidney stone prevalence, incidence and recurrence have reported inconsistent findings, in part because of the lack of a standardized stone classification system. A kidney stone classification system based on practical and clinically useful measures of stone disease may help to improve both the study and clinical care of stone formers. Any future kidney stone classification system should be aimed at distinguishing asymptomatic from symptomatic stones, clinically diagnosed symptomatic stone episodes from self-reported symptomatic stone episodes, symptomatic stone episodes that are confirmed from those that are suspected, symptomatic recurrence from radiographic recurrence (that is, with radiographic evidence of a new stone, stone growth or stone disappearance from presumed passage) and determine stone composition based on mutually exclusive categories.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^39351efa]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney stones 1 to 2 cm in adults—clinicians may offer mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) when available, over ureteroscopy (URS) because of higher stone-free rates (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In a meta-analysis performed for this Guideline, mini-PCNL was demonstrated to have a higher stone-free rate compared to URS for the treatment of 1 to 2 cm kidney stones; however, the data are less clear with regard to differences in complication rates or hospital stay. Clinicians should discuss with the patient the advantages and disadvantages of mini-PCNL, including the expected operative time. Of note, emerging data with newly developed suction devices for URS show noninferiority with regard to stone-free rates with suction-assisted URS compared to mini-PCNL, but there are currently insufficient high-quality studies comparing these modalities to make a definitive statement regarding efficacy. This Guideline is not meant to imply that standard PCNL cannot be used for the treatment of stones in this size range, particularly when mini-PCNL setups are unavailable.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^2dc7d660]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location and size, and the patient’s comorbidities and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations. Several institutions around the world have issued guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the evidence available and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insight.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analysed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis worldwide, and gives novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

### Reducing shock number dramatically decreases lesion size in a juvenile kidney model [^1d6e3980]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Adult stone patients are treated with several thousand lithotripter shockwaves (SWs) in order to pulverize a kidney stone. This typical clinical dose assures that the stone will be fractured completely. However, this same dose induces damage to the kidney, especially pediatric-size kidneys. If increasing SW number is known to increase renal injury and functional impairment, will reducing SW number below typical treatment levels significantly decrease kidney damage and hemodynamic changes?

Materials and Methods

To address this question, one kidney in each of nine juvenile pigs (6-7 weeks old) was treated with 1000 SWs at 24 kV directed at a lower-pole calix with an unmodified HM-3 lithotripter. Parenchymal-lesion size was determined by sectioning the entire kidney and quantitating the amount of hemorrhage in each slice. Renal function was determined before and after SW treatment by inulin clearance, paraaminohippurate (PAH) extraction, and PAH clearance. The resulting morphologic and functional changes were then compared with those of kidneys that had been treated with a typical clinical dose of 2000 SWs (data previously published; J Am Soc Nephrol 2000;11:310). Eleven pigs were utilized as sham-treated controls.

Results

Limiting SW number to 1000 significantly reduced the size of the lesion (by 95%) and reduced the degree of functional change (glomerular filtration rate by 38%, PAH extraction by 73%, renal plasma flow by 46%) compared with kidneys receiving 2000 SWs (an adult dose).

Conclusions

These data support the idea that SW number should be reduced to the lowest number that fractures kidney stones in order to minimize renal injury and functional impairment.

### Citrate salts for preventing and treating calcium-containing kidney (...) [^398c1c00]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do citrate salts treat and prevent calcium-containing kidney stones in adults. Evidence-Based Answer Citrate supplementation reduces stone size to less than 5 mm and prevents new stone formation when compared with placebo or no intervention. Citrate therapy also stabilizes existing stones and decreases the need for retreatment. These benefits come at the expense of upper gastrointestinal disturbances that lead to a higher dropout rate.
1. Practice Pointers In the United States, the prevalence of symptomatic kidney stones is
8. 8% in the general population, and is higher in men and obese individuals. This Cochrane review included seven randomized controlled trials with a total of 477 participants.

1 Three studies compared potassium citrate supplementation with placebo or no intervention, and three studies compared potassium-sodium citrate with no intervention. One study compared potassium-magnesium citrate with placebo. Primary outcomes included radiographic evidence of reduced stone size to less than 5 mm, lack of new stone formation, or stone size stability over six months, one year, or two years. Secondary outcomes were the need for retreatment, adverse events, and dropout rates. Dosages of citrate therapy ranged from 30 to 60 mEq per day. Citrate therapy increased the likelihood of stone size reduction to less than 5 mm. The incidence of new stone formation over a period of 12 to 48 months was also significantly reduced. Citrate therapy prevented growth of existing stones. Only two studies reported the need for retreatment as an outcome; in these, citrate therapy significantly decreased the need for retreatment vs. control over a follow-up period of three to four years. In absolute terms, the need for retreatment was 3. 6% vs.
41. 4% in the first study.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^b570767b]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA guideline—management of residual stones after surgery for kidney and/or ureteral stones advises that clinicians should offer secondary endoscopic removal of residual fragments and engage in shared decision-making, taking into account the benefits and risks (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C); the decision between observation and active intervention depends on balancing the risks of an additional procedure against benefits such as preventing pain, obstruction, infection, or continued stone growth, and the risk of requiring intervention is greater for larger versus smaller residual fragments.

### Nephrolithiasis [^ead131f0]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide, and decreasing stone growth and recurrence is critical to reducing morbidity. Preventative approaches vary with kidney stone type, so knowledge of stone composition and a thorough history and metabolic evaluation are necessary to individualize therapy. The cases presented herein highlight treatment strategies for the most common stone types seen in clinical practice with practical pearls for the nephrologist.

### Crystallite size – is it a new predictor for renal stone burden? [^60c06056]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the importance of stone composition and crystallite size in the formation of ultimate stone burden. Crystallite is the smallest building block, which is unique in size and architecture for each type of stone component. Currently, the knowledge about the clinical importance of crystallite size is very limited.

Methods

The results of quantitative X-ray diffraction phase analysis performed on 286 kidney stones extracted during endourological surgery or expelled spontaneously were retrospectively analyzed. Stone composition and crystallite size were determined and were compared to the burden occupying the pelvicalyceal system.

Results

A total of 286 renal stones were analyzed. Stones were low burden and high burden in 242 and 44 of cases, respectively. We observed statistically significant association of phosphates and urates with high-burden stones in contrast to oxalates, which formed mainly low-burden stones. Crystallite sizes were available for 179 stones. Large-sized crystallites of calcium oxalate monohydrate and hydroxyl apatite formed low-burden stones, whereas small-sized crystallites formed staghorn stones. Struvite and urates had a uniform average size of crystallites.

Conclusion

Oxalate stones have statistically significant association with smaller stones, whereas high-burden calculi are significantly associated with urates and phosphates, especially the struvite type. The smaller the crystallite size is to start with, the larger will be the ultimate stone burden. This rule is followed by calcium oxalate monohydrate and Apatite minerals.

### Kidney stones: pathophysiology and medical management [^8a9dbb1c]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The formation of stones in the urinary tract stems from a wide range of underlying disorders. That clinicians look for the underlying causes for nephrolithiasis is imperative to direct management. There are many advances in genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic imaging, medical treatment, medical prevention, and surgical intervention of nephrolithiasis. Here, I provide a brief general background and focus mainly on pathophysiology and medical treatment of kidney stones. Although important advances have been made in understanding nephrolithiasis from single gene defects, the understanding of polygenetic causes of kidney stones is still largely elusive. A substantial proportion of data that resulted in new methods of treatment and prevention, which can be empirical or definitive, has focused on urinary luminal chemical composition of the precipitating solutes. Manipulation of inhibitors and epithelial factors is important and needs further investigation. Advances in the management of nephrolithiasis depend on combined efforts of clinicians and scientists to understand the pathophysiology.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^159e4ef5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of kidney stones treatment algorithm—Treatment options vary by shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) parameter favorability and stone size. Where “Favorable SWL parameters?” applies, the pathway lists “SWL, URS, PCNL (consider mPCNL),” whereas “Non-favorable SWL parameters” lead to “URS, PCNL (consider mPCNL).” For larger stones, “PCNL (for 2-3 cm stones, consider mPCNL)” is specified. The figure notes that “Favorable parameters include Hounsfield units <1000 and skin-to-stone distance <10 cm,” and also states that the ureteral-stone algorithm is not provided due to reporting heterogeneity. Abbreviations are defined as mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mPCNL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), and ureteroscopy (URS).

### Measuring kidney stone volume-practical considerations and current evidence from the EAU endourology section [^b63db2e4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This narrative review provides an overview of the use, differences, and clinical impact of current methods for kidney stone volume assessment.

Recent Findings

The different approaches to volume measurement are based on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT). While volume measurement using formulas is sufficient for smaller stones, it tends to overestimate volume for larger or irregularly shaped calculi. In contrast, software-based segmentation significantly improves accuracy and reproducibility, and artificial intelligence based volumetry additionally shows excellent agreement with reference standards while reducing observer variability and measurement time. Moreover, specific CT preparation protocols may further enhance image quality and thus improve measurement accuracy. Clinically, stone volume has proven to be a superior predictor of stone-related events during follow-up, spontaneous stone passage under conservative management, and stone-free rates after shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS) compared to linear measurements.

Summary

Although manual measurement remains practical, its accuracy diminishes for complex or larger stones. Software-based segmentation and volumetry offer higher precision and efficiency but require established standards and broader access to dedicated software for routine clinical use.

### Size matters: the width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^27e08c02]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Urolithiasis is a common cause of acute flank pain with increasing prevalence and increasing costs for health systems. According to earlier studies 75–90% of stones in the ureter pass spontaneously. If the stone can be expected to pass spontaneously within a reasonable time and the pain is tolerable, the first approach is watchful waiting, with or without accompanying medical expulsive therapy (MET). Stones that are not expected to pass are treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), laser lithotripsy or percutaneous stone extraction via the renal pelvis. There are risks with both the conservative and the invasive approaches, such as sepsis that can occur either because of an obstructing stone or as a post-procedure complication. The main risk of the conservative approach is failure and that the patient has had to endure symptoms to no benefit. The major risk of intervention is that it was unnecessary, exposing the patient to the potential risks of, for example, anaesthesia, upper urinary tract infections and ureteral injury. Thus prediction of the chance for a stone to pass spontaneously is crucial for the appropriate selection of a treatment strategy.

It is widely agreed that there is a strong correlation between stone size and location and the likelihood for spontaneous stone passage. More recent studies have suggested other predictive factors, e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP), hydronephrosis and side of the stone.

There is, however, still no standardized method of stone size measurement, with the most widely used method for diagnosing ureteral stones being non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NECT). The uncertainty of stone size measurements includes whether the length or width of the ureteral stone predicts the probability for spontaneous passage. A recent study revealed that 2D measurements underestimate the stone size compared to 3D measurements. Due to the non-standardization of stone size measurement, the meta-analysis published in the 2007 Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) have large intervals – 68% of stones <5 mm and 47% of stones >5 mm pass spontaneously. Consequently the guidelines state that watchful waiting is an optional initial approach for ureteral stones <10 mm. These recommendations were not changed in the most recent guidelines from EAU.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine how to most accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone using the information available in the diagnostic NECT, including reformats in the three most commonly used image planes with clearly defined measurements and to create predictive models for spontaneous stone passage.

### Is measurement of stone surface area necessary for SWL treatment of nonstaghorn calculi? [^ded612e8]. Journal of Endourology (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The size of urinary tract stones is usually assessed by the longest diameter (LD) alone. Logically, however, two-dimensional measurement of the stone surface area (SSA) susceptible to shockwaves would give more useful information for the planning of treatment by extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). This has been shown for staghorn calculi. The aim of this study was to determine for nonstaghorn kidney and ureter stones whether the LD alone identifies as reliably a subgroup of patients with a stone of a certain size as does the SSA. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether the LD alone indicates as reliably the number of patients who would be rendered stone free after one SWL session within a certain subgroup as would the SSA.

Patients and Methods

Retrospectively, SWL treatment and radiographic data of 330 patients who had undergone SWL for a single stone were analyzed.

Results

Ureteral stones were significantly smaller on average, and ureteral stone patients needed fewer SWL treatment sessions and fewer shockwaves to become stone free. Stratification of both kidney and ureteral stones by either LD or SSA resulted in comparable groups of patients. There were no significant differences in patient, stone, or treatment data. More importantly, the stone-free rates after one treatment did not differ significantly.

Conclusion

The LD does accurately reflect the size of a nonstaghorn kidney or ureteral stones. Therefore, the measurement of LD, as generally practiced, appears clinically sufficient and appropriate for the assessment of stone size prior to SWL in both kidney and ureteral stones.

### Determining a performance envelope for capture of kidney stones functionalized with superparamagnetic microparticles [^5df43940]. Journal of Endourology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Complete stone removal is important in upper tract stone surgery. Unfortunately, even with the latest technologic advances, current methods only achieve 50% to 80% complete clearance of upper tract stones at the time of primary treatment. Our group has explored the novel use of peptide-coated iron oxide superparamagnetic microparticles that bind to calcium stones, allowing for extraction of these stones with magnetic tools. We present analytic and numeric models that characterize stone attraction performance for feasible magnetic tool sizes and stone magnetization levels.

Materials and Methods

Magnetostatics equations are applied to a simplified, one-dimensional scenario of a spherical target coated with a variable amount of superparamagnetic particles, placed under the influence of a magnetic field aimed at vertical attraction (capture) of the target. Equations are parameterized in terms of (a) target size, ranging from 0.5 mm to 3 mm to represent stone sizes of interest, (b) effective magnetization per surface area delivered by the particle binding chemistry, and (c) distance to the field source.

Results

Target capture is predicted to be effective in the low, single-digit millimeter distance range, favoring smaller stones and then up to a practical upper limit of 3 mm diameter. Higher iron loading chemistries have a direct improvement in magnetic force and therefore increase the viability of the technique, albeit along an asymptotic trendline.

Conclusions

We are able to characterize the potential for kidney stone capture via magnetic attraction. Computer-developed models show good correlation with experimental results using actual magnetized stone samples. Future research efforts can use the proposed techniques to estimate the performance impact of advanced magnetic tools and surface chemistries.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^06b809d0]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

This retrospective study was classified as non-human research by the local institutional review board. Kidney stones are routinely collected from surgical treatment procedures and chemical stone composition is routinely analyzed at the local laboratory using infrared spectroscopy. The reference standard of the stone size for subsequent analyses was obtained using a mean out of two measurements of the long-axis diameter with a vernier caliper (Man-M). For this study, 96 stones with a minimum long-axis diameter of 3 mm were initially included, of which 4 stones fractured during handling and were therefore excluded from the final analysis. Hence, this study comprised 92 kidney stones representing the clinically encountered variability: brushite (n = 11), cystine (n = 10), dahllite (n = 11), struvite (n = 7), uric acid (n = 12), weddellite (n = 12), whewellite (n = 20), and xanthine stones (n = 9) (Table 1).

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^238ff183]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to renal stone size, thresholds of < 10 mm, 10–20 mm and > 20 mm are used in the EAU, DGU and SAU guidelines, whilst the AUA guidelines differentiate between lower pole calculi > 10 mm and ≤ 10 mm, and non-lower pole stones > 20 mm and ≤ 20 mm. The SUA guidelines provide recommendations for lower pole calculi regardless of size, and the AFU guidelines differentiate between > 20 mm and < 20 mm for all renal stones.

Figure 1 shows the consensus decision tree resulting from semi-automatic comparison of all decision trees. SWL and URS were the most commonly recommended procedures for all stone sizes and locations. Moreover, PNL is mentioned as a treatment option for all renal calculi by all guidelines except for the AUA and SUA guidelines, which do not recommend it for the treatment of smaller non-lower pole renal calculi.

Fig. 1 
Consensus tree listing decision criteria and recommended treatments of all guidelines. (Note that URS for proximal ureteral calculi > 10 mm involves ante- and retrograde approach in the EAU-Guidelines)

Comparative analysis assessing the most often recommended combination of procedures revealed an agreement ranging from 50 to 83% for different stone sizes and locations (Fig. 2). A high degree of consensus was found in particular for lower pole renal stones below 20 mm (83% of the guidelines recommend ‘SWL or URS or PNL’) and distal ureteral stones (83% of the guidelines recommend ‘SWL or URS’).

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^49c8b1ef]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Kidney stones >2 cm in adults—clinicians should recommend percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) as first-line therapy (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). PCNL has been shown to have a higher stone-free rate and lower rates of retreatment in patients with large (>2 cm) stones compared to shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS), and in particular, PCNL should constitute the first-line treatment for large, branched stones. Meta-analyses performed for this Guideline revealed higher stone-free rates for PCNL versus SWL, and for PCNL versus URS. Shared decision-making discussions may reveal that a patient prefers URS to the more invasive PCNL procedure, and these discussions should include the likelihood of needing multiple procedures if URS is selected instead of PCNL.

Cross-sectional imaging to guide treatment selection—adult patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones: clinicians may obtain cross-sectional imaging to guide surgical treatment selection (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Non-contrast abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) is the most reliable imaging modality for evaluating stone size and volume, location, number, and density and also allows assessment of anatomic variations, relational anatomy of the kidney, intrarenal geometry including infundibular angle, hydronephrosis, the presence of distal obstruction, and patient factors such as body habitus and stone-to-skin distance that may affect procedural choice and outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) may provide some relational and intrarenal anatomic detail that can guide treatment selection; however, neither MR nor US reliably measures stone density and MR does not reliably visualize upper urinary tract stones.

### Stone burden in an average Swedish population of stone formers requiring active stone removal: how can the stone size be estimated in the clinical routine? [^37da9d96]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To get information on the distribution of stone burdens in an average and representative group of Swedish stone forming patients requiring active removal of stones from the kidneys or ureters and to compare different methods for assessing the stone burden.

Methods

A computerised device was used to measure the total stone surface area (A(measured)) of 599 stone situations in kidneys and ureters in a consecutive group of patients referred to active stone removal. These measurements were compared with the large and short transverse diameters of the greatest stone, the sum of the largest diameters of the stones, the arithmetically calculated surface area (A(calculated)) as well as with the stone-types (A-F) previously described.

Result

There were 483 stone situations with one and 116 with more than one stone. The stones were found in 407 men and 192 women. In 343 cases were the stones on the left side and in 256 on the right side. There were 34 staghorn stones. Of the examined stone situations 250 were in the kidney and 349 in the ureter. An A(measured) above 300 mm(2) was recorded in 7% of all stone situations. The corresponding numbers for A(measured) above 200 mm(2), 500 mm(2) and 700 mm(2) were 13%, 4% and 3%, respectively. When staghorn stones were excluded, good correlations were recorded for all variables but the best correlation was found between A(measured) and A(calculated). A revision of the previously published stone-type subgroups is suggested based on the following limits for the stone surface area: A < or = 30 mm(2), B = 31-300 mm(2), C = 301-700 mm(2) and D > 700 mm(2).

Conclusion

The distribution of stone situations with different stone burden in an average Swedish population is described. With the exception of staghorn stones and stones with extremely irregular form an acceptable estimate of the stone surface are can be arithmetically derived from the length and the width of the stone.

### Treatment of pediatric stone disease driven by age and stone size (...) [^fc634bd1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Ellison et al1 conducted a multi-institutional prospective cohort study involving 1039 children and adolescents with kidney stones treated by either percutaneous nephrolithotomy or ureteroscopy. The results of the study were both statistically significant and surprising; for those stones larger than 15 mm, PCNL cleared 94. 0% whereas ureteroscopy was inferior, clearing only
55. 0%. 1 In addition, and unforeseen, were the quality of life findings; treatment with PCNL was associated with significantly less pain intensity, pain interference, anxiety, and urinary symptoms. It is important to note that the median age in this cohort was that of an adolescent, with a body habitus and physiology approaching adulthood.

The reader must also understand that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is an additional treatment modality used to treat pediatric nephrolithiasis, and at present high-powered holmium lasers and thulium technology have changed the efficiency at which stone-free rates are achieved with ureteroscopy. It is thought that the compliance of the pediatric collecting system imparts a better chance of clearing larger amounts of stone burden after ESWL when compared with the adult ureters challenged with similar stone burdens. 4 Infants and toddlers have this additional treatment option available for their kidney stones that can also be vertically integrated with other treatments in complex scenarios.
5. The median age of the cohort was
15. 6 years. Their observed stone-free rate with Ho: YAG lasers was 59% compared to 70% with the SPTF. Furthermore, SPTF was associated with 61% lower odds of having a residual stone after ureteroscopy.

7 As the laser-based technologies change, so will stone-free rates. The PKIDS Care Improvement Network should be acknowledged for their strong work examining best treatment practice while using validated measures under strict criteria. Based on this study, it is difficult to not favor PCNL over ureteroscopy when treating a teenager with a 1. 5-cm kidney stone. An infant or toddler with the same size stone has the additional option of treatment with ESWL. It is comforting to know that we will continue to receive updates from this collaborative, guiding our treatments based on prospective data of surgical interventions in children and adolescents with kidney stones.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^13b7225a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thus, kidney stones not only cause pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous health care costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and are not noticed by the patient. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with recurrent calcium-containing stones. We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones.According to previously published data, approximately half of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones will have symptoms during the first stone passage, regardless of the size of the stone.However, the number of stones that never passed, and thus did not cause any symptoms, was unknown in this analysis. By contrast, our study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones in recurrent calcium-containing stone formers by using CT imaging at baseline and at the end of follow-up. Thus, we were able to obtain an accurate evaluation of the natural history of all (presumably calcium-containing) kidney stones, including those resulting from asymptomatic stone passage.

Uric acid: Unless combined with calcium stones, uric acid stones are radiographically transparent. Causes include gout, myeloproliferative disorders, and tumor lysis syndrome that results in hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. Struvite: The characteristic appearance of a “staghorn” calculi is caused by struvite stones, which are associated with significant morbidity and symptoms including bleeding, obstruction, and infection. Cystine: Cystine stones are found in children with cystinuria, and the stones are moderately radio-opaque. Imaging: CT is still considered by many as the best imaging modality for both evaluating the presence, size, and location of stones, and the surrounding anatomy. Its use is debatable for monitoring and follow up of chronic or recurrent stones, given the high exposure to radiation. Intravenous urography was the gold standard but has since been superseded by CT scans.

Shock wave lithotripsy directs a shock wave onto the stone, causing it to fragment. This technique is generally used for smaller stones. Ureteroscopy is an endoscopic method used to visualize the renal and ureteric tract and allows instruments to fragment or remove stones. This technique is generally used for smaller stones. Stone-free rates are higher than shock wave lithotripsy but ureteroscopy is associated with a higher complication rate, including sepsis and ureteral injury. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy involves the creation of an access tract into the renal collecting system, that allows for nephroscopy and subsequent fragmentation and removal of stones using laser or lithotrite. This technique is generally used for larger stones, complex stones, or when shock wave lithotripsy fails.

Among patients with recurrent kidney stones, the incidence of recurrence did not appear to differ substantially among patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once daily at a dose of 12. 5 mg, 25 mg, or 50 mg or placebo once daily. Sorensen MD et al. N Engl J Med 2022. The removal of small, asymptomatic kidney stones during surgery to remove ureteral or contralateral kidney stones resulted in a lower incidence of relapse than nonremoval and in a similar number of emergency department visits related to the surgery.

### Size matters: the width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^952297e5]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Predictive logistic regression models

After the stepwise backwards exclusion of the non-significant independent predictor variables predictive univariate logistic regression models were created for the subgroups upper and lower ureteral stones with the predictor variables stone width and length separately for the bone window and for the soft tissue window. Neither stone side nor hydronephrosis were included in the predictive logistic regression models, due to the low number of stones in each subgroup and consequently broad CIs they would cause and because they were not significant predictors in all parts of the ureter. Furthermore, earlier studies on hydronephrosis and side regarding stone passage have shown divergent results.

As seen in Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6, there is a steep middle part of the logistic regression model curves, especially for the upper stones, making the estimated probability for passage range from about 80% in a 4-mm wide stone, to about 10% in a 6-mm wide stone in the long-term follow-up bone window.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^7d394ec1]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Second, the presence of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage was only extrapolated from the number of visible kidney stones on CT images and patient reports in the absence of an objective confirmation of lithiasis. Moreover, accurately estimating asymptomatic stones, particularly following procedures like extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, poses inherent challenges because of the presence of small stone fragments. According to a study by Sivaguru et al. there is a possibility of kidney stones dissolution in vivo.In this context, it is possible that some kidney stones claimed to be expelled spontaneously without symptoms were dissolved. This could be associated with an overestimation of the number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages, although this scenario is very rare and is mostly attributed to uric acid stones. However, in our study, all patients had recurrent calcium-containing stone formers, which renders such an event extremely unlikely.

Third, the parent trial had an underrepresentation of women, and most of the patients were White. Nonetheless, considering that White men have by far the highest kidney stone prevalence,the trial provides information about the typical target population.

Fourth, we recognize a potential concern regarding the number of inputs of independent variables in the linear regression analysis (Tables 3 and 4), and we attribute this limitation to the influence of sample size.

Finally, the median duration of our trial was approximately 3 years. As kidney stones can recur lifelong, we do not have data about the behavior of asymptomatic kidney stones in the long term. However, there is a lack of well-designed, prospective, CT-controlled studies on this topic. An analysis after a longer follow-up of our NOSTONE trial is intended, but it will take a few more years.

A high number of patients (55%) with recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones had experienced a stone event within 3 years of follow-up, and a relevant part (42%) of the spontaneous stone passages were asymptomatic. The total number of stones at randomization was associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages. Our results should encourage urologists to counsel patients regarding the possibility of an active surveillance strategy when smaller kidney stones are present.

### Ultrasonic propulsion of kidney stones [^4f1ba294]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ultrasonic propulsion is a novel technique that uses short bursts of focused ultrasonic pulses to reposition stones transcutaneously within the renal collecting system and ureter. The purpose of this review is to discuss the initial testing of effectiveness and safety, directions for refinement of technique and technology, and opinions on clinical application.

Recent Findings

Preclinical studies with a range of probes, interfaces, and outputs have demonstrated feasibility and consistent safety of ultrasonic propulsion with room for increased outputs and refinement toward specific applications. Ultrasonic propulsion was used painlessly and without adverse events to reposition stones in 14 of 15 human study participants without restrictions on patient size, stone size, or stone location. The initial feasibility study showed applicability in a range of clinically relevant situations, including facilitating passage of residual fragments following ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy, moving a large stone at the ureteropelvic junction with relief of pain, and differentiating large stones from a collection of small fragments.

Summary

Ultrasonic propulsion shows promise as an office-based system for transcutaneously repositioning kidney stones. Potential applications include facilitating expulsion of residual fragments following ureteroscopy or shock wave lithotripsy, repositioning stones prior to treatment, and repositioning obstructing ureteropelvic junction stones into the kidney to alleviate acute renal colic.

### Urinary stone size: comparison of abdominal plain radiography and noncontrast CT measurements [^d9f6d009]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To compare urinary stone size as measured by abdominal plain radiography (AXR) with stone size as measured by noncontrast three-dimensional spiral CT in patients with acute renal colic.

Patients and Methods

Patients presenting to the emergency room of a single institution with urinary stones that were visible on both AXR and noncontrast spiral CT were identified. Two radiologists blinded to the clinical outcomes separately and randomly reviewed all films and measured maximum longitudinal (craniocaudal) and transverse (anteroposterior) stone diameters. The two-tailed paired Student's t-test was used to compare the sizes of each stone on AXR and CT.

Results

Over a 1-year period, 22 patients were identified with a total of 31 urinary stones visible on both AXR and CT. Nineteen stones were located in the kidney, three in the midureter, and nine in the distal ureter. The mean stone size by AXR was 6.1 mm (range 2-13 mm; SD +/- 1.95) in the longitudinal axis and 5.3 mm (range 2-11 mm; SD +/- 1.50) in the transverse axis. The mean stone size by CT was 6.9 mm (range 3-12 mm; SD +/- 1.95) in the longitudinal axis and 6.1 mm (range 2-11 mm; SD +/- 1.50) in the transverse. The differences between AXR and CT measurements did not attain significance in either the longitudinal (p = 0.67) or the transverse (p = 0.25) axis.

Conclusions

A CT scan provides estimates of stone size that are consistently greater than those of AXR in both the longitudinal and transverse axes. However, for stones between 2 and 13 mm in maximum diameter, these differences do not attain significance. In patients with a history of radiopaque stones in this size range, therefore, AXR may provide useful size data for clinical decision-making without concern about significant disparities between the two modalities. As AXRs are more expeditiously obtained, incur less direct costs, and expose patients to significantly lower doses of radiation than CT scans, they remain a useful adjunctive study in the work-up of nephrolithiasis.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^f5601bb6]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality to use to evaluate patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation. Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT, but does not require use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Both modalities have advantages and disadvantages. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) plain film radiography is most helpful in evaluating for interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease, and is less useful in the setting of acute stones. MRI provides the possibility of 3D imaging without exposure to radiation, but it is costly and currently stones are difficult to visualize. Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones in light of the current guidelines and a randomized controlled trial could aid clinicians.

### Removal of small, asymptomatic kidney stones and incidence of relapse [^74018a3d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits of removing small (≤6 mm), asymptomatic kidney stones endoscopically is unknown. Current guidelines leave such decisions to the urologist and the patient. A prospective study involving older, nonendoscopic technology and some retrospective studies favor observation. However, published data indicate that about half of small renal stones left in place at the time that larger stones were removed caused other symptomatic events within 5 years after surgery.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in which, during the endoscopic removal of ureteral or contralateral kidney stones, remaining small, asymptomatic stones were removed in 38 patients (treatment group) and were not removed in 35 patients (control group). The primary outcome was relapse as measured by future emergency department visits, surgeries, or growth of secondary stones.

Results

After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, the treatment group had a longer time to relapse than the control group (P<0.001 by log-rank test). The restricted mean (±SE) time to relapse was 75% longer in the treatment group than in the control group (1631.6±72.8 days vs. 934.2±121.8 days). The risk of relapse was 82% lower in the treatment group than the control group (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.44), with 16% of patients in the treatment group having a relapse as compared with 63% of those in the control group. Treatment added a median of 25.6 minutes (interquartile range, 18.5 to 35.2) to the surgery time. Five patients in the treatment group and four in the control group had emergency department visits within 2 weeks after surgery. Eight patients in the treatment group and 10 in the control group reported passing kidney stones.

Conclusions

The removal of small, asymptomatic kidney stones during surgery to remove ureteral or contralateral kidney stones resulted in a lower incidence of relapse than nonremoval and in a similar number of emergency department visits related to the surgery.

American Urological Association (AUA) kidney stone evaluation—laboratory, imaging, and metabolic testing directives are as follows: clinicians should obtain serum intact parathyroid hormone level as part of the screening evaluation if primary hyperparathyroidism is suspected (Clinical Principle), and primary hyperparathyroidism should be suspected when serum calcium is high or high normal; when a stone is available, clinicians should obtain a stone analysis at least once (Clinical Principle); clinicians should obtain or review available imaging studies to quantify stone burden (Clinical Principle); clinicians should perform additional metabolic testing in high-risk or interested first-time stone formers and recurrent stone formers (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B); metabolic testing should consist of one or two 24-hour urine collections obtained on a random diet and analyzed at minimum for total volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, uric acid, citrate, sodium, potassium and creatinine (Expert Opinion), and primary hyperoxaluria should be suspected when urinary oxalate excretion exceeds 75 mg/day in adults without bowel dysfunction; clinicians should not routinely perform “fast and calcium load” testing to distinguish among types of hypercalciuria (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

ADPKD obstructing kidney stones—management setting and modality selection: Practice Point 2.3.5 notes that because obstructing kidney stones are more challenging to treat in people with ADPKD, they should be managed by centers of expertise; depending on ureteric obstruction level and stone size (>10 mm or <10 mm), extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy may be preferred first-line, whereas percutaneous nephrolithotomy generally is second-line. Large kidney cysts may make extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or percutaneous nephrostomy more difficult to perform, and results vary across centers and procedure types.

A meta-analysis cited here found no significant difference in rates of spontaneous stone expulsion between MET and control groups for these locations, and stratified outcomes by stone location should be interpreted with caution due to few studies. The Panel concluded that despite lack of benefit for middle/proximal ureter stones, the safety and success of MET for distal ureter stones make it reasonable to consider this adjuvant pharmacotherapy for ureteral stones at all locations.

### Totally tubeless, tubeless, and tubed percutaneous nephrolithotomy for treating kidney stones [^7c79a7a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) is the standard of care for removing large kidney stones (> 2 cm). Once the procedure is complete, different exiting strategies exist to manage the percutaneous tract opening, including placement of an external nephrostomy tube, placement of an internal ureteral stent, or no external or internal tube. The decision to place or not place a tube is handled differently among clinicians and may affect patient outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of tubeless PNL (with ureteral stenting), totally tubeless PNL (without ureteral stenting or nephrostomy), and standard PNL (nephrostomy only) for the treatment of kidney stones in adults.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in multiple biomedical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science), as well as in two clinical trial registries. We also handsearched reference lists of relevant publications and conference proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. The latest search update was conducted in September 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled and quasi-randomized controlled trials of adult patients who received tubeless, totally tubeless, or standard PNL for treating kidney stones. We defined tubeless PNL as no nephrostomy tube, but ureteral stenting, while totally tubeless PNL meant no nephrostomy tube or ureteral stenting. Both interventions were compared to standard PNL with placement of a nephrostomy tube (only). We considered access tubes of any sizes. We only considered unilateral PNL with single-tract access. There were no exclusions on stone composition, size, or location.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Primary outcomes were severe adverse events and postoperative pain, and secondary outcomes were operating time, length of hospital stay, and stone-free rate. We used the random-effects model for meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included 10 studies in the review. Participant age varied among studies, ranging from 20 to 60 years. Detailed information on stone characteristics was rarely presented. Tubeless PNL versus standard PNL We are very uncertain whether there is a difference in severe adverse events (SAEs) between tubeless PNL and standard PNL (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 16.46; I 2 = 42%; 2 studies, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tubeless PNL may have little to no effect on pain on postoperative day one (mean difference (MD) 0.56 lower, 95% CI 1.34 lower to 0.21 higher; I 2 = 84%; 4 studies, 186 participants; low-certainty evidence), and probably results in little to no difference in operating room time (MD 0.40 longer (in minutes), 95% CI 4.82 shorter to 5.62 longer; I 2 = 0%; 3 studies, 81 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tubeless PNL may reduce length of hospital stay (MD 0.90 shorter, 95% CI 1.45 shorter to 0.35 shorter; I 2 = 84%; 6 studies, 238 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of tubeless PNL on blood transfusions (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.52; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies, 161 participants; very low-certainty evidence), sepsis or fever (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.75; I 2 = not applicable; 2 studies, 82 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or readmissions (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 14.21; I 2 = not applicable, 1 study, 24 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless versus standard PNL Totally tubeless PNL may result in lower SAE rates (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.25; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence) and pain on postoperative day one (MD 3.60 lower, 95% CI 4.24 lower to 2.96 lower; I 2 = Not applicable; 1 study, 50 participants; low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless PNL may result in little to no difference in operating room time (MD 6.23 shorter (in minutes), 95% CI 14.29 shorter to 1.84 longer; I 2 = 72%; 2 studies, 174 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and sepsis or fever (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.97; I 2 = not applicable; 1 study, 90 participants; low-certainty evidence). Totally tubeless PNL likely shortens the length of hospital stay (MD 1.55 shorter, 95% CI 1.82 shorter to 1.29 shorter; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies, 274 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the effect of totally tubeless PNL on blood transfusions (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.48; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies, 274 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or readmissions (RR not estimable, 95% CI not estimable; I 2 = not applicable; 1 study, 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We found no studies comparing tubeless mini versus standard mini-PNL or totally tubeless mini versus standard mini-PNL.

Authors' Conclusions

When comparing tubeless to standard PNL with regard to the predefined primary outcomes of this review, there may be little difference in early postoperative pain, while we are very uncertain of the effect on SAEs. People treated with tubeless PNL may benefit from a reduced length of stay compared to standard PNL. When comparing totally tubeless to standard PNL, early postoperative pain and severe adverse events may be reduced with totally tubeless PNL. The certainty of evidence by outcome was mostly very low (range: moderate to very low) for the comparison of tubeless to standard PNL and low (range: moderate to very low) for the comparison of totally tubeless to standard PNL. The most common reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. We did not find randomized trial evidence for other comparisons. Overall, further and higher-quality studies are needed to inform clinical practice.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^6d6a0291]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Kidney stone size measurements

Regarding CT-based size measurements, mean ICC was 0.923 (0.907–0.936), indicating excellent interrater reliability. Across all stones, the manually measured size was 6.7 ± 2.8 mm ranging from 3.0 to 14.0 mm, while CT-based measurements were higher when averaging all reconstructions (7.1 ± 3.5 mm; p < 0.001). The overall correlation between Man-M and CT-based measurements was good (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.47). Regarding specific iodine-induced attenuation, CT-based measurements showed a good correlation with Man-M (R 2 = 0.40–0.58; p < 0.001), while measurements using the high-dose protocol showed a better correlation than using the low-dose protocol (R 2 = 0.39–0.68 vs. R 2 = 0.31–0.57; all p < 0.001) (Table 3). Yet, CT-based measurements of stone size did not significantly differ between scans with 2 mGy and 10 mGy when averaging all reconstructions (7.2 ± 3.6 vs. 7.0 ± 3.3 mm; p > 0.05).

### The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5 mm: comparison with ≥ 5 mm [^1dc89fe1]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: To clarify the natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤5mm in comparison with stones ≥5mm. Calculi ≤5mm are considered insignificant stones, but to what extent stone-related events can occur is unclear. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, 207 patients with asymptomatic renal stones confirmed by both CT and ultrasonography performed on the same day were enrolled. A follow-up ultrasound was performed every 6 months. The active indications for surgical intervention included stone relocations into the ureter and stone-related symptoms. The primary endpoint was the rate of surgical intervention. Results: A total of 207 patients (71 cases with stones ≤5mm and 136 cases with stones >5mm) were included in this study. At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 14 patients (20%) from the ≤5-mm group and 52 (38%) from the >5-mm group underwent surgical treatment ( p =0.0067). Moreover, 11 patients (16%) from the ≤5-mm group and 27 (20%) from the >5-mm group received surgical intervention as they manifested active indications, showing no significant difference ( p =0.44). As regards stone events, there were no significant differences in spontaneous stone passage, pain, hematuria, and stone growth. Multivariate analysis revealed that age ≤50 years and a history of stone surgery were significant factors, but stone size was not. Conclusion: About 20% of asymptomatic renal stones ≤5mm require surgical treatment within 5 years.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^211956c5]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists, and therefore where more evidence might increase consensus.

Methods

The webpages of the 61 members of the Societé Internationale d’Urologie were analysed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

Results

Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While 7 national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and 11 to the EAU guidelines, 43 neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

Conclusions

Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis. While there is a high grade of consensus for most stone scenarios, we also detected some discrepancies between different guidelines. These are, however, controversial situations where adequate evidence to assist with decision-making has yet to be elicited by further research.

### Size and volume of kidney stones in computed tomography: influence of acquisition techniques and image reconstruction parameters [^dd5b3f7e]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Computed tomography (CT) is routinely used to assess suspected urolithiasis. Information obtained from CT include presence, location and size of stones, with the latter frequently determining treatment strategy. While there is consensus regarding measurements procedures of kidney stones, influence of radiation dose and reconstruction techniques on stone measurements are unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the influence of these technical determinants on kidney stone size measurements.

Method

47 kidney stones of different composition were scanned using a 64-row-multi-detector CT in a 3D-printed, semi-anthropomorphic phantom. Reference stone sizes were measured manually with a digital caliper (Man-M). Stones were imaged with 2 and 10 mGy CTDI. Images were reconstructed using filtered-back-projection, hybrid-iterative and model-based-iterative reconstruction algorithms (FBP, HIR, MBIR) in combination with different kernels and denoising levels. All stones underwent semi-automatic, threshold-based segmentation for computation of maximum diameter and volume. Statistics were conducted using ANOVA ± correction for multiple comparisons.

Results

Overall stone size as compared to manual measurements was overestimated in CT (10.0 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05) yet showing a good correlation (R 2  = 0.66). Radiation dose and denoising levels did not significantly influence measurements (p > 0.05). MBIR and sharp kernels showed closest agreement with Man-M (9.3 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05). Differences within single stones were as high as 40 % (e.g. Man-M: 5.9 mm, CT: 7.3-12.0 mm).

Conclusions

CT-based measurements of kidney stone size appear unaffected by radiation dose and denoising technique, whereas reconstruction algorithms and kernels demonstrate a relevant impact on size measurements. Smallest differences were found using MBIR with a sharp kernel.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^6bbe3ee9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding covariates related to stone history, the number of stones on low-dose noncontrast CT imaging at randomization was associated with a significant increase in total and asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage. The direct association between stone burden and the risk of spontaneous passage is expected and comprehensible. Previous radiographic studies have examined the relationship between the width, length, and location of ureteral stones and the rate of spontaneous passage. In general, these studies have indicated a high likelihood of spontaneous passage for stones ≤4 mm in width and ≤6 mm in length as well as for stones located in the distal ureter. Thus, factors associated with spontaneous stone passage are well established for ureteral stones but not for kidney stones. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the incidence of asymptomatic spontaneous passage of kidney stones and its association with various clinical parameters.

The strengths of our trial include the prospective, imaging-controlled, multicenter design, and the large sample size. Indeed, this is the largest cohort ever to investigate spontaneous stone clearance in a CT-controlled population of kidney stone formers. CT acquisition was standardized as part of a randomized trial, and both baseline and follow-up CT scans of each participant were performed on the same CT scanner with identical acquisition settings. In addition, the standard operating procedure for the low-dose CT indicated a slice thickness of ≤2 mm and a slice increment less than or equal to slice thickness, theoretically minimizing the likelihood of missing very small stones.A very close follow-up (every 3 months) was performed; therefore, underreporting of symptomatic stone events is very unlikely.

This study had some limitations. First, we could not always identify (on a radiological basis) in patients with multiple spontaneous passages in which kidney stones present on CT at randomization passed symptomatically or asymptomatically. Thus, the exact sizes of kidney stones that passed spontaneously have presumably not been documented in a very limited number of stone events. This information would have been useful for identifying the size limit for spontaneous stone passage. Moreover, asymptomatic stone passage could not be excluded for stones potentially formed after the beginning of the study and were, therefore, not present at randomization, although we consider this phenomenon, if present at all, very rare.

AUA guideline—PCNL technique selection for adult kidney stones up to 3 cm states that for adult patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for kidney stones up to 3 cm in size, clinicians may offer standard or mini-PCNL (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and clinicians should inform these patients that mini-PCNL has stone-free rates comparable to standard PCNL but is associated with fewer complications, less pain, and shorter length of stay, but with a longer operative time (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C); clinicians should counsel that standard (24 Fr to 30 Fr) or mini-PCNL (10 Fr to 22 Fr) offer comparable stone-free rates for stones up to 3 cm in size, though for stones approaching 3 cm or larger in diameter several studies have demonstrated that standard PCNL has a higher stone-free rate; compared with standard PCNL, mini-PCNL is reported to have shorter hospital length of stay, fewer Clavien-Dindo Grade I and II complications with similar Grade III and higher complications, less blood loss and lower transfusion rates, and less pain, while operative time is consistently longer for mini-PCNL.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^7f9b1c88]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Other studies demonstrated that kidney stone size influences the detection rate on VNC. In line with these studies, we found a difference in size between visible and invisible stones as well as a positive correlation between stone size and detectability. Considering a general cut-off for insignificant stones of ≤ 5 mm described by current guidelines, our results showed a significantly better detectability for stones > 5 mm, which remained as high as 85 % on VNC 1000HU. Yet, it has to be mentioned that stones smaller than 5 mm might also cause symptoms and might not pass spontaneously, although up to 95 % of kidney stones smaller than 4 mm pass spontaneously. More particular detection of small stones may be diagnostic in the scenario of unclear hematuria (irrespective of the impact on treatment).

Furthermore, previous studies reported an underestimation of kidney stone size on VNC compared to true non-contrast images due to an over-subtraction of small stones or of the peripheral stone along with the iodine signal. Contrary, CT-based stone size in this study was generally overestimated compared to Man-M, which is e.g. discrepant to an earlier ex-vivo study of Lazar et al using a DSCT system, performing 2D-based size measurements on axial reconstructions and including smaller stones with a diameter of 2.4 ± 1.1 mm in which the over-subtraction may have a higher influence on size measurements. A possible explanation for this behaviour might lie in the different scanner techniques and hence post-processing capabilities used between the studies.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^a1840f13]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline—medical management of kidney stones—scope and evidence base: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature. The primary source of evidence was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) on recurrent nephrolithiasis in adults, and to augment the AHRQ report the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori; in total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions. Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of a screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients. Kidney stone disease burden is highlighted as affecting nearly 1 in 11 individuals in the United States and as likely to recur, with at least 50% of individuals experiencing another stone within 10 years of the first occurrence. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identify high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is likely to be effective in reducing stone recurrence.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^7c319cc6]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematuria and urolithiasis rank among the most common urologic diagnoses, with urolithiasis being one of the leading causes of hematuria. While the prevalence of hematuria has been reported between 2.4 and 31.1%, the lifetime prevalence of urolithiasis is approximately 15% in developed countries. In patients with suspected urolithiasis, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) and in patients with hematuria and a high risk for genitourinary malignancy, multiphasic CT is recommended by international guidelines authored by the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association, respectively. Due to the rising prevalence of urolithiasis and a high rate of recurrence of up to 50%, limiting radiation exposure in these and other urologic patients is a major concern.

In recent decades, technical advances allowed for extensive investigations regarding the reduction of radiation dose in computed tomography. This leads to the implementation of low-dose scanning protocols for patients with suspected urolithiasis in the international guideline by the EAU [,–]. On the contrary, the radiation dose of multiphasic CT in patients with hematuria including a non-contrast, parenchymal and excretory phase still exhibits a high radiation dose. Here, virtual non-contrast reconstructions (VNC) of excretory phase derived from dual-energy CT systems showed promising results in urinary stone detection to replace true non-contrast scans. More recently, split-bolus protocols have been described to further reduce radiation dose by combining the parenchymal and excretory phase of the multiphasic hematuria CT protocol. Hence, when applied to dual-energy CT (DECT) systems, the non-contrast, parenchymal and excretory phase may be obtained within a single scan yielding a radiation dose reduction of up 40 to 60%. So far, previous studies investigated the detection of kidney stones on VNC of the excretory phase using the different available emission-based DECT systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study available investigating the effect of different parameters using VNC of the dual-layer DECT system (DLCT). In particular, information on the performance of DLCT regarding detectability and size measurements of kidney stones is unavailable; however, both frequently determine treatment strategies in patients with kidney stones.

Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation dose on the detection rate and size measurements of kidney stones on VNC obtained from DLCT.

### Preparation of artificial kidney stones of reproducible size, shape, and mass by precision injection molding [^4705a1b1]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To prepare artificial kidney stones of defined shape, size, mass, and material composition via precision injection molding of Ultracal 30 cement slurries into an inexpensive biodegradable mold.

Materials and Methods

A calcium alginate and silica-based mold was used to prepare casts of varying shapes in a reproducible manner. Ultracal 30 cement slurries mixed 1:1 with water were injected into these casts and allowed to harden. The artificial stones were recovered and their physical properties determined. Ex-vivo and in-vivo responses to holmium laser lithotripsy were examined.

Results

Spheres, half spheres, cylinders, cubes, tapered conical structures, and flat angulated structures were prepared with high precision without post-molding manipulations. Large spheres of average mass 0.661 g (+/- 0.037), small spheres of average mass 0.046 g (+/- 0.0026), and hexagons of average mass 0.752 g (+/- 0.0180) were found to have densities (1610-1687 kg/m(3)) within the expected range for Ultracal 30 cement stones. Ex-vivo holmium laser lithotripsy of small spheres in saline showed uniformly reproducible efficiencies of comminution. Implantation of a tapered conical stone into the ureter of a porcine model demonstrated stone comminution in vivo consistent with that seen in the ex-vivo models.

Conclusions

We present an environmentally safe, technically simple procedure for the formation of artificial kidney stones of predetermined size and shape. The technique does not require the use of hazardous solvents or postprocedural processing of the stones. These stones are intended for use in standardized experiments of lithotripsy efficiency in which the shape of the stone as well as the mass can be predetermined and precisely controlled.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part II: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^26a39702]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)—immediate/early post-operative imaging: For adult patients undergoing PCNL, clinicians may obtain a computed tomography (CT) in the immediate/early post-operative period to assess stone-free status and determine the need for a secondary procedure. (Expert Opinion). Surgeon assessment of residual fragments during PCNL, based on intraoperative findings and fluoroscopy, has been shown to have poor sensitivity (24% to 50%) compared to immediate/early post-operative non-contrast CT imaging, and surgeons commonly underestimate the size of clinically significant residual fragments, which are known to confer a higher risk of re-intervention and unplanned stone events; accordingly, use of post-operative CT imaging may inform the need for and planning of secondary procedures and may additionally identify organ injury after PCNL, and use of low-dose CT protocols should be considered to minimize cumulative radiation exposure during the treatment period.

### Imaging urolithiasis: complications and interventions in children [^83776228]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Ultrasound allows for identification of most clinically relevant stones, making it the modality of choice in paediatric urolithiasis. In children with symptoms of significant colic and nondiagnostic US, complementary imaging modalities such as KUB radiography or non-contrast CT might be considered. Management of kidney stones includes dietary, pharmacological and urological interventions depending on stone size, location or type and the child’s condition. Given the very high incidence of underlying metabolic abnormalities and significant recurrence rates in paediatric urolithiasis, a thorough metabolic evaluation and follow-up examinations are of utmost importance.

Pregnancy—imaging for ureteral stones indicates that 'By far, the most accurate imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones in pregnancy is non-contrast CT,' and that teratogenic effects are 'highest between the 2nd and 20th weeks of gestation; nevertheless, typical stone protocol CT imaging is performed at doses below teratogenic thresholds of 5 rad (50 milligray [mGy])'; 'Low dose protocols can be utilized.' Like ultrasound (US), non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 'avoids exposure to ionizing radiation and can be used during any trimester,' but stones are not directly visualized and 'MRI has a reported 80% positive predictive value (PPV) for stones.' During imaging in pregnancy, 'it is most prudent to involve the obstetric team' and, if ionizing radiation is used, clinicians 'should consider further consultation with radiology and/or a medical physicist.'

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^1595f709]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the effects of different degrees of surrounding iodine-induced attenuation and radiation dose on the detection rate and size measurements of kidney stones on VNC obtained from DLCT. We found that the overall detection rate continuously decreased with increasing surrounding iodine-induced attenuation, while remaining comparable to true-non-contrast scans on VNC ≤ 400 HU even when using a low-dose technique. The detection rate of kidney stones was higher in the high-dose protocol as compared to the low-dose protocol and was comparable between both protocols on VNC ≤ 600HU. Kidney stone size influenced the detection rate and was generally overestimated. Stones > 5 mm were better detected than stones ≤ 5 mm, while the detection rate remained comparable on VNC ≤ 800HU.

The reported data demonstrate the beneficial value of VNC derived from dual-energy CT in the imaging of hematuria and urolithiasis. VNC has the potential to replace the true non-contrast scan in multiphasic CT protocols resulting in a reduction of radiation dose, while maintaining a high detection rate of kidney stones when taking the observed limitations into account. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first study investigating the detection of kidney stones on VNC derived from DLCT, while most published in vivo studies used rapid-switching rather than dual-source DECT. A direct translation of the presented results to other DECT systems is limited due to different technical aspects, such as a reported variation in iodine quantification accuracy between the different DECT systems—which, in turn, closely relates with VNC accuracy. Yet it has been shown that iodine can be accurately quantified with all state-of-the-art DECT systems including DLCT. Nonetheless, future studies are encouraged to perform a true head-to-head comparison.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part I: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^43fe7070]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA guideline—pre-operative evaluation and preparation for surgical intervention for kidney and/or ureteral stones—states that for adult and pediatric patients undergoing surgical intervention for kidney and/or ureteral stones, clinicians should obtain a medical history, perform a relevant physical examination, and obtain laboratory studies appropriate to procedural risk and patient comorbidities (Clinical Principle); additionally, the Panel recommends a focused medical history and physical examination in patients undergoing upper urinary tract stone surgery.

ADPKD practice points—urinary stones and weight advise that people with ADPKD who either have or have an increased risk of developing urinary stones should make dietary adjustments to prevent stone formation with strategy based on stone composition or urine lithogenic molecules; people with ADPKD should maintain a healthy body weight accounting for additional weight due to enlarged kidneys and liver; total kidney and liver weight derived from volumes should be calculated and subtracted from total body weight for more accurate assessment of weight and BMI; and a healthy (adjusted) BMI of 20–25 kg/m2 is important for optimal cardiovascular health.

### Stone-mode ultrasound for determining renal stone size [^61ffdd75]. Journal of Endourology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to measure the accuracy of stone-specific algorithms (S-mode) and the posterior acoustic shadow for determining kidney stone size with ultrasound (US) in vivo.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-four subjects with 115 renal stones were prospectively recruited and scanned with S-mode on a research US system. S-mode is gray-scale US adjusted to enhanced stone contrast and resolution by minimizing compression and averaging, and increasing line density and frequency. Stone and shadow width were compared with a recent CT scan and, in 5 subjects with 18 stones, S-mode was compared with a clinical US system.

Results

Overall, 84% of stones identified on CT were detected on S-mode and 66% of these shadowed. Seventy-three percent of the stone measurements and 85% of the shadow measurements were within 2mm of the size on CT. A posterior acoustic shadow was present in 89% of stones over 5mm versus 53% of stones under 5mm. S-mode visualized 78% of stones, versus 61% for the clinical system. S-mode stone and shadow measurements differed from CT by 1.6±1.0mm and 0.8±0.6mm, respectively, compared with 2.0±1.5mm and 1.6±1.0mm for the clinical system.

Conclusions

S-mode offers improved visualization and sizing of renal stones. With S-mode, sizing of the stone itself and the posterior acoustic shadow were similarly accurate. Stones that do not shadow are most likely <5mm and small enough to pass spontaneously.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis-a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^0f985520]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

If surgical treatment of ureteral or renal stones is indicated, clinicians face the challenge of choosing the most appropriate treatment for each patient. In ambiguous situations, evidence-based guidelines can help the urologist with decision-making.

Our systematic search covering all members of the SIU showed that the EAU and AUA guidelines are the most frequently referenced guidelines worldwide for the treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment recommendations are based on stone size and location in all available guidelines. Remarkably, the websites of most national urological associations neither refer to a reference guideline nor provide their own guidelines. However, efforts are made to improve this situation such as those by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) in collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Besides a linked guideline on laparoscopic stone removal, new guidelines covering the management of renal and ureteric calculi are supposed to be published by February 2019. We suggest that urological associations without own guidelines should refer to one of the cited guidelines to provide a reliable source their members can refer to.

Regarding location – except for the AFU guidelines – all guidelines consider calculi in the lower renal pole separately because of a reduced possibility of passage of fragments [,–]. Most guidelines categorize stone size into < 10 mm, 10–20 mm, and > 20 mm. However, the AUA guidelines for renal calculi only differentiate between ≤10 mm and > 10 mm for lower-pole stones and between ≤20 mm and > 20 mm for non-lower pole stones. There is also some deviation from the most common classifications in the AFU guidelines, SAU guidelines, and SUA guidelines.

Surgical treatment of ureteral calculi depends on stone location and size. The AUA guidelines state that earlier classifications split the ureter into thirds and that this was because of the surgical approaches available. Nowadays, the ureter is divided into two sections marked by the crossing of the iliac vessels. All guidelines use a cut-off level of 10 mm to define the surgical approach.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^d1d62d3b]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

AUA medical management of kidney stones—empiric therapy when no metabolic abnormality persists states that clinicians should offer thiazide diuretics and/or potassium citrate to patients with recurrent calcium stones in whom other metabolic abnormalities are absent or have been appropriately addressed and stone formation persists (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). It adds that thiazides and potassium citrate therapy have been shown to prevent recurrent stones in patients with normal range urinary calcium and citrate, respectively, and therefore it may be appropriate to utilize these therapies for patients with recurrent stones who do not demonstrate specific urinary abnormalities, with potassium citrate possibly preferred first-line in patients with no identified risk factors for nephrolithiasis given its relatively low side effect profile.

### Kidney stone volume estimation from computerized tomography images using a model based method of correcting for the point spread function [^840f2e30]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

We propose a method to improve the accuracy of volume estimation of kidney stones from computerized tomography images.

Materials and Methods

The proposed method consisted of 2 steps. A threshold equal to the average of the computerized tomography number of the object and the background was first applied to determine full width at half maximum volume. Correction factors were then applied, which were precalculated based on a model of a sphere and a 3-dimensional gaussian point spread function. The point spread function was measured in a computerized tomography scanner to represent the response of the scanner to a point-like object. Method accuracy was validated using 6 small cylindrical phantoms with 2 volumes of 21.87 and 99.9 mm(3), and 3 attenuations, respectively, and 76 kidney stones with a volume range of 6.3 to 317.4 mm(3). Volumes estimated by the proposed method were compared with full width at half maximum volumes.

Results

The proposed method was significantly more accurate than full width at half maximum volume (p <0.0001). The magnitude of improvement depended on stone volume with smaller stones benefiting more from the method. For kidney stones 10 to 20 mm(3) in volume the average improvement in accuracy was the greatest at 19.6%.

Conclusions

The proposed method achieved significantly improved accuracy compared with threshold methods. This may lead to more accurate stone management.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^f5071383]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of ureteral and/or kidney stones—abstract scope, methods, and applicability: This Guideline covers the surgical treatment of patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones and is intended for clinicians evaluating and managing patients with these diseases. The systematic review was conducted in two planned stages, including a search for systematic reviews followed by a search for primary literature; OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE, and databases were searched for studies published from January 2000 through May 2025 (week 20), with reference lists scanned for potentially useful studies. The Panel addressed adult and pediatric patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones for whom surgical intervention may be indicated, with statements addressing particular patient scenarios and review of specific surgical techniques, technologies, or medications aimed at improving patient outcomes. Selection of optimal treatment modalities is determined by patient factors, urinary tract anatomy, and stone characteristics and is guided by shared decision-making that additionally takes into account patient goals and preferences, resource availability, and physician expertise, and the Guideline serves as a resource to provide the best available evidence on which to base discussions with patients in a shared decision-making process to arrive at appropriate treatment decisions.

### Size matters: the width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^e81e0fe5]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Ever since NECT replaced KUB in the 1990s as the primary tool for diagnosing ureteral stones there have been controversies concerning how to measure the ureteral stones for prediction of stone passage rate. A pivotal aspect has been the diversity and sometimes lack of definitions of stone width and length [,–,,–].

We created logistic regression models for prediction of spontaneous passage using a clear definition of the stone width and length. The strong correlation between the width and the length of a ureteral stone suggests that either measurement can be used in a predictive model with a similar AUC. Thus the choice between the width and the length as a predictor variable is less important, while it is of utmost importance that the selected measure is used consistently. Although the stone width took precedence over the length in the multivariate regression and measuring the width conforms to the intention in earlier studies, we provide predictive models for both stone width and length (Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6). We also recommend a high level of magnification to be used, together with a predefined window setting.

To the best of our knowledge the present study with spontaneous passage as the outcome has included the largest number of ureteral stones since the start of the CT era, which made it possible to create logistic univariate regression models for prediction of passage probabilities given the stone size for different stone locations and with two different window settings of L300/W1120 and L50/W400.

It is widely agreed that the stone location is an important predictor of stone passage [–,]. Our results suggest a classification of stone location into upper and lower ureteral stones when predicting stone passage.

We demonstrated that left-sided ureteral stones seem to pass significantly more often than right-sided in some analyses (see Table 4). Sfoungaristos et al. suggested that the reason might be that the right ureter is typically adherent to the peritoneum, in contrast to the left ureter, providing a better peristalsis in the left ureter.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^06e217f8]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Influence of kidney stone size on detection rate

Considering a general cut-off for insignificant stones of ≤ 5 mm described by current guidelines, 32 kidney stones (34.8 %) were ≤ 5 mm, while 60 kidney stones (65.2 %) were > 5 mm (indicated by Man-M, respectively). The overall detection rate of kidney stones ≤ 5 mm was significantly lower as compared to stones > 5 mm (80.6 % vs. 87.1 %; p < 0.01) when averaging all reconstructions. With increasing iodine-induced attenuation, detection rates in low-dose protocols dropped sooner as compared to high-dose protocols (e.g. VNC 1000HU 68.8 % vs 85.0 %, p < 0.01) (Table 4).

### Management of stones in abnormal situations [^35488716]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Stones in abnormal situations present a management conundrum to the urologist. Many of these situations are relatively rare and literature is scanty on the appropriate management. We review the current literature on the management of stones in the setting of pregnancy, calyceal diverticulum, urinary diversions, pelvic kidneys, transplant kidneys, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, horseshoe kidneys, and other renal anomalies. The aims of treatment are complete stone-free status. The modality of treatment should be individualized to the size and location of stone and type of abnormal situation confronted.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis [^6a14fa8d]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease. Given the complexity and variability of stone formation, individualised patient management is emphasised.

Methods

The guidelines incorporate evidence from the latest research and focus on risk assessment, imaging techniques, pharmacological management, and surgical interventions. A research librarian conducted literature searches for urolithiasis in the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase databases via Dialog-Datastar. The strength of recommendations is also rated.

Key Findings and Limitations

Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and imaging, with ultrasound as the first-line modality and low-dose computed tomography as the gold standard for precise stone assessment. Stone composition and burden influence treatment decisions with algorithms primarily based on stone size, location, and composition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for first-line pain management, with opioids reserved as a secondary option. Medical expulsive therapy with α-blockers may be considered for selected patients with ureteral stones. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy remain the primary intervention modalities, with selection based on stone characteristics and patient factors. Advances in multiplanar imaging have improved assessment of the stone burden, although further research is needed to refine predictive models. Genetic testing is recommended for high-risk patients to guide personalised treatment.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The guidelines provide a framework for clinical decision-making while acknowledging the need for continued advances in urolithiasis.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for diuretic renal scintigraphy in adults with suspected upper urinary tract obstruction 1.0 [^9dd7c4cc]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Special cases—acute renal colic: In patients with suspected stone-related obstruction, unenhanced helical computed tomography (CT) is described as the “procedure of choice,” can ascertain stone size, and “cannot determine the functional status of the kidney”; the correct non‑stone diagnosis “can be made in approximately 50%” of symptomatic patients. Stone size informs management: “calculi smaller than 5 mm generally pass spontaneously,” “many calculi between 3 and 8 mm in size are followed up conservatively,” and “larger stones (5–8 mm)…can be managed conservatively, whereas some small stones (3–5 mm) do result in high‑grade obstruction and may need more aggressive management.” In the emergency room, “obtaining a diuretic renal scan…has been shown to direct patient management,” and “one study found that the scan changed the decision to admit or discharge the patient in 30% of cases.”

### The durability of active surveillance in patients with asymptomatic kidney stones: a systematic review [^128652f9]. Journal of Endourology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: The natural progression of asymptomatic kidney stones remains unclear. Such knowledge may promote value-aligned care for patients and reduce potentially unnecessary procedures. We sought to evaluate the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones in adults undergoing active surveillance. Materials and Methods: Using themes of "Kidney Stone" and "Active Surveillance," we performed a systematic review by searching for studies in MEDLINE, all Cochrane libraries, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, BIOSIS, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception through October 2017-in addition to ClinicalTrials.gov, American Urological Association Annual Meeting abstracts (2014-2017), Google Scholar, and references of included studies and prior reviews. Two blinded reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. We qualitatively summarized rates of surgical intervention (primary outcome), spontaneous stone passage, symptom development, and stone growth. We assessed the relationship between surveillance duration and rate of surgical intervention with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Of 7034 unique records, 13 studies met final eligibility criteria. There was substantial variation in reported rates of surgical intervention from 6/85 (7.1%) to 80/301 (26.6%), spontaneous stone passage from 1/32 (3.1%) to 101/347 (29.1%), symptom development from 7/96 (7.3%) to 231/300 (77.0%), and stone growth from 5/96 (5.2%) to 33/50 (66.0%). Mean surveillance duration spanned from 11.3 to 80 months (range 2-180 months). Longer mean duration of surveillance did not correlate with an increase in surgical intervention rate across studies ( n =13, r =0.01, p =0.98), and this finding persisted when restricting analysis to observational studies ( n =9, r =0.12, p =0.76). Conclusions: Active surveillance appears to be a durable strategy for a majority of patients with asymptomatic kidney stones, as there was no increase in failure of watchful waiting despite increasing duration of surveillance. Higher quality studies are needed to ascertain which patients may benefit most from active surveillance.

### Making renal stones change size-impact of CT image post processing and reader variability [^0b7d52ad]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to quantify the impact of image post-processing parameters on the apparent renal stone size, and to quantify the intra- and inter-reader variability in renal stone size estimation.

Methods

Fifty CT datasets including a renal or ureteral stone were included retrospectively during a prospective inclusion period. Each of the CT datasets was post-processed in different ways regarding slice thickness, slice increment and window setting. In the first part of the study a single reader repeated size estimations for the renal stones using different post-processing parameters. In the intra-reader variability experiment one reader reported size estimations for the same images with a one-week interval. The inter-reader variability data were obtained from 11 readers reporting size estimations for the same renal stones.

Results

The apparent stone size differed according to image post-processing parameters with the largest mean differences seen with regard to the window settings experiment (1.5 mm, p<0.001) and slice thickness (0.8 mm, p<0.001). Changes in parameters introduced a bias and a pseudo-random variability. The inter-reader variability was considerably larger than the intra-reader variability.

Conclusion

Our results indicate a need for the standardisation of making measurements on CT images.

### The risk of chronic kidney disease associated with urolithiasis and its urological treatments: a review [^6a168272]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urolithiasis can impair kidney function. This literature review focuses on the risk of kidney impairment in stone formers, the specific conditions associated with this risk and the impact of urological surgery.

Materials and Methods

The PubMed® and Embase® databases were searched for publications on urolithiasis, its treatment, and the risk of chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease and nephrectomy in stone formers.

Results

In general, renal stone formers have twice the risk of chronic kidney disease or end stage renal disease, and for female and overweight stone formers the risk is even higher. Patients with frequent urinary tract infections, struvite stones, urinary malformations and diversions, malabsorptive bowel conditions and some monogenic disorders are at high risk for chronic kidney disease/end stage renal disease. Shock wave lithotripsy or minimally invasive urological interventions for stones do not adversely affect renal function. Declines in renal function generally occur in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease or a large stone burden requiring repeated and/or complex surgery.

Conclusions

Although the effect size is modest, urolithiasis may cause chronic kidney disease and, thus, it is mandatory to assess patients with renal stones for the risk of chronic kidney disease/end stage renal disease. We suggest that all guidelines dealing with renal stone disease should include assessment of this risk.

### Tract sizes in miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a systematic review from the European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines panel [^25caf30f]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Miniaturized instruments for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), utilizing tracts sized ≤22 Fr, have been developed in an effort to reduce the morbidity and increase the efficiency of stone removal compared with standard PNL (>22 Fr).

Objective

We systematically reviewed all available evidence on the efficacy and safety of miniaturized PNL for removing renal calculi.

Evidence Acquisition

The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Since it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, the data were summarized in a narrative synthesis.

Evidence Synthesis

After screening 2945 abstracts, 18 studies were included (two randomized controlled trials [RCTs], six nonrandomized comparative studies, and 10 case series). Thirteen studies were full-text articles and five were only available as congress abstracts. The size of tracts used in miniaturized procedures ranged from 22 Fr to 4.8 Fr. The largest mean stone size treated using small instruments was 980mm 2 . Stone-free rates were comparable in miniaturized and standard PNL procedures. Procedures performed with small instruments tended to be associated with significantly lower blood loss, while the procedure duration tended to be significantly longer. Other complications were not notably different between PNL types. Study designs and populations were heterogeneous. Study limitations included selection and outcome reporting bias, as well as a lack of information on relevant confounding factors.

Conclusions

The studies suggest that miniaturized PNL is at least as efficacious and safe as standard PNL for the removal of renal calculi. However, the quality of the evidence was poor, drawn mainly from small studies, the majority of which were single-arm case series, and only two of which were RCTs. Furthermore, the tract sizes used and types of stones treated were heterogeneous. Hence, the risks of bias and confounding were high, highlighting the need for more reliable data from RCTs.

Patient Summary

Removing kidney stones via percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) using smaller sized instruments (mini-PNL) appears to be as effective and safe as using larger (traditional) instruments, but more clinical research is needed.

### Patient information: kidney stones (...) [^cdf5d7ff]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Walter K. Kidney Stones. JAMA. 2022; 328:

898. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2022. 12609 Kidney stones are deposits of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys. Most commonly, kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium. Less frequently, they are made up of uric acid or cystine or are associated with urinary tract infections. While small kidney stones may pass freely through the urinary system, larger kidney stones can become lodged within a ureter, which is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. Symptomatic kidney stones typically cause sudden onset of severe flank or back pain on one side of the body that can radiate to the groin and may result in blood in the urine, pain with urination, increased frequency of urination, fever and chills, and nausea and vomiting.

The preferred imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of kidney stones is a noncontrast abdominal computed tomography scan, which provides information about the size and location of the stones. Ultrasonography may be an alternative option for individuals who are pregnant or for patients who need frequent imaging due to recurrent kidney stones. For patients with a kidney stone that is 10 mm in diameter or smaller, typical outpatient management involves a 4- to 6-week trial of straining the urine to capture a passed kidney stone. Patients who are not at risk of developing low blood pressure may be treated with an alpha-adrenergic blocker medication to help expel ureteral stones. Surgical treatment is recommended for patients with symptomatic kidney stones larger than 10 mm in diameter.

Surgery may also be considered for patients with smaller symptomatic kidney stones who have fever, uncontrolled nausea or pain, or only 1 functioning kidney and for those who prefer early intervention or who have not spontaneously passed the kidney stone after 4 to 6 weeks. Risk factors for symptomatic recurrent kidney stones include history of asymptomatic or symptomatic kidney stones, larger stones, and a higher number of kidney stones detected by imaging. Other risk factors include male sex, younger age, obesity, pregnancy, and having a family history of kidney stones.

### Accuracy of reduced-dose computed tomography for ureteral stones in emergency department patients [^0f03c397]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Reduced-dose computed tomography (CT) scans have been recommended for diagnosis of kidney stone but are rarely used in the emergency department (ED) setting. Test characteristics are incompletely characterized, particularly in obese patients. Our primary outcome is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a reduced-dose CT protocol for symptomatic ureteral stones, particularly those large enough to require intervention, using a protocol stratified by patient size.

Methods

This was a prospective, blinded observational study of 201 patients at an academic medical center. Consenting subjects underwent both regular- and reduced-dose CT, stratified into a high and low body mass index (BMI) protocol based on effective abdominal diameter. Reduced-dose CT scans were interpreted by radiologists blinded to regular-dose interpretations. Follow-up for outcome and intervention was performed at 90 days.

Results

CT scans with both regular and reduced doses were conducted for 201 patients, with 63% receiving the high BMI reduced-dose protocol. Ureteral stone was identified in 102 patients (50.7%) of those receiving regular-dose CT, with a ureteral stone greater than 5 mm identified in 26 subjects (12.9%). Sensitivity of the reduced-dose CT for any ureteral stone was 90.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.3% to 95.0%), with a specificity of 99.0% (95% CI 93.7% to 100.0%). For stones greater than 5 mm, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 85.0% to 100.0%). Reduced-dose CT identified 96% of patients who required intervention for ureteral stone within 90 days. Mean reduction in size-specific dose estimate was 18.6 milligray (mGy), from 21.7 mGy (SD 9.7) to 3.4 mGy (SD 0.9).

Conclusion

CT with substantial dose reduction was 90.2% (95% CI 82.3% to 95.0%) sensitive and 98.9% (95% CI 85.0% to 100.0%) specific for ureteral stones in ED patients with a wide range of BMIs. Reduced-dose CT was 96.0% (95% CI 80.5% to 99.3%) sensitive for ureteral stones requiring intervention within 90 days.

### What predicts spontaneous passage of ≤ 1 CM ureteral stones in children? [^5ceafefa]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study is to determine what factors predict spontaneous passage of ≤1 cm ureteral stones in children.

Methods

Files of the patients diagnosed with a single ureteral stone on a given side between 2008 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with congenital obstructive uropathy, neurogenic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux and those with a stone diameter of >1 cm were excluded. Detection of ureteral stones was done using ultrasonography (US) primarily, and computed tomography when US findings were inconclusive. Patients were treated either conservatively or surgically. Conservative treatment included adequate hydration and pain management whereas surgical treatment included ureteroscopic intervention. Apart from those who required urgent intervention, patients were referred for surgical treatment after 2-4 weeks of follow-up with no spontaneous passage. Factors analyzed for association of spontaneous passage included age, gender, type of hematuria, stone localization, laterality, presence of concomitant kidney stone, degree of hydronephrosis, stone size and stone composition.

Results

A total of 70 patients (38 males, 32 females); median age 4.7 years had a ≤ 1 cm ureteral stone (median diameter 7 mm). US was able to diagnose the ureteric stone in 47 patients while computed tomography was required in 23 patients. Spontaneous passage was observed in 40 patients (57.1%). Median time for stone passage was 8 days (3-34 days). Stone size and presence of hematuria (macroscopic and microscopic combined) were factors associated with spontaneous passage and 6.7 mm was found to be the cut-off (AUC = 0.953; 95% CI 0.905-1.000; sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 82.5%, p < 0.001). Moreover, age, degree of hydronephrosis or stone location were not associated with spontaneous passage.

Conclusion

Patients with a ureteric stone size <6.7 mm can safely be followed conservatively, with a spontaneous passage rate of 82.5%. Type of Study Case series with no comparison group. Level of Evidence IV.

### Size matters: the width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^37e949cb]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Spontaneous stone passage was observed in 312 patients (80%). Intervention was performed in 73 patients (19%) in the 20-week follow-up, mean intervention day 37 (range 0–179). Seven patients without spontaneous passage in 20 weeks did not undergo any intervention during the study period. The mean ±1 SD outcome observation day in the short-term group was 31 ± 7. The observed spontaneous stone passage rate at different stone width, measured in bone window (L300/W1120), and in different locations is listed in Table 3 with 95% CIs for proportions using an exact method. Using the bone window the Bland Altman 95% limits of agreement for the width estimation between reader 1 and 2 was 0.7 ± 1.3 mm, between reader 1 and 3, 0.7 ± 1.3 mm and between reader 2 and 3, 0.1 ± 1.1 mm.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part II: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^85c7ff25]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones (AUA Guideline) abstract—scope and methods: The guideline covers the surgical management of patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones and is intended for clinicians evaluating and managing patients, and the summary represents Part II of the three-part series. The systematic review was conducted in two planned stages—first searching for systematic reviews and then for primary literature—using OVID to search MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles evaluating surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones, with databases searched for studies published from January 2000 through May 2025 (week 20) and with reference lists of included systematic reviews and primary literature scanned. The Panel addressed adult and pediatric patients with ureteral and/or kidney stones for whom surgical intervention may be indicated, with each statement addressing a specific patient scenario in which the choice of surgical intervention was reviewed and justified, and additionally reviewed and analyzed the utility of specific surgical techniques, technologies, or medications aimed at improving patient outcomes. Conclusions emphasize that selection of optimal treatment modalities is determined by patient factors, urinary tract anatomy, and stone characteristics and is guided by shared decision-making that takes into account patient goals and preferences, resource availability, and physician expertise, and the guideline serves as a resource to provide the best available evidence on which to base discussions in a shared decision-making process to arrive at appropriate treatment decisions.

### Variation in radiologic and urologic computed tomography interpretation of urinary tract stone burden: results from the registry for stones of the kidney and ureter [^c32bf3c9]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the measured stone burden recorded between urologists and radiologists, and examine how these differences could potentially impact stone management. As current urologic stone surgery guideline recommendations are based on stone size, accurate stone measurements are crucial to direct appropriate treatment. This study investigated the discrepant interpretation that often exists between urologic surgeons and radiologists' estimation of patient urinary stone burden.

Materials and Methods

From November 2015 through August 2016, new patients prospectively enrolled into the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter (ReSKU) were included if they had computed tomography images available and an accompanying official radiologic report at the time of their urologist provider visit. Stone number and aggregate stone size were compared between the urologic interpretation and the corresponding radiologic reports.

Results

Of 219 patients who met the inclusion criteria, concordance between urologic and radiologic assessment of aggregate stone size was higher for single stone sizing (63%) compared with multiple stones (32%). Statistical significance was found in comparing the mean difference in aggregate stone size for single and multiple stones (P<.01). Over 33% of stone-containing renal units had a radiologic report with an unclear size estimation or size discrepancy that could lead to non-guideline-driven surgical management.

Conclusion

Significant variation exists between urologic and radiologic computed tomography interpretations of stone burden. Urologists should personally review patient imaging when considering stone surgical management. A standardized method for measuring and reporting stone parameters is needed among urologists and radiologists.

### Management of stones in renal transplant [^6121d440]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Increasingly, screening of both deceased and living donor organs has led to the early detection of kidney stones prior to donation. A number of transplant recipients will still present with donor-gifted and de-novo stones. A range of treatment modalities is available in the management of renal transplant stones.

Recent Findings

Stones can be pretreated in the (living) donor prior to transplantation, managed at the time of transplantation or treated in the recipient post-transplant. The options include conservative management, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, ureteroscopy or open surgery depending on the size and location of the stone(s). Various techniques to deal with a transplant kidney are described. Ex-vivo ureteroscopy or pyeloscopy can safely render a kidney-stone free prior to transplantation and in living donors this means without subjecting the living donor to an additional stone removing procedure.

Summary

The cause of renal transplant lithiasis is multifactorial. More research is needed to understand the factors associated with de-novo stone formation. Early detection of donor-gifted stones can allow stones to be removed at the time of transplantation. Close follow up of both living donors and transplant recipients is necessary to ensure long-term safety is maintained.

### Detection and size measurements of kidney stones on virtual non-contrast reconstructions derived from dual-layer computed tomography in an ex vivo phantom setup [^c6d261a3]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Additionally, it has been shown that measurements taking the three-dimensional irregular structure of kidney stones by means of volumetric CT-based measurements or multiplanar reconstructions into account might be a better predictor of treatment outcome and showed closer agreement with true stone size.

Besides, the detectability and size assessment of small kidney stones using low-dose protocols in the non-contrast imaging of urolithiasis as recommended by current guidelines has been extensively investigated in previous studies. These studies demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy and accurate size assessment of small stones with a diameter of less than 3 mm as compared to high-dose protocols. Pertaining to the detection of kidney stones surrounded by iodine-induced attenuation on VNC, our study showed comparable detectability between the low- and high-dose protocol on VNC ≤ 600HU as well as comparable size measurements. Hence, a further reduction of radiation dose in clinical studies of the imaging of hematuria seams conceivable, since previous in-vivo and ex vivo studies only investigated radiation doses as low as 6 and 10 mGy.

In addition, non-contrast dual-energy CT showed better differentiation of stone composition compared to polyenergetic CT, even when using a low-dose technique. So far, only Lazar et al analysed the effect of stone composition on the detection rate of kidney stones on VNC and reported the best detectability for cystine stones, followed by struvite, brushite, and whewellite stones. On the contrary, we found higher detection rates for calcium (whewellite, weddellite, dahllite, brushite) and xanthine stones (> 80%) as compared to uric acid, cystine and struvite stones (< 80%) without reaching a statistical significance. Besides, DECT type-dependent differences, these discrepancies may also result from the inclusion of larger stones in our analysis.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^b8643286]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Residual fragments after SWL (shock wave lithotripsy), URS (ureteroscopy), or PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy)—risk and management—residual fragments >4 mm in size are associated with higher rates of unplanned secondary procedures than residual fragments ≤4 mm in size. A meta-analysis of 18 studies with over 2,000 patients with residual fragments following SWL, URS, or PCNL reported that patients with >4 mm residual fragments had a 50% greater odds of requiring an unplanned secondary procedure compared to patients with smaller fragments (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.70 to 2.30). For patients undergoing PCNL, clinicians may obtain a CT in the immediate/early post-operative period to assess stone-free status and determine the need for a secondary procedure, and clinicians should offer URS or flexible nephroscopy to retrieve residual fragments after PCNL, even if the decision is ultimately made to defer. URS was found in both an RCT and retrospective cohort study to yield higher stone-free rates compared to SWL for removal of post-PCNL residual fragments. Prior studies supported treating residual fragments >2 mm with flexible nephroscopy to prevent future stone events, and additional studies found significantly higher rates of stone-related events for residual fragments >4 mm after PCNL and higher rates of fragment growth or obstruction for residual fragments >3 mm after PCNL. Clinicians should counsel patients with residual fragments that these fragments may lead to asymptomatic or symptomatic stone passage or may require unplanned intervention or attention.

### Surgical management of kidney and ureteral stones: AUA guideline (2026) part III: evaluation and treatment of patients with kidney and / or ureteral stones [^9ce85d1f]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA Guideline—emerging technologies and patient-centered research priorities in kidney and ureteral stone management emphasize that mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) and suction technologies are introduced, yet in many cases these technologies are still sensitive to the patient’s baseline stone burden, and using high frequency lasers for a “dusting” approach appears inferior to basket extraction. Novel options listed include suction-based retrograde approaches, ultrasonic propulsion burst wave lithotripsy, robotic platforms, hybrid lasers, and the ability to monitor collection system temperature and pressure, and the guideline states these novel technologies and techniques should be rigorously and critically assessed in clinical investigations that employ clearly described, high quality imaging, and adhere to standardized definitions of treatment outcomes. The document also notes that understanding the patient perspective on the treatment of stones is limited with little investigation into shared decision-making, calls for study designs that include patient-reported outcomes such as quality-of-life effects, and highlights that fundamental questions for patients, including how long it will take for a ureteral stone to pass, when to intervene on an asymptomatic stone, how to optimally treat stent discomfort, and whether anything can be done to promote stone passage, remain largely unanswered and should be front-of-mind as future studies assess quality and outcomes.

### Kidney stone disease: risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^f775f079]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract and constitutes a major global health-care problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life and enormous health-care expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and low bone mass. Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH. A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations and guide therapy. Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized, underserved and under-researched. Greater awareness and investments in research, innovation and education are urgently needed.

### Size matters: the width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^57cb67c3]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine how to most accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone using information in the diagnostic non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) and to create predictive models with smaller stone size intervals than previously possible.

Methods

Retrospectively 392 consecutive patients with ureteric stone on NECT were included. Three radiologists independently measured the stone size. Stone location, side, hydronephrosis, CRP, medical expulsion therapy (MET) and all follow-up radiology until stone expulsion or 26 weeks were recorded. Logistic regressions were performed with spontaneous stone passage in 4 weeks and 20 weeks as the dependent variable.

Results

The spontaneous passage rate in 20 weeks was 312 out of 392 stones, 98% in 0–2 mm, 98% in 3 mm, 81% in 4 mm, 65% in 5 mm, 33% in 6 mm and 9% in ≥6.5 mm wide stones.

The stone size and location predicted spontaneous ureteric stone passage. The side and the grade of hydronephrosis only predicted stone passage in specific subgroups.

Conclusion

Spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone can be predicted with high accuracy with the information available in the NECT. We present a prediction method based on stone size and location.

Key Points

• Non - enhanced computed tomography can predict the outcome of ureteral stones.

• Stone size and location are the most important predictors of spontaneous passage.

• Prediction models based on stone width or length and stone location are introduced.

• The observed passage rates for stone size in mm - intervals are reported.

• Clinicians can make better decisions about treatment.

### Disparities in kidney stone disease: a scoping review [^bcb22066]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the available evidence regarding health disparities in kidney stone disease to identify knowledge gaps in this area.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was conducted using PubMed®, Embase® and Scopus® limited to articles published in English from 1971 to 2020. Articles were selected based on their relevance to disparities in kidney stone disease among adults in the United States.

Results

Several large epidemiological studies suggest disproportionate increases in incidence and prevalence of kidney stone disease among women as well as Black and Hispanic individuals in the United States, whereas other studies of comparable size do not report racial and ethnic demographics. Numerous articles describe disparities in imaging utilization, metabolic workup completion, analgesia, surgical intervention, stone burden at presentation, surgical complications, followup, and quality of life based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and place of residence. Differences in urinary parameters based on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status may be explained by both dietary and physiological factors. All articles assessed had substantial risk of selection bias and confounding.

Conclusions

Health disparities are present in many aspects of kidney stone disease. Further research should focus not only on characterization of these disparities but also on interventions to reduce or eliminate them.

### Diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis in children [^3b61a4f5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The incidence of kidney stones in children is increasing. Approximately two-thirds of pediatric cases have a predisposing cause. Children with recurrent kidney stones have an increased higher risk of developing chronic kidney. A complete metabolic workup should be performed. Ultrasound examination is the initial imaging modality recommended for all children with suspected nephrolithiasis. A general dietary recommendation includes high fluid consumption, dietary salt restriction, and increased intake of vegetables and fruits. Depending on size and location of the stone, surgical intervention may be necessary. Multidisciplinary management is key to successful treatment and prevention.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^614c0619]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Kidney damage markers in acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)—Kidney damage is most commonly ascertained by urinary markers and imaging studies; examples include urinary red blood cells/casts, white blood cells/casts, renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells/casts, fine and coarse granular casts, proteinuria, blood markers of tubular syndromes, and imaging abnormalities such as large kidneys, hydronephrosis, cysts, and stones, while small kidneys and size discrepancy indicate CKD; kidney damage is not a criterion for acute kidney injury (AKI) and, in the presence of AKI, does not indicate a separate diagnosis of AKD.
