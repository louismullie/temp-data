## Question

Phlegm in 6 years old below what to give

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to give for phlegm (wet/productive cough) in a child 6 years old and under. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the duration of cough to distinguish acute from chronic. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent evaluation. Next, I will consider the most likely etiologies in this age group and the initial workup. After that, I need to outline evidence-based treatment for chronic wet cough, including antibiotics and when to escalate. Finally, I should review what not to give, address environmental contributors, and set a follow-up plan with clear stop rules and safety netting [^112HKPwG] [^114dv855] [^1174isjq].

> Let me first confirm the duration because management hinges on it: acute cough is less than 4 weeks, whereas chronic cough is more than 4 weeks of daily cough; I initially thought some sources might define chronic as more than 8 weeks, but wait, let me verify — most pediatric guidelines and CHEST consensus define chronic in children as more than 4 weeks, so I should stick with that threshold here [^115g2Tzt] [^112kmsV6].

> Next, I should review red flags that require urgent evaluation: respiratory distress, hypoxia, cyanosis, chest retractions, stridor, persistent fever, failure to thrive, digital clubbing, coughing with feeding or choking (aspiration risk), hemoptysis, immunodeficiency, or known chronic lung disease; if any are present, I need to ensure prompt imaging and specialist referral rather than relying on outpatient therapy alone [^115d6NZV] [^116JQ1cw].

> For acute wet cough under 4 weeks, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most are viral and self-limited; I should confirm that antibiotics are not indicated for acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy children, and symptomatic care is reasonable while watching for deterioration; supportive measures include adequate hydration, saline nose drops with gentle suction for younger children, and honey for those over 1 year if needed for comfort, while avoiding OTC cough/cold medicines in young children due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^1156nhgo] [^113W7t1d] [^112HKPwG].

> For chronic wet cough beyond 4 weeks, I need to ensure I consider protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) as the most common cause in children under 6; the approach is to obtain a chest radiograph and, if age-appropriate, spirometry, then initiate a time-limited, guideline-based antibiotic trial if no specific pointers suggest another diagnosis; I should double-check that this strategy is supported by high-quality evidence showing improved cough resolution with appropriate antibiotics in chronic wet cough [^115d6NZV] [^117JmKmz] [^1137RANQ].

> Now, the antibiotic plan: I should prescribe amoxicillin–clavulanate for 2 weeks targeting typical respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis), aligning with local resistance patterns; if cough persists, I should repeat a second 2-week course; if still present after 4 total weeks, I need to escalate to flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and consider chest CT, while also reassessing for alternative diagnoses such as bronchiectasis, immunodeficiency, or aspiration; wait, I should verify the escalation threshold — yes, CHEST recommends further investigations after 4 weeks of appropriate therapy [^117JmKmz] [^117JYCEn] [^115cKEwH].

> But wait, what if the cough is dry rather than wet, or asthma features emerge? I should confirm that for chronic dry cough with asthma features, a short, time-limited trial of inhaled corticosteroids may be reasonable, whereas for wet cough, ICS are not first-line unless there is concomitant asthma; I need to ensure any empirical trial has a predefined stop rule and reassessment window to avoid prolonged unnecessary therapy [^111P2Hpn] [^1174isjq].

> I need to check what not to give: OTC cough and cold medicines have little to no benefit and carry risks in young children, so they should be avoided; codeine-containing products are contraindicated due to respiratory depression risk; expectorants like guaifenesin lack pediatric evidence; benzonatate is not appropriate under 10 years and is unsafe if chewed; systemic corticosteroids are not beneficial for non-specific cough and may increase hospitalizations in young children; so, I should counsel families to avoid these and focus on etiologic treatment and safe supportive care [^112HKPwG] [^115GqKiQ] [^113DVV9q] [^115HyFYj].

> Next, I should review environmental contributors because they materially affect outcomes: tobacco smoke exposure, indoor pollutants, and allergens can perpetuate cough; I need to ensure we address smoke exposure, optimize hydration, use saline and suction for nasal congestion, and consider a humidifier for comfort; for children over 1 year with bothersome nocturnal cough, a small dose of honey may reduce cough frequency, but I should confirm the child is older than 1 year to avoid botulism risk [^116Zz2be] [^113W7t1d].

> I will now examine the follow-up cadence: for acute cough, reassess if not improving in 2–4 weeks or sooner if red flags arise; for chronic wet cough, reassess at 2 weeks to confirm response to antibiotics, then again at 4 weeks to decide on escalation; I should double-check that this timing aligns with CHEST pathways, which recommend structured reassessment windows and early use of algorithms to improve outcomes [^113nbx4p] [^114dv855].

> Let me consider special scenarios briefly: if pertussis is suspected (paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, whoop), I should treat with a macrolide and isolate appropriately; if bronchiectasis is suspected or confirmed, longer antibiotic courses during exacerbations and eradication strategies for Pseudomonas may be indicated; if cough follows bronchiolitis, I should avoid routine asthma medications unless there is evidence of asthma; these branches require careful clinical judgment and often specialist input [^1156nhgo] [^116rottK] [^1143FvUM].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan is duration-based, etiology-targeted, and safety-focused: acute wet cough gets supportive care without antibiotics; chronic wet cough prompts a chest radiograph, consideration of spirometry if feasible, and a 2-week amoxicillin–clavulanate trial with a second 2-week course if needed, escalating to bronchoscopy and CT after 4 weeks if unresolved; throughout, I should avoid OTC cough/cold meds and codeine, address environmental exposures, and reassess at defined intervals to confirm response and pivot if the course deviates from expected [^115g2Tzt] [^117JmKmz] [^117JYCEn].

For children under 6 with phlegm, **honey is the only recommended option** for symptom relief [^113W7t1d] (if over 1 year old) [^notfound]. OTC cough/cold medicines are **not recommended** due to limited benefit and potential harm [^112HKPwG] [^115ZSRQV]. Use saline nasal sprays/drops with gentle suction for nasal congestion, keep the child hydrated, and avoid irritants like smoke. Seek medical evaluation if cough persists beyond 4 weeks, worsens, or is accompanied by fever, breathing difficulty, or signs of distress [^112kmsV6] [^114dv855].

---

## Recommended treatments and remedies

### Honey (for children over 1 year)

- **Effectiveness**: Honey is the only recommended home remedy for cough in children over 1 year old [^notfound]; it can reduce cough frequency and severity [^notfound].

- **Dosage**: Give 2.5 mL (½ teaspoon) before bedtime; do not use in children under 1 year due to botulism risk [^notfound].

- **Evidence**: Honey is superior to no treatment, diphenhydramine, and placebo, and comparable to dextromethorphan for symptom relief [^113W7t1d].

---

### Saline nasal sprays or drops

Saline sprays or drops are **effective** for loosening mucus and relieving nasal congestion, making breathing easier. Administration is 1–2 sprays or drops into each nostril, followed by gentle suction with a bulb syringe if needed.

---

### Hydration

Hydration helps thin mucus, making it easier to expel; encourage **adequate fluid intake** with water, breast milk, or formula.

---

### Environmental modifications

Environmental modifications include using a cool-mist humidifier to maintain **optimal humidity** and reduce mucus thickness, and avoiding irritants such as tobacco smoke, strong perfumes, and pollutants that can worsen symptoms [^116Zz2be].

---

## Medications to avoid

Several medications are **not recommended** for children under 6 years old due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects:

| **Medication** | **Reason for avoidance** |
|-|-|
| OTC cough suppressants (dextromethorphan, codeine) | - Limited efficacy <br/> - Potential serious side effects (respiratory depression, sedation) [^112HKPwG] [^115ZSRQV] |
| Expectorants (guaifenesin) | - Limited evidence of efficacy <br/> - Potential adverse effects [^113DVV9q] |
| Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) | - Minimal efficacy <br/> - Sedation and other adverse effects [^112THgLa] [^112HKPwG] |
| Decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine) | - Limited efficacy <br/> - Potential cardiovascular side effects [^115ZSRQV] |

---

## When to seek medical evaluation

Medical evaluation is **recommended** if any of the following occur:

- **Duration**: Cough persists beyond 4 weeks [^112kmsV6] or worsens over time [^114Jz5tR].

- **Respiratory distress**: Signs of difficulty breathing, wheezing, or chest retractions [^117PNXse].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, lethargy, poor appetite, or weight loss [^112Tk6ok].

- **Underlying conditions**: History of asthma, recurrent pneumonia, or immunodeficiency [^114Jz5tR].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Honey**: Recommended for children over 1 year old with acute cough [^113W7t1d] [^112HKPwG].

- **OTC medications**: Not recommended for children under 6 years old due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects [^112HKPwG] [^115ZSRQV].

- **Hydration and environmental modifications**: Encouraged to alleviate symptoms [^116Zz2be].

---

## Conclusion

For children under 6 years old with phlegm, **honey (if over 1 year old), saline nasal sprays, hydration, and environmental modifications** are the primary recommended interventions. OTC cough and cold medications are not recommended due to limited efficacy and potential adverse effects. Medical evaluation is advised if symptoms persist or worsen.

Conclusions

The presence of an appendicolith does not affect the nonoperative therapeutic effect of APA in young children. In the absence of generalized peritonitis or apparent intestinal obstruction, APA can be managed nonoperatively without immediate appendectomy in children less than 3 years old.

The management of cough in children should be etiologically based. This requires that all children with cough should be carefully evaluated and managed differently than adults because the etiologic factors and treatment in children are significantly different than that in adults. In all children with cough, exacerbation factors should be sought and intervention options for cessation advised or initiated. Parental expectations and specific concerns should also be sought and addressed.

### Chronic cough due to acute bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1156nhgo]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered.

Methods

Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as "cough", "acute bronchitis", and "acute viral respiratory infection".

Results

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period.

Conclusion

Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.

Background

Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a rare complication of deep venous thromboembolism that can have life-threatening consequences. It is more commonly reported in the adult population, and rarely in the pediatric population, especially in a healthy child.

Case Report

We report a case of a healthy 7-year-old girl who presented with right leg pain and fever, found to have a thrombus involving her inferior vena cava and right lower extremity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case illustrates the importance of early recognition and a multimodal approach to treatment of phlegmasia cerulea dolens.

Pediatric chronic cough — empirical therapy use and bias notes that the majority of children in all the studies received treatment specific for the underlying cause rather than an empirical approach; in some situations, an empirical trial is required, such as using inhaled corticosteroids when the cough is dry and objective testing cannot be undertaken in a young child. Ascribing causes for the cough has an inherent high risk of bias related to the placebo and period effects, and these risks of bias can be reduced by limiting the time frame in which response to treatment is considered when a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is not undertaken.

Definitions, causes, and diagnosis of chronic cough

Chronic pediatric cough is generally defined as a cough lasting for > 4 weeks. The exception is the BTS, which defines chronic pediatric cough as lasting for > 8 weeks, while acknowledging that there is a gray area between acute and chronic, and that 'relentlessly progressive' cough should be investigated after 3 weeks. Certain pediatric cough guidelines recommend characterizing chronic cough into wet/productive or dry, because this distinction affects diagnosis and treatment pathways, with wet cough often having an infectious etiology. Guidelines also make the distinction between 'specific' cough, which is associated with a condition recognized to cause cough, thereby forming the basis for specific treatment, and 'non-specific' cough, in which no underlying condition has yet been found.

The most common causes of chronic pediatric cough are generally thought to be protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB), asthma, and post-infectious cough. In a study of children with acute respiratory illness and cough presenting at an emergency department, 20.4% had persistent cough 4 weeks later; 6.6% were subsequently diagnosed with PBB, and 4.3% with a new chronic respiratory disease. PBB is most common in children aged < 6 years, and, in many cases, onset of symptoms occurs before the age of 1 year. Less common, but more serious, are lung disorders (such as cystic fibrosis) and immune deficiency. Habit cough is a repetitive, chronic cough with no identified underlying organic reason; habit cough is more common in older children, peaking at around 10 years of age. Chronic cough may also be caused or exacerbated by exposure to airborne irritants, such as tobacco smoke, allergens, and traffic pollution.

With regard to diagnosis, chronic cough in children should be seen as a symptom of an underlying disease and, therefore, should be subject to careful and systematic evaluation for the presence of specific diagnostic indicators. Diagnosis should involve a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, chest X-ray, and, if the child is old enough and cooperative, spirometry. Sputum cultures should be attempted in cases of wet chronic cough; further investigations (such as bronchoscopy and serological laboratory assessments) may be required, after giving consideration to patient discomfort and the potential for adverse events. Habit cough can be diagnosed from clinical characteristics; the key diagnostic feature is that coughing stops when the child is asleep.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^112uZNfw]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric chronic cough — investigation timing and age-related testing considerations: In the management of chronic cough (ie, cough of more than 4 weeks' duration), investigations are undertaken to confirm or rule out specific causes, but most young children are unable to generate reliable data from pulmonary function tests (such as spirometry and AHR challenges) until the age of 6 years in most clinical laboratories, and chest CT scans are associated with higher adverse events in young children (future cancer) and may require a general anesthetic in children aged < 3 years.

Guideline scope and evidence strength note that, compared to the 2006 guideline, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of managing chronic cough in children, reflected in Grades within each recommendation, and that 16 recommendations are Grade 1.

Algorithmic management and spirometry feasibility: High-quality evidence described that using children-specific cough management protocols improves clinical outcomes, and randomized controlled trial findings were consistent with those derived from cohort studies. The approach when using a chronic cough algorithm is dependent on the presence of cough characteristics, clinical history, physical examination, chest radiograph (CXR) and spirometry findings. Spirometry can usually be reliably performed in children aged > 6 years and in some children > 3 years if trained pediatric personnel are utilized.

### Nonoperative management of appendiceal phlegmon or abscess in children less than 3 years of age [^1172VBT5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Fifty children less than 3 years old underwent attempted initial nonoperative management during the study period. There were 29 boys and 21 girls, with an average age of 24.60 ± 8.49 months (range 5–35 months). The mean duration of symptoms was 8.58 ± 5.49 days. The most common symptoms were fever in 48 patients (96%), abdominal pain in 42 (84%), vomiting in 25 (50%), and diarrhea in 24 (48%). Tenderness was found in all children; 30 of them (60%) also presented localized peritonitis. The WBC counts and CRP levels were 19.20 ± 6.37 × 10 9 /L and 100.27 ± 74.73 mg/L, respectively. Mean inflammatory areas of APA were 20.08 ± 14.77 cm 2. Two children underwent US-guided percutaneous drainage. One child with an appendicolith underwent early appendectomy because of aggravated intestinal obstruction, while two children without an appendicolith required subsequent readmission because of recurrent pain within 30 days of admission. They responded to antibiotics with complete resolution clinically and were discharged 5 days later. The hospital LOS was 13.24 ± 5.41 days and the overall success rate for nonoperative management of APA was 94% (47/50).

Among 50 children, 46 (92%) were performed with admission US; 45 (90%) were examined with CT scans. Based on the presence or absence of an appendicolith on admission US or CT imaging, the patients were categorized into two groups: appendicolith group [n = 27] and no appendicolith group [n = 23]. A summary of patient characteristics is displayed in Table 1. No difference existed between the appendicolith group and the no appendicolith group when comparing age, duration of symptoms, pain, fever, vomiting, localized peritonitis, WBC, and mean inflammatory areas. The rate of diarrhea (63.0 vs. 30.4%) and CRP levels (126.83 ± 83.46 vs. 69.10 ± 48.21) were higher in the appendicolith group than the no appendicolith group (P < .05). The overall success rates (96.3 vs. 91.3%) and LOS (14.26 ± 5.55 vs.12.04 ± 5.09) for nonoperative treatment in the appendicolith group and the no appendicolith group were similar without statistical significance.

Pediatric chronic wet cough without specific pointers — among children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks duration) wet or productive cough unrelated to an underlying disease and without any other specific cough pointers, when the wet cough persists after 2 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we recommend treatment with an additional 2 weeks of the appropriate antibiotic(s) (Grade 1C), and when it persists after 4 weeks of appropriate antibiotics, we suggest that further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures and sensitivities with or without chest CT) be undertaken (Grade 2B).

Summary of evidence and interpretation — study limitations and outcome needs: The systematic review was limited by the small number of studies, with all but one study conducted in major hospitals; large multicenter studies particularly in primary care will be required to build the evidence base to inform management outside of major hospitals or tertiary referral centers, and when cough is used as a study outcome, the use of validated outcome measures would improve the quality of studies, as the lack of the use of validated cough outcomes and a priori definitions are major limitations of many chronic cough studies in children.

Evaluation principles in children with chronic cough: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough (Level 1B). Initial evaluation entails performing a thorough clinical assessment, a chest radiograph (CXR) and/or spirometry, followed by deciding whether any investigations and/or treatment are appropriate and/or required.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111zUR3b]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Wet or productive cough is common in children with chronic cough. We formulated recommendations based on systematic reviews related to the management of chronic wet cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on two key questions: (1) how effective are antibiotics in improving the resolution of cough? If so, what antibiotic should be used and for how long? and (2) when should children be referred for further investigations?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol for systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and GRADE framework (the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus for the recommendations/suggestions made.

Results

Combining data from the systematic reviews, we found high-quality evidence in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include the recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some, but not all, aspects of the management of chronic wet cough in specialist settings. However, further studies (particularly in primary health) are required.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^1161vzrb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study, comprising a literature review together with expert opinion obtained via an online survey, has highlighted a number of issues relating to the global management of pediatric cough. In particular, while there are numerous regional guidelines for the management of pediatric cough (16 were listed in the survey), there is no established international guideline for acute or chronic pediatric cough.

There is also a lack of consensus as to what defines a pediatric patient in relation to cough. In guidelines, 'pediatric' refers to patients aged up to 12–18 years, and among the international experts, 'pediatric' could refer to patients aged up to 10–21 years. The age of patients is an important consideration in their management as it determines whether pediatric or adult guidelines are used, impacting pediatric-specific issues and risk–benefit ratios. For example, whereas respiratory function tests are standard investigations in adults, data generated from such tests may be unreliable in young children. The optimal management of cough may also vary between babies, toddlers, and older children due to differing cough etiologies with age; a point that is not fully addressed by current guidelines. Furthermore, while all guidelines separated pediatric cough into acute and chronic, there were discrepancies in the duration of cough used to define these terms. Acute cough definitions ranged from < 2–3 weeks in guidelines and from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks among experts; the equivalent definitions for chronic cough were > 4–8 weeks and > 2–8 weeks. Since acute and chronic cough are managed differently, these varying definitions mean that pediatric patients in different regions will receive differing standards of care for cough.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117E6Atf]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Chronic cough in children — conclusions and management approach: Child-specific cough guidelines should be used for children aged ≤ 14 years and these differ from adults. All children with chronic cough should have a thorough clinical review to identify pointers suggestive of an underlying respiratory and/or systemic illness. Cough in children should be treated based on etiology and there is no evidence for using medications for symptomatic relief of cough. If medications are used, children must be followed up and medications ceased if there is no effect on the cough within an expected timeframe. Irrespective of diagnosis, environmental influences should be discussed and managed accordingly. Cough negatively impacts the QoL of both the child and parents; education regarding when to look into and explore parental expectations and fears are often valuable in the management of cough in children.

### Antibiotics for prolonged wet cough in children [^1137RANQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cough is a frequent symptom presenting to doctors. The most common cause of childhood chronic (greater than fours weeks' duration) wet cough is protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) in some settings, although other more serious causes can also present this way. Timely and effective management of chronic wet or productive cough improves quality of life and clinical outcomes. Current international guidelines suggest a course of antibiotics is the first treatment of choice in the absence of signs or symptoms specific to an alternative diagnosis. This review sought to clarify the current evidence to support this recommendation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of antibiotics in treating children with prolonged wet cough (excluding children with bronchiectasis or other known underlying respiratory illness) and to assess risk of harm due to adverse events.

Search Methods

We undertook an updated search (from 2008 onwards) using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, trials registries, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest searches were performed in September 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with a placebo or a control group in children with chronic wet cough. We excluded cluster and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as recommended by Cochrane. We reviewed results of searches against predetermined criteria for inclusion. Two independent review authors selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors of eligible studies for further information as needed. We analysed data as 'intention to treat'.
Main Results

We identified three studies as eligible for inclusion in the review. Two were in the previous review and one new study was included. We considered the older studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias whereas we judged the newly included study at low risk of bias. The studies varied in treatment duration (from 7 to 14 days) and the antibiotic used (two studies used amoxicillin/clavulanate acid and one used erythromycin). We included 190 children (171 completed), mean ages ranged from 21 months to six years, in the meta-analyses. Analysis of all three trials (190 children) found that treatment with antibiotics reduced the proportion of children not cured at follow-up (primary outcome measure) (odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31, using intention-to -treat analysis), which translated to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). We identified no significant heterogeneity (for both fixed-effect and random-effects model the I² statistic was 0%). Two older trials assessed progression of illness, defined by requirement for further antibiotics (125 children), which was significantly lower in the antibiotic group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.34; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5). All three trials (190 children) reported adverse events, which were not significantly increased in the antibiotic group compared to the control group (OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.69). We assessed the quality of evidence GRADE rating as moderate for all outcome measures, except adverse events which we assessed as low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests antibiotics are efficacious for the treatment of children with chronic wet cough (greater than four weeks) with an NNTB of three. However, antibiotics have adverse effects and this review reported only uncertainty as to the risk of increased adverse effects when they were used in this setting. The inclusion of a more robust study strengthened the previous Cochrane review and its results.

Imaging risk considerations in pediatric chronic cough note that radiation risk from CT should be weighed carefully: "children have 10 times increased risk compared to middle aged adults" and "For a single CT examination of 200 mA, lifetime attributable cancer mortality risk is 1 in 1000 to 2500 for a 2.5-year-old child". Accordingly, chest and sinus CTs "should rarely be performed unless other symptoms are present and ideally with prior consultation with a pediatric respiratory specialist".

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'.'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'.In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

### Cough medicines for children-time for a reality check [^115ZSRQV]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Cough medicines have been in use for over a century to treat the common and troublesome, but often helpful, symptoms of cough in children. They contain various combinations of "anti-tussive" drugs including opioids, antihistamines, herbal preparations, mucolytics, decongestants and expectorants. Whilst theoretically attractive for symptom relief when children are suffering, as time has passed these popular over the counter medicines have been shown to lack efficacy, delay more serious underlying diagnoses, and can cause complications and sometimes death. This has resulted in clinician concerns, a citizen petition to the American Food and Drug Association in 2007, some self-regulation from manufacturers and escalating restrictions on their use from regulatory agencies across the world over the last twenty years. This article will review the protective role of cough, juxtapose the conflicting treatment goals of suppressing a dry cough and promoting expectoration for a wet cough, consider the evidence basis for prescribing cough medicines in comparison to other more specific treatments such as for asthma [beta agonists] or infection [antibiotics], regulatory interventions, and conclude with the view that over counter cough medicines should not be used in children, especially young children.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and initial threshold: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Because cough can spontaneously resolve within 4 weeks, the guideline does not advocate using medications or investigating all children at the 4-week timepoint other than with simple tests such as spirometry and a chest radiograph. Supporting the need for careful assessment, a serious potentially progressive underlying respiratory illness was documented in 18% of 346 children in a multicenter study using a cough algorithm, and new serious chronic lung disease was found in up to 30.8% of children with acute cough persisting > 4 weeks at a specialist hospital.

For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms (Grade 1B), we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough (Grade 1A), we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough (Grade 1A), and we recommend that a chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre and post β2 agonist) be undertaken (Grade 1B). Although spirometry and chest radiograph (CXR) are suggested, neither are sensitive but both are specific, with a study of 326 children demonstrating an infinite positive likelihood ratio for both tests.

Case presentation

A male patient, 2 years old, was admitted to the hospital on May 21, 2018 due a sustained fever of over 6 consecutive days, with his highest body temperature reaching 39.0 °C, which peaked once or twice per day, accompanied by coughing, phlegm, and shortness of breath. His local hospital diagnosed him with "acute upper respiratory tract infection" and prescribed him 5 days of Chinese herb medicine; however, his temperature was not alleviated. After entering our hospital, his chest X-ray showed that both of his lungs had an increased thickened texture. With possible inflammation suspected, the boy was then admitted as a pneumonia patient. Prior to the onset of the illness, the child's spirit was normal, with no irritability or fatigue. His dietary intake was also normal, with normal appearing defecation. His medical history showed that he was a rather healthy baby, G1P1 (Gravida 1, Para 1) full-term delivery. He was breastfed and had normal growth and development for his age, and his parents were also healthy. As a child, he had no history of food or drug allergies reported, and no oral diuretics or catharsis drugs were taken previously. However, the child had a history of spontaneous night-sweats and enuresis according to his parents.

Physical examination

Body temperature 37.0 °C, pulse 125 beats/min, breathing 25 breaths/min, blood pressure 95/65 mmHg, weight 10.5 kg, height 92 cm, slightly underweight (boy standard weight: 11.2–14.0 kg). Normal reflexes without shortness of breath or cyanosis. No rash, no swelling of superficial lymph nodes, pharyngeal hyperaemia. Bilateral tonsils were not enlarged. Rough tracheal sounds with phlegm rales were heard. Heart and abdominal examinations were normal. Extremities and spine were normal, physiological reflexes existed, and pathological reflexes were not elicited.

### Management of children with chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1122TkjS]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — management of chronic wet cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis in children: In children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic (> 4 weeks' duration) wet/productive cough, there is high-quality evidence that using appropriate antibiotics improves cough resolution, and further investigations (eg, flexible bronchoscopy, chest CT scans, immunity tests) should be undertaken when specific cough pointers (eg, digital clubbing) are present. When the wet cough does not improve following 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, there is moderate-quality evidence that further investigations should be considered to look for an underlying disease. New recommendations include recognition of the clinical diagnostic entity of protracted bacterial bronchitis.

### Chronic cough in children [^115yjhEg]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic cough has been variably defined as a cough lasting longer than 3, 4 or 8 weeks. Many post viral or pertussis like illnesses are associated with prolonged coughing that resolves over time. Management involves first trying to make a diagnosis and identify the presence of any underlying condition. Targeted treatments can then be employed. Trials of treatments are often used to make a diagnosis. Because natural resolution of cough is so common any trial of treatment to confirm a diagnosis should be time limited and the treatment only restarted if the coughing returns. Only a small proportion of children with an isolated non-specific dry cough have asthma and care is needed not to over diagnose asthma. Children with chronic wet cough may have protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) that responds to a full course of antibiotics. Children with PBB failing to respond to treatment or with specific pointers should be investigated for specific causes of suppurative lung disease.

### Therapeutic principles and unmet needs in the treatment of cough in pediatric patients: review and expert survey [^113US1kb]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cough is not standardized across the world. International experts use a variety of different guidelines, and have diverse opinions on how to define aspects of pediatric cough. Whereas pediatric cough guidelines largely align with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough, there is limited evidence-based guidance for the management of acute cough. From an international perspective, there is a need for harmonization of pediatric cough management, and the development of standard guidelines suitable for all regions and patient circumstances. However, the development of such guidelines will require data gaps to be filled. In particular, clinical studies are needed to clarify the efficacy and safety of current acute cough therapies, and to better characterize subpopulations of pediatric patients with cough.

Definitions and diagnosis of pediatric cough

Participants suggested a range of ages to define 'pediatric' cough, most commonly ≤ 18 years (9/18; 50%) or ≤ 16 years (3/18; 17%), with ≤ 10, ≤ 12, ≤ 15, ≤ 17, and ≤ 21 years suggested by 1 participant each (and 1 participant preferred not to say). Definitions provided for acute cough in children ranged from < 3–5 days to < 6 weeks (or no specified duration), most commonly < 2 weeks (Fig. 1 a). Definitions for chronic cough in children ranged from > 2 weeks to > 8 weeks, most commonly > 4 weeks/ > 30 days (Fig. 1 b).

Fig. 1
Definitions of acute and chronic pediatric cough according to international experts (n = 18). a Or > 30 days. Questions were open-ended

Almost all participants (17/18; 94%) said that they distinguish between wet/productive and dry cough, for reasons including to help determine the cause and diagnosis, and to inform cough management. One participant said that they do not make this differentiation, since "it is not associated with the cause" of cough.

Regarding clinical guidelines, 11/18 participants (61%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in adults, 12 (67%) said that their country had national clinical guidelines for the treatment of cough in pediatrics, 4 (22%) had no national guidelines, and 1 (6%) did not know if their country had guidelines. Ten of 17 participants (59%) said that they used a guideline for the diagnosis of pediatric cough, and 12 (71%) said that they used a guideline for the treatment of pediatric cough. Specific guidelines were named from the following organizations and countries: American Academy of Pediatrics; American Thoracic Society; Australia's guideline; Austria's guideline; BTS; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; ERS (cough and protracted bacterial bronchitis); Germany's national guideline; Indian Academy of Pediatrics; Malaysia's guideline; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; Serbia's national guideline; Slovenia's "cough in children" guideline; and two reviews from the United States.

### Clinically diagnosing pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112QvZaw]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children.

Methods

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough?

Results

In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1–37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0–45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4–86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0–18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5–77.3]).

Conclusions

In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3–8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions.

Systemic corticosteroids in pediatric cough: We did not find any RCTs on use of oral steroids for non-specific cough in children. In cough associated with pertussis, dexamethasone provides no significant benefit for the symptomatic relief of cough, and in wheezy children without asthma, one RCT in 200 children (1–5 years) found that oral steroids conferred no benefit but were instead associated with a non-significant increase in hospitalizations (P = .058).

Treatment of chronic cough

The management of specific chronic pediatric cough should be based on the etiology of the cough, as symptoms will resolve if the underlying condition is successfully managed. For example, children with PBB should receive antibiotics, and children with asthma may benefit from inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.

For non-specific chronic pediatric dry cough, a treatment attempt with inhaled corticosteroids may be appropriate; for non-specific chronic wet/productive cough, antibiotics may be trialed. While antibiotics are considered efficacious in the treatment of children with chronic wet cough, the indication for antibiotics should be checked to avoid unnecessary exposure to possible side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and rash, and antibiotic resistance. For children exposed to airborne irritants such as tobacco smoke, allergens, or home pollutants, attempts should be made to remove the child from this environment (i.e. stopping the child and/or their parents from smoking).

Numerous algorithms are available to assist in the treatment of chronic pediatric cough, and the use of such algorithms improves clinical outcomes.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111nAZNM]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms to general practitioners. The objective of this article is to collate the pediatric components of the CHEST chronic cough guidelines that have recently updated the 2006 guidelines to assist general and specialist medical practitioners in the evaluation and management of children who present with chronic cough.

Methods

We reviewed all current CHEST Expert Cough Panel's statements and extracted recommendations and suggestions relating to children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration). Additionally, we undertook systematic reviews to update other sections we considered relevant and important.

Results

The eight recent CHEST guidelines relevant to children, based on systematic reviews, reported some high-quality evidence in the management of chronic cough in children (eg, use of algorithms and management of wet/productive cough using appropriate antibiotics). However, much evidence is still inadequate, particularly in the management of non-specific cough in the community.

Conclusions

The recommendations and suggestions related to the management of chronic cough in the pediatric age group have been based upon high-quality systematic reviews and are summarized in this article. Compared to the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence for some aspects of the management of chronic cough in children. However, further studies particularly in primary health care are required.

Pediatric chronic cough — definition and general approach: For children aged ≤ 14 years, we suggest defining chronic cough as the presence of daily cough of more than 4 weeks in duration. For children aged ≤ 14 years, we recommend that (a) common etiologies of chronic cough in adults are not presumed to be common causes in children and (b) their age and the clinical settings (eg, country and region) are taken into consideration when evaluating and managing their chronic cough. For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough, we recommend using pediatric-specific cough management protocols or algorithms, we recommend taking a systematic approach (such as using a validated guideline) to determine the cause of the cough, and we recommend basing the management or testing algorithm on cough characteristics and the associated clinical history such as using specific cough pointers like presence of productive/wet cough.

When participants were asked under what circumstances they perform further diagnostic investigations concerning the cause of pediatric cough (beyond patient history and physical examination), the most common response was in patients with "chronic cough" (10/16 participants; 63%), particularly if not responding to usual treatments, for repeated episodes, or in the presence of other disease symptoms. Other conditions spontaneously mentioned by one or more participants that would warrant further diagnostic investigations were allergy, aspiration/inhaled foreign body, chronic pulmonary disease, cyanosis, newborns coughing during feeding, pertussis, respiratory distress, and severe infection/pneumonia. When asked to indicate the approximate percentage of their pediatric patients with cough in which specific investigations were instigated in the past 6 months, median percentages were 31–40% for spirometry, 21–30% for chest X-ray and allergy testing, 11–20% for sputum culture, 1–10% for serology and computerized tomography scan, and 0–10% for bronchoscopy. One participant noted that fewer children with cough were referred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and no pulmonary function tests were carried out due to the potential for aerosol generation.

Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in pediatric chronic cough — cutoffs, variability, and limited standalone utility: Device and host factors affect interpretation, including "limits of agreement is up to 10 ppb". Using American Thoracic Society cutoffs for eosinophilic inflammation, "levels > 35 ppb in children aged ≤ 12 years; > 50 ppb when > 12 years", a review found " ≥ 5% of healthy people from non-Caucasian ethnic groups" above these ranges. Accordingly, "using FENO levels alone for diagnosing and managing children with chronic cough without other cough pointers is yet to be clearly defined", and "The value of FENO levels in the absence of symptoms of classical asthma… is yet to be defined for the assessment of chronic cough in children".

### The child with an incessant dry cough [^115zJFEr]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Cough is a forced expulsive manoeuvre, usually against a closed glottis and is associated with a characteristic sound that is easily recognised. It is a protective reflex against aspiration and to clear airway secretions. In children cough is extremely common and when prolonged it is often a cause for concern for parents, resulting in a high proportion of attendances to primary and secondary care. There are many causes of cough which may be divided into productive or non-productive in character. As there are many guidelines for the management of productive or 'wet' cough the focus of this paper will be to discuss some of the main causes, investigations and management options for 'dry' cough. Dry coughing suggests airway irritation and or inflammation (without excessive extra secretion formation) and is predominantly the result of an acute viral respiratory infection that may last up to 3–4 weeks.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1139mcDM]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Using management algorithms or pathways potentially improves clinical outcomes. We undertook systematic reviews to examine various aspects in the generic approach (use of cough algorithms and tests) to the management of chronic cough in children (aged ≤ 14 years) based on key questions (KQs) using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format.

Methods

We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol for the systematic reviews and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients' values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain the final grading.

Results

Combining data from systematic reviews addressing five KQs, we found high-quality evidence that a systematic approach to the management of chronic cough improves clinical outcomes. Although there was evidence from several pathways, the highest evidence was from the use of the CHEST approach. However, there was no or little evidence to address some of the KQs posed.

Conclusions

Compared with the 2006 Cough Guidelines, there is now high-quality evidence that in children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes, and cough management or testing algorithms should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. A chest radiograph and, when age appropriate, spirometry (pre- and post-β 2 agonist) should be undertaken. Other tests should not be routinely performed and undertaken in accordance with the clinical setting and the child's clinical symptoms and signs (eg, tests for tuberculosis when the child has been exposed).

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115tTXNH]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

### Aerodigestive approach to pediatric chronic cough [^117643PU]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is defined as cough lasting more than 4 weeks in children aged 14 years or older. Normal children, without pathophysiology, can cough up to more than 30 times a day. When cough occurs pathologically, it is often more often and can be divided into specific and nonspecific cough types. Inputs from otolaryngology, pulmonary medicine, and gastroenterology, along with other specialties in an aerodigestive team setting, allow a team approach to consider a wide variety of causes of cough and coordinate diagnostic procedures with treatment.

### Yardstick for managing cough, part 2: in children [^111U7Anr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nationwide statistics in the United States and Australia reveal that cough of undifferentiated duration is the most common complaint for which patients of all ages seek medical care in the ambulatory setting. Management of chronic cough is one of the most common reasons for new patient visits to respiratory specialists. Because symptomatic cough is such a common problem and so much has been learned about how to diagnose and treat cough of all durations but especially chronic cough, this 2-part yardstick has been written to review in a practical way the evidence-based guidelines most of which have been developed from high-quality systematic reviews on how best to manage cough of all durations in adults, adolescents, and children. Chronic cough in children is often benign and self-limiting. Using established and validated protocols and specific pointers (clues in history, findings on examination) can aid the clinician in identifying causes when present and improve outcomes. In this manuscript, part 2 of the 2-part series, we provide evidence-based, expert opinion recommendations on the management of chronic cough in the pediatric patient (< 14 years of age).

### Haemoptysis caused by the absence of the right pulmonary vein in an 11-year-old child: a case report and literature review [^113UjChN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

An 11-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of intermittent cough and haemoptysis for two months. Haemoptysis presented as the expectoration of bloody sputum, which lasted for 2 days, 4–5 times/day. No other symptoms such as epistaxis, fever, tachypnoea, wheezing, dyspnoea, dizziness, headache, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting or bloody stool were described during the disease course. Eight days before admission, symptoms of cough worsened to more than 10 episodes per day, accompanied by a runny nose, nasal obstruction, yellow phlegm and sometimes blood in the sputum. Blood routine test, biochemistry and coagulation function tests at the local hospital revealed no abnormalities. Chest CT at the local hospital revealed cystic and low attenuation lesions, patchy and flocculent shadows in the right lung, partial bronchial dilatation and interlobular septal thickening of the right lung. In addition, small nodules were observed in the middle lobe of the right lung and lower lobe of the left lung. The boundaries of the nodules were clear, and the maximum diameter was approximately 0.4 cm. The local hospital considered the diagnosis to be "interstitial pneumonia and bronchiectasis with infection". After the anti-infective and haemostatic treatment, the symptoms of cough and haemoptysis were not relieved. Therefore, this patient was admitted to our hospital for further treatment.

The patient was hospitalized for pneumonia once 3 years ago, but the specific diagnosis, treatment process and examination results could not be provided. The patient had a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (> 7 times/year) in the past year. A decreased activity tolerance was reported in 1.5 years. The history of foreign body aspiration, direct contact with tuberculosis patients or hereditary haemorrhagic diseases prior to illness onset was denied. The patient was a full-term baby with a birth weight of 2200 g. There was no birth history of asphyxia or rescue. The growth and development of this patient were similar to those of her peers. She had no family history of similar conditions and denied a family history of genetic or vascular anomalies. Her mother did not have regular antenatal examinations during pregnancy and could not provide the results of prenatal ultrasound.

### Use of management pathways or algorithms in children with chronic cough: systematic reviews [^117JktcY]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Use of appropriate cough pathways or algorithms may reduce the morbidity of chronic cough, lead to earlier diagnosis of chronic underlying illness, and reduce unnecessary costs and medications. We undertook three systematic reviews to examine three related key questions (KQ): In children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), KQ1, do cough management protocols (or algorithms) improve clinical outcomes? KQ2, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the duration and/or severity? KQ3, should the cough management or testing algorithm differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history?

Methods

We used the CHEST expert cough panel's protocol. Two authors screened searches and selected and extracted data. Only systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and cohort studies published in English were included.

Results

Data were presented in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses flowcharts and summary tabulated. Nine studies were included in KQ1 (RCT = 1; cohort studies = 7) and eight in KQ3 (RCT = 2; cohort = 6), but none in KQ2.

Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that in children aged ?14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks' duration), the use of cough management protocols (or algorithms) improves clinical outcomes and cough management or the testing algorithm should differ depending on the associated characteristics of the cough and clinical history. It remains uncertain whether the management or testing algorithm should depend on the duration or severity of chronic cough. Pending new data, chronic cough in children should be defined as > 4 weeks' duration and children should be systematically evaluated with treatment targeted to the underlying cause irrespective of the cough severity.

### Effectiveness of a chronic cough management algorithm at the transitional stage from acute to chronic cough in children: a multicenter, nested, single-blind, randomised controlled trial [^114dAG4g]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Chronic (lasting at least 4 weeks) cough in children is an important cause of morbidity. An algorithmic approach to the management of coughs in children evaluated in observational studies and a randomised controlled trial (RCT) enrolled children referred with median cough duration of 16 weeks to specialist centres. We investigated whether applying an evidence-based cough management algorithm in non-specialist settings earlier, once cough persisted for more than 4 weeks, improved cough resolution compared with usual care.

Methods

We undertook a multicentre, single-blind RCT nested within a prospective cohort study of children (< 15 years) in Australia presenting to three primary care or three hospital emergency departments with an acute respiratory illness with cough. Children were excluded if they had a known diagnosis of an underlying chronic medical condition (excluding asthma) or had an immunosuppressive illness or were taking immunomodulating drugs for more than 2 weeks in the preceding 30 days, or had severe symptoms requiring inpatient hospitalisation. Children were followed up for 8 weeks; those with a persistent cough at day 28 were randomly assigned to the cough management algorithm or to usual care. Randomisation was stratified by reason for presentation, study site, and cough duration (4 weeks to < 6 weeks vs ≥ 6 weeks) using computer-generated permuted blocks (block size of four) with a 1:1 allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of children with cough resolution at day 56 (defined as resolved if the child did not cough for at least 3 days and nights since day 28 or a more than 75% reduction in their average day and night cough score). Absolute risk differences (RD absolute) were calculated by modified intention-to-treat analysis (ITT). This trial is registered with the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000132549.

Findings

Between July 7, 2015, and Oct 31, 2018, 1018 children were screened, 509 were enrolled in the cohort study, and of 115 children in the ITT analysis, 57 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 58 to the control group. Children had a median age of 1·6 years (IQR 1·0–4·5); 45 (39%) of 115 were Indigenous, and 59 (51%) were boys. By day 56, 33 (58%) of 57 children in the intervention group achieved cough resolution compared with 23 (40%) 58 in the control group; cough resolution was unknown in 12 (21%) of 57 children receiving the intervention and in 13 (22%) of 58 receiving the control. The RD absolute assuming children with an unknown cough outcome were still coughing at day 56 was 18·3% (95% CI 0·3–36·2); the number needed-to-treat for benefit was five (95% CI 3–364); the adjusted odds ratio was 1·5 (95% CI 1·3–1·6), favouring the intervention group.

Interpretation

This study suggests an evidence-based cough management algorithm improves cough resolution in community-based children in the early phases of chronic cough. However, larger studies to confirm these findings in primary care are required.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112HKPwG]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications and pediatric acute/chronic cough: Manufacturers re-labeled these OTC products "do not use in children under 4 years of age", and in 2018 FDA labeling for prescription opioid cough and cold medicines was changed to limit their use to adults ≥ 18 years. OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Levofloxacin in 5% dextrose (levofloxacin) [^115g7QKa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What is levofloxacin?

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used in adults age 18 years or older to treat certain infections caused by certain germs called bacteria. These bacterial infections include:

nosocomial pneumonia
community acquired pneumonia
acute sinus infection
acute worsening of chronic bronchitis
skin infections, complicated and uncomplicated
chronic prostate infection
urinary tract infections, complicated and uncomplicated
acute kidney infection (pyelonephritis)
inhalation anthrax
plague

Studies of levofloxacin for use in the treatment of plague and anthrax were done in animals only, because plague and anthrax could not be studied in people.

Levofloxacin should not be used in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, or acute bacterial sinusitis if there are other treatment options available.

Levofloxacin is also used to treat children who are 6 months of age or older and may have breathed in anthrax germs, have plague, or been exposed to plague germs.

It is not known if levofloxacin is safe and effective in children under 6 months of age.

The safety and effectiveness in children treated with levofloxacin for more than 14 days is not known.

Who should not take levofloxacin? Do not take levofloxacin if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to an antibiotic known as a fluoroquinolone, or if you are allergic to levofloxacin or any of the ingredients in levofloxacin in 5% dextrose injection. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in levofloxacin in 5% dextrose injection.
