## Question

clonazepam panic attack dosage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about clonazepam dosing for panic attacks and panic disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the user is asking about acute panic attack treatment versus maintenance therapy for panic disorder. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled dosing, titration, and discontinuation guidance. Next, I will review the pivotal trials to understand the dose–response and where the 1 mg/day "sweet spot" comes from. After that, I need to check guideline positions on benzodiazepines in panic disorder, including when and how to combine with SSRIs. Finally, I should consider special populations, safety, dependence, and tapering, and then synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Clonazepam is indicated for panic disorder, not for isolated, intermittent panic attacks, and its use is generally as scheduled maintenance rather than as-needed rescue, so I need to ensure we are discussing panic disorder treatment rather than acute panic attack rescue dosing, which would typically favor shorter-acting benzodiazepines like lorazepam or alprazolam if used at all [^116WDU8d] [^114iZuMB].

> I will now examine the FDA-labeled dosing. The recommended starting dose is 0.25 mg orally twice daily, with a target of 1 mg/day typically reached after 3 days. Higher doses up to 4 mg/day may be used in some patients, but doses above 1 mg/day were less effective and more adverse in the fixed-dose study, so I should emphasize that 1 mg/day is the usual effective dose for most adults [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for the 1 mg/day target. In the fixed-dose trial, 1 mg/day was the only dose that consistently separated from placebo, with about 74% of patients achieving zero full panic attacks at endpoint versus 56% on placebo. Higher fixed doses of 2–4 mg/day were less effective and more poorly tolerated, which supports keeping most patients at 1 mg/day unless there is a compelling reason to titrate cautiously upward [^112w3NvA] [^112kEUAd].

> Next, I should review titration and discontinuation. Dose increases should be small, typically 0.125–0.25 mg twice daily, and spaced about every 3 days as tolerated. Discontinuation should be gradual, reducing by about 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days to mitigate withdrawal and rebound, with slower tapers if symptoms emerge, and I need to ensure I note that abrupt stopping can precipitate seizures in susceptible patients [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB] [^112mbH2c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic use. I should confirm guideline positions. Contemporary guidelines generally do not recommend benzodiazepines as first-line for panic disorder due to dependence, cognitive effects, and withdrawal risks; SSRIs are preferred, and if benzodiazepines are used, it is often short-term or as a bridge, with careful tapering and close monitoring, so I need to counsel on this risk–benefit balance explicitly [^111YyzMN] [^114iZuMB] [^113HGjNg].

> Let me consider combination strategies. Early coadministration of clonazepam with an SSRI can accelerate symptom control in the first 1–3 weeks, but the benzodiazepine should generally be tapered off within about 4–8 weeks to avoid long-term dependence risks. This approach is supported by randomized data and aligns with guideline cautions about limiting benzodiazepine duration [^114cBvZa] [^111mfUPX] [^117Y4uqj].

> I should double-check special populations. In older adults, start low and go slow due to sensitivity to sedation, falls, and cognitive effects. In hepatic impairment, lower starting doses and slower titration are prudent. In pregnancy, benzodiazepines cross the placenta and can cause neonatal sedation and withdrawal, so use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks and consider tapering before delivery when feasible [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB] [^111UoMLp].

> Next, I should review safety and dependence. Tolerance to therapeutic effects can develop, though less so to cognitive adverse effects. Physical dependence is expected with regular use, and withdrawal can include anxiety, insomnia, perceptual disturbances, and rarely seizures, reinforcing the need for the lowest effective dose and planned tapering when discontinuing [^114ieFza] [^112mbH2c] [^115aNnxW].

> But wait, what if someone is asking for an "as-needed" dose for acute panic attacks. I need to clarify that clonazepam's long half-life makes it poorly suited for prn rescue of acute attacks; shorter-acting agents are sometimes used off-label for that purpose, though guidelines still advise minimizing benzodiazepine exposure and prioritizing SSRIs and CBT for panic disorder, so any prn use should be exceptional, brief, and coordinated with a long-term plan [^114iZuMB] [^113HGjNg].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For adults with panic disorder, start clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, increase to 0.5 mg twice daily after 3 days if tolerated, and aim for 1 mg/day total as the usual effective dose. Reserve doses above 1 mg/day for refractory cases and titrate slowly by 0.125–0.25 mg increments every 3 days, not exceeding 4 mg/day. Concurrently initiate an SSRI when appropriate, plan to taper the benzodiazepine within 4–8 weeks, and discontinue gradually using 0.125 mg twice daily reductions every 3 days, adjusting the pace to withdrawal symptoms [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB] [^114cBvZa].

> Finally, I should confirm monitoring and counseling points. Reassess efficacy and adverse effects frequently, watch for somnolence, cognitive clouding, and coordination problems, avoid coadministration with other CNS depressants when possible, and document informed consent regarding dependence and withdrawal risks. If tapering proves difficult, consider slower schedules or adjunctive supports, and remember that most patients can successfully discontinue benzodiazepines with planning, though relapse of panic symptoms can complicate withdrawal interpretation [^112mbH2c] [^111HGttc] [^1141JdpN].

Clonazepam is **not indicated for acute panic attacks** because of its slow onset; instead, it is used for panic disorder maintenance at 0.5–1 mg/day in divided doses, with a typical maximum of 4 mg/day [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB]. Start at 0.25 mg twice daily and titrate by 0.125–0.25 mg every 3 days to effect or tolerability [^116AyMnA]. For acute panic attacks, use faster-onset benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam 0.5–1 mg orally or IV) [^116tectP] or non-benzodiazepine options. Clonazepam is best reserved for short-term use or as a bridge until SSRIs take effect, with gradual tapering to minimize withdrawal [^114iZuMB] [^114cBvZa] [^112mbH2c].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and clinical considerations

Clonazepam has a **slow onset** (about 1 hour) and a long half-life (18–50 hours), making it unsuitable for acute panic attacks that require rapid relief [^notfound]. It is primarily used for maintenance therapy in panic disorder, with a delayed onset of therapeutic effect [^116AyMnA].

---

## Recommended dosage for panic disorder

The **recommended dosage** for panic disorder is as follows:

| **Clinical phase** | **Recommended dosage** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 0.25 mg orally twice daily | Start low to minimize sedation and adverse effects [^116AyMnA] |
| Titration | Increase by 0.125–0.25 mg every 3 days | Titrate to clinical response or tolerability [^116AyMnA] |
| Typical maintenance dose | 0.5–1 mg/day in divided doses | Most patients respond to 1 mg/day [^116AyMnA] |
| Maximum dose | 4 mg/day | Higher doses increase adverse effects without added benefit [^116AyMnA] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage recommendations

Clinical trials show that **1 mg/day** is the optimal dose for most patients, balancing efficacy and tolerability [^112w3NvA]. Higher doses (2–4 mg/day) are less effective and cause more adverse effects, though some patients may require them [^116AyMnA].

---

## Alternative medications for acute panic attacks

Given clonazepam's slow onset, **alternative medications** are preferred for acute panic attacks:

- **Lorazepam**: 0.5–1 mg orally or intravenously; rapid onset (15–30 minutes) [^116tectP].
- **Alprazolam**: 0.5 mg orally; rapid onset (15–30 minutes) [^notfound].
- **Non-benzodiazepine options**: SSRIs (e.g. sertraline, escitalopram) are first-line for long-term management, though they have a delayed onset (2–4 weeks) [^111YyzMN] [^113r1t5q].

---

## Risks and side effects

Clonazepam carries risks of **sedation, cognitive impairment, tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms** [^112mbH2c]. Long-term use increases the risk of dependence and withdrawal; therefore, it should be used short-term or as a bridge until SSRIs take effect [^114iZuMB] [^114cBvZa].

---

## Withdrawal and tapering strategies

Gradual tapering is essential to minimize withdrawal. A typical taper reduces the dose by **0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days**, with slower tapers if withdrawal symptoms occur [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity and fall risk [^116AyMnA].
- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Use lower doses and monitor closely [^notfound].
- **Pregnant or breastfeeding patients**: Avoid if possible due to potential fetal and neonatal risks [^111UoMLp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines recommend SSRIs as **first-line therapy** for panic disorder, with benzodiazepines (including clonazepam) reserved for short-term use or as adjuncts during SSRI initiation [^111YyzMN] [^114iZuMB]. Clonazepam is not recommended for acute panic attacks due to its slow onset [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 0.25 mg orally twice daily [^116AyMnA].
- **Titration**: Increase by 0.125–0.25 mg every 3 days to 0.5–1 mg/day [^116AyMnA].
- **Maximum dose**: 4 mg/day (rarely required) [^116AyMnA].
- **Acute panic attacks**: Use faster-onset benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam) or non-benzodiazepine options [^116tectP].
- **Duration**: Short-term use or as a bridge until SSRIs take effect; taper gradually to minimize withdrawal [^114iZuMB] [^112mbH2c].

---

Clonazepam is **not appropriate for acute panic attacks** because of its slow onset; it is used for panic disorder maintenance at 0.5–1 mg/day, with a maximum of 4 mg/day. Use the lowest effective dose, titrate slowly, and taper gradually to minimize withdrawal risks [^116AyMnA] [^1178xDvB].

Clinical Trials:

Panic Disorder:

The effectiveness of clonazepam in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IIIR) with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, clonazepam was shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder on change from baseline in panic attack frequency, the Clinician's Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician's Global Impression Improvement Score.

Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study involving clonazepam doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose, and a 7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full panic attacks, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients.

Study 2 was a 6-week, flexible-dose study involving clonazepam in a dose range of 0.5 to 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in three phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 6-week optimal-dose, and a 6-week discontinuance phase. The mean clonazepam dose during the optimal dosing period was 2.3 mg/day. The difference between clonazepam and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. At endpoint, 62% of patients receiving clonazepam were free of full panic attacks, compared to 37% of placebo-treated patients.

Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender.

Panic Disorder:

Adults:

The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.

Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.

There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Pediatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.

Geriatric Patients:

There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam:

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Seizure Disorders:

Clonazepam is useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic, and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam may be useful.

Some loss of effect may occur during the course of clonazepam treatment (see PRECAUTIONS: Loss of Effect).

Panic Disorder:

Clonazepam is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.

The efficacy of clonazepam was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

The effectiveness of clonazepam in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use clonazepam for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More among Clonazepam-Treated Patients:

Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred during acute therapy of panic disorder from a pool of two 6- to 9-week trials. Events reported in 1% or more of patients treated with clonazepam (doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg/day) and for which the incidence was greater than that in placebo-treated patients are included.

The prescriber should be aware that the figures in Table 3 cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied.

Commonly Observed Adverse Events:

Treatment-Emergent Depressive Symptoms:

In the pool of two short-term placebo-controlled trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term "depression" were reported in 7% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients, without any clear pattern of dose relatedness. In these same trials, adverse events classified under the preferred term "depression" were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^1178xDvB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Panic Disorder

Adults

The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.

Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.

There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Klonopin for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Pediatric Patients

There is no clinical trial experience with Klonopin in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.

Geriatric Patients

There is no clinical trial experience with Klonopin in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of Klonopin and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use).

Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of KLONOPIN

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue Klonopin or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).

### Clonazepam [^114ieFza]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tolerance

Tolerance to clonazepam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of clonazepam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials), patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use.

### Combined paroxetine and clonazepam treatment strategies compared to paroxetine monotherapy for panic disorder [^114cBvZa]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread application of combined selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder, there has been relatively little systematic assessment of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. Although the limited number of studies to date suggest a more rapid onset of benefit with combined treatment, this study is the first to address the critical question of whether continued combined treatment confers superior efficacy. This study is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm study in patients with panic disorder (n = 60), comparing the efficacy and safety of paroxetine and placebo (PP), paroxetine coadministered with clonazepam followed by a tapered benzodiazepine discontinuation phase (PC-D), and ongoing combination treatment (PC-M). All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement by endpoint. There was a significant advantage for the combined treatment groups early in treatment but, subsequently, outcome in all three groups was similar. A trend towards greater achievement of endpoint remission status for the PC-D group was attenuated when variability in baseline severity was considered. The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of a relatively moderate sample size and higher rates of early dropout. Combined treatment with paroxetine and clonazepam resulted in more rapid response than with the SSRI alone, but there was no differential benefit beyond the initial few weeks of therapy. Initiating combined treatment followed by benzodiazepine taper after a few weeks may provide early benefit while avoiding the potential adverse consequences of long-term combination therapy.

### High-potency benzodiazepines: recent clinical results [^113g5BCM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

As high-potency benzodiazepines, essentially alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam, have been used to treat anxiety disorders for almost 2 decades, most efficacy and safety data appeared several years ago. The release of new formulations of 2 of them, clonazepam and alprazolam, invites review of these broadly effective anxiolytics. Clonazepam has recently become available in a lyophilized wafer that disintegrates when exposed to saliva and enhances ease of administration without altering its pharmacology, as shown by bioequivalence studies. Two U.S. multicenter trials carried out in the 1990s, among others, have provided strong confirmatory evidence for the use of clonazepam in panic disorder. Other recently published data on clonazepam pertain to its use as augmentation therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and in the prevention of recurrences of major depressive disorder. A new, extended-release formulation of alprazolam now allows for once-daily rather than t.i.d. or q.i.d. dosing. With extended release, the blood drug concentrations of alprazolam remain within the therapeutic window for several hours, which should reduce fluctuation in therapeutic effect and curb the clock-watching phenomenon between doses. The literature concerning the use of this new formulation of alprazolam in panic disorder is reviewed.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Seizure Disorders

Klonopin is useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal variant), akinetic, and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, Klonopin may be useful.

Some loss of effect may occur during the course of clonazepam treatment (see PRECAUTIONS: Loss of Effect).

Panic Disorder

Klonopin is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.

The efficacy of Klonopin was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials).

Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.

The effectiveness of Klonopin in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use Klonopin for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Clonazepam [^112mbH2c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dependence:

Physical Dependence

Clonazepam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions).

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam and WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions).

Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms
Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality.
Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome
Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.

### Next-step strategies for panic disorder refractory to initial pharmacotherapy: a 3-phase randomized clinical trial [^112t3DUv]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

More data are needed to guide next-step interventions for panic disorder refractory to initial intervention.

Method

This 24-week randomized clinical trial (RCT) enrolled 46 patients with DSM-IV-defined panic disorder from November 2000 to April 2005 and consisted of 3 phases. Patients who failed to meet remission criteria were eligible for randomization in the next treatment phase. Phase 1 was a 6-week lead-in with open-label sertraline flexibly dosed to 100 mg (or escitalopram equivalent) to prospectively define treatment refractoriness (lack of remission). Phase 2 was a 6-week double-blind RCT of (1) increased-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) versus (2) continued SSRI plus placebo. Phase 3 was a 12-week RCT of added cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to "medication optimization" with SSRI plus clonazepam. Primary endpoints were remission and change in Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the intent-to-treat sample in each phase.

Results

In phase 1, 20.5% (8/39) of the patients achieved remission, and only baseline severity predicted endpoint PDSS score (beta [SE] = 1.04 [0.15], t = 6.76, P < .001). In phase 2, increasing the SSRI dose did not result in greater improvement or remission rates (placebo 15% [n = 2] vs increased dose 9% [n = 1]: Fisher exact test P = NS). In phase 3, remission was minimal (medication optimization = 11% [n = 1]; CBT = 10% [n = 1]), with a lack of group difference in PDSS score reduction (t(17) = 0.51, P > .60) consistent with a small effect size (d = 0.24).

Conclusions

Although power was limited and larger studies are needed, we failed to find evidence for greater benefit of increased SSRI dose versus continuation of current dose for panic disorder symptomatic after 6 weeks at moderate dose. Further, augmentation with CBT or medication optimization with clonazepam augmentation in nonremitted panic after 12 weeks of an SSRI did not differ, suggesting that both are reasonable next-step options. However, low overall remission rates in this comorbid refractory population suggest that better predictors of response to specific treatments over time and additional interventions are needed.

### The development of clonazepam as a psychotropic: the Massachusetts general hospital experience [^115SYLcs]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of anxiety disorders is not clearly understood; therefore, clinical observation, case reports, and case reviews continue to enhance physicians' understanding of disease and treatment mechanisms. At Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), physicians and researchers are guided by the recognition that available approved treatments are a small subset of what is sensible to try in anxiety disorders and have thus chosen to remain open minded and prepared to challenge assumptions about therapeutic agents and to explore new uses, including early work with high-potency benzodiazepines. Clinical trials established alprazolam as efficacious for panic disorder, and the agent was widely prescribed for patients at MGH after its approval. Soon, however, clinical observation suggested a short duration of benefit for a given dose in some patients. In some cases, patients who missed a dose reported rebound worsening. In response to the apparent problematic pharmacokinetics of alprazolam, members of the MGH psychiatry department pursued investigation that ultimately established the antipanic efficacy of clonazepam as well as examined its effectiveness in the treatment of other disorders, such as bipolar disorder and social phobia. The process of exploring new uses of older agents remains a worthy effort while we await newer agents with innovative mechanisms of action.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^11197pHx]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with panic disorder — Co-occurring panic disorder may respond to the SRI used for OCD or to CBT for panic. When panic disorder or a history of panic attacks is present, SRI treatment should be initiated at low doses and slowly titrated upward over a period of weeks to avoid initiating or exacerbating panic attacks. Alternatively, an SRI can be started at usual doses combined with a benzodiazepine at antipanic doses for the first month or so and then the benzodiazepine can be tapered over weeks.

### Issues in the clinical use of benzodiazepines: potency, withdrawal, and rebound [^1129xsY3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Low and medium potency benzodiazepines were initially introduced for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Their therapeutic actions as anxiolytics, sedative hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and muscle relaxants (with their low toxicity) have led to their use as first-line treatments, and they have become one of the most prescribed classes of drugs. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines were discovered with the introduction of the high-potency benzodiazepines (e.g., alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam). They were found to be effective in treating panic disorder and panic attacks with or without agoraphobia, as add-on therapy to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorders, and as adjunctive therapy in treating patients with acute mania or acute agitation. High-potency benzodiazepines have replaced low and medium potency benzodiazepines in all benzodiazepine clinical indications due to their greater therapeutic effects and rapid onset of action. Differences in distribution, elimination half-life, and rate of absorption are important considerations when choosing a high-potency benzodiazepine. Typically, a benzodiazepine with long distribution and elimination half-lives is preferred. A maximum dose of 2 mg/day of any of the high-potency benzodiazepines when given for more than 1 week is recommended. Although as a class benzodiazepines act rapidly and are well tolerated, their use presents clinical issues such as dependence, rebound anxiety, memory impairment, and discontinuation syndrome.

### The pharmacotherapy of panic disorder [^114aFKnu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is common and associated with significant morbidity and dysfunction. The pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder is aimed at reducing or eliminating panic attacks, avoidance behavior, anticipatory anxiety, and comorbid conditions — and substantially improving and normalizing overall function and quality of life. Antidepressants and benzodiazepines remain the current mainstays of pharmacotherapy for panic disorder, although other novel agents and strategies are becoming available and may add effective alternatives to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112iQHEG]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA).

Relevant studies were identified from Medline through PubMed and Embase from inception to 17 June 2021. The search terms were constructed according to population (eg, panic disorder, panic) and intervention domains (eg, benzodiazepine, SSRI, SNRI). Supplementary appendix 1 provides details of the search terms and search strategies. For searching in PubMed, we used the filter function to select only randomised controlled trials and phase I-IV clinical trials. ClinicalTrials.gov was also searched to identify ongoing trials. In addition, to identify other relevant studies we reviewed the reference lists of included studies and previous meta-analyses.

Randomised controlled trials published in any language were eligible that included adults aged ≥ 18 years with panic disorder diagnosed in accordance with the Feighner criteria, DSM third (and revised third) to fifth revisions, or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems; compared any pairs of interventions involving drugs for the treatment of panic disorder, with no treatment (eg, placebo or waitlist); and had any of the outcomes of remission, dropout, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and adverse events. We excluded studies that compared different dosages of the same drugs, such as alprazolam 0.5 mg/day v 1 mg/day, did not report sufficient data necessary for pooling (eg, patient numbers by treatment and outcome groups in contingency tables for dichotomous outcomes or mean and standard deviation values by treatment groups for continuous outcomes), or had concurrent psychotherapy with drug interventions. For multi-arm studies comparing different dosages of the same drug with other drugs or placebo, we only used data from the arm with a common or recommended dosage. Two reviewers (NC and KC) independently selected studies based on titles and abstracts; if eligibility was still undetermined, they reviewed full study texts. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus with a third researcher (TA).

Interventions of interest

Interventions of interest for panic disorder included tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SNRIs, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (eg, mirtazapine), noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (eg, reboxetine), benzodiazepines, noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (eg, buspirone), and β adrenergic receptor blocking agents.

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of combined clonazepam with paroxetine compared with paroxetine monotherapy for generalized social anxiety disorder [^115ZQNf9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is a pervasive form of social anxiety that affects approximately 5% of persons in the community. Among evidence-based pharmacologic treatments for the disorder, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become widely used and are known to be efficacious. Monotherapy with the benzodiazepine clonazepam is also efficacious for GSAD, but the adjunctive use of clonazepam with an SSRI to potentially improve outcomes has not been studied to date.

Method

Twenty-eight patients (22 men and 6 women) with DSM-IV-defined GSAD were randomly assigned to receive double-blind clonazepam (or placebo), 1.0 to 2.0 mg/day (divided b.i.d.) along with open-label paroxetine, 20 to 40 mg/day, for 10 weeks. A 2-week taper of double-blind medication was followed by an additional 8 weeks of open-label paroxetine treatment (during which the dose of paroxetine could be increased to a maximum of 50 mg/day). Twenty-three patients (82%) met DSM-IV criteria for avoidant personality disorder. The patients' mean ± SD age was 31.2 ± 7.7 years, and their mean duration of illness was 12.1 ± 5.8 years. Data were gathered from August 2001 to April 2002.

Results

Nineteen (68%) of 28 patients completed treatment. At the end of the 10-week double-blind treatment, there was a trend (p < .06) favoring the paroxetine/clonazepam group, who had a 79% response rate (Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement scale [CGI-I] score of 1 or 2) compared with a 43% response rate for the paroxetine/placebo group. However, no significant differences on other outcome measures were noted between the 2 groups in an intent-to-treat analysis, in terms of either very early (2–4 weeks) or not as early (5–10 weeks) responses during treatment. Dropout rates due to adverse events were rare (1 patient in each group), indicating that the paroxetine/clonazepam combination was well tolerated.

Conclusion

Coadministration of clonazepam with an SSRI, in contrast to findings in panic disorder, did not lead to more rapid resolution of symptoms in GSAD. On the other hand, there is some evidence that the clonazepam-added group had superior global outcomes (e.g., as measured on the CGI-I), although power to detect such differences in this study was small. These observations suggest that a role for adjunctive benzodiazepines in patients with GSAD (e.g., for augmenting SSRI partial response or nonresponse) is deserving of further controlled investigation.

### Antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults [^113Te87J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset, reaches a peak within 10 minutes and in which at least four of 13 characteristic symptoms are experienced, including racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, stomach churning, faintness and breathlessness. Panic disorder is common in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions. Amongst pharmacological agents, antidepressants and benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for panic disorder. Different classes of antidepressants have been compared; and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consider antidepressants (mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)) as the first-line treatment for panic disorder, due to their more favourable adverse effect profile over monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). In addition to antidepressants, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed for the treatment of panic disorder.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the effects of antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults.

Search Methods

The Specialised Register of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group (CCMDCTR) to 11 September 2015. This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-) and PsycINFO (1967-). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. We contacted experts in this field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind randomised controlled trials allocating adult patients with panic disorder to antidepressants or benzodiazepines versus any other active treatment with antidepressants or benzodiazepines.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were entered in RevMan 5.3 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies, including 6785 participants overall (of which 5365 in the arms of interest (antidepressant and benzodiazepines as monotherapy)) were included in this review; however, since studies addressed many different comparisons, only a few trials provided data for primary outcomes. We found low-quality evidence suggesting no difference between antidepressants and benzodiazepines in terms of response rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.47; participants = 215; studies = 2). Very low-quality evidence suggested a benefit for benzodiazepines compared to antidepressants in terms of dropouts due to any cause, even if confidence interval (CI) ranges from almost no difference to benefit with benzodiazepines (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.63; participants = 1449; studies = 7). We found some evidence suggesting that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are better tolerated than TCAs (when looking at the number of patients experiencing adverse effects). We failed to find clinically significant differences between individual benzodiazepines. The majority of studies did not report details on random sequence generation and allocation concealment; similarly, no details were provided about strategies to ensure blinding. The study protocol was not available for almost all studies so it is difficult to make a judgment on the possibility of outcome reporting bias. Information on adverse effects was very limited.

Authors' Conclusions

The identified studies are not sufficient to comprehensively address the objectives of the present review. The majority of studies enrolled a small number of participants and did not provide data for all the outcomes specified in the protocol. For these reasons most of the analyses were underpowered and this limits the overall completeness of evidence. In general, based on the results of the current review, the possible role of antidepressants and benzodiazepines should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis. The choice of which antidepressant and/or benzodiazepine is prescribed can not be made on the basis of this review only, and should be based on evidence of antidepressants and benzodiazepines efficacy and tolerability, including data from placebo-controlled studies, as a whole. Data on long-term tolerability issues associated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines exposure should also be carefully considered. The present review highlights the need for further higher-quality studies comparing antidepressants with benzodiazepines, which should be conducted with high-methodological standards and including pragmatic outcome measures to provide clinicians with useful and practical data. Data from the present review will be included in a network meta-analysis of psychopharmacological treatment in panic disorder, which will hopefully provide further useful information on this issue.

### The management of panic disorder [^114ijhDE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The evidence for benzodiazepines in panic disorder is compelling; along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are a standard treatment for panic and other anxiety disorders. However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.

### Combined psychotherapy plus benzodiazepines for panic disorder [^114WpWn2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of combining psychotherapy and benzodiazepines for panic disorder is unclear, despite widespread use.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of the combination compared with either treatment alone.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials comparing the combination of psychotherapy and benzodiazepine with either therapy alone for panic disorder were identified. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Studies and References Registers were searched. References of relevant trials and other reviews were checked. Experts in the field were contacted. Additional unpublished data were sought from authors of the original trials.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently checked the records retrieved by the searches to identify randomised trials comparing the combined therapy versus either of the monotherapies, among adults with panic disorder.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently checked eligibility, assessed quality and extracted data from the eligible trials using a standardised data extraction form. The primary outcome was "response" based on global judgement. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, combining data from included trials.

Main Results

Three trials met eligibility criteria. A 16-week behaviour therapy intervention was used in two trials, and a 12-week cognitive-behaviour therapy intervention in the third. Duration of follow-up varied, ranging from 0 to 12 months. Two trials (total 166 participants) provided data comparing combination with psychotherapy alone (both using behaviour therapy). No statistically significant differences were observed in response during the intervention (relative risk (RR) for combination 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.03, P = 0.35), at the end of the intervention (RR 0.78, 0.45 to 1.35, P = 0.37), or at the last follow-up time point, although the follow-up data suggested that the combination might be inferior to behaviour therapy alone (RR 0.62, 0.36 to 1.07, P = 0.08). One trial (77 participants) compared combination with a benzodiazepine alone. No differences were found in response during the intervention (RR 1.57, 0.83 to 2.98, P = 0.17). Although the combination appeared to be superior to the benzodiazepine alone at the end of treatment (RR 3.39, 1.03 to 11.21, P = 0.05) the finding was only borderline statistically significant, and no significant differences were observed at the 7-month follow-up (RR 2.31, 0.79 to 6.74, P = 0.12).

Authors' Conclusions

The review established the paucity of high quality evidence investigating the efficacy of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for panic disorder. Currently, there is inadequate evidence to assess the clinical effects of psychotherapy combined with benzodiazepines for patients who are diagnosed with panic disorder.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114SK5jS]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The lifetime prevalence of the common psychological problem known as panic disorder is between 1% and 5%. Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks associated with several comorbid psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditionssuch as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular diseasesand impairment of social, work, and family functioning. Agoraphobia is a strong fear or anxiety provoked by real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations and is often associated with panic disorder. Successive revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV) provide similar definitions of panic disorder, refined with each new edition; but in the fifth revision (DSM-5) panic disorder and agoraphobia have been defined individually.

Several drug treatments are available for panic disorder, including tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Findings from previous systematic reviews and direct meta-analyses suggest these treatments are more effective in reducing panic symptoms than placebo, but tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines are linked with a significantly higher risk of adverse events. As a result several guidelines recommend SSRIs as the primary treatment owing to their preferable long term safety over benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which SSRI is most efficacious and is associated with the lowest risk of adverse events given the limited availability of direct comparisons between SSRIs and other drug classes.

### A three-year follow-up study of patients with the respiratory subtype of panic disorder after treatment with clonazepam [^116fC1i3]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

The demographic, clinical and therapeutic features of the respiratory subtype of panic disorder (PD) versus the non-respiratory subtype were studied in a prospective design. Sixty-seven PD outpatients (DSM-IV), who had previously been categorized into respiratory (n = 35) and non-respiratory (n = 32) subgroups, were openly treated with clonazepam for a 3-year period. The principal measure of efficacy was the number of panic attacks, obtained from the Sheehan Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale. In the first 8 weeks of treatment (acute phase), the respiratory subtype group had a significantly faster response to clonazepam. During the follow-up (weeks 12–156), the two subgroups did not differ significantly in the number of panic attacks experienced from baseline to end point. Patients in the respiratory subtype were characterized by a later onset of disorder and a family history of PD. Patients in the non-respiratory subgroup had a significantly higher number of past depressive episodes than those in the respiratory subgroup. The respiratory subgroup had a faster response after 8 weeks of treatment and an equivalent response in the 3-year follow-up period. Clonazepam had a sustained therapeutic effect over the entire treatment period.

### Changes in anxiety sensitivity with pharmacotherapy for panic disorder [^113qSKkN]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

Fear of anxiety symptoms (anxiety sensitivity) has been implicated in the etiology and maintenance of panic disorder, and has been shown to improve with cognitive-behavioral treatment. The impact of pharmacotherapy on anxiety sensitivity is less clear. We administered the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) during a 12-week randomized controlled trial investigating the relative efficacy of paroxetine, paroxetine plus sustained clonazepam, and paroxetine plus brief clonazepam for patients with panic disorder. We found a mean reduction in ASI scores of 9.6 points, which correlated with symptomatic improvement, and did not differ significantly between groups. Our data provides further evidence that pharmacotherapy leads to significant acute reductions in fears of anxiety symptoms in patients with panic disorder, albeit at levels that may be somewhat less than the changes associated with CBT. Implications of these findings are discussed relative to optimizing pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder.

### Clonazepam (Klonopin) [^115aNnxW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Tolerance

Tolerance to Klonopin may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of Klonopin may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

Following the short-term treatment of patients with panic disorder in Studies 1 and 2 (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials), patients were gradually withdrawn during a 7-week downward-titration (discontinuance) period. Overall, the discontinuance period was associated with good tolerability and a very modest clinical deterioration, without evidence of a significant rebound phenomenon. However, there are not sufficient data from adequate and well-controlled long-term clonazepam studies in patients with panic disorder to accurately estimate the risks of withdrawal symptoms and dependence that may be associated with such use.

### Long-term management of panic disorder [^112Ua63f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a chronic, disabling condition that is often associated with a need for long-term clinical treatment. While a variety of pharmacotherapy options, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, are effective in reducing symptoms in the acute phase, a significant number of patients do not fully respond to initial treatment, and a large majority of patients experience relapse after medication discontinuation. Optimal long-term treatment of panic disorder involves attention to adequate medication dosing and adequate duration of treatment to achieve maximum improvement before discontinuing. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral therapy to improve treatment response. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of these multifaceted treatment strategies among patients suffering from refractory panic disorder.

### Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis [^112XVSfc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

Objectives

To compare, via network meta-analysis, individual drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) or placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To rank drug classes for panic disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines with each other or with a placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined by global judgement of the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), panic symptom scales and global judgement (continuous outcome), frequency of panic attacks (as recorded, for example, by a panic diary; continuous outcome), agoraphobia (dichotomous outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses.

Main Results

Overall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants. There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with diazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam ranking as the most effective. We found heterogeneity in most of the comparisons, but our threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta-analysis. Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined. Thirty-two RCTs (N = 8569) were included in the remission outcome. Most medications were more effective than placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest. Thirty-five RCTs (N = 8826) are included in the continuous outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small trials. Forty-one RCTs (N = 7853) are included in the frequency of panic attack outcome. Only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest. Twenty-six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo. For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs. For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise. For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs. The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.

### Are benzodiazepines still the medication of choice for patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia? [^112F2Ehv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, pharmacological treatment guidelines for panic disorder have changed as newer treatment options have become available. The authors examined how the use of psychotropic drugs has shifted over the course of 10 years to determine if prescribing patterns have changed to reflect these revised treatment guidelines.

Method

A total of 443 patients with panic disorder were enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project, a prospective longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. These patients were interviewed over the course of 10 years to examine their use of psychotropic medications.

Results

Despite efforts aimed at increasing the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with panic disorder (e.g. APA's practice guideline for panic disorder, Food and Drug Administration approval of particular SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder), only a modest increase in their use was found. Treatment patterns for psychotropic drugs appear to have remained stable over the past decade, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly used medication for panic disorder. In comparison, SSRI use throughout the follow-up period has remained low. Patients using an SSRI did not have a more favorable clinical course than those using a benzodiazepine, nor were there significantly better rates of remission in patients using SSRIs and benzodiazepines concomitantly.

Conclusions

These results highlight a gap between pharmacological treatment guidelines and actual delivery of care in that recommendations to use SSRIs to treat panic disorder are not being followed. Factors potentially associated with promoting and ignoring treatment recommendations are discussed.

### What to do when SSRIs fail: eight strategies for optimizing treatment of panic disorder [^116WKoVs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the drug of choice for treatment of patients with panic disorder. Most patients have a favorable response to SSRI therapy; however, 30 percent will not be able to tolerate these drugs or will have an unfavorable or incomplete response. Strategies to improve management of such patients include optimizing SSRI dosing (starting at a low dose and slowly increasing the dose to reach the target dose) and ensuring an adequate trial before switching to a different drug. Benzodiazepines should be avoided but, when necessary, may be used for a short duration or may be used long-term in patients for whom other treatments have failed. Slower-onset, longer-acting benzodiazepines are preferred. All patients should be encouraged to try cognitive behavior therapy. Augmentation therapy should be considered in patients who do not have a complete response. Drugs to consider for use in augmentation therapy include benzodiazepines, buspirone, beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and valproate sodium.

### Alprazolam [^113p4c7q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosage in Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the acute treatment of patients with GAD is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses).

Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Dosage in Panic Disorder

The recommended starting oral dosage of alprazolam tablets for the treatment of PD is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day.

Controlled trials of alprazolam tablets in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily. The mean dosage was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg per day.

For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of alprazolam tablets greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit.

The necessary duration of treatment for PD in patients responding to alprazolam tablets is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^113CyfDR]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of most patients, there will be some who require doses greater than 4 mg/day. In such cases, dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects.

Anxiety Disorders and Transient Symptoms of Anxiety

Treatment for patients with anxiety should be initiated with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg given three times daily. The dose may be increased to achieve a maximum therapeutic effect, at intervals of

3 to 4 days, to a maximum daily dose of 4 mg, given in divided doses. The lowest possible effective dose should be employed and the need for continued treatment reassessed frequently. The risk of dependence may increase with dose and duration of treatment.

In all patients, dosage should be reduced gradually when discontinuing therapy or when decreasing the daily dosage. Although there are no systematically collected data to support a specific discontinuation schedule, it is suggested that the daily dosage be decreased by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may require an even slower dosage reduction.

Panic Disorder

The successful treatment of many panic disorder patients has required the use of alprazolam at doses greater than 4 mg daily. In controlled trials conducted to establish the efficacy of alprazolam in panic disorder, doses in the range of 1 to 10 mg daily were used. The mean dosage employed was approximately 5 to 6 mg daily. Among the approximately 1700 patients participating in the panic disorder development program, about 300 received alprazolam in dosages of greater than 7 mg/day, including approximately 100 patients who received maximum dosages of greater than 9 mg/day. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg a day to achieve a successful response.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^116Biip1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder

Of 42 documents primarily covering conditions in this category; 20 covered Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), 19 covered Panic Disorder (PD), 19 covered Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Additionally, 13 covered Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD) and 12 covered Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

For all these conditions, > 80% of documents in each category did not advise their use as first-line agents and most documents recommended use only when necessary for either < 4 weeks or for an unspecified short-term use duration. The specific agents recommended most were diazepam and alprazolam for GAD, clonazepam and alprazolam for SAD and PD. There was significant heterogeneity in the guidance on their prescriptive use with most guidelines or guidance documents offering either no advice, limited advice or variable guidance on their dosing or administration pattern (scheduled vs. prn use).

Insomnia

When pharmacologic use was deemed necessary for treatment, 19 of 25 documents either made explicit recommendations for BZRA or BZD as either the only 1st line treatment of choice or one of multiple 1st line pharmacologic options. The BZRA ('Z-Drugs') were clearly more often the treatment of choice over BZD. Fourteen of 25 documents advised use < 4 weeks specifically. Other salient features were an emphasis on intermittent or 'prn' use (n = 6) or use of the "lowest dose possible" (n = 8).

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^116tectP]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Buspirone is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets. We recommend starting with a dosage of 2.5 mg (half of a 5 mg tablet) given each morning. We then increase the dosage by 2.5 mg weekly, in the morning and at "after school" time points. We continue in this manner until the symptoms of anxiety are "much improved" or "very much improved", the patient develops interfering side effects (see above) that limit further dose escalation, or we reach a target dose of 15 mg twice a day.

While no published trials have been completed in ASD, benzodiazepines can be highly effective for acute episodes of anxiety (i.e. as needed for acute panic attacks) but can also be used as a short-term treatment of anxiety while waiting for a primary medication to take effect. Lorazepam dosing depends on its specific intent (acute administration or as a short-term treatment) and the age of the individual. Minimal dose is typically initiated to achieve efficacy without sedation or dizziness. For acute dosing, which is the most common use of lorazepam, children can be given 0.25 mg up to 1 mg, and adults can be given 0.5 mg up to 2 mg. However, in some cases, it may be advantageous to start at an even lower dose (0.125 in children and 0.25 in adults). For short-term daily treatment, with the intended action of 4–6 h, the frequency of administration would be 2–3 times/day with a total maximum daily dose of 1–3 mg. Clinical exceptions may require higher dosing. Side effects include sedation, dizziness, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and confusion. A less common yet notable side effect may include misuse or development of addiction (with increased risk in individuals who have a history of substance misuse). To protect against misuse, clinicians may consider short-term usage only or increase the monitoring of refill durations. Benzodiazepines can act with other sedating medications (to increase the risk of sedation), and at high dosages, risks include suppression of respiration drive, which is contraindicated for treating sleep in patients with sleep apnea. In addition, patients taking more than 3 mg in 24 h are at risk for seizure if medication is stopped suddenly. Prescribers are advised to taper down as the safest way to discontinue use. Finally, benzodiazepines also carry a risk of paradoxical reactions in those with neurodevelopmental disorders (again emphasizing the need to start low and go slow).

### Opioid prescribing patterns among medical providers in the United States, 2003–17: retrospective, observational study [^111D5s6z]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Defining drugs of interest

We followed US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations when selecting the most appropriate opioids for our analysis. Specifically, we excluded buprenorphine products prescribed as treatment for opioid use disorder, drugs typically not used in outpatient settings (eg, fentanyl in solution), cough and cold formulations, and injectable or intravenous opioids.

As with any system, some unequal distribution is expected, due, for example, to differences in provider preferences, provider location, provider specialties, or provider perceptions. Thus to facilitate comparison, we tabulated eight benzodiazepines used to treat anxiety, panic disorder, seizures, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and muscle spasms: alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, and triazolam. Similar to opioids, benzodiazepines have highly variable prescribing patterns and a wide range of doses and therapeutic uses, including episodic use. A full list of National Drug Codes for each drug can be found in the online code repository (see supplementary materials section 1).

Quantities of interest

We estimated two primary quantities of interest for each drug and year, for each provider: dose and number of prescriptions. In addition, we estimated three secondary quantities of interest: daily dose, dose for each patient, and dose for each prescription. Opioid doses were standardized to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) using National Drug Code specific conversion factors. Benzodiazepine doses were standardized to lorazepam milligram equivalents. Dose was calculated as the quantity×drug strength×conversion factor. For each provider, we took the total number of opioid or benzodiazepine prescriptions across all patients. The daily dose was calculated as the dose divided by the number of days supply for each prescription. The dose for each patient was calculated as the total dose divided by the number of unique patients who received an opioid or benzodiazepine prescription from each provider separately (that is, a patient receiving multiple opioid prescriptions from multiple providers counts as one unique patient for each provider). The dose for each prescription was calculated as the total dose divided by the total number of opioid or benzodiazepine prescriptions for each provider.

### Alprazolam (Xanax) [^114337dX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1	Dosage in Generalized Anxiety Disorder

The recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX for the acute treatment of patients with GAD is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses).

Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2	Dosage in Panic Disorder

The recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX for the treatment of PD is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day.

Controlled trials of XANAX in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily. The mean dosage was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg per day.

For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose‑response study, patients treated with doses of XANAX greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit.

The necessary duration of treatment for PD in patients responding to XANAX is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted, but there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish without recurrence of symptoms and/or the manifestation of withdrawal phenomena [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^113qSUjW]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Benzodiazepines in OCD — evidence for monotherapy benefit is limited to case reports, controlled data are inconsistent or negative, and modest doses may relieve anxiety without reducing obsessions/compulsions; among those with substance abuse histories they should be prescribed cautiously, and benzodiazepines cannot be recommended as monotherapy for OCD except in rare individuals unable or unwilling to take standard anti-OCD medication. Evidence for beneficial effects of benzodiazepines as monotherapy for OCD is primarily limited to case reports with clonazepam and alprazolam, and for clonazepam negative results from controlled trials cast doubt on earlier positive findings; case reports note an onset within 1–3 weeks.

### Early carbon dioxide challenge test may predict clinical response in panic disorder [^112VknMM]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

We examined whether responses to the carbon dioxide (CO₂) challenge test were correlated with clinical response. Thirty-four panic disorder patients participated in a CO₂ test after 1 h, 2 weeks and 6 weeks of treatment with clonazepam (2 mg/day) or placebo. The clonazepam group had significantly fewer panic attacks in response to the CO(2) test and the test may predict clinical response.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^111HGttc]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

How to discontinue?

Discontinuation strategies

Lithium: gradual discontinuation of lithium (at least over a month) reduces risk of DS and early recurrence relative to rapid discontinuation. In clinical practice, lithium and other mood stabilizers are often tapered hyperbolically (Supplementary Text). If lithium needs to be discontinued because of inefficacy or severe side effects, it may be replaced with another mood stabilizer or SGA.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: it is unclear whether this also applies to other mood stabilizers.

Dose reduction

Lithium: for lithium, recommended effective doses for the prevention of manic and depressive episodes result in blood plasma levels of 0.6–0.8 mmol/l, or, in some cases, 0.4–0.6 mmol/l. Dose reductions below these levels may diminish effectiveness.

Valproate/carbamazepine/lamotrigine: minimally effective blood levels are less robustly established than for lithium: 50 mg/l for valproate, 4 mg/l for carbamazepine, and 3 mg/l for lamotrigine.

Discontinuation interventions

There are no known interventions to reduce relapse risk or DS during or after mood stabilizer discontinuation. Closely monitoring mood symptoms during discontinuation of mood stabilizers is recommended, for at least 1 year.

Benzodiazepines

Who can discontinue?

Relapse rates after discontinuation

Relapse rates for benzodiazepines are generally intricate to ascertain given the diversity of symptoms for which benzodiazepines are prescribed. Nevertheless, the majority of patients succeed in discontinuing benzodiazepines, as shown by systematic reviews and meta-analyses that found an average 1-year discontinuation success rate of 55–64%.

Discontinuation symptoms (DS)

Most patients discontinuing benzodiazepines experience some degree of DS (59–78%). Physical DS of benzodiazepine discontinuation include muscle tension, weakness, spasms, pain, and influenza-like symptoms (sweating and shivering). Psychological DS include anxiety and panic attacks, restlessness, agitation, depression, mood swings, concentration difficulties, and sleep disturbances. In rare instances, rapid discontinuation may induce more severe DS, including seizures and psychotic symptoms. DS may emerge or worsen weeks after discontinuation, with highest risks in short elimination half-life benzodiazepines (temazepam and lorazepam).

Risk factors for relapse following discontinuation

Patients often want to stop after long-term benzodiazepine use, but face barriers such as dependence and misuse, reliance on benzodiazepines for comfort, and anticipation of sleep problems. Intrinsic motivation and sufficient time to consider the benefits of discontinuation can help.

### Evidence of a suffocation alarm system sensitive to clinically-effective treatments with the panicolytics clonazepam and fluoxetine [^112kZvQd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, 'hunger for air', and the urge to flee are the cardinal symptoms of respiratory-type panic attacks. Patients also show baseline respiratory abnormalities and a higher rate of comorbid and antecedent respiratory diseases. Panic attacks are also precipitated by both the infusion of 0.5 M sodium lactate and the inhalation of 5–7% carbon dioxide (CO₂) in predisposed patients, but not in healthy volunteers nor patients without panic disorder. Further studies show that patients with panic are also hyper-responsive to hypoxia. These and other observations led Klein (1993) to suggest that clinical panic is the misfiring of a suffocation alarm system. In rats, cytotoxic hypoxia of chemoreceptor cells by intravenous injection of potassium cyanide (KCN) produces short-lasting flight behaviors reminiscent of panic attacks. KCN-induced flight behaviors are blocked both by denervation of chemoreceptor cells and lesion of dorsal periaqueductal gray matter, a likely substrate of panic. Herein, we show that KCN-evoked flight behaviors are also attenuated by both acute and chronic treatment with clonazepam (0.01–0.3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and fluoxetine (1–4 mg/kg/day, i.p. for 21 days), respectively. Attenuation of KCN-evoked panic-like behaviors by clinically-effective treatment with panicolytics adds fresh evidence to the false suffocation alarm theory of panic disorder.

### Prescribing and deprescribing guidance for benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use in adults with depression, anxiety, and insomnia: an international scoping review [^112cwr2w]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

When BZD are used for anxiety related disorders, there is a clear consensus among most documents to restrict their use to the 'short-term' (often unspecified in terms of duration) but most commonly for less than 4 weeks. Interestingly, alprazolam which has become noticeably more problematic in terms of misuse or harm based on real world data over the past two decades, is still over-represented as a BZD of choice in many guidance documents. This is no doubt attributable to the larger abundance of earlier randomised controlled trial data compared to some other BZDs for conditions such as PD. However, real world evidence of harm via overdose and diversion trends should be considered in framing future recommendations on BZD selection. For instance, some newer documents specifically advise against the use of alprazolam given its rapid onset and shorter-half life; pharmacokinetic properties that increase its potential for withdrawal and misuse. Other major BZD that were prominently represented were diazepam, lorazepam and, especially; clonazepam which has more long-term use data from clinical trials, particularly in PD.

Another area of clear heterogeneity in guidance was in the dosing pattern recommended. Some major guidelines advise regular scheduled dosing of BZD for common anxiety disorders. In contrast, other documents advise 'prn' use or intermittent dosing. How prescriptions are issued and used in real world medical practice can have profound effects on the development of tolerance or dependence for individuals with these conditions and so this is an area where further clarity could be achieved within future guidelines. This is especially important because recent observational research indicates potentially safer outcomes with intermittent compared to chronic dosing.

Guidance for OCD and PTSD were comparatively limited, based on lack of positive evidence of benefit, and no documents clearly advised their use as first line pharmacologic options. Furthermore, the use of BZD in PTSD has been controversial and frequently ill-advised based on their proposed propensity to interfere with fear extinction in exposure therapy as well as potentiate the development of ongoing stress symptomatology in the aftermath of a traumatic event.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^112Jkbhm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background — benzodiazepines (BZDs) are FDA‑approved for conditions such as anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures but are associated with increased risks including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly with concurrent central nervous system depressants like alcohol or opioids; physical dependence is expected and abrupt discontinuation can cause serious and potentially life‑threatening withdrawal symptoms, and the risk–benefit balance of prescribing may shift as patients and co‑medications change, while clinicians in palliative and end‑of‑life care are not the intended audience for this guideline.

### Comparative safety of chronic versus intermittent benzodiazepine prescribing in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^117WPWWE]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Various approaches have been used to characterize benzodiazepine adverse outcomes in both short- and long-term use. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of certain anxiolytic benzodiazepines for anxiety disorders; however, these trials have less utility for examining rarer adverse outcomes or outcomes that emerge after prolonged periods of exposure beyond the duration of the trial. In particular, randomized trials examining outcomes of long-term benzodiazepine use are uncommon; those that exist, such as a 3-year study of clonazepam versus paroxetine in panic disorder, have a weaker design than the more numerous short-term trials. We are not aware of any randomized trials that specifically compare chronic and intermittent benzodiazepine use.

An alternative approach to characterizing benzodiazepine outcomes is the use of observational methods such as cohort studies. Most previous observational studies have not been derived from population-based data; rather, they have been derived from clinical settings, which affect their generalizability. A few recent population-based studies have focussed on a single outcome in relation to benzodiazepine exposure, such as those reporting the association of benzodiazepine use with hip fractures, poor outcome after total hip replacement in arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. A further study of this type found no association between benzodiazepine use and dementia/cognitive decline.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111HaPj4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal risk by dose, duration, and frequency (Table 3) — clinical consensus estimates indicate that with any duration and ≤ 3 days per week the risk is no; with < 1 month and ≥ 4 days per week the risk is lower risk, but possible; with 1–3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at low total daily dose the risk is lower risk, but possible, whereas at moderate to high dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration; with ≥ 3 months and ≥ 4 days per week at any dose the risk is yes, with greater risk with increasing dose and duration. A low daily dose is estimated as 10 mg diazepam equivalents or less (e.g., ≤ 0.5 mg clonazepam, ≤ 2 mg lorazepam, ≤ 1 mg alprazolam), a moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam), and a high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g., > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Purpose

The following medical and professional societies partnered to develop and disseminate this Joint Clinical Practice Guideline on Benzodiazepine Tapering (hereafter referred to as the Guideline):
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)
American Academy of Neurology (AAN)
American Academy of Physician Associates (AAPA)
American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)
American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists (AAPP)
American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT)
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)
American Geriatrics Society (AGS)
American Psychiatric Association (APA)
American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM)

This Guideline provides information on evidence-informed and consensus-based strategies to help clinicians determine whether tapering benzodiazepine (BZD) medications may be appropriate for a given patient and, if so, how to taper them. This Guideline applies to adult patients who have been taking BZDs regularly and may be at risk of physical dependence. Note that physical dependence is an expected outcome associated with BZD use and is distinct from BZD use disorder. Additional considerations for patients with substance use disorder (SUD) are discussed separately in the section " Patients with Benzodiazepine and Other Substance Use Disorders". Clinicians in palliative and end-of-life care settings are not the intended audience for this Guideline.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a wide range of conditions, including anxiety and panic disorders, social phobia, insomnia, and seizures, and are commonly prescribed. They are important therapeutic tools. However, use of these medications is associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcohol or opioids. – The risk–benefit balance of BZD prescribing may shift over time as patients age and their physical or mental health conditions and other prescribed medications change. Because physical dependence is an expected outcome of BZD use, discontinuation can be challenging. When BZDs are used regularly, abrupt discontinuation (i.e. stopping the medication without a taper) or precipitous dose decreases can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111DkVJU]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results

A total of 2019 studies were identified, of which 87 (12 800 participants) met the inclusion criteria (fig 1). Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies (see supplementary file for references e1-e87). The mean age of participants was 35.0 years and 63.7% (7819/12 276) were women. Most of the studies (39/87, 44.3%) used the DSM-III-TR (text revision) criteria for diagnosing panic disorder. Eighty three studies (95%) included participants with agoraphobia, and duration of panic disorder was 6.9 years before study commencement. The most common duration of treatment was eight weeks (35%), followed by 12 weeks (19%). A total of 21 comparisons were considered for analysis; most compared benzodiazepines with placebo (n = 16 studies) and SSRIs with placebo (n = 16), followed by tricyclic antidepressants versus benzodiazepines (n = 8), tricyclic antidepressants versus SSRIs (n = 8), and SSRIs versus SSRIs (n = 6), and tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo (n = 5), with the remaining comparisons represented in only a few studies. Fifty two studies reported outcomes for remission, 75 for dropouts, 41 for anxiety symptoms, 22 for depression symptoms, and 54 for adverse events. Quality of life outcomes were not considered as data were only available from seven studies.

Risk of bias assessment

Most of the studies had at least some concerns (70%; 61/87) or were at high risk of bias (29%; 25/87); only a single study was considered low risk (supplementary eFigures 1 and 2). Risk of bias was mostly related to insufficient details of randomisation and concealment processes (88%; 77/87 studies) and selection of results reported (91%; 79/87) owing to non-registration or publication of study protocols.

### Treatment of panic disorder [^1116FTyo]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia occurs commonly in patients in primary care settings. This article assesses multiple evidence-based reviews of effective treatments for panic disorder. Antidepressant medications successfully reduce the severity of panic symptoms and eliminate panic attacks. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective in the treatment of panic disorder. The choice of medication is based on side effect profiles and patient preferences. Strong evidence supports the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in treating panic disorder. Family physicians who are not trained in cognitive behavior therapy may refer patients with panic disorder to therapists with such training. Cognitive behavior therapy can be used alone or in combination with antidepressants to treat patients with panic disorder. Benzodiazepines are effective in treating panic disorder symptoms, but they are less effective than antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy.

Data

Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Animal Data

In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, a similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed at all doses, in a low, non-dose-related incidence. The lowest dose tested is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and similar to the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m² basis. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryofetal growth occurred in one study at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day.

No adverse maternal or embryofetal effects were observed in mice or rats following oral administration of clonazepam during organogenesis of doses up to 15 or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m2basis).

Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines.

Nursing Mothers

Risk Summary

Clonazepam is excreted in human milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. There are no data on the effects of clonazepam on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Klonopin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Klonopin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to Klonopin through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111ccKRN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

BZDs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage a wide range of conditions, including acute conditions (e.g. panic and acute anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, seizures) and common chronic conditions (e.g. anxiety disorders, primary insomnia). These medications are commonly prescribed and represent important therapeutic tools; however, data on long-term safety and efficacy are limited. BZD use is associated with an increased risk of adverse events including falls, motor vehicle accidents, cognitive impairment, delirium, overdose, and death, particularly when BZDs are used in combination with CNS depressants such as alcohol or opioids. –

Since 2000, fatal overdoses involving BZDs have increased nearly tenfold, often involving the combination of opioids and BZDs. Although prescribing rates for BZDs have fallen since the most recent peak in 2013, in the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 9.1% of US adults reported use of BZDs in the past year, with more than 15% of those reporting BZD misuse. Between 1996 and 2013, the number of adults filling BZD prescriptions increased from 4.1 to 5.6%, while the total quantity of BZD prescriptions filled more than tripled, from 1.1 to 3.6 kg lorazepam equivalents per 100,000 adults. Over this time, emergency department (ED) visits related to BZDs also tripled, and BZD-related overdose deaths quadrupled. Since 2013, however, BZD prescriptions dispensed from outpatient and mail-order pharmacies have fallen by approximately 33%.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116owtBX]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To identify drug classes and individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with high rates of remission and low risk of adverse events in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 17 June 2021.

Eligibility criteria for study selection

Randomised controlled trials that included adults aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of panic disorder, compared drugs used to treat the panic disorder, and measured the outcomes of interest, including remissions, dropouts, and adverse events.

Methods

Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Direct meta-analyses were performed using random effects models. A two stage network meta-analysis with surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to estimate the comparative efficacy of drug classes and individual SSRIs.

Results

87 studies including a total of 12 800 participants and 12 drug classes were eligible for inclusion. Almost all the studies (86/87) had some concern or were at high risk of bias. Network meta-analysis of remission with consistent results indicated that tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, SSRIs, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) were associated with significantly higher remission rates than placebo, with risk ratios of 1.39 (95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.54), 1.47 (1.36 to 1.60), 1.30 (1.00 to 1.69), 1.38 (1.26 to 1.50), and 1.27 (1.12 to 1.45), respectively. SUCRAs identified benzodiazepines (84.5%, mean rank = 2.4), tricyclic antidepressants (68.7%, 3.8), and SSRIs (66.4%, 4.0) as the top three best treatments for remission. However, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and SSRIs were also significantly associated with increased risk of adverse events compared with placebo, with risk ratios of 1.79 (1.47 to 2.19), 1.76 (1.50 to 2.06), and 1.19 (1.01 to 1.41), respectively. Consistency assumption of adverse events was upheld but could still be present on removal of studies with high percentages of women participants and those with agoraphobia. A SUCRA cluster ranking plot considering both remission and adverse events among all drug classes indicated that SSRIs were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. Among individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram provided high remission with an acceptable risk of adverse events.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that SSRIs provide high rates of remission with low risk of adverse events for the treatment of panic disorder. Among SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were associated with high remission and low risk of adverse events. The findings were, however, based on studies of moderate to very low certainty levels of evidence, mostly as a result of within study bias, inconsistency, and imprecision of the findings reported.

‡ A moderate daily dose is estimated as 10–15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g. 0.5–1.5 mg clonazepam, 2–3 mg lorazepam, 1–2 mg alprazolam). See Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents

§ A high daily dose is estimated as more than 15 mg diazepam equivalents (e.g. > 1.5 mg clonazepam, > 3 mg lorazepam, > 2 mg alprazolam). See Appendix B for BZD dose equivalents

2 Clinicians should avoid abruptly discontinuing BZD medication in patients who are likely to be physically dependent on BZDs and at risk of BZD withdrawal (see Table 3; Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). a Tapering is indicated for patients who are likely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Clinicians should consider either discontinuation or a short taper for patients who are unlikely to be physically dependent when the risks of BZD medication outweigh the benefits (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Alprazolam (Xanax) [^1159qPYP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3	Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of XANAX

To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue XANAX or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Reduced the dosage by no more than 0.5 mg every 3 days. Some patients may benefit from an even more gradual discontinuation. Some patients may prove resistant to all discontinuation regimens.

In a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients which compared the recommended taper schedule with a slower taper schedule, no difference was observed between the groups in the proportion of patients who tapered to zero dose; however, the slower schedule was associated with a reduction in symptoms associated with a withdrawal syndrome.

2.4	Dosage Recommendations in Geriatric Patients

In geriatric patients, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dosage, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.5	Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with hepatic impairment, the recommended starting oral dosage of XANAX is 0.25 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. This may be gradually increased if needed and tolerated. If adverse reactions occur at the recommended starting dose, the dosage may be reduced [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6	Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions

XANAX should be reduced to half of the recommended dosage when a patient is started on ritonavir and XANAX together, or when ritonavir administered to a patient treated with XANAX. Increase the XANAX dosage to the target dose after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and XANAX together. It is not necessary to reduce XANAX dose in patients who have been taking ritonavir for more than 10 to 14 days.

XANAX is contraindicated with concomitant use of all strong CYP3A inhibitors, except ritonavir [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Risk of bias

Study quality

Risk of bias judgements are summarised in Figure 2. The majority of trials (9/12; 75%) failed to provide complete outcome data. On average, 19 percent (37 out of 191) of the participants in the six trials that provided dropout data did not reach study endpoint; hence the risk of attrition bias is considerable. The authors of one trial reported that "data from only the most clinically pertinent findings" were presented in the paper, although they specified all outcome measures that were initially recorded. Therefore, this trial was judged to have a high risk of selective outcome reporting.

Figure 2.
Risk of bias summary figure.

Publication bias

No unpublished reports of completed RCTs were obtained. Three RCTs were found (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00645450, NCT00648375 and NCT01239173) that had been terminated because of inadequate subject recruitment. The authors of these three discontinued trials were contacted. All responded, but none provided data.

Meta-analyses

Propranolol versus benzodiazepines in panic disorder with or without agoraphobia

Meta-analysis I. Outcome: number of panic attacks after 2 weeks of treatment

Two trials report the effects of propranolol (30–320 mg/day) versus benzodiazepines (1–30 mg/day alprazolam or 5–40 mg/day diazepam) prescribed to adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia for a 2-week period, expressed in mean number of panic attacks after 2 weeks of treatment. Effect size for each study was expressed as a WMD. There was substantial statistical heterogeneity of studies (two trials, 50 participants in total; χ² = 3.04, df = 1, p = 0.08, I² = 67%). No significant difference was found between propranolol and benzodiazepines (mean difference = 1.58, 95%-CI [–2.33; 5.50], Z = 0.79, p = 0.43) (Figure 3(a)).

### Impaired GABA neuronal response to acute benzodiazepine administration in panic disorder [^114qon1Q]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Disturbances in the metabolism of the brain amino acid transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may contribute to the pathophysiology of human anxiety disorders. Animal studies indicate that deletions or reductions in the expression of the gene for the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD₆₅), reduce basal cortical GABA levels or stress-induced release of GABA in the cerebral cortex and increase fear behaviors. Complementing these findings, the authors recently observed lower than normal cortical GABA levels in patients with panic disorder. In the current study, the authors tested the hypothesis that panic disorder patients have a deficient GABA neuronal response to benzodiazepine (clonazepam) administration.

Method

In a parallel-group, repeated-measures design, occipital cortex GABA responses to acute oral, open-label benzodiazepine administration were tested in 10 panic disorder patients and nine healthy comparison subjects. Occipital cortex total GABA levels were measured before and after medication administration by means of a novel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique.

Results

Panic disorder patients had a deficient GABA neuronal response (blunted reduction of occipital cortex GABA level) to acute benzodiazepine administration, compared to the healthy subjects, who exhibited a significant decrease in occipital cortex GABA levels after this intervention. The patients also appeared to have persistently low occipital cortex GABA after chronic benzodiazepine treatment.

Conclusions

Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that a trait-like abnormality in GABA neuronal function contributes to the pathogenesis of human panic disorder. The data raise the possibility that GAD₆₅ enzyme dysfunction could be a pathogenic factor in panic disorder.

### Alprazolam [^114P3H6b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Alprazolam tablets were compared to placebo in double-blind clinical studies (doses up to 4 mg per day) in patients with a diagnosis of anxiety or anxiety with associated depressive symptomatology. Alprazolam tablets were significantly better than placebo at each of the evaluation periods of these 4-week studies as judged by the following psychometric instruments: Physician's Global Impressions, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Target Symptoms, Patient's Global Impressions, and Self-Rating Symptom Scale.

14.2 Panic Disorder

The effectiveness of alprazolam tablets in the treatment of panic disorder was studied in 3 short-term, placebo-controlled studies (up to 10 weeks) in patients with diagnoses closely corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder.

The average dose of alprazolam tablets was 5 mg to 6 mg per day in 2 of the studies, and the doses of alprazolam tablets were fixed at 2 mg and 6 mg per day in the third study. In all 3 studies, alprazolam tablets were superior to placebo on a variable defined as "the number of patients with zero panic attacks" (range, 37% to 83% met this criterion), as well as on a global improvement score. In 2 of the 3 studies, alprazolam tablets were superior to placebo on a variable defined as "change from baseline on the number of panic attacks per week" (range, 3.3 to 5.2), and also on a phobia rating scale. A subgroup of patients who improved on alprazolam tablets during short-term treatment in 1 of these trials was continued on an open basis up to 8 months, without apparent loss of benefit.

### Clonazepam [^111UoMLp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome).

Data

[Enter Generic Section here]

Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.

Animal Data

In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, a similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed at all doses, in a low, non-dose-related incidence. The lowest dose tested is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and similar to the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m2basis. Reductions in maternal weight gain occurred at doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryofetal growth occurred in one study at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day.

No adverse maternal or embryofetal effects were observed in mice or rats following oral administration of clonazepam during organogenesis of doses up to 15 or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m2basis).

Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines.

### Comparative safety of chronic versus intermittent benzodiazepine prescribing in older adults: a population-based cohort study [^111h36bw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

In illustrating excess risks for chronic use over intermittent use, we have captured an issue with benzodiazepines, which cannot be revealed by studies that simply undertake meta-analysis of side effects in short-term trials. A good example of such a study is the recent meta-analysis of, which compared the side effect burden of benzodiazepines in panic disorder treatment trials of up to 12 weeks duration to that of SSRIs, concluding that incidence of adverse effects was slightly lower in people randomized to benzodiazepines. While such a meta-analysis is informative, it cannot address the issue of excess harms of benzodiazepines with chronic use over the longer periods we have examined in this study.

While this study illustrates that chronic benzodiazepine use carries enhanced risks of most of the adverse outcomes relative to intermittent use, especially in older men, it must be recognized that the excess risk described is merely one factor to be taken into consideration when deciding whether ongoing benzodiazepine use is acceptable or unacceptable for a given patient who has been taking these drugs for long periods and is deriving benefit, especially where there has been no evidence of dose escalation or tolerance to the therapeutic effect. Clearly, when discussing the way forward with patients in this situation, the excess risks we have enumerated here must be considered against the risks of withdrawal and rebound of symptoms of their original disorder which may occur if established benzodiazepine treatment is reduced in dose and/or frequency, as well as the potential adverse effects of other medications that might be introduced to allow this to happen.

### First-line pharmacotherapy approaches for generalized anxiety disorder [^112HSjqf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Many patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) do not receive adequate treatment. Several classes of drugs, including benzodiazepines, azapirones, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, alpha(2)delta Ca++ channel modulators, and atypical antipsychotics are consistently beneficial in patients with GAD. Cognitive therapy is also effective as a first-line treatment. When individualizing treatment, drug dose ranges and side effect profiles need to be considered, as well as the patient's comorbid conditions. Doses may need to be reduced for elderly or medically ill patients or those taking other medications. Doses may need to be increased for refractory cases. Common comorbid conditions with GAD include depression, alcohol or drug abuse, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. In patients with significant depression, an antidepressant is more likely to succeed than a benzodiazepine. Generalized anxiety disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. Remission is attainable but can take several months, and stopping medication increases the risk of relapse within the first year of initiating treatment.

### Poor treatment response in panic disorder patients with suicide attempts and their symptom network characteristics [^112zzDLr]. Depression and Anxiety (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with PD were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry of the CHA Bundang Medical Center (Seongnam, Republic of Korea) between December 2013 and June 2022. The HCs were registered in the local community using online and print advertising. Through individual interviews, trained psychiatrists confirmed that the HCs had no personal history of psychiatric disorders.

Patients with PD satisfied the criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or Fifth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), based on diagnoses proposed by trained psychiatrists using the Structured Clinical Interview based on the DSM-5 (SCID-5). We only included patients with PD with or without agoraphobia in the principal diagnosis, even though they had depressive disorders as an additional diagnosis, since the PD with/without agoraphobia mainly cooccurs with major depression in the natural course of PD and the aim of our study was to investigate the key clinical presentations of PD except other anxiety disorders. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) other major psychiatric comorbidities, including anxiety disorders other than PD, schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar and related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders; (2) neurodevelopmental disorders; (3) neurocognitive disorders; (4) major medical disorders; and (5) pregnancy. Additionally, all patients with PD treated with individual or group psychotherapy, including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), were excluded from the study.

Figure 1(b) shows the timeline for the evaluation of PD patients. We measured the symptom severity of patients with PD at their baseline unmedicated status. After baseline, all patients with PD received pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, including paroxetine, escitalopram, or sertraline (escitalopram equivalence dosage = 10.23 ± 7.06 (mean ± SD) mg/day), and benzodiazepine (BDZ) as alprazolam or clonazepam was primarily permitted on a pro re nata (as required) basis. Some patients with PD undergo pharmacological treatment with antidepressants and anxiolytics according to the Korean medication algorithm for PD or the Clinical Practice Guidelines: Treatment of PD. Clinical interviews and several instruments were conducted during each patient's first visit to the hospital to evaluate the various factors affecting pharmacological treatment response in PD.

Support for the effectiveness of alprazolam in the treatment of panic disorder came from three short-term, placebo-controlled studies (up to 10 weeks) in patients with diagnoses closely corresponding to DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder.

The average dose of alprazolam was 5–6 mg/day in two of the studies, and the doses of alprazolam were fixed at 2 and 6 mg/day in the third study. In all three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as "the number of patients with zero panic attacks" (range, 37–83% met this criterion), as well as on a global improvement score. In two of the three studies, alprazolam was superior to placebo on a variable defined as "change from baseline on the number of panic attacks per week" (range, 3.3–5.2), and also on a phobia rating scale. A subgroup of patients who were improved on alprazolam during short-term treatment in one of these trials was continued on an open basis up to 8 months, without apparent loss of benefit.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115MP9y2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

For other antidepressants, SNRIs, when compared with placebo, were more efficacious in attaining remission, similar for dropout, and had significantly more associated adverse events. However, SNRIs were ranked lower than SSRIs for achieving remission and adverse events and might represent a second line treatment option for panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants were found to be statistically superior to placebo for dropout, remission, anxiety, and depression scores but worse for adverse events. Despite their efficacy, tricyclic antidepressants are associated with adverse effects, which are further exacerbated when combined with benzodiazepines. As such, the clinical use of tricyclic antidepressants alone or combined with benzodiazepines is limited because of the extent of the associated adverse effects.

For additional treatment options not included in previous meta-analyses, monoamine oxidase inhibitors were found to be significantly superior to placebo for remission but were not different from placebo for other outcomes. However, monoamine oxidase inhibitors have severely limited use in real world practice given their adverse effects profile, increased risk of hypertensive crisis, and multiple drug interactions. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors did not show much effect compared with placebo, although some guidelines have recognised their use as a potential treatment option for panic disorder. Given the limited evidence available and lack of demonstrable benefit, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors might not be a suitable treatment for panic disorder. Evidence is also insufficient to recommend the use of noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants given their associated high rate of drowsiness and weight gain, and this is in line with current recommendations from the American Psychological Association. Given the low quality of the studies with identified adverse effects, high dropout rate, and no demonstrable efficacy, buspirone should not be currently considered a viable treatment option for panic disorder.

### Combination therapy for patients with panic disorder… [^111mfUPX]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of panic disorder using a combination of benzodiazepines and antidepressants is a common clinical practice. Currently, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in particular, are recommended for treatment of panic disorder. However, few studies have examined the short- and long-term benefits of combining benzodiazepines with SSRIs. In one study, patients with panic disorder benefited immediately when a benzodiazepine was added to an SSRI treatment regimen, but the positive short-term results were offset by long-term problems. Goddard and colleagues studied the benefits of early coadministration of benzodiazepines and SSRIs in the rapid stabilization of panic disorder. The study participants attended a university anxiety clinic and were diagnosed with panic disorder based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.

To qualify, participants had to have at least one panic attack per week for one month before the study. Patients who qualified for the study were treated with a flexible dosage of sertraline in an open-label fashion with a target dosage of 100 mg per day for 12 weeks. This group was randomized to receive either placebo or clonazepam in a dosage of 0. 5 mg three times per day, followed by three weeks of tapering doses. All of the participants were assessed for panic disorder and anxiety level before the study and weekly during the treatment phase. Efficacy and safety issues were also monitored during these visits. Participants who received the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine had a better response at the end of weeks 1 and 3 of treatment than those who received placebo. The patients taking combination therapy scored better on the anxiety and panic disorder scales used during the study. By week 4, both groups had similar scores on these scales.

Adverse reactions were the same in both groups, although participants taking SSRIs and benzodiazepines were more likely to develop diarrhea. There were no significant differences in dropout data in both groups. The authors conclude that early coadministration of clonazepam and sertraline appears to be a safe and effective treatment for early stabilization of patients with moderate to severe panic disorder. Further studies are needed to better define the optimal timing of benzodiazepine use for treatment of this disorder.

### Personality and symptom sensitivity predictors of alprazolam withdrawal in panic disorder [^1128DJN9]. Psychological Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Discontinuation of benzodiazepine (BZ) treatment results in a well-characterized withdrawal syndrome in 40–50% of anxious patients. While numerous studies have established the role of BZ dose, treatment duration, half-life, potency, rate of withdrawal and severity of underling anxiety disorder in predicting severity of withdrawal symptoms, fewer studies have examined the role of psychological and personality factors.

Method

In 123 panic disorder patients undergoing gradual tapered discontinuation of alprazolam in conjunction with pre-treatment with carbamazepine or placebo, the relationship between measures of 'symptom sensitivity' and 'harm avoidance', and severity of withdrawal symptoms measured as peak severity of symptoms, time before taper needed to be slowed due to symptoms, and ability to complete taper, was examined.

Results

After controlling for the less substantial effects of dose, treatment duration, pre-taper anxiety and panic attack frequency, measures of symptom sensitivity and harm avoidance accounted for an additional 3–6% of withdrawal variance.

Conclusions

These results show an effect of symptom sensitivity and harm avoidance on BZ withdrawal symptoms, comparable to prior findings linking dependent personality characteristics to withdrawal severity. Failure to show the expected effect on ability to complete taper may be due to either the more symptomatic nature of the patients in this study.

### Alprazolam (Niravam) [^1122eWyD]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The importance of dose and the risks of alprazolam as a treatment for panic disorder

Because the management of panic disorder often requires the use of average daily doses of alprazolam above 4 mg, the risk of dependence among panic disorder patients may be higher than that among those treated for less severe anxiety. Experience in randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation studies of patients with panic disorder showed a high rate of rebound and withdrawal symptoms in patients treated with alprazolam compared to placebo-treated patients.

Relapse or return of illness was defined as a return of symptoms characteristic of panic disorder (primarily panic attacks) to levels approximately equal to those seen at baseline before active treatment was initiated. Rebound refers to a return of symptoms of panic disorder to a level substantially greater in frequency, or more severe in intensity than seen at baseline. Withdrawal symptoms were identified as those which were generally not characteristic of panic disorder and which occurred for the first time more frequently during discontinuation than at baseline.

In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113r1t5q]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values. Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit (remission) with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events.

Comparison with other studies

Multiple options exist for the treatment of panic disorder; however, previous evidence has been mainly limited to placebo comparisons. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported benzodiazepines as the most efficacious in reducing panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety symptoms. Despite this clear evidence of benefit, benzodiazepines have not been recommended as the primary treatment option for panic disorder owing to potential adverse events (sedation, impaired memory and cognitive function, and increased risk of falling, especially in elderly people) and long term risks of dependency and withdrawals. This was consistent with our findings of associated risks.

SSRIs as a drug class have been recommended as the primary treatment for panic disorder. However, evidence or comparative studies to identify the most efficacious individual drug has been insufficient. In our study we specifically evaluated each SSRI to determine the most suitable as treatment for panic disorder. Our findings suggest that fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were more efficacious than placebo for achieving remission. SSRIs combined with β blockers, were associated with reduced anxiety symptoms and were top ranked for improving both anxiety and depression symptoms. SSRIs were not considered to be the best treatment for dropout, especially compared with benzodiazepines, which might be associated with a delayed onset of action that can take several weeks. When the benefits of remission and low adverse events are considered against potential agitation and early dropout, SSRIs were considered the best treatment option. Sertraline and escitalopram in particular offered the best balance between benefit (remission) and risk (adverse events) and were the top ranked among individual SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder. The findings for escitalopram, however, were based on a single study and as such should be interpreted with caution. There are concerns about using escitalopram at supratherapeutic dose (30 mg/day) as it has been shown to increase the risk of QT prolongation. However, the risk of serious arrythmias is rare when escitalopram is prescribed at treatment dosage (10–20 mg/day).

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111LK8VM]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders

Patients with BD frequently experience symptoms of anxiety and comorbid anxiety disorders (GAD, panic disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder and others). Clinical samples indicate that 24%‐56% of patients with BD meet criteria for one or more anxiety disorders, with the highest rates in women. 720 Comorbid anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders are associated with a higher number of mood episodes and depressive symptoms, including suicidality and sleep disturbance, and greater impairment of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. 721 The presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder is also associated with high rates of use of antidepressants, 722 which should be employed with caution due to their potential for mood destabilization (Section 4).

While the CANMAT Task Force report 720 described key studies and treatment recommendations in length, those recommendations have been updated below. However, it remains the case that there are few studies that have focused exclusively on anxiety symptoms or disorders comorbid with BD, whether for treatment efficacy or safety. While there are treatment options, the limitations resulting from a paucity of data prevent the development of clear guidelines or treatment algorithms.

A "step‐wise" approach was recommended in the 2012 CANMAT recommendations for managing comorbid anxiety. In general, mood stabilization is the priority before specific anxiety treatments are considered (Figure 9). Despite clinical experience, antidepressants, particularly serotoninergic agents, should be employed with caution due to their potential to provoke mood destabilization. While benzodiazepines are an important clinical tool because they can rapidly alleviate anxiety, clinicians should strive to prescribe them at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period possible, given the concerns about suicide risk, abuse and dependence. CBT continues to be an appropriate first‐line treatment for anxiety.

2.2.1.1 Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)

Eligible participants completed a structured psychiatric interview to confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (bipolar disorder type 1 [BD-I], bipolar disorder type 2 [BD-II], schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified) using an adapted version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The MINI was administered by trained research psychologists (KJSL, HP). Best-estimate lifetime diagnoses were made based on the MINI data by two members of the NCMH team: a research psychologist (HP) and a psychiatrist (IJ) and consensus was reached through discussion where necessary. For inclusion in analyses, participants were required to meet criteria for BD-I or BD-II. The MINI was also used to assess current diagnoses of panic disorder (PD) and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) according to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The presence of anxiety disorder was defined as a diagnosis of GAD and/or PD according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. We focused solely on GAD and PD as these are the most prevalent anxiety disorder comorbidities in individuals with bipolar disorder. Likewise, these diagnoses have previously been associated with sleep disturbances, whereas the association between sleep disturbances and other anxiety disorders (e.g. social anxiety disorder) are less well supported by reliable empirical evidence.

2.2.1.2 Medication

During the baseline interview, participants self-reported all current medications (prescribed and "over the counter"), their typical daily dosages and the start date of each drug. Medications that participants reported they were taking were allocated into the following classification groups for analysis: antidepressants, antipsychotics (atypical and typical variants), mood stabilisers (including lithium), as well as anxiolytics (diazepam, temazepam, clonazepam) and sleep medications (zopiclone). These medications have previously been shown to have varying effects on sleep (e.g. some antipsychotics can promote sedation and improve sleep quality, whereas certain antidepressant medications can impair sleep).

### The role of extended-release benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety: a risk-benefit evaluation with a focus on extended-release alprazolam [^114y6iso]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself. The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation. The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation. This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.
