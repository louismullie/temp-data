## Question

Skin flare-ups associated with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the skin "flare-ups" in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) — what they represent, how they map to warm vs cold subtypes, how they fit within diagnostic criteria, their mechanisms, severity spectrum, treatment implications, prognosis, and special populations considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "skin flare-ups" in the context of CRPS and anchor them to the Budapest Criteria. Then, I should verify the evidence for warm and cold phenotypes and reconcile conflicting descriptions of sweating and temperature. Next, I will review specific cutaneous findings across vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and trophic domains and their diagnostic weight, followed by severe dermatologic manifestations. After that, I need to examine mechanisms linking skin signs to inflammation, autonomic dysregulation, and central neuroplasticity. Finally, I will consider treatment implications by subtype, prognostic signals, pediatric considerations, underrecognition in dermatology, and synthesize practical takeaways with careful citation and self-verification throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us: in CRPS, "skin flare-ups" are not incidental rashes but core autonomic, vascular, and trophic changes that cluster within the Budapest Criteria's vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and motor/trophic domains; these are distinguishing clinical signals that help establish the diagnosis alongside disproportionate pain and exclusion of better explanations, and they reflect the underlying pathophysiology rather than transient epiphenomena [^111NsCXg] [^115z1LKj] [^116Yk6v1].

> Next, I should review the warm vs cold CRPS subtypes because they frame the skin phenotype over time; an international multisite cohort using unbiased cluster analysis demonstrated a warm subtype with a warm, red, edematous extremity and a cold subtype with a cold, blue, less edematous extremity, with median durations of approximately 4.7 months and 20 months respectively, suggesting that warm is more common in acute CRPS whereas cold predominates in chronic presentations, with similar pain intensity across groups [^117VgrTT].

> Wait, let me verify the sweating pattern because descriptions can conflict; I initially recalled that the warm subtype is "sweaty", but a large guideline synthesis characterizes warm as warm, red, dry, and edematous and cold as cold, blue, sweaty, and less edematous, whereas the original cluster report emphasized warmth, redness, edema, and sweating for the warm group, so I need to reconcile this by noting that sudomotor findings likely vary by stage and individual, with hyperhidrosis more prominent early and hypohidrosis emerging with chronic vasoconstrictive states, meaning clinicians should prioritize the broader warm–cold vasomotor polarity over a fixed sweating rule [^117VgrTT] [^111Lpee9] [^111NsCXg].

> I will now classify the skin manifestations by diagnostic domain so we stay anchored to the criteria: vasomotor features include temperature asymmetry often exceeding 1°C and color asymmetry with erythema, cyanosis, or mottling; sudomotor/edema features include edema and sweating abnormalities with side-to-side asymmetry; and trophic features include atrophic, shiny skin, hair changes, and nail dystrophy, which tend to evolve later, all of which function as observable signs that strengthen diagnostic confidence when present on exam [^115z1LKj] [^111NsCXg] [^114xFipW].

> Hold on, I should also recognize the severe dermatologic end of the spectrum so I don't understate risk; although uncommon, true skin pathology can occur, including non-healing wounds and bullae that dramatically improved with spinal cord stimulation in a reported case, leukocytoclastic vasculitis presenting with petechiae, severe nail dystrophy, and even apparent lidocaine insensitivity suggesting cutaneous nerve fiber dysfunction, which together underscore that CRPS skin involvement can extend beyond functional dysautonomia into overt dermatologic disease in select patients [^111seXUM] [^114xFipW].

> Let me think about how much diagnostic weight to assign to these skin findings; there is no gold-standard test for CRPS, so diagnosis is clinical using validated criteria, with the Budapest Criteria improving specificity compared to the older IASP criteria while preserving high sensitivity, and the CRPS Severity Score (CSS) offering a continuous index to track change over time; objective skin signs are particularly valuable because they are observable, and although tools like prolonged skin temperature monitoring can aid differentiation, they are not routinely practical in clinic [^115pSp1h] [^117CbUma] [^114hCkZE] [^1169jgUt].

> I need to ensure I connect the skin signs to mechanisms; in early warm CRPS, neurogenic inflammation features elevated cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α and mast cell accumulation, promoting edema and erythema, whereas autonomic and vascular mechanisms including an endothelin-1 and nitric oxide synthase imbalance and adrenergic receptor upregulation drive vasomotor instability and sweating abnormalities across subtypes; central sensitization and hemisensory disturbances can perpetuate or even spatially modulate these peripheral phenomena, linking cortex and brainstem dynamics to cutaneous temperature and perception [^114Q5Sev] [^111NsCXg] [^1128rHXW].

> But wait, what if "flare-ups" are being used to guide therapy; I should tie phenotype to management gently and mechanism-based where possible: for warm/inflammatory presentations in the early phase, a carefully selected short course of corticosteroids may help if started promptly, and bisphosphonates may benefit a subset with osteopenic features, while for cold/chronic autonomic presentations, sympathetic blocks can help identify sympathetically maintained pain and, when integrated with active reactivation therapy, can sometimes assist, with neuromodulation considered in refractory cases, always within a framework that prioritizes functional restoration and graded desensitization [^111XHd2b] [^117Bkjyr] [^113SCH7c] [^1146KjpQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cure; prognosis varies, and although many improve over time, about 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, with an early cold limb signaling poorer outcomes, and intriguingly, skin autonomic and trophic changes can persist even when pain abates in so-called "painless CRPS", indicating partially autonomous trajectories for the cutaneous phenotype beyond pain intensity alone [^112e8fP9] [^113LeSz5] [^111NsCXg].

> Next, I should review special populations so we don't overgeneralize; pediatric CRPS often shows similar skin manifestations but generally carries a better prognosis with intensive physiotherapy and psychological support, and while invasive options exist, they are typically reserved for refractory cases after a structured rehabilitation-first approach, emphasizing family education to avoid disuse and solicitous behaviors that can worsen disability [^11599hAr] [^116zCLvH] [^115knSy3] [^116Ze8Rn].

> I need to check the dermatology perspective because underrecognition is common; dermatologists may encounter unilateral vasculitis-like changes, nail dystrophy, or localized hypotrichosis with neuropathic pain and temperature asymmetry, and given how few dermatologic papers explicitly address CRPS skin features, heightened suspicion and cross-disciplinary referral are warranted to avoid mislabeling primary skin disease when the pattern and history suggest CRPS [^114xFipW] [^111NsCXg].

> Let me briefly consider supportive imaging and histology, even though they are not diagnostic standards; hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies have demonstrated increased metabolic activity in muscle and neurovascular bundles and occasionally skin in CRPS-affected regions, and skin-focused research has outlined early trophic and microvascular alterations with inflammatory signaling, which together may contextualize the cutaneous phenotype but should not replace clinical criteria [^116bcbLn] [^114AVVEp] [^114Q5Sev].

> In synthesis, I should emphasize that CRPS "skin flare-ups" are constitutive manifestations of the syndrome that map onto warm versus cold phenotypes, inform mechanism-aware care, and carry diagnostic and prognostic value; reconciling sweating patterns requires attention to timing and individual variability, diagnosis remains clinical via Budapest Criteria with objective skin signs as anchors, and management should prioritize functional restoration while selectively leveraging anti-inflammatory, sympathetic, or neuromodulatory strategies as phenotype and timing dictate [^111NsCXg] [^115z1LKj] [^117VgrTT] [^113SCH7c].

---

CRPS skin flare-ups are driven by **neurogenic inflammation** [^111NsCXg] and **autonomic dysregulation** [^114Q5Sev], producing episodic redness, warmth, swelling, and sweating changes that often accompany pain flares [^111Lpee9]. Triggers include minor trauma [^117RCNQ9], stress, temperature shifts [^112yzZnX], and overuse. Management centers on **multidisciplinary care** [^112dKriF] [^111NsCXg], including physical therapy, psychological support, and medications such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids [^111XHd2b], and neuropathic agents [^111xfxme]; sympathetic blocks [^111xfxme] and neuromodulation are options for refractory cases [^113SCH7c]. Early recognition and treatment are essential to limit chronicity and disability [^116Yk6v1].

## Clinical features of skin flare-ups

CRPS skin flare-ups are characterized by **episodic changes** in skin appearance and sensation, including:

- **Redness (erythema)**: Often accompanied by warmth and swelling, indicative of acute inflammation [^114Q5Sev].

- **Temperature changes**: The affected limb may feel warm or cold compared to the contralateral limb, reflecting autonomic dysregulation [^111Lpee9] [^112yzZnX].

- **Sweating abnormalities**: Hyperhidrosis or hypohidrosis may occur, often asymmetrically [^111HY6Jp].

- **Edema**: Swelling is common, particularly in acute flare-ups [^111NsCXg].

- **Trophic changes**: Chronic flare-ups may lead to skin atrophy, dryness, scaling, and nail dystrophy [^114xFipW].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie CRPS skin flare-ups:

- **Neurogenic inflammation**: Release of neuropeptides (e.g. substance P, CGRP) from sensory nerves causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and mast cell activation, leading to redness, warmth, and swelling [^111HY6Jp].

- **Autonomic dysregulation**: Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction results in abnormal vasomotor and sudomotor responses, causing temperature and sweating abnormalities [^111NsCXg].

- **Immune system activation**: Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) contribute to inflammation and tissue damage [^114Q5Sev].

- **Central sensitization**: Enhanced excitability of central nociceptive pathways amplifies pain and sensory disturbances, often spreading beyond the initial injury site [^1128rHXW].

---

## Triggers and exacerbating factors

In CRPS, skin flare-ups are precipitated by **minor trauma or injury** — even minimal stimuli can provoke significant responses due to heightened sensitivity — and by **emotional stress**, which exacerbates autonomic dysregulation and inflammation [^117NzziS] [^112dKriF]. Temperature changes (cold or heat) [^112yzZnX] can trigger **vasomotor responses**, and physical overuse of the affected limb may also precipitate flare-ups.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and assessment tools

Diagnosis of CRPS, including skin flare-ups, is primarily clinical using the **Budapest Criteria** [^115z1LKj] [^113gE2VG], which require ongoing pain disproportionate to any inciting event; at least one symptom in three of four categories (sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, motor/trophic); and at least one sign in two of four categories (sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, motor/trophic). No other diagnosis should better explain the symptoms. Ancillary tests, such as thermography and skin biopsies, may support the diagnosis but are not definitive [^1169jgUt] [^113WsNgU] [^114Q5Sev].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management of CRPS skin flare-ups requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

- **Pharmacological treatments**: NSAIDs, corticosteroids [^111XHd2b], and neuropathic pain medications (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin) may reduce inflammation and pain [^112e8fP9].

- **Physical therapy**: Gentle, graded exercises and desensitization techniques help restore function and reduce flare-ups [^1146KjpQ].

- **Psychological interventions**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and stress management techniques address psychological factors contributing to flare-ups [^116Ze8Rn].

- **Interventional therapies**: Sympathetic nerve blocks and neuromodulation (e.g. spinal cord stimulation) [^113SCH7c] may be considered in refractory cases.

---

## Impact on quality of life

Skin flare-ups **significantly impair quality of life** [^111cbSDD], causing persistent pain, itching, and burning [^117NzziS]. They also contribute to emotional distress (anxiety, depression, social isolation) and functional limitations, including reduced mobility and difficulty with daily activities [^114mftjV].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

The prognosis of CRPS skin flare-ups varies widely [^112e8fP9] [^111Lpee9]. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical to prevent **chronicity and disability** [^116Yk6v1]. Persistent flare-ups can lead to chronic pain, skin atrophy, and significant functional impairment [^114xFipW] [^111NsCXg].

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Evidence for warm and cold subtypes in a large prospective clinical sample [^111Lpee9]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Limited research suggests that there may be warm complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and cold CRPS subtypes, with inflammatory mechanisms contributing most strongly to the former. This study, for the first time, used an unbiased statistical pattern recognition technique to evaluate whether distinct warm vs. cold CRPS subtypes can be discerned in the clinical population. An international, multisite study was conducted using standardized procedures to evaluate signs and symptoms in 152 patients with clinical CRPS at baseline, with 3-month follow-up evaluations in 112 of these patients.

Two-step cluster analysis using automated cluster selection identified a two-cluster solution as optimal. The results revealed a warm CRPS patient cluster characterized by a warm, red, edematous, and sweaty extremity, and a cold CRPS patient cluster characterized by a cold, blue, and less edematous extremity.

The median pain duration was significantly shorter in the warm CRPS (4.7 months) than in the cold CRPS subtype (20 months), with pain intensity comparable (P < 0.001). A derived total inflammatory score was significantly elevated in the warm CRPS group compared to cold CRPS at baseline but diminished significantly over the follow-up period (P < 0.001), whereas this score did not diminish in the cold CRPS group (time × subtype interaction: P < 0.001).

Results support the existence of a warm CRPS subtype common in patients with acute (< 6 months) CRPS and a relatively distinct cold CRPS subtype most common in chronic CRPS. The pattern of clinical features suggests that inflammatory mechanisms play a significant role in distinguishing these subtypes.

### Pharmacotherapy of complex regional pain syndrome [^111xfxme]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) has both nociceptive/inflammatory and neuropathic elements and is always, by definition, associated with abnormal activity of the sympathetic nervous system. There is compelling evidence that CRPS, as currently conceptualized, ultimately includes central sensitization and has motor abnormalities. The lack of a standard diagnostic test or a specific mechanistically based diagnostic scheme has hindered the conduct of well-designed trials. At the time of writing, there is very little evidence supporting an effective treatment. Fortunately, some randomized controlled trials of drug therapies have been conducted, and systematic reviews have been published of related neuropathic conditions from which results have been extrapolated for clinical use in CRPS.

The following article presents an overview of available data regarding drug and interventional treatment options for CRPS and relevant pharmacotherapies derived from the neuropathy literature. As with most chronic pain syndromes, pharmacotherapy coupled with functional restoration and an interdisciplinary approach to treatment are essential for a successful outcome.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111NsCXg]. The Lancet Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare pain disorder that usually occurs in a limb after trauma. The features of this disorder include severe pain and sensory, autonomic, motor, and trophic abnormalities. Research from the past decade has offered new insights into CRPS epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

Early identification of individuals at high risk of CRPS is improving, with several risk factors established and some others identified in prospective studies during the past five years. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of CRPS has led to its classification as a chronic primary pain disorder, and subtypes of CRPS have been updated. Procedures for diagnosis have also been clarified.

Although effective treatment of CRPS remains a challenge, evidence-based integrated management approaches provide new opportunities to improve patient care. Further advances in diagnosis and treatment of CRPS will require coordinated, international multicentre initiatives.

### Experiences of diagnosis and treatment for upper limb complex regional pain syndrome: A qualitative analysis [^111cbSDD]. Pain Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) most frequently affects the upper limb, with high associated disability. Delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment can adversely impact prognosis and quality of life, but little is known about the healthcare experiences of people with CRPS. This study aimed to explore lived experiences of diagnosis and treatment for people with upper limb CRPS.

- **Methods**: Participants were recruited through online support groups and multiple public and private healthcare settings in the Greater Wellington Region, New Zealand. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who had experienced upper limb CRPS for more than three months and less than three years. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.

- **Results**: Thirteen participants (11 female, 2 male), aged between 43 and 68 years, were interviewed. Duration of CRPS ranged from 7 months to 2.5 years. Five themes were identified. Participants initially engaged in healthcare out of a desire to return to being the person they were before having CRPS. Three interacting experiences epitomized the overall healthcare experience: (1) not knowing what is going on, (2) not being taken seriously, and (3) healthcare as adding another layer of load. Meanwhile, participants used multiple approaches in an attempt to not let CRPS stop them from continuing to live their lives.

- **Conclusions**: Participants in this study felt that credible information, validation, and simplification from healthcare providers and systems would support their process of navigating the condition effectively.

### Predictors of self-reported neglect-like symptoms and involuntary movements in complex regional pain syndrome compared to other chronic limb pain conditions [^117RCNQ9]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

We asked whether respondents had experienced pain on most days for three or more months, and if so, how long they had been experiencing pain. We also inquired about the average hours of pain per day, whether they had received a medical diagnosis for their pain condition, what this diagnosis was, and which type of medical professional, if any, had provided the diagnosis. Fifteen pain-related medical diagnoses were predefined, including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), although no distinction was made between CRPS I and II, as many respondents may not know which type they have. An "other" option was available, accompanied by a free-text box for respondents to specify additional diagnoses. Multiple items were counted as separate diagnoses.

Respondents were asked to indicate where in their body they experienced pain over the past week. Pain intensity was measured using the Numeric Pain Rating scale. Respondents selected a number on a sliding scale from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst pain imaginable") to best reflect the average level of their pain over the last week for each body part affected. The pain ratings for the most painful limb were used for the study. Respondents were also asked what event or injury triggered the onset of their pain condition. Seven events/injuries were predefined, and an "other" option with a free-text box was included.

Two survey questions provided insight into how many pain triggers and bodily changes reflecting symptoms of CRPS were reported. These questions, created for another study, asked which, if any, of 13 predefined triggers and associated bodily changes were experienced.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 4th edition [^114K7xdp]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

This is the fourth edition of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy). Expert practitioners from each discipline traditionally used in treating CRPS reviewed the available and relevant literature systematically. Due to the paucity of levels 1 and 2 studies, less rigorous, preliminary research reports were included. The literature review was supplemented with knowledge gained from extensive empirical clinical experience, particularly in areas lacking high-quality evidence to guide therapy.

The research quality, clinical relevance, and the "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed in considerable detail, aimed at the expert practitioner in each therapeutic area. Levels of evidence are mentioned when available, enabling practitioners to better assess and analyze the modality under discussion, and if desired, to consider the citations personally. Tables provide details on the characteristics of studies in different subject domains described in the literature.

In the humanitarian spirit of utilizing all available thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case-by-case analysis of the risk/cost versus benefit, the authors offer these "practical" guidelines.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^116rRaZU]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) may develop after limb trauma and is characterized by pain, sensory-motor, and autonomic symptoms. Recent results from neurophysiological research are important for understanding the pathophysiology of CRPS.

- **Mechanisms for CRPS symptoms**: These may be present subsequently or in parallel during the course of CRPS. Key mechanisms include trauma-related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetically maintained pain, and cortical reorganization in response to chronic pain (neuroplasticity). Recognizing these mechanisms in individual CRPS patients is a prerequisite for mechanism-oriented treatment.

### A prospective, multisite, international validation of the complex regional pain syndrome severity score [^114hCkZE]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a dichotomous (yes/no) categorization, necessary for clinical decision-making. Such diagnostic categories fail to convey subtle gradations in the condition's severity over time and have poor statistical power when used as an outcome measure in research. This prospective, international, multicenter study slightly modified and evaluated the validity of the CRPS Severity Score (CSS), a continuous index of CRPS severity.

Using a prospective design, medical evaluations were conducted in 156 patients with CRPS to compare changes over time in CSS scores between patients initiating a new treatment program and those on stable treatment regimens. New versus stable categorizations were supported by greater changes in pain and function in the former. Results indicated that CSS values in the stable treatment group exhibited much less change over time relative to the new treatment group, with intraclass correlations nearly twice as large in the former. A calculated smallest real difference value revealed that a change in the CSS of ≥ 4.9 scale points would indicate real differences in CRPS symptomatology (with 95% confidence).

Across groups, larger changes in CRPS features on the CSS over time were associated, in the expected direction, with greater changes in pain intensity, fatigue, social functioning, ability to engage in physical roles, and general well-being. The overall pattern of findings further supports the validity of the CSS as a measure of CRPS severity.

### Mechanism-based treatment in complex regional pain syndromes [^112dKriF]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS) are multifactorial disorders with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. Management of CRPS is challenging, partly due to a lack of clinical data regarding the efficacy of various therapies, and partly because successful treatment of CRPS requires a multidisciplinary, patient-tailored approach. The pain in CRPS is often described as typical 'burning' neuropathic pain and is accompanied by a variety of sensory, motor, and autonomic signs and symptoms. Research into therapies specifically for CRPS has been scarce; thus, treatment for these syndromes has largely been based on therapeutic strategies adapted from neuropathic pain states. However, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of CRPS has provided the opportunity to develop mechanism-based treatments.

The interactions between the multiple pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the development, progression, and maintenance of CRPS remain poorly understood. This review describes the challenges in linking theories and knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms to the modes of action of different treatment approaches. We discuss the treatment strategies for CRPS, including pharmacotherapy, sympathetic ganglion block interventions, psychological support, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy, and establish the concept of mechanism-based treatment for CRPS.

### Recommendations for a first core outcome measurement set for complex regional pain syndrome clinical studies (COMPACT) [^113sbvjV]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a persistent pain condition that remains incompletely understood and challenging to treat. Historically, a wide range of different outcome measures have been used to capture the multidimensional nature of CRPS. This has been a significant limiting factor in the advancement of our understanding of the mechanisms and management of CRPS. In 2013, an international consortium of patients, clinicians, researchers, and industry representatives was established to develop and agree on a minimum core set of standardized outcome measures for use in future CRPS clinical research, including but not limited to clinical trials within adult populations. The development of a core measurement set was informed through workshops and supplementary work, using an iterative consensus process.

- **Research question**: "What is the clinical presentation and course of CRPS, and what factors influence it?" This was agreed as the most pertinent research question that our standardized set of patient-reported outcome measures should be selected to answer.

- **Domains**: The domains encompassing the key concepts necessary to answer the research question were agreed as follows: pain, disease severity, participation and physical function, emotional and psychological function, self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and patient's global impression of change.

The final core measurement set included the optimum generic or condition-specific patient-reported questionnaire outcome measures, which captured the essence of each domain, and one clinician-reported outcome measure to capture the degree of severity of CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116BE912]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. The syndrome is biomedically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, and frequently contains psychosocial components that are pivotal diagnostic features and critical treatment targets. The variability in patient presentations and the fact that these presentations often change over time complicate successful identification and treatment.

To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known. Evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly, due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis. Moreover, when research data are available, they are sometimes challenging to interpret.

Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how should a specialist embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach.

Interdisciplinary treatment is defined here as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable, but more accessible, is multidisciplinary treatment, where a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113xBZEx]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Since autoantibodies have increasingly been implicated in CRPS pathophysiology, it is possible that a combination of several of these drugs may be useful, but definitive trials are currently lacking. Emerging immune treatment strategies include a reduction of the autoantibody-serum titer and modification of antibody downstream effects. A number of other therapeutic agents developed for the treatment of other antibody-mediated conditions are available for testing in CRPS (B-cell or plasma-cell targeting drugs, FcRn receptor blockers, level 4), but trials are currently lacking.

- **Bisphosphonates**: Bisphosphonates have immune-modulatory properties and modulate bone metabolism. One RCT, in patients with very early "CRPS" (who had an average disease duration of 5 weeks from trauma), has shown some efficacy with bisphosphonate treatment (level 2), however, these results have not, at the time of writing, been reproduced elsewhere. Although several small bisphosphonate trials reported efficacy in persistent CRPS, two recent large pharma-sponsored trials were either not reported or were reported as negative (level 2; see ClinicalTrials.gov). Proponents highlight that it is possible that bisphosphonates will improve selected sub-types of CRPS, but given the occurrence of rare serious side effects RCTs are required to confirm such beneficial effects (level 4). It has been hypothesized that bisphosphonates may work best for CRPS characterized by osteopenia ("Sudeck's Atrophy"); this subset of CRPS patients may perhaps be identified by bone density or triple-phase bone scanning abnormalities (level 4).

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^113eQtJY]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2) by two raters (A.H. and K.B.). QUADAS-2 is a recommended tool for use in systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies. This tool evaluates risk of bias and applicability in four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. Each of these domains receives a rating of high, low, or unclear for risk of bias, with the first three also rated for applicability.

Risk of bias in each domain is assessed using signaling questions to identify potential concerns. For example, study patient selection should be performed without inappropriate exclusion criteria, and the interpretation of the index and reference standard tests must be conducted without knowledge of the results of the other. Applicability is rated based on whether the study matched the review questions.

The index test is the novel test being evaluated for diagnostic accuracy, while the reference standard is used as a comparator. Ideally, a reference standard is 100% sensitive and specific, revealing the absolute truth about a diagnosis, whether positive or negative (often referred to as a gold standard test). For this review, the selection of the reference standard test was based on study design, where an existing tool or physician diagnosis was typically used as the reference test. Given that no widely accepted and evaluated reference standard exists, no tool used as the reference standard received higher than an "unclear" score for risk of bias.

### Pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: A review [^11599hAr]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic, intensified localized pain condition. It can affect children, adolescents, and adults, with a higher prevalence among adolescent girls. Symptoms include limb pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, swelling or changes in skin color of the affected limb, dry mottled skin, hyperhidrosis, and trophic changes of the nails and hair. Although the exact mechanism of CRPS is unknown, several different mechanisms have been suggested.

The diagnosis is clinical, aided by the adult criteria for CRPS. Standard care consists of a multidisciplinary approach with the implementation of intensive physical therapy alongside psychological counseling. Pharmacological treatments may aid in reducing pain to allow the patient to participate fully in intensive physiotherapy. The prognosis in pediatric CRPS is favorable.

### Clinical expression profiles of complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia and a-specific repetitive strain injury: more common denominators than pain [^1149WiJV]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

To systematically evaluate and compare the clinical manifestations, disease course, risk factors and demographic characteristics of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS), fibromyalgia (FM) and a-specific repetitive strain injury (RSI), a literature search was performed using terms related to the aforementioned topics and diseases. Only original clinical studies that included at least 20 subjects were eligible.

Results from fifty-nine studies on CRPS, seventy-three on FM, and seven on a-specific RSI were identified. These diseases show similarities in age distribution, male-female ratio, pain characteristics, and sensory signs and symptoms.

- **Motor, autonomic and trophic changes**: Frequently reported in CRPS but only occasionally in FM and RSI.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Found in patients with CRPS and FM, and in a subgroup of patients with RSI.
- **Symptom onset and spread**: In all three disorders, symptoms usually start locally but may spread to other body regions later. For FM, this spread is a prerequisite for diagnosis. Disease onset is always, usually, or occasionally of traumatic origin in RSI, CRPS, and FM, respectively.
- **Psychological factors**: Anxiety and depression are more frequent in patients compared to controls, but likely not very different from patients with other pain conditions or chronic diseases.

In conclusion, apart from some obvious differences between CRPS, FM, and RSI, the similarities are conspicuous. The common features of CRPS, FM, and a-specific RSI may suggest that a common pathway is involved. However, until patients with these types of symptoms are assessed with a uniform assessment procedure, a thorough understanding remains elusive.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: A systematic review [^115pSp1h]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is highly complex, and given the large number of potential signs and symptoms, it can be challenging to diagnose. There is no gold standard radiological, laboratory, genetic, or electrical diagnostic test for CRPS. Over time, several clinical tools specifying signs and symptoms have been developed; however, they vary in their description of the disease. Having clear diagnostic criteria would allow clinicians to identify the disease accurately and initiate appropriate treatments. A screening tool would further enable clinicians to expedite access to treatments and referrals to specialists. From a research perspective, a consensus on diagnostic criteria would aid in defining study populations, allowing for comparisons between studies.

The primary objective was to identify and summarize the measurement properties and feasibility of screening and diagnostic tools for CRPS in all ages. A secondary objective was to identify and summarize screening and diagnostic tools used for CRPS in children and adolescents up to 21 years of age.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116Ze8Rn]. Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

There is little well-controlled CRPS-specific outcome research on which to base psychological treatment recommendations for the condition. However, clinical experience and available data suggest several specific strategies that may be helpful.

While there are indications that many cases of acute CRPS may resolve relatively quickly without any need for specific psychological intervention, a low-cost and potentially helpful intervention recommended for all acute or chronic CRPS patients is comprehensive education about the condition. Specifically, it is recommended that all patients and their families receive detailed information early in treatment that addresses the negative effects of disuse, the importance of reactivation, the need for an active self-management approach to treatment, and that provides an explanation of how possible psychophysiological interactions could affect the severity of CRPS. Such education may help prevent the development of dysfunctional behavior patterns (e.g. elevated distress and severe disuse) that could contribute to the severity, disability, and chronicity of the condition.

For more chronic CRPS patients or those who do not respond to limited intervention, individualized psychological evaluation is recommended, followed by focused psychological pain management treatment. An overview of several key issues to address in this assessment and treatment is provided below.

### Complex regional pain syndrome (type 1) following steroid injection for stenosing tenosynovitis [^115uaSVh]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by severe pain, swelling, and changes in the skin. Precipitating factors include injury and surgery, and a variety of causes have been described. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman who exhibited features indicative of CRPS following a steroid injection for a 'trigger' thumb.

- **Immune modulation**: Some evidence (level 2) suggests that very early initiation of steroid treatment (approximately 30 mg/day for 2–12 weeks, followed by a taper) may be effective. A systematic review evaluated one of these trials and found it to be low quality. Given the data, a short course of steroids may be indicated in early CRPS with prominent inflammation, but longer courses are unproven and there are numerous serious contraindications to chronic steroid use. In persistent CRPS, intermediate-dose steroids (1 g orally in total, taken over 2 weeks) are rarely effective, and this treatment often causes side effects. High-dose pulsed treatment (3x1g IV), as used in autoimmune conditions, has not been evaluated. A single intrathecal steroid injection was shown to be ineffective.

	- A randomized controlled trial (level 2) of low-dose (0.5 g/kg) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment for persistent CRPS indicated efficacy. However, a subsequent larger trial was negative. Although there is some anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of high-dose IVIG, this has not been formally tested. The TNF-alpha blocker, infliximab, was ineffective in a preliminary RCT (level 3) which was stopped early. Treatment with lenalidomide, which has strong anti-TNF activity, was also not effective, having been assessed in one of the largest RCTs (level 2) in persistent CRPS conducted at the time of writing. A small, open-label randomized trial (level 3) of mycophenolate (1.5 g BID) suggested efficacy, but a larger trial would be needed to confirm these findings. Plasma exchange has been reported effective.

### Complex regional pain syndromes: New pathophysiological concepts and therapies [^111HY6Jp]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), formerly known as Sudeck's dystrophy and causalgia, is a disabling and distressing pain syndrome. This review provides an overview based on the literature concerning the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy of CRPS. CRPS may develop following fractures, limb trauma, or lesions of the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS).

The clinical picture comprises a characteristic triad of symptoms: autonomic disturbances (disturbances of skin temperature, color, and sweating abnormalities), sensory disturbances (pain and hyperalgesia), and motor disturbances (paresis, tremor, dystonia). Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical signs. Several pathophysiological concepts have been proposed to explain the complex symptoms of CRPS, including:

- **Facilitated neurogenic inflammation**: This refers to the heightened inflammatory response observed in CRPS.

- **Pathological sympatho-afferent coupling**: This describes the maladaptive interaction between the sympathetic nervous system and sensory afferents.

- **Neuroplastic changes within the CNS**: These changes may contribute to the persistence and intensification of symptoms.

There is accumulating evidence that genetic factors may predispose individuals to CRPS. Therapy is based on a multidisciplinary approach:

- **Non-pharmacological approaches**: This includes physiotherapy and occupational therapy.

- **Pharmacotherapy**: This is tailored to individual symptoms and includes the use of steroids, free radical scavengers, treatment of neuropathic pain, and agents that interfere with bone metabolism, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates.

- **Invasive therapeutic concepts**: This includes the implantation of spinal cord stimulators.

This review covers new aspects of the pathophysiology and therapy of CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: A narrative review for the practising clinician [^113G4YeL]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a life-altering condition that usually affects the extremities after trauma or nerve injury. The physiologic changes that occur as a result of the inciting injury are complex, as the name of the syndrome implies. The pain and disability associated with CRPS often lead to psychological co-morbidities that create a vicious cycle of pain, isolation, and depression. We review recent developments in the understanding of CRPS and advancements in the management of this syndrome. Further research targeting specific mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of CRPS should lead to the prevention of this condition.

### Pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: a review [^116zCLvH]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric CRPS is a chronic pain syndrome that differs from the adult version. It is more common among adolescent girls, and the distal lower extremity is most commonly affected. Symptoms include limb pain, allodynia, hyperalgesia, swelling and/or changes in skin color of the affected limb, dry and mottled skin, hyperhidrosis, and trophic changes of the nails and hair. The exact mechanism is unknown, although many different mechanisms have been suggested.

The diagnosis is clinical, with the aid of the adult criteria for CRPS. A complete patient history and examination are needed with judicious laboratory and radiographic tests to rule out other possible causes. Once pediatric CRPS is diagnosed, the standard care consists of a multidisciplinary approach with the implementation of intensive physical therapy in conjunction with psychological treatment. Treatment should consider the child and the surrounding environment, including family, academic, and social issues. Pharmacological treatments may aid in reducing pain to allow the patient to participate fully in intensive physiotherapy.

Invasive treatments should be reserved for refractory CRPS cases, after considering the benefits versus the risks in each case. With the knowledge and an intensive approach, the prognosis in pediatric CRPS has improved considerably. Further studies are needed to develop better diagnostic tools, improve understanding of this syndrome, and enhance treatment outcomes and lower recurrence rates.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^112e8fP9]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To help avoid unrealistic expectations, patients should be informed that while there is no treatment proven to cure complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) or reduce symptoms in all patients, the drugs administered during treatment have been shown to help some individuals with CRPS.

- **General considerations**: Recognize that CRPS may be more than just a single unitary condition. Early CRPS, defined as having a duration of up to 6–18 months, can respond differently to interventions than persistent CRPS. Importantly, patients diagnosed with early CRPS are likely to naturally improve, and drugs or nerve blocks effective even for a few months may bridge the time to natural recovery. Approximately 15% of early CRPS patients fail to recover, with an early cold limb being a potential poor prognostic sign.

- **Analgesic tolerance and treatment**: Understand that most patients will, over time, develop analgesic tolerance to available drugs, whereas side effects often persist. Available drugs are not thought to "cure" the condition. Monotherapy is preferred to minimize adverse effects, cost, and patient non-compliance, but rational polypharmacy is often needed to address the various CRPS symptoms and disease subtypes. This should comprise rational combinations of different classes of medications rather than multiple medications from the same class.

- **Medication choices**: The choice of medications should include cost considerations and address other patient needs. Drugs that simultaneously treat multiple symptoms are desirable. For example, tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be relatively effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for relieving neuralgic pain and are also effective for anxiety and depression.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^117KorhH]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

This paper provides a review of the concepts of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and presents diagnostic criteria. The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms of painful disorders, previously addressed as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), remain doubtful.

- **Issues**: The supposition of sympathetic hyperactivity in the development of this syndrome could not be confirmed. To date, no diagnostic test specific for the diagnosis of CRPS is available. The diagnosis relies on clinical findings and the exclusion of conditions that could account for the degree of pain and dysfunction. Pain relief and functional restoration are the primary goals of all therapeutic interventions and should start as early as possible.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^117Bkjyr]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There is some evidence for the efficacy of the classic stellate ganglion block (SGB) and lumbar sympathetic block (LSB) in an apparent subset of subjects (level 3) as above. Apart from possible efficacy as an intervention, a secondary reason these blocks remain in most complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) treatment algorithms is the clinical differentiation of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) from sympathetically independent pain (SIP), and thus, to provide a rationale for a course of sympathetic blockade and perhaps (controversially) neuro-ablation in this subset of CRPS patients with SMP. The empirical utility of the SGB or LSB when used in a short series in conjunction with active reanimation physiotherapy is advocated based on consensus recommendations (level 4). Surprisingly, there is very little good evidence for LSB therapy. Carroll et al. performed a study (level 3) involving the combination of bupivacaine plus botulinum toxin versus bupivacaine alone in a trial including 9 patients undergoing LSB for CRPS. These authors found that the addition of botulinum toxin prolonged the duration of analgesia from a mean of 10 days to 71 days.

- **Other blocks and infusion techniques**: There are numerous case reports supporting the use of brachial plexus blockade in the CRPS literature (level 4). Indications for continuous brachial plexus infusion include peri-operative, post-trauma, post-operative pain relief, vascular compromise, intractable pain from CRPS I and II, and phantom limb pain. The brachial plexus is an ideal location for a continuous regional technique, because of its well-defined peri-vascular compartment and the close approximation of the large number of nerves supplying the upper extremity. Catheters have been placed successfully in this region for pain management.

### Patients with Ehlers Danlos syndrome and CRPS: a possible association [^1164fuJC]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Rare patients are left with chronic pain, vasodysregulation, and other symptoms that define complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), after limb traumas. The predisposing factors are unknown. Genetic factors undoubtedly contribute but have not yet been identified. We report four CRPS patients also diagnosed with the classical or hypermobility forms of Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS), inherited disorders of connective tissue. These patients had been diagnosed using standard diagnostic criteria for CRPS and for EDS. All had sustained joint injury; in three, this had been surgically treated. The association of these two diagnoses leads us to hypothesize that EDS might contribute to the development of CRPS in one or more of the following ways: via stretch injury to nerves traversing hypermobile joints, increased fragility of nerve connective tissue, or nerve trauma from more frequent surgery. We review the clinical presentation of the different Ehlers Danlos syndromes and provide clinical criteria that can be used to screen CRPS patients for EDS for clinical or research purposes.

### Skin biopsy in complex regional pain syndrome: Case series and literature review [^113WsNgU]. Pain Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Accumulating experimental and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I) may be a small fiber neuropathy.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the use of commercially available standard biopsy methods to detect intradermal axon pathology in CRPS-I, and to ascertain if these structural changes can explain quantitative sensory testing (QST) findings in CRPS-I.

- **Study design**: Retrospective review of charts and laboratory data.

- **Setting**: Outpatient clinic.

- **Methods**: Skin biopsies from 43 patients with CRPS-I were stained with PGP 9.5, and epidermal nerve fiber density, sweat gland nerve fiber density, and morphological abnormalities were evaluated. Thirty-five patients had quantitative sensory testing.

- **Results**: Alterations in skin innervation were seen in approximately 20% of CRPS-I patients with commercial processing. There were no patient characteristics, including duration of disease, that predicted a decreased epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD). There was no consistent relationship between QST changes and ENFD measured by standard commercial skin biopsy evaluation procedures.

- **Limitations**: Commercial processing of tissue does not utilize stereologic quantitative analysis of nerve fiber density. Biopsy material is utilized from a proximal and distal source only, and differences in denervation of a partial nerve territory may be missed. The functional attributes of small fibers cannot be assessed.

- **Conclusions**: The negative results indicate that CRPS-I may be associated with changes in the ultramicroscopic small fiber structure.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113SCH7c]. Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Numerous interventional therapies have been described, although they are often poorly studied. The mechanisms and pathophysiology of CRPS are multifactorial, presenting unique challenges due to the dynamic and diverse nature of its clinical symptoms. This section reviews historical evidence for the use of various traditional therapies in CRPS treatment, including sympathetic nerve blocks (SNB), intravenous regional anesthetic techniques (IVRA), other blocks (such as somatic blocks and spinal infusions), neurolytic sympathetic blockade, and implantable therapies, including neuromodulation and targeted drug delivery.

Recent publications of randomized controlled trials and their supporting evidence for the interventional treatment of CRPS have emphasized neuromodulation, particularly dorsal root ganglion stimulation. This advanced form of spinal cord stimulation is used to treat focal neuropathic pain. Studies published in 2017 and 2019 have elevated this therapy to important later-stage considerations. Traditional spinal cord stimulation, an FDA-approved treatment for chronic pain, was first introduced to the market in 1967.

Several topical reviews and meta-analyses identified in a 2020 PubMed search provide updates from the previous edition. The Cochrane Database for Systematic Review is utilized to highlight quality studies, explore newer and existing treatments, and assist in some aspects of clinical decision-making.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: A systematic review [^116Yk6v1]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

This systematic review identified four diagnostic tools validated for use in adults, none validated in pediatric populations, and no screening tools for any age group. The four diagnostic tools identified include the Veldman criteria, IASP criteria, Budapest Criteria, and Budapest Research Criteria. Several studies suggest that early diagnosis and intervention may lead to more favorable outcomes and potentially prevent disability and poor quality of life. The importance of early diagnosis is recognized by the IASP, which recommends rapid assessment of acute CRPS. Furthermore, an accurate diagnosis is critical, given that CRPS has specific treatments that differ from other types of chronic pain; for example, common interventions for CRPS include specific physiotherapies (graded motor imagery), pharmacotherapy (intravenous ketamine), and interventions (spinal cord stimulation).

The results of this review represent how our understanding of this rare disease has evolved. In 1993, expert consensus agreed upon the term CRPS and defined two subtypes (1 and 2). In the same year, two sets of diagnostic criteria (the IASP criteria and Veldman criteria) were published. Another critical time point was the expert consensus meeting held by the IASP in Budapest in 2003, whereby the former IASP criteria were replaced with the Budapest Criteria. These new criteria were more robust, including more diverse symptoms, particularly with the addition of motor and trophic features.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: What the dermatologist should know [^114xFipW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is a subtype of complex regional pain syndrome, characterized by persistent post-injury extremity pain. Temperature and sweating changes, edema, mobility changes, and a variety of hair, nail, and skin sequelae have been described. Only 23 articles published since 1990 describe dermatologic changes in CRPS. Given this paucity of literature, we present a case to further elucidate cutaneous manifestations of CRPS.

Our patient is a 52-year-old Caucasian woman with a 19-year history of reflex sympathetic dystrophy who has presented with several dermatologic complaints. She was first referred to the clinic due to episodic, mildly tender, clustered, non-blanching, and non-palpable petechiae on the legs bilaterally, which was histologically consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. No systemic involvement was identified, and symptoms resolved with topical steroids. The patient was also noted to have severe ten toenail dystrophy without any evidence of onychomycosis based on multiple cultures and PAS staining of clipped nails. Avulsion of the great toenail was performed to provide symptomatic relief.

Incidentally, the patient was found to have lower extremity and facial hypotrichosis on physical examination. Further, she required increased lidocaine administration in addition to pre- and post-procedure lidocaine and prilocaine 5% emulsion cream for various office procedures, suggestive of lidocaine insensitivity. This case captures previously described cutaneous manifestations of CRPS such as vasculitis, nail dystrophy, and extremity hypotrichosis.

### Can complex regional pain syndrome be painless [^113LeSz5]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

While spontaneous and stimulus-evoked pain are the hallmarks of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, autonomic abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes in the affected limb are additional clinical characteristics distinguishing this syndrome. Even though the exact underlying mechanisms of the syndrome remain obscure, a recent hypothesis suggests that the abnormal response of neural nociceptive tissue plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CRPS via the mechanism known as "neurogenic inflammation". The group of patients presented here exhibited all the clinical characteristics of CRPS but had no pain, thereby indicating that ongoing or evoked pain is not a necessary condition for CRPS to be maintained. We suggest the term complex regional painless syndrome to describe this syndrome.

### Complex regional pain syndrome [^117NzziS]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare, chronic pain disorder. It presents a significant challenge for patients and physicians due to the morbidity associated with chronic pain that may last for years. CRPS typically develops four to six weeks after direct trauma, such as injury or surgery, causing pain disproportionate to the initial injury. Multiple physiologic mechanisms are implicated, affecting skin texture, and localized sensory, motor, sudomotor, and vasomotor pathways.

The diagnosis of CRPS is made clinically using standardized diagnostic criteria. Ancillary testing is not necessary for diagnosis but can be useful to rule out alternative diagnoses. There are two types of CRPS, type 1 and type 2, although treatment is the same for both. No single proven treatment modality exists for CRPS, and there have been no large randomized controlled studies of CRPS treatments. Most treatments are based on studies of their use for other types of neuropathic pain.

The mainstay of treatment aims to improve the function of the affected body part and decrease pain. Therefore, treatment requires multiple modalities, including medications, behavioral health interventions, and referral to a pain specialist.

In conclusion, these findings argue against the historical three sequential stages of CRPS. Nonetheless, lack of support for traditional sequential stages does not invalidate the concept of other CRPS subtypes that may evolve over time. One promising candidate, consistent with clinical observations, is the distinction between "warm CRPS" and "cold CRPS".

A large, international, prospective multi-site study tested whether distinct warm and cold CRPS subtypes could be identified solely using unbiased statistical pattern recognition (i.e. no a priori assumptions). Results of cluster analysis using automated cluster selection revealed:

- **Warm CRPS patient cluster**: Characterized by a warm, red, dry, and edematous extremity.
- **Cold CRPS patient cluster**: Characterized by a cold, blue, sweaty, and less edematous extremity.

Consistent with clinical observations, median CRPS duration was much shorter in the warm CRPS subtype (4.7 months) than in the cold CRPS subtype (20 months), with comparable pain intensity across these subtypes. Although a warm presentation is by far the most common in early CRPS, a small subgroup of patients was noted who had CRPS of brief duration yet displayed a cold CRPS pattern, a group provisionally labelled "primary cold CRPS".

Further bearing on the issue of temporal sequencing of these subtypes, a score reflecting the total number of inflammatory features was found to be significantly elevated at baseline in the warm subtype relative to the cold subtype, with these elevations significantly diminishing only in the warm CRPS subtype over a 3-month period.

Functional restoration emphasizes physical activity ("reanimation"), desensitization, and normalization of sympathetic tone in the affected limb. It involves a steady progression from the most gentle, least invasive interventions to the ideal of complete rehabilitation, such as a return to work or studies, in all aspects of the patient's life (see Figure 2). Although the benefits of functional restoration may be obvious to experienced clinicians, the evidence required to support these empirical impressions remains to be collected. Systematically collected research data needed to determine which aspects of treatment demonstrate efficacy, which specific components of a functional restoration program yield positive outcomes, as well as which modalities should be delivered, when, and for how long, are currently unavailable.

- **Evidence**: The data supporting functional restoration and reanimation in CRPS management are currently modest but credible. It is important to note that in a 1997 meta-analysis, Kingery observed that "CRPS trials tended to use fewer subjects and were less likely to use placebo controls, double blinding, or perform statistical tests for differences in outcome measures" than neuropathic pain (level 1). Early, uncontrolled work by several investigators focused on preliminary concepts of quantifying different facets of function and biometrics in "Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy" (RSD, also known as CRPS I). In a pivotal 1988 paper, Davidoff et al. conducted a prospective uncontrolled study in RSD that determined three key concepts: that objective functional components and bio

### Neurovascular, muscle, and skin changes on 18FFDG PET/MRI in complex regional pain syndrome of the foot: A prospective clinical study [^114AVVEp]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Abnormalities detected on PET and MRI were classified into three tissue categories: muscle, neurovascular bundle, and skin/subcutaneous tissue. Note that further classification of tissue types, such as peripheral nerves, blood vessels, and skin, was not feasible due to the limited spatial resolution of PET. For each lesion on the PET images, a circular region of interest (ROI) fitting the lesion was manually drawn to measure the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max). For each control, the SUV max of each tissue type in the foot and lower extremities was measured. Then, for each tissue type, the group of SUV max from associated lesions from patients was compared with the group of SUV max from healthy controls. The sample size of seven provides 80% power to detect a difference as small as 1.5 standard deviations with a two-sided 5% error. The Mann-Whitney U-test was employed for comparison, with the P-values of .05 adopted as a significance level. The mean and standard deviation of SUV max of the patients and the healthy controls were also calculated for individual tissue groups.

### Spatially defined modulation of skin temperature and hand ownership of both hands in patients with unilateral complex regional pain syndrome [^112yzZnX]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Numerous clinical conditions, including complex regional pain syndrome, are characterized by autonomic dysfunctions (e.g. altered thermoregulation, sometimes confined to a single limb) and disrupted cortical representation of the body and the surrounding space. The presence of disruptions in spatial perception, bodily ownership, and thermoregulation in patients with complex regional pain syndrome led us to hypothesize that impaired spatial perception might result in a spatial-dependent modulation of thermoregulation and bodily ownership over the affected limb.

In five experiments involving a total of 23 patients with complex regional pain syndrome of one arm and 10 healthy control subjects, we measured skin temperature of the hand with infrared thermal imaging, before and after experimental periods of either 9 or 10 minutes each, during which the hand was held on one or the other side of the body midline. Tactile processing was assessed by temporal order judgments of pairs of vibrotactile stimuli, delivered one to each hand. Pain and sense of ownership over the hand were assessed by self-report scales.

Across experiments, when kept on its usual side of the body midline, the affected hand was 0.5 ± 0.3°C cooler than the healthy hand (P < 0.02 for all, a common finding in cold-type complex regional pain syndrome), and tactile stimuli delivered to the healthy hand were prioritized over those delivered to the affected hand. Simply crossing both hands over the midline resulted in warming of the affected hand (the affected hand became 0.4 ± 0.3°C warmer than when it was in that position).

### Bilateral deficiency of Meissner corpuscles and papillary microvessels in patients with acute complex regional pain syndrome [^114Q5Sev]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

Skin is an easily accessible tissue providing insight into not only the somatosensory system but also the immune, autonomic, and vascular skin systems. Skin biopsies from CRPS patients have helped to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms: increased macrophage inflammatory protein-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and mast cell accumulation mediate inflammation; disbalance of endothelin-1 and nitrous oxide synthase-1 leads to vasomotor disturbances; increased adrenoceptor expression results in autonomic dysfunction; and activation of protease networks is responsible for neuropeptide accumulation. Morphologically, trophic changes like epidermal thickening were detected. Skin innervation to analyze neuropathy was performed only in chronic CRPS. Furthermore, many of these studies lack control tissues from the same location from healthy individuals.

We hypothesized that trophicity, vascular supply, and the somatosensory system are altered in the skin of patients with early CRPS. We further postulated that these alterations would be reflected by changes in barrier proteins in the skin cells and affect morphology. Analysis of these structures might identify potential diagnostic markers or targets for individualized treatment.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^1113hYR8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

This is the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS; also known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy [RSD], causalgia). These guidelines have been sponsored by the Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association and are written by expert practitioners in each discipline traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS. A recent, excellent, and rigorous systematic review of the treatment literature in CRPS confirmed there is only modest high-quality research in the area. Nonetheless, in this "evidence vacuum", we still have a responsibility to treat. Certainly, we must develop better evidence, but our patients cannot wait. Thus, although the authors of these practical guidelines all utilized a systematic approach to reviewing the available and relevant literature, they have also included less rigorous, preliminary research reports, often supplemented by extensive empirical experience. The authors must also extrapolate from "related conditions" (e.g. neuropathy). The research quality, clinical relevance, and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail. Where there have been no discernible updates in areas since the 4th edition, text from that has been kept, sometimes verbatim.

These guidelines are intended to serve as an aid to the informed practitioner. They are not intended to replace or supplant the clinician's best judgment, experience, training, and/or a careful consideration of the clinical context.

### Effect of spinal cord stimulation in type I complex regional pain syndrome with 2 rare severe cutaneous manifestations [^111seXUM]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

The authors present the case of a 49-year-old female patient with complex regional pain syndrome-Type I (CRPS-I) who was suffering from non-healing wounds and giant bullae, which dramatically improved after spinal cord stimulation (SCS). The scientific literature concerning severe cutaneous manifestations of CRPS-I and their treatment is reviewed. Non-healing wounds and bullae are rare manifestations of CRPS-I that are extremely difficult to treat. Immediate improvement of both wounds and bullae after SCS, such as in this case, has not been reported previously in the literature. Considering the rapidly progressive nature of these severe skin manifestations, immediate treatment, possibly with SCS, is mandatory.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^117CbUma]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The next validity study examined the accuracy with which the 1994 CRPS criteria were able to distinguish CRPS patients from non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients based on patterns of signs and symptoms. This appeared to be a minimal requirement for the clinical utility of the criteria. Although the absence of a clear pathophysiological "gold standard" for CRPS diagnosis made the design of this study more challenging, an approach was chosen based on methods used in developing evidence-based diagnostic criteria for other conditions with unclear pathophysiology, such as headache and psychiatric disorders. The method chosen "stacked the deck" in favor of the 1994 criteria being able to discriminate accurately between the CRPS and non-CRPS neuropathic pain patients. Nonetheless, the results of a preliminary study and a subsequent larger study failed to support the validity of these criteria.

In the larger, more definitive study, diagnostic sensitivity of the 1994 IASP criteria (i.e. the ability to detect CRPS when it is present) was found to be quite high, as expected (0.98), but specificity (i.e. minimizing false positive diagnoses) was poor (0.36; i.e. worse than a coin flip), with a positive diagnosis of CRPS likely to be correct in as few as 40% of cases.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Manifestations and the role of neurostimulation in its management [^114mftjV]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

The hallmark of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is excruciating pain, which can manifest as aching, burning, pricking, or shooting sensations. Diagnosis should be established as soon as possible, as response to treatment is adversely affected by any delay.

Treatment of CRPS is aimed at improving function through an interdisciplinary, time-dependent, and patient-dependent approach that includes rehabilitation, psychological therapy, and pain management. If no response to conventional treatment, such as pharmacotherapy, is noted within 12–16 weeks, a more interventional technique like spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be considered.

Spinal cord stimulation has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of CRPS type I, resulting in a significant, long-term reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life. SCS is particularly effective at helping restore function in affected extremities, especially if applied early in the course of the disease. Additionally, SCS is cost-effective and improves health-related quality of life.

### Hemisensory disturbances in patients with complex regional pain syndrome [^1128rHXW]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Sensory disturbances often spread beyond the site of injury in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), but whether this applies equally to CRPS I and II, or changes across the course of the disease, is unknown. Establishing this is important because different symptom profiles in CRPS I and II, or in acute versus chronic CRPS, might infer different pathophysiology and treatment approaches.

To explore these questions, sensory disturbances were assessed in the limbs and forehead of 71 patients with CRPS I and 33 patients with CRPS II. Pain had persisted up to 12 months in 32 patients, for 13 to 36 months in 29 patients, and for longer than this in 43 patients. Patients with CRPS I were more likely to be female, and pain was more likely to be present in an additional limb than patients with CRPS II. Conversely, pain was more likely to be associated with sensory deficits and allodynia in patients with CRPS II than CRPS I.

Nevertheless, heightened sensitivity, allodynia, and/or hyperalgesia to mechanical and thermal stimuli were detected in a hemisensory distribution ipsilateral to the affected limb in both forms of CRPS. Some of these hemisensory disturbances strengthened with the chronicity of pain. These findings suggest that heightened excitability of nociceptive pathways in CRPS spreads to hemisensory convergence points in the brainstem or higher brain centers, possibly in association with compromised pain controls. The similarity of symptom profiles in chronic CRPS I and II implies shared mechanisms despite different triggers.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: A systematic review [^113gE2VG]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a severely painful condition that presents with a constellation of symptoms. The understanding of the pathophysiology of CRPS has evolved over time, as have the diagnostic criteria.

Our primary objective was to identify screening and diagnostic tools for CRPS and summarize their feasibility, measurement properties, and study quality. A secondary objective was to identify screening and diagnostic tools used for CRPS in pediatric populations (0–21 years of age). A systematic review of English articles in electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science) was conducted with the aid of a librarian in November 2018 and updated in July 2020.

Studies were included if the tool was a screening or diagnostic tool, the tool included self-report or physical examination, and the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the measurement properties or feasibility of use. For each study, data were extracted for quality indicators using the QUADAS-2 tool.

No screening tools were identified. Four diagnostic tools were identified: the Veldman criteria, International Association for the Study of Pain criteria, Budapest Criteria, and Budapest Research Criteria. There are no diagnostic tools validated for use in pediatric CRPS. Because there are no extant screening tools for CRPS, all people with suspected disease should undergo rapid diagnostic assessment by a clinician. For adults, the Budapest Criteria are the preferred diagnostic tool. Future research is recommended to develop a diagnostic tool for pediatric CRPS.

### Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 predictors - Epidemiological perspective from a national database analysis [^113r76Gd]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to explore the risk factors and predictors of complex regional pain syndrome type 1, a disabling pain disorder with unclear etiology typically triggered by a limb injury, with or without specific nerve damage. This was achieved through a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2007 to 2011 in the United States.

Adult inpatients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type 1 were the focus of the study. The statistical methods used included chi-square tests and both simple and multivariate logistic regression analyses, with adjustments made for patient demographics and comorbidities.

The main results indicate that out of an inpatient sample of 33,406,123, there were 22,533 patients diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome type 1. The condition peaks between the ages of 45 and 55. Factors associated with a higher rate of the syndrome include female gender, Caucasian race, higher median household income, headache, depression, drug abuse, and having private insurance compared to Medicaid. Conversely, diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, and anemia were linked to a lower rate of the syndrome.

In conclusion, this study, utilizing a large database, adds valuable information to the risk profile of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 in an inpatient population. This should aid physicians in early recognition and diagnosis of patients at risk.

### Invasive management for pediatric complex regional pain syndrome: Literature review of evidence [^115knSy3]. Pain Physician (2015). High credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a multifactorial condition with a complex pathogenesis characterized by spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain disproportionate to the inciting event. It is commonly accompanied by a myriad of autonomic and motor disturbances in highly variable combinations. This condition has been underreported in children until recently, making the management of CRPS in the pediatric population a greater challenge than in adults. This is partly due to a lack of clinical data concerning the efficacy of the diverse treatment methods available, and partly because successful treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach. Although various invasive methods exist for the treatment of CRPS, scarce pediatric-focused trials had been published at the time of this writing.

- **Objective**: To examine and analyze the existing data on the invasive management of CRPS in children and to suggest a management algorithm based on reviewed evidence and our team's experience.

- **Study Design**: A comprehensive review of invasive management for pediatric CRPS.

- **Setting**: Academic hospital in Spain.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive review of all published evidence at the time of writing was conducted. Four databases (PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane databases) were searched for articles published from 1980 to 2014. The eligibility criteria included any paper published in English or Spanish where a non-conventional approach was used to manage pediatric CRPS. Two independent reviewers extracted the data.

- **Results**: Many case series were reviewed without conclusive outcomes supporting one specific invasive treatment approach.

### Lower extremity complex regional pain syndrome type II following a craniotomy: Case report [^117PUx9a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a collection of signs and symptoms that most often include regional pain, edema, changes in skin temperature, increased skin sensitivity, and weakness. These symptoms usually affect the extremities and almost exclusively affect the surgical site. A 52-year-old woman presented with lower extremity CRPS due to positioning following a craniotomy.

### Does prolonged skin temperature measurement improve the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome [^1169jgUt]. Nature Clinical Practice. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

This Practice Point provides commentary on a prospective study by Krumova et al. that explored the diagnostic utility of long-term temperature measurements in patients with upper extremity complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The objectives of the group were twofold: to evaluate vascular abnormalities in CRPS by comparing real-time thermal variations experienced in everyday circumstances over prolonged time frames in affected and nonaffected hands, and to develop a practical approach for differentiating CRPS from other painful conditions. Measurement of skin temperature dynamics differentiated between CRPS and arm pain secondary to other etiologies with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 67%. Although the technique Krumova and colleagues used is more practical than those previously described, it is still too onerous for patients and physicians to routinely employ. We anticipate that improved identification of pain mechanisms will translate into better treatment outcomes, but this hypothesis remains to be tested.

### Proposed new diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome [^116XCY5u]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This topical update reports recent progress in the international effort to develop more accurate and valid diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). The diagnostic entity of CRPS, published in the International Association for the Study of Pain's Taxonomy monograph in 1994 (International Association for the Study of Pain [IASP]), was intended to be descriptive and general, without implying any etiopathology. It had the potential to improve clinical communication and generalizability across research samples.

Unfortunately, the realization of this potential has been limited because these criteria were based solely on consensus, and their utilization in the literature has been sporadic at best. As a result, the full potential benefits of the IASP criteria have not been realized. Consensus-derived criteria that are not subsequently validated may lead to overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis and will reduce the ability to provide timely and optimal treatment.

Results of validation studies at the time of writing suggest that the IASP/CRPS diagnostic criteria are adequately sensitive. However, both internal and external validation research indicates that the use of these criteria causes problems of overdiagnosis due to poor specificity. This update summarizes the latest actions of the international consensus group in Budapest, Hungary, to approve and codify empirically validated, statistically derived revisions of the IASP criteria for CRPS.

### The role of fatigue in patients with complex regional pain syndrome [^111GNi6T]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The study surveyed typical CRPS symptoms and medical history, disease onset, and the place of diagnosis. Clinical characteristics of CRPS were captured according to the new IASP diagnostic criteria, enhancing the reliability of diagnosing CRPS. A 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) assessed pain during movement (movement pain) and pain at rest. The severity of the disease, including sensory, vaso/sudomotor, motor, and trophic dysfunction, was evaluated using an adaptation of the validated CRPS severity score (CSS) based solely on self-reported symptoms. Classification of CRPS patients into clinical phenotypes — "peripheral", "mixed", and "central" — was based on the reported diagnostic criteria, referring to a recently proposed algorithm. In this algorithm, minor injury eliciting CRPS, motor signs, allodynia, and glove/stocking-like sensory deficits reflect the central phenotype. In contrast, symptoms like edema, skin color changes, skin temperature changes, sweating, and trophic changes predominantly represent the peripheral phenotype.

The descriptive data reported here are part of a more extensive investigation of comorbidities in patients with CRPS. Therefore, no à priori sample size calculation was performed for the possible association of fatigue and CRPS (for more details see).

All analyses were conducted using R, version 4.2.2. Correlations were calculated using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. To test differences of means between groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were used.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^117TJho4]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

With regards to family intervention, the most crucial issue to address is the possibility that some family members may be a barrier to reactivation due to solicitous responses and fear of pain exacerbations. Unless detailed education regarding CRPS and disuse issues is provided, family members may consider any activity that increases pain as dangerous to the patient and something to be discouraged. It is therefore important to ensure that family members understand the necessity of reactivation and that this might be associated with transient increases in pain. In contrast, family members may, due to a lack of understanding, incorrectly assume that unusual symptoms such as allodynia are exaggerated and, as a consequence, be less than fully supportive. Adequate positive family support can have a significant impact on the ultimate efficacy of treatment.

Family members should therefore be guided in how they can best respond to the patient's pain in a way that encourages and facilitates appropriate reactivation and helps keep the patient focused on constructive management of the condition. The importance of addressing family issues is highlighted by findings demonstrating that more than half of caregivers of CRPS patients experience negative mood and significant strain, and these factors, in turn, are associated with greater patient disability. While one might assume that this family distress and strain is a result of having to handle greater patient disability, the possibility of bi-directional causal influences must at least be considered.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: Practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^113C55Dj]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

An International Research Consortium for CRPS (IRC) was established in 2015. This consortium comprises a community of researchers in the field. As part of its work, the IRC considered the barriers to conducting collaborative, multicenter CRPS research studies to achieve adequate sample sizes for clinically meaningful studies. Currently, due to the low incidence rate of CRPS and a heterogeneous patient population, research is mainly confined to small study populations. This presents methodological challenges associated with the synthesis of data, as a wide range of different outcome measures are used, and consequently, advances in CRPS research are hindered.

Clinical research registries with agreed core data sets are widely used in healthcare, providing access to a large, standardized set of observational, retrospective data from across a wide geographical area. In CRPS, an international registry and core data set could aid in identifying risk factors that precipitate CRPS and potential CRPS subtypes, better understand the mechanisms driving the condition, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in clinical samples. Such a registry could provide researchers and clinicians with access to a novel, large, and consistent set of CRPS outcome and demographic data, along with contact information for CRPS patients willing to participate in research. Access to such data would have the potential to improve health outcomes for the CRPS population worldwide.

### Neurovascular, muscle, and skin changes on 18FFDG PET/MRI in complex regional pain syndrome of the foot: A prospective clinical study [^116bcbLn]. Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for noninvasive visualization of muscular, neurovascular, and skin changes secondary to complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).

Seven adult patients with CRPS of the foot and seven healthy adult controls participated in our 18FFDG PET/MRI study. All participants received whole-body PET/MRI scans 1 hour after the injection of 370 MBq 18FFDG. The resulting PET/MRI images were reviewed by two radiologists. Metabolic and anatomic abnormalities identified were grouped into muscular, neurovascular, and skin lesions. The [18 F]FDG uptake of each lesion was compared with that of corresponding areas in controls using a Mann-Whitney U-test.

On PET images, muscular abnormalities were found in five patients, neurovascular abnormalities in four patients, and skin abnormalities in two patients. However, on MRI images, no muscular abnormalities were detected. Neurovascular and skin abnormalities in the affected limb were identified on MRI in one and two patients, respectively. The difference in 18FFDG uptake between the patients and the controls was significant in muscle (P = 0.018) and neurovascular bundle (P = 0.0005).

The increased uptake of 18FFDG in the symptomatic areas likely reflects the increased metabolism due to the inflammatory response causing pain. Therefore, our approach combines metabolic 18FFDG PET and anatomic imaging effectively for the assessment of CRPS-related changes.

### Complex regional pain syndrome in burn pathological scarring: A case report and review of the literature [^113MLM5c]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic pain in burn pathological scarring is not an uncommon occurrence. The mechanisms of pain are not clearly understood, and hence, the management approach is often a daunting task. However, meticulous physical examination of these patients may classify them as having complex regional pain syndrome, type I.

We present a patient with classic signs and symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome associated with burn pathological scarring of her left forearm that had a favorable response to a thoracoscopic sympathectomy. The possible pathological mechanisms of burn pathological scarring, mechanisms of pain, and complex regional pain syndrome are reviewed.

### A mysterious case of complex regional pain syndrome in a 9-year-old girl [^112oeRKE]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

To describe the clinical manifestation and the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type II in childhood, this study provides detailed insights into a young patient's condition.

- **Methods**: Using information on the symptoms, diagnosis, rehabilitation, and outcome of a young patient with complex regional pain syndrome type II.

- **Results**: A 9-year-old girl experienced severe pain in the region of the left foot, signs of common fibular nerve entrapment, hyperalgesia not limited to the distribution of the injured nerve, weakness, and temperature asymmetry of unknown origin. She consulted several doctors before receiving the correct diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome type II. Following the diagnosis, treatment commenced, which included intensive physiotherapy, electrical therapy, and supportive psychological therapy. Half a year later, the patient was free of daily pain and returned to all physical activities without any restrictions.

- **Conclusions**: The case report illustrates that peripheral nerve compression or injuries, specifically complex regional pain syndrome type II, should be considered when evaluating children with weakness and pain in the lower or upper limbs.

- **Implications of rehabilitation**: Raising awareness of complex regional pain syndrome in childhood is essential for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment options include early and adequate pain management, such as electrical therapy and physiotherapy. Psychological therapy helps to avoid psychological stress reactions and mitigate the disease's negative impact on the child's education, sports, and the family's social life.

### Screening and diagnostic tools for complex regional pain syndrome: a systematic review [^115z1LKj]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

- **Budapest criteria**: In 2003, the IASP held a consensus conference in Budapest to improve the IASP diagnostic criteria for CRPS. This meeting resulted in the creation of the new criteria, named the Budapest Criteria, which largely reflected criteria proposed earlier by Harden and Bruehl in 1999. The Budapest Criteria include motor and trophic features of the disease and place more emphasis on signs (i.e. observable by the clinician). Intended for clinical purposes, the Budapest Criteria mirror the Budapest Research Criteria, with the exception of a difference in scoring.

The Budapest Criteria are as follows: (1) continuing pain that is disproportionate to any inciting event, (2) one symptom in 3 of 4 categories, (3) one sign in 2 of 4 categories, and (4) no other diagnosis could better explain the patient's presentation. The categories include sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and motor/trophic. These criteria underwent initial validation in 2010 by Harden et al, where the Budapest Criteria were compared to the IASP criteria in discriminating between CRPS-1 and other types of neuropathic pain. This study concluded that both criteria had excellent diagnostic sensitivity (IASP criteria 100% and Budapest Criteria 99%), but the Budapest Criteria had superior specificity (68%) compared with the IASP criteria (41%).

Analysis of the discriminant validity of individual criteria was also performed in this study, with sensitivity ranging from 93% to 94% and specificity from 57% to 71%. Overall, the tool's diagnostic validity has been evaluated in 4 studies with highly variable results.
