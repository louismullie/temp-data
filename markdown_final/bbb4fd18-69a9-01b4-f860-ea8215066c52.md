## Question

Cause of ingrown toenails

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of ingrown toenails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and whether the nail plate truly penetrates the skin or if the soft tissues encroach on the nail. Then, I should verify the major etiologic categories, including mechanical, anatomic, infectious, and iatrogenic or medication-related causes. Next, I will examine specific contributors within each category and weigh the strength of evidence. After that, I should consider special populations and modifiers like diabetes, pediatrics, and athletes. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchical model of causation and highlight practical implications for prevention and management, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too strong or unsupported by the references.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the same pathophysiology: the nail plate penetrates the periungual skin, triggering a foreign-body inflammatory response with edema, granulation tissue, and secondary infection, which then further embeds the nail and perpetuates the cycle. This is the canonical model taught in primary care and dermatology references and aligns with surgical descriptions of removing the offending nail edge to break the cycle [^76b053cb] [^c829dad7] [^d379c944].

> Wait, let me verify whether the soft tissues can also be the primary driver. Some surgical literature emphasizes that hypertrophic lateral nail folds or distal soft-tissue overgrowth can compress or overgrow the nail plate, effectively causing the nail to become ingrown even when the plate itself is not sharply penetrating; this is particularly described in pediatric and recalcitrant cases, and techniques that debulk the soft tissue without matricectomy can be curative, supporting a bidirectional model where either the nail invades the skin or the skin engulfs the nail [^23e741ea] [^99487794] [^48a8a091].

> I will now examine mechanical and behavioral causes, since these are repeatedly cited as the most common. Improper nail trimming with rounded corners or tearing leaves a spicule that acts like a barb, while tight or ill-fitting footwear and repetitive trauma (sports, occupational pressure) force the nail edge into the lateral fold; obesity and hyperhidrosis soften the periungual skin and increase penetration risk, and adolescents are disproportionately affected due to sweat-related maceration and poor nail care habits [^76b053cb] [^c829dad7] [^d379c944] [^850da2ac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anatomy. I initially thought "wider nail folds and flatter nails" were proven risk factors, but I should double-check that. A case-control study cited in older reviews found no difference in nail shape between those with and without ingrown nails, so I need to be cautious and frame anatomic contributors as plausible rather than definitively established; that said, observational and population data associate foot deformities such as hallux valgus, flat foot, and acquired valgus/varus with higher ingrown nail risk, and congenital malalignment of the great toenail can cause lateral growth and ingrowing, so biomechanics and alignment likely modulate risk even if specific morphometrics are inconsistent across studies [^d379c944] [^4a91aa49] [^8605c5da].

> Next, I should review infectious and inflammatory modifiers. Onychomycosis thickens and distorts the nail plate, altering its trajectory and increasing lateral pressure, and diabetes-related neuropathy and vasculopathy impair nail care and healing, magnifying risk and complications; importantly, chronic infection can drive granulation tissue and lateral fold hypertrophy, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates ingrowth even after the initial mechanical trigger is addressed [^2a2b40a8] [^d7809acb] [^76b053cb].

> I need to check iatrogenic and medication-related causes. Certain topical antifungals (efinaconazole, tavaborole) list ingrown toenails as adverse effects, likely via softening or irritation of periungual tissues rather than direct matrix toxicity; systemic agents such as indinavir and other protease inhibitors have long-standing postmarketing reports of ingrown nails and paronychia, and targeted therapies like EGFR inhibitors frequently cause periungual inflammation and granulation that mimic or evolve into ingrown nails, so medication review is essential in recurrent or atypical cases [^b08e184f] [^f3495447] [^f6bb320e] [^4247f189] [^56fe1b03].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. In diabetes, ingrown nails are both more common and more consequential, with higher risks of infection and ulceration; guidelines emphasize prevention through education and avoidance of self-care of ingrown nails, and observational data link ingrown nails to future foot ulcer risk, underscoring the need for early, expert management in this group [^d6d7b9c6] [^82c8b8dd]. In children and adolescents, congenital malalignment, distal soft-tissue hypertrophy, and sports-related repetitive trauma are prominent, and pediatric series show excellent outcomes with appropriately selected surgical techniques that address both nail and soft tissue pathology [^48a8a091] [^8c264a1a]. In athletes, "jogger's toenail" reflects repetitive microtrauma from shoe friction and downhill running, illustrating how cumulative mechanical stress can precipitate ingrowth even without classic sharp spicules [^76b053cb].

> But wait, what if the nail itself is not the only culprit in recalcitrant cases. I should confirm that some chronic or recurrent ingrown nails reflect underlying bone or periosteal changes from longstanding infection; radiographic studies in children with chronically infected ingrown nails show periosteal reactions and occasional cortical softening, and rare cases progress to exogenous osteomyelitis, while case reports document malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer) after years of recurrent infection, reminding me to maintain vigilance for atypical or nonhealing lesions [^3e14232c] [^d1e0f78d].

> Let me synthesize a hierarchical model, keeping the strength of evidence in mind. Primary drivers are mechanical and behavioral: improper trimming, tight footwear, and repetitive trauma, with hyperhidrosis and obesity amplifying risk. Secondary contributors include anatomic variants and foot deformities, infectious modifiers such as onychomycosis, and systemic or medication-related factors like diabetes and targeted therapies. Tertiary amplifiers include inflammatory granulation, lateral fold hypertrophy, and chronic infection, which together create a self-perpetuating cycle that explains recurrence despite initial relief [^76b053cb] [^c829dad7] [^2a2b40a8] [^4247f189].

> I should double-check practical implications for prevention and management. Prevention hinges on straight-across nail trimming, footwear with adequate toe-box depth, moisture control, and early attention to spicules or early inflammation. Management should target both the mechanical trigger and the inflammatory milieu, with partial nail avulsion plus chemical matricectomy reducing recurrence compared with avulsion alone, while selective soft-tissue debulking is reasonable when hypertrophic folds are the dominant pathology. In diabetes, avoid self-care and escalate early to procedural management to mitigate infection and ulcer risk [^c829dad7] [^e4e9a37c] [^99487794] [^d6d7b9c6].

---

Ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis) result from **mechanical trauma** — most often improper nail trimming, tight footwear, or repetitive impact — that drives the lateral nail edge into the periungual skin, triggering inflammation, granulation, and infection [^76b053cb] [^c829dad7]. Additional contributors include **anatomic factors** (prominent nail folds, pincer nails, distal phalanx shape), **infections** (onychomycosis, bacterial colonization), and systemic conditions (obesity, diabetes, edema) that soften or distort the nail or periungual tissue [^2a2b40a8] [^d7809acb]. Management should address both the mechanical trigger and inflammatory sequelae to prevent recurrence [^c829dad7].

---

## Mechanical trauma and improper nail care

Mechanical trauma is the **most common cause** of ingrown toenails, typically from:

- **Improper nail trimming**: Rounded corners or cutting too short create sharp edges that penetrate the lateral nail folds [^d379c944].

- **Tight footwear**: Shoes with narrow toe boxes compress the nail and soft tissues, forcing the nail into the skin [^d379c944].

- **Repetitive impact**: Sports or activities with repeated toe trauma (e.g. running, soccer) increase risk [^d42a11b2].

---

## Anatomic and structural factors

Certain anatomic variations predispose to ingrown nails:

- **Prominent nail folds**: Hypertrophic lateral folds can overgrow and trap the nail edge [^23e741ea].

- **Pincer nails**: Overcurvature increases lateral pressure and embedding [^0e37bc4b].

- **Distal phalanx morphology**: Upturned or enlarged distal phalanges alter nail trajectory [^0535abd7].

---

## Infectious and inflammatory conditions

Infections and inflammation **soften and distort** the nail unit, promoting ingrowth:

- **Onychomycosis**: Fungal thickening and distortion change nail shape and increase pressure [^notfound].

- **Bacterial colonization**: Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas infection cause granulation and edema, embedding the nail [^notfound].

- **Chronic inflammation**: Granulation tissue and hypertrophy perpetuate the cycle [^d379c944].

---

## Systemic and lifestyle factors

Several systemic and lifestyle factors **increase susceptibility**:

- **Obesity**: Increased mechanical load and sweating soften periungual tissue [^d379c944].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Neuropathy, vasculopathy, and poor glycemic control impair healing and increase risk [^2a2b40a8].

- **Edema**: Lower-extremity swelling compresses the nail folds [^d379c944].

---

## Summary of causative factors

| **Category** | **Specific factors** |
|-|-|
| Mechanical trauma | - Improper trimming <br/> - Tight footwear <br/> - Repetitive impact |
| Anatomic factors | - Prominent nail folds <br/> - Pincer nails <br/> - Distal phalanx shape |
| Infectious/inflammatory | - Onychomycosis <br/> - Bacterial infection <br/> - Chronic inflammation |
| Systemic/lifestyle | - Obesity <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Edema |

---

Ingrown toenails arise from a **multifactorial interplay** of mechanical, anatomic, infectious, and systemic factors, with mechanical trauma and improper nail care being the most common. Effective management requires identifying and addressing both the precipitating cause and the inflammatory response to prevent recurrence [^c829dad7].

### Interventions for ingrowing toenails [^42f30dbf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common problem in which part of the nail penetrates the skinfold alongside the nail, creating a painful area. Different non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails are available, but there is no consensus about a standard first-choice treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of non-surgical and surgical interventions in a medical setting for ingrowing toenails, with the aim of relieving symptoms and preventing regrowth of the nail edge or recurrence of the ingrowing toenail.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We also updated our searches of CINAHL, WEB of SCIENCE, ongoing trials databases, and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of non-surgical and surgical interventions for ingrowing toenails, which are also known by the terms 'unguis incarnatus' and 'onychocryptosis', and those comparing postoperative treatment options. Studies must have had a follow-up period of at least one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data from selected studies. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails'. In this update we included 24 studies, with a total of 2826 participants (of which 7 were also included in the previous review). Five studies were on non-surgical interventions, and 19 were on surgical interventions. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed; this is a measure of the methodological quality of several characteristics in these studies. It was found to be unclear for several items, due to incomplete reporting. Participants were not blinded to the treatment they received because of the nature of the interventions, e.g. surgery or wearing a brace on the toe. Outcome assessors were reported to be blinded in only 9 of the 24 studies. None of the included studies addressed our primary outcomes of 'relief of symptoms' or 'regrowth', but 16 did address 'recurrence'. Not all of the included studies addressed all of our secondary outcomes (healing time, postoperative complications - infection and haemorrhage, pain of operation/postoperative pain, participant satisfaction), and two studies did not address any of the secondary outcomes. Surgical interventions were better at preventing recurrence than non-surgical interventions with gutter treatment (or gutter removal), and they were probably better than non-surgical treatments with orthonyxia (brace treatment). In 4 of the 12 studies in which a surgical intervention with chemical ablation (e.g. phenol) was compared with a surgical intervention without chemical ablation, a significant reduction of recurrence was found. The surgical interventions on both sides in these comparisons were not equal, so it is not clear if the reduction was caused by the addition of the chemical ablation. In only one study, a comparison was made of a surgical intervention known as partial nail avulsion with matrix excision compared to the same surgical intervention with phenol. In this study of 117 participants, the surgical intervention with phenol was significantly more effective in preventing recurrence than the surgical intervention alone (14% compared to 41% respectively, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.69). None of the postoperative interventions described, such as the use of antibiotics or manuka honey; povidone-iodine with paraffin; hydrogel with paraffin; or paraffin gauze, showed any significant difference when looking at infection rates, pain, or healing time.

Authors' Conclusions

Surgical interventions are more effective than non-surgical interventions in preventing the recurrence of an ingrowing toenail. In the studies comparing a surgical intervention to a surgical intervention with the application of phenol, the addition of phenol is probably more effective in preventing recurrence and regrowth of the ingrowing toenail. Because there is only one study in which the surgical interventions in both study arms were equal, more studies have to be done to confirm these outcomes. Postoperative interventions do not decrease the risk of postoperative infection, postoperative pain, or healing time.

### Ingrown toenails: a survey among dermatologists on current treatments [^7cbbbdec]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, there is no formal consensus on how to treat ingrown toenails. Despite the risk of causing irreparable damage to the nail, highly invasive procedures are still common. Less-invasive, matrix-directed techniques with shorter downtime and high cure rates exist, but, perhaps because of a lack of awareness, appear not to have been universally adopted.

Objective

The authors' study sought to generate data on common practices in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

The authors developed and conducted an online survey to ask dermatologists/dermatosurgeons how they would proceed in 9 different cases of ingrown toenails based on photographs.

Results

The authors received 154 replies. Nonsurgical interventions, including advice on nail care/foot baths/ointments/wraps/padding, were always the most frequently chosen option. Removal of the lateral nail plate followed by chemical partial matricectomy (phenolization) was the most or second-most frequently chosen surgical intervention. The answers were highly heterogeneous, and there was no unanimity based on morphology alone.

Conclusion

Except for a preference for nonsurgical interventions, the authors could not identify any clear treatment standards. The heterogeneity of treatment approaches suggests the need for a guideline.

### Ingrown toenail management [^76b053cb]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ingrown toenails:

- **Definition**: Ingrown toenails, also known as onychocryptosis, is a condition where the toenail grows into the surrounding skin, leading to pain and inflammation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ingrown toenails involves the nail plate penetrating into the periungual skin. This penetration can lead to skin irritation and overgrowth, causing the nail to become embedded in the skin.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ingrown toenails in South Korea is estimated at 307.5 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for ingrown toenails include familial predisposition, poor foot hygiene, and occupations or sports that increase pressure on the toes. Other factors such as previous nail avulsion and foot bone deformity have been associated with poorly controlled and recurrence-prone ingrown toenails.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with ingrown toenails often present with pain, redness, and swelling at the affected site. If left untreated, the condition can progress to infection, abscess formation, and even cellulitis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for ingrown toenails is generally good with appropriate management.

### Ingrown toenail management [^c829dad7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingrown toenails account for approximately 20% of foot problems in primary care. The great toe is most often affected. Ingrown toenails occur most commonly in young men, and nail care habits and footwear are most often contributory factors. No consensus has been reached for the best treatment approach, but ingrown nails may be nonsurgically or surgically treated. Nonsurgical treatments are typically used for mild to moderate ingrown nails, whereas surgical approaches are used in moderate and severe cases. Simple nonsurgical palliative measures include correcting inappropriate footwear, managing hyperhidrosis and onychomycosis, soaking the affected toe followed by applying a mid- to high-potency topical steroid, and placing wisps of cotton or dental floss under the ingrown lateral nail edge. Application of a gutter splint to the ingrown nail edge to separate it from the lateral fold provides immediate pain relief. A cotton nail cast made from cotton and cyanoacrylate adhesive, taping the lateral nail fold, or orthonyxia may also alleviate mild to moderate ingrown toenail. Surgical approaches seek to remove the interaction between the nail plate and the nail fold to eliminate local trauma and inflammatory reaction. These approaches are superior to nonsurgical ones for preventing recurrence. The most common surgical approach is partial avulsion of the lateral edge of the nail plate. Matrixectomy further prevents recurrence and can be performed through surgical, chemical, or electrosurgical means.

### Surgical treatments for ingrowing toenails [^0cc218f2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrowing toenails are a common condition which, when recurrent and painful, are often treated surgically.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of methods of the surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails.

Search Strategy

Electronic database searching (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL) followed by investigation of reference lists of the papers identified from the initial search.

Selection Criteria

Any randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trial which compares one form of surgical removal of all or part of a toenail due to its impact on the soft tissues to another or others. Studies must have a minimum follow period of six months and aim to permanently remove the troublesome portion of the nail.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction was carried out independently by the two reviewers using a pre-derived data extraction form and entered into RevMan. Categorical outcomes were analysed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Avulsion with phenol versus surgical excision: Phenolisation combined with simple avulsion of a nail is more effective than the use of more invasive excisional surgical procedures to prevent symptomatic recurrence at six months or more (OR 0.44 CI 95% 0.24–0.80). Avulsion with phenol versus avulsion without phenol: The addition of phenol, when performing a total or partial nail avulsion dramatically reduces the rate of symptomatic recurrence, (OR 0.07 95% CI 0.04–0.12). This is offset by a significant increase in the rate of post-operative infection when phenol is used (OR 5.69 95% CI 1.93–16.77).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that simple nail avulsion combined with the use of phenol, compared to surgical excisional techniques without the use of phenol, is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails. The addition of phenol when simple nail avulsion is performed dramatically decreases symptomatic recurrence, but at the cost of increased post-operative infection.

### Surgical management of ingrown toenails-an update overdue [^23e741ea]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

For decades, every year sees a wide number of articles about treatment of ingrown toenails. There is still a debate about the cause of this painful condition. Surgical treatments rely on two main approaches: either narrowing the nail plate or debulking the soft tissues. It is up to the surgeon to select the most appropriate approach in each case. All procedures cited in this article have high cure rates as long as they are properly performed. As with all surgical procedures, they are operator dependent. Chemical cautery is the easiest and most versatile technique that may help in almost all instances for lateral ingrowing. For distal embedding and very hypertrophic and exuberant lateral folds, debulking with secondary intention healing is the most effective and easy to perform, with great results.

### Ingrown toenail removal [^fac862a7]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail is a common problem resulting from various etiologies including improperly trimmed nails, hyperhidrosis, and poorly fitting shoes. Patients commonly present with pain in the affected nail but with progression, drainage, infection, and difficulty walking occur. Excision of the lateral nail plate combined with lateral matricectomy is thought to provide the best chance for eradication. The lateral aspect of the nail plate is removed with preservation of the remaining healthy nail plate. Electrocautery ablation is then used to destroy the exposed nail-forming matrix, creating a new lateral nail fold. Complications of the procedure include regrowth of a nail spicule secondary to incomplete matricectomy and postoperative nail bed infection. When performed correctly, the procedure produces the greatest success in the treatment of ingrown nails. Basic soft tissue surgery and electrosurgery experience are prerequisites for learning the technique.

### Modified sleeve method treatment of ingrown toenail [^52bfbe65]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail is a common problem that causes inconvenience, pain, and limitation of daily function. Current conventional treatment methods are not satisfactory and have a high recurrence rate.

Objective

To evaluate a modification of an existing, although uncommonly used, method for treating ingrown toenail.

Methods

Patients with ingrown toenail were treated under local anesthesia by insertion of a flexible narrow plastic tube under the toenail along its lateral border. Tube fixation was performed with silk or nylon 2–0 sutures passed through the toenail. Granulomatous and inflamed tissue was removed by electrocautery or local excision.

Results

Twenty-eight procedures were performed in 25 patients. In 20 procedures (71.4%), no recurrences were recorded; the other 8 procedures (28.6%), were symptomatic.

Conclusion

This method for the treatment of ingrown toenail was found to be simple and efficient, with a relatively low recurrence rate. Therefore we currently advocate this procedure as the treatment of choice.

### Ingrown toenail management [^e447b92b]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for ingrown toenails, more specifically with respect to partial nail avulsion with phenolization, AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend to offer partial nail avulsion followed by phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix for the management of ingrown toenails.

---

### Management of the ingrown toenail [^bdbc849a]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, most commonly affects the great toenail. Many anatomic and behavioral factors are thought to contribute to ingrown toenails, such as improper trimming, repetitive or inadvertent trauma, genetic predisposition, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene. Conservative treatment approaches include soaking the foot in warm, soapy water; placing cotton wisps or dental floss under the ingrown nail edge; and gutter splinting with or without the placement of an acrylic nail. Surgical approaches include partial nail avulsion or complete nail excision with or without phenolization. Electrocautery, radiofrequency, and carbon dioxide laser ablation of the nail matrix are also options. Oral antibiotics before or after phenolization do not improve outcomes. Partial nail avulsion followed by either phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toenails. Compared with surgical excision of the nail without phenolization, partial nail avulsion combined with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails, but has a slightly increased risk of postoperative infection.

### Best way to treat an ingrown toenail [^1fd6f151]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Nail phenolization is considered a useful procedure for treating ingrowing toenails. Nail phenolization is indicated when partial and definitive removal of the nail plate is necessary. Nail phenolization is simple and inexpensive, and associated with little postoperative discomfort, a quick return to normal activities, and a low rate of complication and recurrence. The Howard-Dubois and super U techniques are indicated when ingrowing nails are caused by hypertrophy of nail folds, according to the degree of severity.

### Lateral foldplasty with or without partial matricectomy for the management of ingrown toenails [^0db905c9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenails are common and lead to significant morbidity.

Objective

This retrospective study was aimed at evaluation of our new surgical technique of lateral foldplasty with limited lateral matrix resection in some cases for the management of ingrown toenails with regard to recurrence rates, spicule formation, local infection, partial flap necrosis, and cosmetic outcome.

Methods & Materials

Thirty-two patients with 52 ingrown nails were included in this study. Lateral foldplasty procedure alone was preferred for the surgical treatment of 18 ingrown toenails of mild to moderate severity. Lateral foldplasty with limited lateral matrix resection was performed in 34 ingrown nails in patients with broad nail plates or for moderate to severe cases with significant granulation tissue formation.

Results

Relapse rate, local infection rate, and partial flap necrosis rate were very low. Spicule formation was not observed. The cosmetic appearance of the nail did not disturb any patient treated with this procedure.

Conclusion

The lateral foldplasty procedure alone or combined with limited lateral matrix resection is a cheap, simple, and satisfactory technique for the treatment of ingrown toenails with a low risk of relapse. This technique also has good cosmetic results.

### Congenital ingrown toenail of the hallux [^48a8a091]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail in the infant is a rare entity that has only occasionally been discussed in the medical literature. At birth, or soon thereafter, children present with bilateral ingrown hallux toenails notable for pain, tenderness, erythema, purulence, and hypertrophy of the skin and fat of the distal end of the great toes extending over the dorsum of the nail plates. Inflammatory and infectious granulation tissue develops with time.

Methods

We present a case series of 4 patients with bilateral congenitally ingrown hallux toenails. Conservative and surgical treatment modalities were used, with 3 of 4 patients undergoing wedge resection of the hypertrophic soft tissues at the distal end of the toes.

Results

There were excellent results in both feet of all patients with resolution of the condition and no recurrences in any patient. Clinical photos are provided for all patients.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenail in the infant is a rare entity that occasionally requires surgical treatment. Excellent results are expected with wedge resection of the hypertrophic soft tissues.

### Exploring postoperative outcomes for ingrown toenails. NaOH vs wedge resection techniques [^55404f94]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown (or ingrowing) toenail is a commonly used term for onychocryptosis, in which the nail becomes inserted into the lateral fold of the toe. The resulting effect on a person's health, well-being, and ability to work suggests the importance of clear treatment guidance, but little consensus exists.

Objective

To explore postoperative recovery after surgery for ingrown toenails using chemical (sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) or mechanical (wedge resection) matricectomy and thus contribute to understanding within the field on which to base treatment guidelines.

Methods

One hundred sixty-one procedures were undertaken, 94 using NaOH and 67 using wedge resection. Four measures of postoperative recovery were recorded: recurrence, infection, time to discharge, and number of postoperative visits.

Results

Patients treated with NaOH had lower rates of recurrence (p = .048) and infection (p = .03) than those treated with wedge resection, and time to discharge was shorter (p = .02), but they had more postoperative visits (p = .003).

Conclusion

Low rates of recurrence and infection and short postoperative recovery time were found after both procedures, with a small advantage with treatment with NaOH. The authors argue for the value of clinical intervention using matricectomy in early stages to avoid complications resulting from granulation tissue growth.

### Treating ingrown toenails by nail splinting with a flexible tube: an Indian experience [^4ca5f565]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail is a common problem, and currently available treatments are either quite invasive or associated with unacceptably high recurrence rate. Recently a new non-invasive therapy. "Nail splinting", has been introduced. In this procedure, the nail is splinted with a longitudinally incised plastic tube. We conducted the present study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this procedure in fifty patients (68 nail edges in 61 nails) with ingrown toenails at all stages. The pain disappeared almost immediately, and inflammation subsided in about one week in all nail edges. Thirty-nine patients came for regular follow-up for six months after removal of the tube. Eight (20.5%) of these patients showed recurrence of the problem. No serious side effects were noted.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In two clinical trials, 1227 subjects were treated with JUBLIA, 1161 for at least 24 weeks and 780 for 48 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 48 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with JUBLIA and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of JUBLIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Application site erythema and exfoliation

### The effectiveness of nail excision versus vandenbos procedure for the surgical management of ingrown toenails in children: a retrospective chart review [^8c264a1a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail commonly occurs in patients who have experienced trauma or long-term compression to their toes. There exist two common methods of surgical management - wedge resection and Vandenbos procedure. We compared the recurrence rate of these two methods in pediatric patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study reviewing patients who presented to our institution with ingrown toenail between 2009 and 2015. Patients who received any surgical treatment outside of our institution or were over 18 years of age were excluded.

Results

There were 523 patients seen at our institution with ingrown toenail. Of these patients, 482 had sufficient data available to be included in this study, with a total of 929 ingrown toenails. Out of these, 333 were managed conservatively while the remaining 596 required surgical intervention; 373 had wedge resection performed and the other 223 had Vandenbos procedure. Our analysis determined that 78 total complications arose in the wedge resection group (21%) while 32 total complications arose in the Vandenbos group (14%; p = 0.0949). Wedge resections had a significantly higher recurrence rate than Vandenbos procedures (41 (11%) vs 5 (2%), p = 0.0001).

Conclusion

Surgical complications are comparable between wedge resections and Vandenbos procedure. Vandenbos procedure offers a significantly lower recurrence rate than wedge resection.

Level Of Evidence

### Patient-controlled taping for the treatment of ingrown toenails [^72a5cc27]. Annals of Family Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Various methods are used to treat ingrown or pincer-like toenails. We developed a novel taping method to prevent topical interruption of the circulation and resulting skin conditions and evaluated it over 14.5 years. We instructed 541 patients or their guardians in the use of the technique. Ingrown toenail symptoms and abnormal nail growth were resolved and no additional therapy was required in 276 patients. The novel taping method was significantly more effective than treatments our patients had received previously. Patient-controlled taping is the first-line treatment for every ingrown or curved toenail seen in our clinic.

### The effect of phenol on ingrown toenail excision in children [^2bbd498e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ingrown toenails in children are a common problem with a high recurrence rate. The objective of this retrospective data review was to compare simple excision of the nail matrix with excision plus phenol (EPP) application in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Methods

The charts of 69 children who underwent surgical treatment of one or more ingrown toenails from 1994 to 2000 were reviewed. The primary procedure was noted (excision alone [EA] vs EPP) and dates of recurrences and reoperations were recorded. Parents were then surveyed by phone regarding complications, cosmetic outcome, and overall satisfaction with the procedure. Five scale categories, ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree", were used, with responses of "strongly agree" and "agree" considered as a good outcome. Either Student's t test or the chi2 test (P < .05 considered significant) was used for analysis.

Results

Thirty-one patients (45%) were in the EPP group whereas the remaining 38 had EA. Mean length of follow-up was 4.3 years for the EA group and 2.1 years for the EPP group. There was no difference in age at operation or length of follow-up between the 2 groups. Boys were predominant in both groups. The survey response rate was 50/69 (73%). The recurrence rate of ingrown toenails in the EA group was 42% vs 4% in the EPP group (P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in parental response with regard to operative experience (P = 0.31) and the cosmetic result (P = 0.13), with most of the respondents (78%) indicating a good outcome for both questions.

Conclusions

The addition of phenol to the surgical excision of ingrown toenail significantly reduced the incidence of recurrence, with similar patient satisfaction and an equivalent cosmetic result.

### Evaluation and management of mechanical and structural nail disorders: a clinical review [^2a2b40a8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical trauma is the most common cause of toenail onychodystrophy, surpassing onychomycosis. Ill-fitting footwear and anatomical foot/toe abnormalities, including Morton's toe, hallux valgus/erectus/rigidus, and flat and splay foot, predispose the forefoot to nonphysiologic strain and toenail alterations, often resembling onychomycosis. Dystrophic toenails should therefore be assessed alongside foot and toe alignment while standing and walking, with close examination of footwear. Trauma-induced onychodystrophy predisposes to secondary onychomycosis, and histopathological/mycological confirmation is needed. Moreover, anatomic foot/toe abnormalities may worsen nail psoriasis through koebnerization. Thus, toenails may still appear dystrophic after treating comorbid conditions if the precipitating factor is not addressed or cannot be successfully treated. Additional nail disorders induced by mechanical trauma include subungual heloma, onychophosis, frictional onycholysis, leukonychia, melanonychia, Beau's lines/onychomadesis/retronychia, and disappearing nail bed. Additionally, arthritic conditions affecting the distal interphalangeal joint may theoretically impact the adjacent nail matrix and cause nail alterations. Hyperglycemia, neuropathy, and vasculopathy likely play a role in the pathogenesis of onychodystrophies in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients are prone to developing structural foot/toe problems, onychomycosis, and ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis), which increase their risk of ulcer formation. Therefore, treating onychomycosis and onychocryptosis in diabetic patients is crucial to prevent complications, including ulcers, osteomyelitis, and amputations.

### Epidemiology and bone-related comorbidities of ingrown nail: a nationwide population-based study [^4a91aa49]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Although ingrown nail (IN) is common, there is no large-scale study regarding its epidemiology and risk factors, such as foot deformity. The purpose of this study is to determine the demographics of IN and clarify its association with bone-related comorbidities of the ankle, foot and toe. Patients in a representative sample cohort of the National Health Information Database of South Korea from 2004 to 2013 who had IN were compared with a control group without IN. Ten-year overall incidence was 307.5/100 000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 304.1–310.9). IN incidence and prevalence showed an increasing trend, and IN was more common in women than in men. Incidence showed bimodal peaks, among teenagers and among participants in their 50s. The IN group showed more common valgus deformity (64.3%) than did the control group (61.6%), and flat foot was also a significant risk factor of IN. There were increasing tendencies of IN incidence and prevalence among females. Confirmed bone deformity, especially acquired valgus or varus deformity, and flat foot were associated with IN.

### Abstract… [^850da2ac]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, is a commonly encountered problem in family practice. Patients usually present with pain in the affected nail but with progression, drainage, infection, and difficulty walking occur. Most patients present with ingrown toenail during the second and third decades of life, but teenagers often develop ingrown toenails after tearing the corners of their toenails. Possible causes of ingrown toenails include improperly trimmed nails, hyperhidrosis, poorly fitting footwear, trauma, subungual neoplasms, obesity, or excessive external pressure. These alterations cause the nail to improperly fit into the lateral nail groove, producing edema and inflammation of the lateral nail fold. Stage 1 ingrown toenails are characterized by erythema, slight edema, and pain with pressure to the lateral nail fold. Stage 2 is marked by increased symptoms, drainage, and infection.

Stage 3 ingrown toenails display magnified symptoms, granulation tissue, and lateral nail-fold hypertrophy. Many physicians advocate conservative management for stage 1 ingrown toenails, including warm soaks, cotton-wick elevation of the affected nail corner, or antibiotic therapy in the presence of infection. Simple, partial nail avulsion has been tried for stage 2 nails but is successful in eradicating the condition in only 30 percent of patients. Stage 3 ingrown toenails can develop from a laterally pointing spicule of nail beneath the nail fold. Excision of the lateral nail plate combined with lateral matricectomy is believed to provide the best chance for eradication. In the treatment of stage 3 toenails, the associated granulation tissue and lateral wall hypertrophy also should be removed. receives nutrition from the underlying nail bed. The nail plate is created by the nail matrix.

The nail plate is visible from the proximal nail fold to the distal or free edge. The lateral nail fold lies outside of the lateral nail groove and is the area where ingrown nails develop. The nail matrix can be seen at the junction with the nail bed, called the lunula. The nail matrix extends to the lateral horns. The nail bed extends distally to the hyponychium. If the lateral nail plate breaks, the remaining nail is regrasped and pulled out. No fragment of nail plate should remain under the proximal nail fold.

### Wedge excision of the nail fold in the treatment of ingrown toenail [^074bf092]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Many treatment modalities of ingrown toenail are reported in the literature, often associated with unacceptably high recurrence rate. The authors present their technique, which aims at reducing the convexity of the nail fold. After complete removal of the nail plate and accurate debridement of the granulomatous tissue, a wedge-shaped ellipsis of skin and subcutaneous tissue, lateral to the affected nail fold, is removed. Approximation of the margins of the resulting defect determines eversion of the nail fold. One hundred twenty ingrown toenails were treated with the wedge excision of the nail fold at the outpatient clinic of the department of plastic surgery, Campus Bio-Medico University, Rome, Italy, between January 1998 and January 2002. Six recurrences were observed. In addition to the high cure rate, short postoperative pain duration, and morbidity as well as low risk of postoperative infection, the remarkable esthetic results achievable with this method are indicated.

### Partial matricectomy with a CO ₂ laser for ingrown toenail after nail matrix staining [^ca7616f9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown toenail is a common nail disease that causes pain, discomfort, and difficulty in walking. It is treated with either conservative therapy or surgery.

Objective

To present a new surgical approach to ingrown toenail.

Materials and Methods

For 19 ingrown toenail borders of 14 toes in 14 patients (1 male and 13 females), the nail matrix was stained with methylene blue and then partial matricectomy was performed with a CO2 laser.

Results

There was no recurrence at 18 nail borders after a mean follow-up period of 13.4 months, whereas a spike grew at one border but caused no walking pain. No serious complications occurred. Cosmetic improvement was also satisfactory.

Conclusions

Partial nail matricectomy with a CO2 laser after staining the nail matrix with methylene blue allows visual confirmation of the completeness of cauterization.

### Partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery: a comparison of two surgical methods in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^8976450e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

An ingrown toenail is a common, painful, and debilitating condition.

Objective

This study aims to compare 2 surgical methods (partial matricectomy with curettage and electrocautery) in the treatment of ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

A total of 92 ingrown nails of the big toe in 86 patients underwent partial matricectomy with curettage, whereas 57 ingrown nails of the big toe in 52 patients underwent partial matricectomy with electrocautery.

Results

Recurrence was observed in 2 toenails in the partial matricectomy with curettage group, whereas no recurrence was observed in the partial matricectomy with electrocautery group (p > .05). The mean period of postoperative pain was 2.3 and 3.1 days in the curettage group and the electrocautery group, respectively (p < .05). There was a significant difference in the duration of scar tissue inflammation (p < .05).

Conclusion

Both surgical methods are safe treatment modalities with a high success rate. Partial matricectomy, which is achieved using curettage, seems to be superior to electrocautery in respect of reduced inflammation and duration of pain.

### Recurrent ingrown toenails secondary to indinavir / ritonavir combination therapy [^d58c61ea]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report five cases of ingrown toenails (IGTN) associated with indinavir/ritonavir (IDV/RTV) combination therapy.

Case Summary

The median onset of IGTN from initiation of IDV/RTV therapy was 18.4 weeks. Four patients previously received IDV, with one of these experiencing prior IGTN. All patients required surgical management of IGTN. All patients received virologic benefit from ongoing antiretroviral therapy, and the majority of patients elected to maintain IDV/RTV combination therapy. Two patients experienced recurrent IGTN while receiving ongoing IDV/RTV combination therapy.

Discussion

IGTN and paronychia have previously been reported with IDV and lamivudine. IGTN in patients with HIV infection is more likely to present acutely, involve more digits, and require surgical management IDV increases retinoic acid signaling and, based on elevated IDV concentrations from concomitant RTV therapy, the risk of IGTN may be increased in patients receiving IDV/RTV combination therapy.

Conclusions

With the increasing popularity of IDV/RTV combination therapy, clinicians should be aware of the potential increase in frequency of dose-related toxicities including IGTN. Evaluation of hands and feet on physical examination should be recommended for all patients being treated with lamivudine and IDV, especially when used in combination with RTV.

### Treatment of ingrown toenail with proximolateral matrix partial excision and matrix phenolization [^fcc6c45c]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ingrown toenail is one of the most common nail conditions. Although many surgical treatments are described for complicated cases, recurrence of pain and postoperative disability are common. We evaluated the long-term efficacy of proximolateral matrix partial excision followed by chemical matricectomy with phenol.

Methods

We performed 348 proximolateral partial matricectomies and phenol ablations in 225 patients with stage 2 or 3 ingrown toenail. Patients were examined weekly until full wound healing was achieved and were observed for 24 months to assess the long-term efficacy of the treatment.

Results

Short-term results were good. We observed only 1 recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period, at 8 months. The success rate was therefore 99.7%. No severe complications occurred. Cosmetic results were remarkably good.

Conclusions

Proximolateral partial matricectomy with phenol ablation is an excellent surgical method for the treatment of ingrown toenails, having low morbidity and a high success rate, even in the long term.

### Treatment of ingrown nail with a special device composed of shape-memory alloy [^b3147466]. The Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Ingrown nail is a common nail problem resulting in pain and disability in daily life. Recently, a new treatment modality for an ingrown nail was reported that used a device composed of shape-memory alloy, K-D. The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy, recurrence rate and complications of K-D. Between June 2010 and September 2012, 24 patients (31 nails) underwent treatment of symptomatic incurved nails with a K-D. Patients were evaluated at pretreatment and during every visit. The mean age of the patients involved was 43.4 years. The mean period of follow up was 161 days. The mean maintenance period was 41 days. The right first toenail was the most common site. Almost ingrown nails healed and the nail deformity was corrected after the procedure. Among the 31 nails, seven of the ingrown nails recurred during follow up (22.6% recurrence rate). The recurrence rate of the patients with stage 1, 2 and 3 ingrown nails was 22.2%, 33.3% and 14.2%, respectively. The majority of patients were very satisfied. There were no side-effects in most patients except loss of nail in one patient. K-D has some advantages such as simple application steps, no deformity after the procedure, high patient satisfaction and obvious effect compared to other non-invasive and invasive methods.

### Interpretation of radiologic abnormalities in patients with chronically infected ingrown toenails with regard to a possible exogenic osteomyelitis [^3e14232c]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic infection of ingrown toenails may lead to exogenous osteomyelitis. Therefore, plain x-rays are commonly taken in children with significant inflammation. We evaluated the preoperative radiologic findings and their clinical significance, especially with regard to exogenic osteomyelitis.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent surgery for infected ingrown toenails during a 5-year period. Data collection included the history of infection, preoperative laboratory tests, preoperative x-rays, and intraoperative presentation.

Findings

One hundred thirty-four patients with infected ingrown nails of the hallux underwent 161 surgical procedures. Mean age at surgery was 14.1 years. Preoperative x-rays were taken in 113 (70.2%) cases. The treating surgeon classified 76 (67.2%) x-rays as negative (no bone affection), 16 (14.2%) as positive (definite bone affection), and 21 (18.6%) as suspicious for bone affection. Only 11 (30%) of 37 children with positive or suspicious x-rays showed bone affection during surgery, which presented as a softening of the cortical bone. None of the children had significantly elevated inflammation markers in the preoperative laboratory tests. Children with positive or suspicious x-rays had a significant longer history of infection compared to those without radiologic abnormalities (8 vs 4.5 weeks mean; P = 0.024). A reevaluation of the x-rays by an experienced radiologist was undertaken and revealed no case of definite osteolysis.

Conclusion

In about one third of all infected ingrown toenails, radiologic changes of the distal phalanx occur. These changes primarily represent periostal reactions. A typical osteomyelitis as a complication of chronically infected ingrown toenails is rare.

### Nail-fold excision for the treatment of ingrown toenail in children [^db7b9783]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of the nail-fold excision procedure in children.

Study Design

Prospectively collected data on patients less than 18 years of age who underwent a nail-fold excision for symptomatic ingrown toenail were analyzed. Patients were seen in 2 centers and data collected included demographics, site of ingrown toenail, complications (including recurrence), patient satisfaction, and duration of follow-up.

Results

Overall, 67 procedures were performed on 50 patients between June 2009 and July 2011 at the 2 institutions. The mean age was 14 years (range, 9–18 years) and 30 were male patients. No recurrences were seen after a follow-up for a median of 14 months (range 6–28 months). Patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. Six minor complications occurred, including 3 patients with bleeding requiring dressing change, 2 with excessive granulation tissue, and 1 with nail growth abnormality.

Conclusions

The nail-fold excision technique is highly effective in the pediatric population, with no recurrence, excellent cosmesis, and very high patient satisfaction.

### Management of the ingrown toenail… [^d379c944]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Approximately 20 percent of patients presenting to a family physician with a foot problem have an ingrown toenail, also known as onychocryptosis. 1 Ingrown toenails occur when the periungual skin is punctured by its corresponding nail plate, resulting in a cascade of foreign body, inflammatory, infectious, and reparative processes. 2 Ultimately, this may result in a painful, draining, and foul-smelling lesion of the involved toe, with soft tissue hypertrophy around the nail plate. Causes and Risk Factors Based on clinical experience, ingrown toe-nails are thought to be caused by improper nail trimming or tearing nails off. Because of poor visualization or instrumentation, a barb is created that anchors itself in the soft periungual tissues and penetrates deeply as the nail plate grows distally. Force during ambulation, pressure from constricting footwear, and obesity drive the nail barb penetration and worsens its severity.
2. Risk factors predisposing to development of ingrown toenails include anatomic and behavioral mechanisms. Some experts suggest that wider nail folds and thinner, flatter nails increase the risk of ingrown toenails, 3 but this remains unproven. A case-control study with 46 patients found no difference in the anatomic shape of toenails in patients with and without ingrown toenails. 4 Repetitive trauma or inadvertent trauma may be inciting factors.
5. Without any strict evidence basis, it is thought that a genetic predisposition and family history, 3 hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene increase the likelihood of ingrown toenails. 6 Diabetes, obesity, and thyroid, cardiac, and renal disorders that may predispose to lower extremity edema can also increase the likelihood.
7. In adolescence, feet perspire more often, causing the skin and nails to become soft, resulting in easy splitting.

This produces nail spicules that can pierce the lateral skin. In older persons, spicule formation can become a chronic problem caused by their reduced ability to care for their nails secondary to reduced mobility or impaired vision. In addition, the natural aging process causes toenails to thicken, making them more difficult to cut and more inclined to exert pressure on the lateral skin at the sides of the nail plate, often becoming ingrown, painful, and infected. 8.

### Efficacy of nail braces for acute and chronic ingrown toenails: a prospective study [^7c43e774]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nail braces are an alternative treatment for ingrown toenails.

Objective

This study aimed to prospectively examine the efficacy of nail braces for treatment of acute inflamed (AI)-type and chronic dystrophic-type ingrown toenails.

Materials and Methods

The authors conducted a prospective study of patients with ingrown toenails treated at Wan Fang Hospital between January 1, 2017, and July 31, 2018. Evaluation using physician global assessment scores and patient satisfaction questionnaires was performed at 1, 3, and 6 months after the start of treatment and during the final visit. Patient demographics, treatment courses, and outcomes were compared between the 2 types of ingrown toenails.

Results

Chronic dystrophic-type and AI-type ingrown toenails were observed in 25 (61 sides) and 28 patients (35 sides), respectively. Of the affected sides, 80.9%, 94.9%, and 100% achieved an excellent or fair result at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. Treatment duration and follow-up period were 179.2 ± 96.8 days and 281.6 ± 120.9, respectively. The recurrence rate was 7.4%. The treatment course and response were different between the 2 types of ingrown toenails.

Conclusion

Ingrown toenails could be effectively treated with nail braces with excellent outcomes, favorable patient satisfaction, and low recurrence rates.

### Evaluation of the recurrence rate of ingrown toenail after a 45-second matrix cauterization with phenol [^23122dcb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ingrown toenail is a very common nail disorder, and partial matricectomy by phenolization is considered the most effective treatment technique. However, the contact time of the phenol with the nail matrix remains debatable.

Objective

To evaluate the recurrence rate of ingrown toenail after partial matricectomy by phenol for 45 seconds.

Methods

A total of 1,460 surgeries were performed, with a photographic record of 802 pictures for a period of 6 months. The presence of any nail spicule or sign of ingrowth during follow-up was considered a recurrence.

Results

A total of 802 surgeries were evaluated, with the most affected nails being the right (49.3%) and left (48%) big toes and most frequently the lateral fold (54.5%). The recurrence rate was 0.75% at 3 months and 1.87% at 6 months, and the medial nail fold had a higher recurrence rate than the lateral nail fold.

Conclusion

Forty-five seconds of contact time of 88% phenol with the nail matrix was enough and effective, resulting in low recurrence rates. Prospective studies are needed to better assess postoperative morbidity.

### Nail changes in children with idiopathic congenital clubfoot deformity [^a669d99d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Nail alterations are commonly seen in cases of idiopathic clubfoot and may cause parental concern. The nature of and whether these changes are congenital or develop secondary to treatment has been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate toenail morphology in clubfoot patients at presentation, to re-evaluate them during the course of treatment for the clubfoot, and to analyze findings in the light of the few literature reports for healthy children of the same age.

Methods

Thirty infants (21 males and 9 females) with idiopathic clubfoot were prospectively enrolled at the Anna Meyer Children's University Hospital. Nails of affected and non-affected feet were evaluated by a team of pediatric dermatologists at presentation and re-evaluated once per patient during the bracing period of Ponseti treatment.

Results

Toenails of affected (47) and non-affected (13) feet were abnormal at presentation in 43.3% of patients, in both clubfeet (40.4%) and non-affected feet (38.5%), but most changes were physiologic or transitory alterations, commonly found in healthy children, with nail concavity (koilonychia) being the most common finding (29.7%). Changes were not related to clubfoot severity or laterality (P > .05). In most (76.9%) unilateral cases, there was concordance of nail changes between clubfoot and non-affected foot. At re-evaluation (follow-up time 410 ± 207 days), nail problems were more frequent (53.3%); ingrown toenail was the most common (21.6%).

Conclusions

The presence of nail alterations seems not to be caused by clubfoot pathology and could be related to unfavorable local condition in the brace.

### Surgical treatment of ingrown toenail without matricectomy [^99487794]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Partial excision of the nail matrix (matricectomy) is generally considered necessary in the surgical treatment of ingrown toenail. Recurrences may occur, however, and poor cosmetic results are frequently observed.

Objective

The objective is to present a new surgical procedure for ingrown toenail with complete preservation of the nail matrix.

Methods

Twenty-three patients with ingrown toenail were included in this study. The surgical excision was performed 1 week after the completion of treatment of the initial infection. A large volume of soft tissue surrounding the nail plate was removed under local anesthesia. No matrix excision was performed.

Results

Short-term results were excellent. No recurrences or severe complications were observed during the minimum 12-months follow-up period. Cosmetic results were remarkable.

Conclusions

Ingrown toenail results from the compression of the lateral nail folds on the nail plate. This study shows that ingrown toenail can be surgically treated without matricectomy. A large volume of soft tissue surrounding the nail plate should be removed to decompress the nail and reduce inflammation. Cosmetic results are excellent and superior to the classical Emmert plasty. Postoperative nail dystrophies and spicule formation are not observed. The main advantage of this surgical approach is the complete preservation of the anatomy and function of the nail to improve both therapeutic and cosmetic results.

### Clinical study of treatment for recalcitrant ingrown toenail by partial distal phalanx removal [^0535abd7]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify putative aetiological factors of recalcitrant ingrown toenail and then to introduce a new surgical technique for its treatment on the basis of this identification. We found that many of our patients had an upturned morphology on the distal phalanx beneath the recalcitrant ingrown toenail. We thereby designed a new operative technique to treat this problem. From October 1997 to May 2006, 31 patients (38 toes), who were operated on using the new technique, were assigned to the experimental group. Another 38 patients, who were randomly selected from the population without an ingrown toenail, were assigned to the control group. Briefly, the operation is performed as follows: make an elliptical skin incision distal to the hyponychium. Remove the wedge of tissue through incision, together with the periosteum on the lateral side of the distal phalanx. Expose and then transect the distal part of the distal phalanx. Twenty-nine patients (36 toes) were included in the follow up which varied in length from 8 to 29 months. None of them had recurrent symptoms. In conclusion, an upturned abnormality of the distal phalanx may contribute, at least partly, to the formation of recalcitrant ingrown toenail. The partial distal phalanx removal could be considered as an effective technique in recalcitrant ingrown toenail therapy.

### Comparison of phenol matricectomy and nail-splinting with a flexible tube for the treatment of ingrown toenails [^ec3ab330]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of ingrown toenail is usually bothersome for patients and doctors.

Objectives

To compare two treatment techniques of ingrown toenails-phenol matricectomy (PM) and nail-splinting using a flexible tube (FT)-in terms of efficacy, postoperative pain, postoperative cosmetic satisfaction, amount of tissue damage, and recurrence.

Methods and Materials

One hundred twenty ingrown toenails were randomized and divided into PM and FT groups. All cases were evaluated 2 days and 1 and 6 months after treatment. Postoperative pain, cosmetic satisfaction, time to recovery, and recurrence rate were measured.

Results

Postoperative pain was less and cosmetic satisfaction was good in both groups (p < .001). Our recurrence rate was 8.4%. There were no statistical differences between groups in these measures. Tissue improvement rate was 6% in the PM group and 93% in the FT group 2 days after the procedures (p < .001).

Conclusions

Although FT provides faster recovery and less postoperative morbidity than PM, the techniques are equally effective in treating ingrown toenails.

### Nail braces as an alternative treatment for ingrown toenails: results from a comparison with the winograd technique [^13109c70]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Ingrown toenails are one of the most frequent nail disorders and can be treated with conservative or surgical approaches. Although discovered a long time ago, the available data are still very limited on the potential effectiveness of nail braces for ingrown toenail treatment. In the present retrospective study, we compared nail braces with surgical wedge excision using the Winograd technique with respect to the time to return to work, recurrence, interval to recurrence, and patient satisfaction. A total of 159 patients were divided into the nail brace (n = 74; mean age 29.51 ± 8.48 years) and Winograd technique (n = 85; mean age 26.95 ± 8.06 years) groups. In the nail brace group, the mean time to return to work (4.15 ± 1.07 days) was significantly shorter than that in the Winograd technique group (13.8 ± 2.26 days; p < .001). Patient satisfaction was significantly greater in the nail brace group (94.6%) compared with the Winograd technique group (82.4%; p = .018). Of the 159 patients, 6 (8.1%) in the nail brace group and 8 (9.4%) in the Winograd technique group developed recurrence; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p > .05). A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean interval to recurrence (12.46 ± 1.60 versus 13.24 ± 2.48 months, respectively; p = .031). The progression-free follow-up periods for the nail brace and Winograd technique groups were 15.45 ± 0.22 months (95% confidence interval 15.02 to 15.88) and 17.18 ± 0.29 months (95% confidence interval 16.61 to 17.84), respectively. We have concluded that the use of nail braces is an appropriate alternative treatment of ingrown toenails with high patient satisfaction, fast recovery times, and a low recurrence rate.

### Storylines of family medicine IX: people and places-diverse populations and locations of care [^0aafa37a]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Family physicians in the procedure room

Jay Allen, Lauren Giammar and John Wood

Never expect a farmer to drive three hours away to get a procedure. He'll say, 'Fine, Doc'. Then he'll drive home and do it himself.

Services provided in primary care settings can be largely organised into three categories: disease prevention, medical management and therapeutic procedures. Although disease prevention and medical management remain core tenets of every primary care specialty, only family medicine continues to place a significant emphasis on the development of procedural skills in residency training and their application in practice. Why? Procedural care contributes to patients' trust in their family physicians: it nurtures the physician–patient relationship and breaks down barriers to healthcare access.

Common procedures in family medicine — What procedures do we as family physicians do? Because every medical ecosystem is different, as is every physician, there is no 'one-size-fits-all' list of procedures. As family physicians, we may do any of the following procedures:

Remove things, including ingrown toenails, skin lesions or other tissues, skin tags, fishhooks placed by overzealous anglers and other foreign bodies.
Shave, punch, excise, fulgurate, desiccate, cauterise, suture and freeze.
Aspirate and inject, poke needles into joints and other spaces, often accompanied by point-of-care ultrasound.
Drain abscesses.
Splint and cast common fractures.
Insert and remove long-acting reversible contraceptives, along with a variety of other procedures related to women's and reproductive health needs.

### Partial matrix excision or orthonyxia for ingrowing toenails [^50ac391a]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We wanted to evaluate whether partial matrix excision and orthonyxia are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toenails of the hallux.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial with 12-month observer-blinded followup, in the surgical outpatient department of a teaching hospital. We randomized 105 consecutive patients with a total of 109 ingrown toenails to either partial matrix excision (n = 58) or an orthonyxia procedure (n = 51). The main outcomes measurements were rate of recurrence after 12 months, postoperative morbidity, and time to complete recovery.

Results

The 12-month followup was completed in 55 of 58 patients undergoing partial matrix excision and 47 of 51 patients having orthonyxia. There were four ingrown toenails, four recurrences in the partial matrix excision group, and eight in the orthonyxia group (NS, p = 0.14). Postoperative morbidity parameters (redness, pus, postoperative bleeding); time to complete recovery, wearing shoes (p < 0.01), and performing activities of daily living and hobbies; postoperative symptoms; and patient satisfaction all favored orthonyxia.

Conclusions

Partial matrix excision and orthonyxia are equally effective treatments for ingrown toenails. But the orthonyxia procedure showed better results, with less postoperative morbidity, shorter time to complete recovery, fewer postoperative symptoms, and greater patient satisfaction.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenails in dizygotic twins [^8605c5da]. Pediatric Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital malalignment of the great toenails is a nail disorder caused by the malalignment of the nail matrix, which results in lateral growth of the nail plate. It may cause onychogryphosis and, in infants and children, ingrown nails. We report an occurrence of this deformity in dizygotic twins.

### Morphologic study of normal, ingrown, and pincer nails [^0e37bc4b]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pincer nail has been confused with ingrown nail for decades.

Objective

The objectives were to analyze the circumferential length of pincer nail and the relationship between nail deformity and the underlying distal phalangeal shape.

Methods

The circumferential length of 53 pincer nails was determined at successive 5-mm intervals of the nail plate. Sixty great toes, including normal (n = 20), ingrown (n = 20), and pincer nails (n = 20), were assessed with respect to body height, body weight, body mass index, nail height, nail width index, and nail height index. Nail angle and height of osteophyte were measured.

Results

Despite the presence or absence of overcurvature, the circumferential length displayed nearly identical values across the proximal to distal range of the nail. In the pincer nail group, only the correlation between the width and height indices was statistically significant; 50%, 80%, and 100% of cases were confirmed based on osteophyte presence in normal, ingrown, and pincer nails.

Conclusion

The findings suggest that the mechanical cause may be associated with the over curved nail, which is affected by nail bed contraction. Results may support the hypothesis that an osteophyte of the distal phalanx may not be a cause of, but rather a result of, an overcurving deformity.

### The choice of self-rated health measures matter when predicting mortality: evidence from 10 years follow-up of the Australian longitudinal study of ageing [^d9d98140]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

In the current study the utility of the SRH items to predict mortality was dependent on age. In particular, the two comparative measures did not provide unique information of mortality risk in adults over 75 years of age. It has been argued that the age-comparative item is not appropriate to use in older populations, or samples with a large age range, due to its sensitivity to age. The current findings support this notion of age-sensitivity and extend it to the self-comparative item. Further research is needed to clarify whether these comparison effects extend to other age groups or are merely cohort effects.

Whilst the focus of the current study was on the impact of the varying SRH measures on mortality, and the majority of the covariate relationships with mortality are as expected, there are findings in the models that are note worthy. For example, we found a significant protective effect for number of medical conditions. We suggest that the counterintuitive relationship between number of medical conditions and mortality found here are a product of the large number of non-life threatening conditions that were included, such as cataracts, gout, hernia, ingrown toenails, and migraines. The conditions included in the aggregate variable were not weighted here for life-threat, as previous research has suggested that this does not necessarily improve model fit, however the combination of stage of disease and comorbidity was found by these authors to increase mortality risk. Together with the current findings it is suggested that future research is needed to ascertain the best way to measure and weight comorbidity in relation to mortality risk.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^ca3a9e8c]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 3. What is the underlying pathologic mechanisms contributing to retronychia?

A. Proximal nail fold trauma
B. Irritant dermatitis
C. Chronic fungal infection
D. Chronic bacterial infection
E. Nail matrix trauma

Answers

A. Proximal nail fold trauma – Incorrect. Although the proximal nail fold suffers trauma in retronychia due to a proximally growing nail plate, trauma to the proximal nail fold is not what causes a retronychia to develop.
B. Irritant dermatitis – Incorrect. Although irritant dermatitis is a common cause of chronic paronychia, it is not responsible for retronychia.
C. Chronic fungal infection – Incorrect. Fungal infection is not associated with retronychia.
D. Chronic bacterial infection – Incorrect. Bacterial infection might develop secondary to the disruption of the seal of the proximal nail fold and nail plate due to trauma from the ingrowing nail plate; however, it is not the cause of the proximally growing nail plate.
E. Nail matrix trauma – Correct. Retronychia occurs secondary to minor physical trauma to the nail matrix often from the distal free edge of the nail plate being pushed backwards into the nail matrix, as would happen with long nails or with poor fitting footwear. The traumatic event might be a singular event, such as a stubbed toe, or might occur from repetitive trauma as one might experience with jogging, dancing, or wearing tight-fitting shoes. After the traumatic event occurs, the nail plate separates completely from the nail matrix, and a new plate grows under the old plate. This growth results in the old plate pushing up into the proximal nail fold, causing inflammation at the proximal nail fold. In addition, the distal nail plate becomes more adherent and, in this case, was noticeably more difficult to elevate than a typical nail plate avulsion with a Freer elevator. The length the patient's toe nails and his report of tight-fitting boots support the diagnosis of retronychia through repetitive trauma. In addition, the patient has multiple Beau lines on his second toenail which is a clue that the patient's nail matrices have experienced repetitive trauma.

### Efinaconazole in onychomycosis [^f8954f48]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection that causes nail discoloration, nail plate thickening, and onycholysis. Efinaconazole 10% topical solution is an FDA-approved treatment for onychomycosis patients aged 6 years and above. The drug functions as an antifungal by disrupting ergosterol synthesis in the fungal cell membrane. It exhibits higher in vitro activity against dermatophytes than other available antifungals such as ciclopirox and itraconazole, and the activity is comparable to amorolfine and terbinafine. Efinaconazole also provides enhanced nail penetration compared with other topical antifungals due to low surface tension, poor water solubility, and low keratin affinity. The pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the efinaconazole topical delivery to the nail bed is not markedly affected by the presence of disease. There is a subset of onychomycosis patients who are more likely to respond to efinaconazole 10% solution: female patients, those with lower BMI, mild onychomycosis, a short disease duration, no infected non-target toenails (large toenail disease only), and when concomitant tinea pedis is treated. Experts recommend efinaconazole 10% topical solution as the first line for mild-to-moderate onychomycosis, pediatric onychomycosis, those with liver or kidney disease, and as maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. The side effects of topical efinaconazole are minimal: most commonly ingrown toenails, dermatitis, vesicles, and pain at the application site. Altogether, phase I and phase III clinical trials, and post-hoc analyses indicate that efinaconazole 10% topical solution is a safe and effective treatment for adult and pediatric onychomycosis, with a satisfactory mycological and clinical cure.

### Marjolin's squamous cell carcinoma of the hallux following recurrent ingrown toenail infections [^d1e0f78d]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Marjolin's squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) affecting the toe is rare. Due to resemblance with benign conditions it can often result in misdiagnosis. We report a case of Marjolin's SCC affecting the proximal hallux in a patient with recurrent ingrown toenail infections. A 58-year-old woman with a background of wedge resections for ingrown toenail and distal phalanx amputation for osteomyelitis presented with pain and hyperkeratotic raised ulcer around the proximal phalanx. MRI scan revealed soft tissue mass infiltrating the proximal phalanx with biopsies confirming a SCC. The patient underwent first ray amputation and made a good clinical recovery and remains disease free. Due to clinical similarities with benign conditions, awareness of Marjolin's SCC as a potential diagnosis when treating patients with recurrent ingrown toenail is imperative. We recommend patients with recurrent ingrown toenail or ulceration with a background of chronic infection have biopsies performed to exclude potential malignancy.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^8d8b8706]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Two RCTs concluded that sharp scalpel debridement had no benefits over sham debridement in adults with IA. In a small prospective cohort study (n = 8), treatment effect was lost by seven days. The rationale for adjunctive treatments are discussed under Recommendations 4–10 and 13. No studies have been undertaken in adults with other types of IA, or children and young people with IA. GWG members with podiatric expertise agreed that inflammatory callus margins in PsA should not be debrided. In the case of suspected ulceration, and in people with diabetes, sharp scalpel debridement of overlying callus should be performed to reveal the size and nature of the ulcer, assess for infection and promote healing. Additionally, callus is a risk factor for foot ulceration in people with diabetes, and sharp scalpel debridement should be performed. Sharp debridement, when required, should only be undertaken by competent practitioners with specialist training.

13. Emollients are safe and effective, and can be offered for the relief of dry skin affecting the foot in IA. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

Rationale

The effectiveness of emollients for foot health in IA has not been formally evaluated in clinical studies. Emollients are widely recommended for other conditions (e.g. in eczema and diabetes), and risk of harm is low. Consideration should be given to other physical problems experienced by some people with IA, such as hand problems, which could make the application of emollients difficult.

14. All adults or children and young people with IA should be offered personalized nail care advice, including footwear advice, to help prevent and/or treat common toenail pathologies. People should be advised when to access foot health care, e.g. for ingrowing toenails, wounds and infections, and how to do this. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 99.
15. Systemic control of disease activity is the aim of treatment, including joint disease and extra-articular manifestations, e.g. skin and nail disease in psoriatic arthritis. Foot skin and nail health should be assessed and managed in the context of systemic disease. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
16. In the presence of recurrent pain or infection, surgical removal of nails can be considered. SOR: 2; LOE: C; SOA: 96.

### Nail toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy [^4247f189]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

As the use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors becomes more widespread, increasing data are being collected regarding both efficacy and toxicity. Cutaneous toxicities are emerging not only as the most relevant class-related events, but also as potentially important markers of response to therapy. Although a follicular eruption is the most frequent cutaneous manifestation of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition, ingrown nails, paronychia, and xerosis and desquamation of the digits, all of which occur in a substantial number of patients, require attention from treating oncologists and dermatologists. These nail disorders are mostly mild to moderate in severity, but, if not properly managed, can result in significant pain and interfere with activities of daily living. Descriptions of the nail and periungual toxicities associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy and prevention and treatment strategies are presented.

### Toxic side effects of targeted therapies and immunotherapies affecting the skin, oral mucosa, hair, and nails [^56fe1b03]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nail Toxicities

Nail Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies may cause damage to nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions (Fig. 4 a, b) that are mostly observed in the nail plate or the nail matrix. As some patients may receive both treatment types combined, clinicians must be fully informed of differences between chemotherapy and targeted therapy-associated nail toxicities. Paronychia and periungual granulomas are mostly reported in response to EGFRIs, with a 17.2% all-grade toxicity incidence, as well as MEKIs and mTOR inhibitors to a lesser extent. Typical lesions, which mostly affect toenails or thumbs, develop slowly after several weeks or months of treatment. Damage typically starts with the development of periungual inflammatory paronychia and can evolve into overgrowing of friable granulation tissue on lateral and/or proximal nail folds, mimicking ingrown nails. Although usually not severe, such lesions can still be very debilitating for the patient, especially when they persist for a long time. Therefore, aggressive strategies must be implemented to help patients cope with these adverse effects. The standard of care for pyogenic granuloma is surgery with partial removal of the nail plate and matrix and physical destruction of the granulation tissue and phenolization. In patients with multiple concomitant lesions, conservative treatment should be prioritized, with supportive oncodermatology while maintaining targeted therapy. In close collaboration with a podiatrist, nail curvature can be corrected if needed. Stretchable tape, liquid nitrogen, a combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics, antiseptic soaks, and silver nitrate can also be used. Topical timolol can also be helpful for periungual pyogenic granuloma.

### Comparison of wedge resection (winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^f02482b3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The present retrospective study compared the efficacy of wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion for the treatment of ingrown toenails (onychocryptosis). Two surgical methods were performed in 95 patients with a stage 2 or 3 ingrown toenail. Each patient was examined weekly until healing and then at 1, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The outcomes measured were surgical duration, healing time, recurrence rate, the incidence of postoperative infection, and cosmetic appearance after surgery. Of the 95 patients (115 ingrown toenails) included in the present study, 39 (41.1%) underwent wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 56 (59%), wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. The mean surgical duration for wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion was 14.9 ± 2.4 minutes and 15.1 ± 3.2 minutes, respectively (p = .73). The corresponding healing times were 2.8 ± 1.2 weeks and 2.7 ± 1.3 weeks (p = .70). Recurrence developed in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and in 4 (4.2%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. In addition, postoperative infection occurred in 3 (3.2%) patients after wedge resection (Winograd procedure) and 2 (2.1%) after wedge resection plus complete nail plate avulsion. Both of the surgical procedures were practical and appropriate for the treatment of ingrown toenails, being simple and associated with low morbidity and a high success rate. However, cosmetically, wedge resection (Winograd procedure) would be the better choice because the nail plate remains intact.

### A minimally invasive surgical approach for ingrown toenails: partial germinal matrix excision using operative microscope [^65a24ea5]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

There are various methods for surgical treatment of ingrown toenails. The aim of surgery is to remove the partial germinal matrix completely, but with minimal invasiveness. In previously reported methods, the surgical procedures have been invasive, and it is uncertain whether the partial germinal matrix is completely removed.

Objective

A new, less-invasive surgical approach — partial germinal matrix excision using operative microscope — is reported.

Methods

Seventy-seven lesions of 56 ingrown toenails in 46 patients were treated with this method. Under an operative microscope, the germinal matrix was excised completely, but with minimal invasiveness.

Result

No cases of recurrence or spicule formation occurred, and the time required for wound healing was about 2 weeks.

Conclusion

This method is less-invasive compared with traditional methods and is effective for the treatment of ingrown toenails. This method could be an alternative treatment technique.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^f0def9e4]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The effectiveness of emollients for foot health in IA has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. Emollients are widely recommended for dry skin conditions generally and for dry skin on the feet (with the exception of interdigital areas), and for plantar callus for people with foot problems in diabetes. Emollients are also recommended for people with psoriasis to improve dryness, scaling and cracking, particularly for the soles of the feet. The SOR is based on expert opinion, widespread use of emollients in routine practice and low risk of harm. Consideration should be given to other physical problems experienced by some people with IA, such as hand problems, which could make the application of emollients difficult.

### Randomized clinical trial of surgical technique and local antibiotics for ingrowing toenail [^7c51118e]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to investigate different surgical techniques for treating ingrowing toenails (IGTNs) and to determine the value of a locally applied antibiotic after intervention.

Methods

One hundred and twenty-three patients with IGTN were assigned randomly to one of four groups. All patients had partial nail avulsion. This was combined with excision of the matrix or application of phenol, with or without local application of gentamicin afterwards. All procedures were performed by one physician. The primary outcome measure was symptomatic recurrence of IGTN.

Results

One hundred and seventeen patients were available for follow-up. Phenol gave significantly better results than matrix excision with respect to recurrence (including regrowth and spike formation) after 1 year (P < 0.001). In terms of signs of infection, there was no significant difference between phenol and matrix excision after 2 days (P = 0.224) or 1 week (P = 0.501). Antibiotics had no effect in reducing the risk of infection after 2 days (P = 0.989) or 1 week (P = 0.676), or in reducing the rate of recurrent IGTN at 1 year (P = 0.187). If regrowth or spike formation is included, the effect is even less significant (P = 0.876).

Conclusion

Partial nail avulsion with phenolization gave better results than partial avulsion with matrix excision. Local antibiotics did not reduce signs of infection or recurrence. Use of phenol did not produce more signs of infection than matrix excision.

### Ciclopirox (Ciclodan) [^1d732213]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In the vehicle-controlled clinical trials conducted in the US, 9% (30/327) of patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), and 7% (23/328) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material.

The incidence of these adverse events, within each body system, was similar between the treatment groups except for Skin and Appendages: 8% (27/327) and 4% (14/328) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event, respectively. The most common were rash-related adverse events: periungual erythema and erythema of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), (5% [16/327]) than in patients treated with vehicle (1% [3/328]). Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included nail disorders such as shape change, irritation, ingrown toenail, and discoloration.

The incidence of nail disorders was similar between the treatment groups (2% [6/327] in the Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), group and 2% [7/328] in the vehicle group). Moreover, application site reactions and/or burning of the skin occurred in 1% of patients treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, (Nail Lacquer), (3/327) and vehicle (4/328).

### Distal nail embedding treatment using autogenous nails [^60acfbb5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A regrowing nail tip after nail avulsion may excessively curve and invaginate into the nail bed. This is treated as a type of ingrown toenail, and is known as distal nail embedding. In most cases, further growth restores the original shape evenly over the nail bed. However, it is often painful and such cases may require treatment. We report a surgical approach that we applied to six cases of distal nail embedding involving pain or deformity of nails caused by a nail tip invaginating into the nail bed and/or cessation of forward nail growth. As our method involves removing a portion of the embedded tip edge nail and inserting the removed nail into the remaining depressed portion, the nail can grow over the bulge. In all six patients in whom we applied this method, the pain and nail deformity resolved and there was no recurrence. We used autogenous nails, which can reduce the pressure imbalance on a nail bed, and this contributed to improving the morphology of nails and nail beds. In addition, the risk of a hypertrophied nail is reduced because half of the nail adheres to the nail bed. Special materials are unnecessary and this method can be conducted with simple outpatient department procedures. There were no cases of a fixed nail section detaching due to a bulge at the nail tip. The inserted nail was maintained in all cases for several months until the nail grew over the bulge.

### The use of autologous platelet gel in toenail surgery: a within-patient clinical trial [^71eae666]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

A number of studies have stressed the importance of platelets in acute and chronic wound healing, although their clinical utility remains controversial. To analyze the use of autologous platelet gel in the surgical treatment of ingrown toenails, a within-patient clinical trial was conducted. Thirty-five healthy volunteers (70 feet) underwent surgical treatment for bilateral ingrown hallux nails. Recovery time (days), postoperative pain (analog chromatic scale), and inflammation (digital circumference) at 48 hours postoperative were the outcomes of interest. Recovery time and postoperative pain were less in the experimental group, although the differences of means were not statistically significant. Based on these results, we suggest that local application of APG in surgical ingrown toenail wounds may produce a slight increase in acute inflammatory phase dermal wound healing, but it does not cause a statistically significant reduction in recovery times or postoperative pain.

### Review and therapeutic approach to malalignment of the great toenails: a common condition that is uncommonly diagnosed [^94b20d61]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Malalignment of the great toenails is a common nail disorder that is uncommonly recognized in general practice.

Objective

Review available literature on lateral malalignment of the great toenails to increase awareness of this underdiagnosed condition and provide management recommendations.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted using the terms " congenital malalignment toenail" and "malalignment great toenail". All articles were reviewed, and all relevant articles were included in this analysis.

Results

Thirty-four distinct articles encompassing 117 patients with similar clinical findings: lateral deviation of the great toenails with yellow brown dyschromia, thickening, and scalloping.

Limitations

Description of malalignment and terminology can vary, which may have led to exclusion of some relevant articles.

Conclusion

Lateral malalignment is a common nail condition that is underappreciated and often misdiagnosed in general dermatologic and medical practice. This review aims to increase awareness to facilitate better care of these patients.

### The effectiveness of matrix cauterization with bichloracetic acid in the treatment of ingrown toenails [^28c8533c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chemical matricectomy is performed mainly by 2 agents, phenol and sodium hydroxide. Chemical matricectomy with phenol has a low recurrence rate and good cosmetic results, but it produces extensive tissue destruction and can result in drainage and a delayed healing time. These adverse effects have brought forward the use of chemical agents such as sodium hydroxide and trichloroacetic acid for matricectomy.

Objective

This prospective study aimed mainly to evaluate the efficacy of partial nail avulsion and selective chemical cauterization of the matrix using 90% bichloracetic acid (BCA) in the treatment of the ingrown nails.

Materials and Methods

A total of 30 patients with 58 ingrown toenail edges were included in this study. All of the patients underwent chemical matricectomy with 90% BCA after partial nail avulsion. Adverse effects such as postoperative pain and drainage were minimal in most of the patients.

Results

One patient who underwent matricectomy had recurrence in a single nail edge (1.8%) at the 12th month of the follow-up. No recurrence was observed in 29 patients during mean follow-up period. This was considered to be statistically significant (p < .001).

Conclusion

This is the first study to use BCA for the treatment of ingrown toenail. Partial nail avulsion followed by BCA matricectomy is a safe, simple, and effective method with low rates of postoperative morbidity and high rates of success. Therefore, partial nail avulsion and BCA matricectomy can be used as an alternative treatment method for the treatment of ingrown toenails.

### Foot self-care practices among Filipino American women with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^0af5f064]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

One in six individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) will develop a foot ulcer in his/her lifetime; 7% have foot ulcers at any given time, and 15% of foot ulcers end in amputation.-Foot ulcers are the most expensive complication of type 2 DM, accounting for about 20% of the costs and 30% of hospital admissions associated with treating persons with type 2 DM. Compliance with proper foot care reduces the incidence of foot ulcers, particularly among persons with reduced severity of neuropathy. A study by Apelqvist and Agardhfound that 25% of clients who had foot ulcers underwent amputation, and 13% died. Moreover, as many as 85% of lower extremity amputations can be avoided by prompt and appropriate treatment of diabetic foot wounds and ulcers by healthcare providers, as well as optimum foot self-care practices by individuals affected by the condition.-Unfortunately, many persons with type 2 DM do not receive adequate foot care instruction from their healthcare providers and, as such, do not perform routine foot examinations.

Optimum foot self-care practices include daily inspection of feet and inside of shoes; daily washing of feet and careful drying afterwards (especially the areas inbetween the toes); not walking barefoot; wearing proper footwear (use of therapeutic shoes with pressure-relieving insoles and not sandals or poorly fitting shoes); cutting toenails straight across; not removing ingrown toenails, calluses, corns, or warts oneself; avoiding the use of antiseptic lotions and adhesive tape on the feet; obtaining prompt professional healthcare treatment if new lesions, cuts, bruises, and wounds are noted; and screening of feet regularly, or at least once annually, by a healthcare provider to identify feet at risk for diabetic foot complications.-Many persons with type 2 DM, however, neglect their foot care18 and regular foot examinations because of painless neuropathic feet, which cause them to ignore even the more serious of foot injuries.1 Such persons may also cause additional foot damage by subjecting their feet to further trauma; while persons without peripheral neuropathy tend not to place weight upon an injured foot, those with peripheral neuropathy continue to do so.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c1e16cc5]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Skin cancer risk factors and disparities — types, UV exposure, and population differences: There are 2 main types of skin cancer, melanoma and keratinocyte carcinoma (KC), which consists of basal and squamous cell carcinoma, with KC more common but melanoma causing more deaths. Exposure to UV radiation from sun exposure, indoor tanning beds, and other UV radiation-emitting devices is the major environmental risk factor for skin cancer, and a history of frequent sunburns, older age, and male sex are associated with increased risk for skin cancer. Melanoma is about 30 times more common in White persons than in Black persons, and persons with darker skin color are often diagnosed at later stages when skin cancer is more difficult to treat; the most common type of melanoma among Black persons occurs mostly on skin not frequently exposed to direct sunlight, such as palms of hands, soles of feet, or under fingernails or toenails.

### Chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide for the treatment of ingrown toenails in people with diabetes [^9e8fcd4c]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of ingrown toenails using chemical matricectomy in patients with diabetes has been difficult, because delayed wound healing, wound infections, and digital ischemia can interfere with the procedure. Chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide is an effective treatment for ingrown toenails in a normal population.

Objectives

Investigation of the effectiveness and safety of chemical matricectomy with 10% sodium hydroxide solution for ingrown toenails in patients with diabetes.

Material and Methods

Thirty patients with diabetes with 40 ingrown toenails and 30 patients without diabetes with 41 ingrown toenails were enrolled in the study. After partial avulsion of the affected edge, germinal matrix was treated for 1 minute with 10% sodium hydroxide. Patients were observed on alternate days until complete healing was achieved and followed for up to 24 months for recurrence.

Results

Assessment of the treatment in both groups for complete healing, postoperative pain, tissue damage, drainage, infections, and rate of recurrences revealed no statistically significant difference.

Conclusions

The partial avulsion of the affected edge and the treatment of the germinal matrix for 1 minute with 10% sodium hydroxide preceded by matrix curettage is an effective and safe treatment modality for ingrown toenails in people with diabetes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^13102c61]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor-associated paronychia and periungual lesions — patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are at risk for nail changes that typically develop after two or more months of chemotherapy exposure, most commonly nail fold inflammation (paronychia) and periungual pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, with possible resultant onycholysis or onychodystrophy. Paronychia is characterized by tender, edematous, often purulent inflammation of the nail folds, affecting fingernails and toenails with the first digits most commonly affected; precedent trauma is not believed to be causative but rather an aggravating factor, and morbidity is high with significant pain, functional limitation, and impairment of activities of daily living; periungual pyogenic granulomata are characterized by friable vascular tissue overgrowths on lateral nail folds.

Follow-up appointments offered

As seen in figure 2, within the MUC patient cohort, 72.7% of patients received a postoperative follow-up appointment (n = 296/407), while only 60.8% of non-MUC patients were offered one (n = 192/316, p < 0.01). Within the non-MUC cohort, only 36.0% of the Northern and out-of-province patients received a postoperative follow-up appointment (31/86), whereas 70.0% of the remaining non-MUC group were given one (161/230). There is a statistically significant difference in the number of follow-up appointments offered to the Northern group compared with both the non-MUC and MUC cohorts (p < 0.001). With the separation of groups, there is no difference in follow-up appointments offered between the remaining non-MUC and MUC patients (p = 0.50). The reasons that patients do not have a follow-up appointment are provided in table 3. The type of procedure performed significantly impacted follow-up offers (table 4). MUC patients who underwent several procedures, including dermatological excision, hernia repair, ingrown toenail, cholecystectomy, or a breast operation, were offered a significantly greater number of follow-up appointments compared with non-MUC patients who had the same procedures (table 4).

### The MOBILIZE Boston study: design and methods of a prospective cohort study of novel risk factors for falls in an older population [^0c2902ec]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Foot and shoewear assessment

Foot disorders and foot symptoms were assessed using the validated Foot Assessment Clinical Tool to capture the main features of 25 common clinical foot disorders. This instrument has been found to have excellent reliability in 2 cohorts, and validity tested against podiatry examination. The Foot questionnaire and examination has two components: the first part queries respondents about pain and specific location of foot pain over various time frames, while the second component consists of a physical examination of the participant's feet. The foot pain questions are useful for global measures and the specific location of pain is used in the identification of specific foot pathology (e.g. plantar fasciitis). Common foot disorders that are examined include Structural Disorders (hallux valgus, pes planus, hammer toes, claw toes, overlapping toes, valgus/varus, Tailor's bunion, amputated toes, other foot deformity), Skin or Nail Disorders (hyperkeratosis, maceration, fissuring, tinea pedis, foot ulcer, ingrown toenail, nail disorders), Systemic Disorders (vascular insufficiency, ankle edema, hallux rigidus, foot infection, fat pad atrophy), and Sensory/Pain Disorders (foot vibratory sensation, Morton's Neuroma, plantar fasciitis, heel spur, local foot pain symptoms). During the Foot Examination, we also collected foot imprint data using a MatScan, a computer-driven foot pressure and imprint device (Tekscan, Boston, MA). This device provides timely measures of foot pressure concentrations, dynamic weight transfer and evaluation of foot function as a participant walks across a sensory mat. The data from this device provide information on foot disorders, such as valgus or varus foot and pes planus during static stance as well as a dynamic walk.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^eecb05f4]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Double (accessory) fifth toenail – Correct. This is considered an incomplete form of polydactyly. On examination, the nail has 2 parts, the medial being wider, with a longitudinal furrow or split. In the largest review to date of this condition, 2 completely distinct nail plates were rare, and findings were often symmetrical. A quarter of cases in this series were more prominent on one side, like our patient, with more subtle findings on the other foot (Fig 2). This is often asymptomatic but can be tender due to compression of the lateral nail fold.
B. Subungual exostosis – Incorrect. Subungual exostosis is a benign bony tumor arising from the distal phalanx and is more common in toenails than fingernails. This presents as a nodule of the distal nail bed with accompanying onycholysis, not a nail plate split. Radiographs are confirmatory.
C. Periungual fibroma – Incorrect. Also known as Koenen's tumors in the setting of tuberous sclerosis, this is a benign papule with hyperkeratotic tip commonly presenting at the proximal nail fold. This leads to longitudinal depression in the nail plate, and not a split nail.
D. Subungual verruca – Incorrect. Despite his history of warts, the fifth toenails did not demonstrate clinical or dermoscopic findings to support a viral etiology.
E. Onychophosis – Incorrect. Onychophosis refers to localized or diffuse hyperkeratosis at the lateral or proximal nail folds, in the space between the nail fold and nail plate, as a result of repeated minor trauma. This does not describe the nail plate abnormality.

### Knot technique: a new treatment of ingrown nails [^dd045ebe]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ingrown nails are a painful problem that affects all ages, particularly the young, and it may become chronic if not treated.

Objective

A new technique was used to treat patients with Stages 2 and 3 ingrown nails in whom conservative and surgical methods were attempted.

Materials and Methods

A total of 30 patients presenting with Stages 2 and 3 ingrown nails to the clinic between 2010 and 2012 were included. A wedge excision of the upper and lower soft tissues of the nail was performed. The wound margins were simply sutured with 2/0 polypropylene. Approximately 8 to 10 knots were tied without cutting the stitches under the nail. These knots were used to push the soft tissue down and to raise the nail. This was achieved by placing a knot under the nail after the needle had been passed inside the nail, without cutting the suture before another knot was tied above the nail. Therefore, the ingrown part of the nail was raised.

Results

Patients were followed up for 20 months (range, 10–24 months). Relapse was observed in only 1 patient. No infection was observed, and none of the patients required additional surgery.

Conclusion

Stages 2 and 3 ingrown nails can also be safely treated with this technique.

### Congenital malalignment of the great toenail and onychomadesis in monozygotic twins [^0f49b36e]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital malalignment of the great toenails (CMGTs) may result in onychocryptosis, a disappearing nail bed, paronychia, Beau lines, onychomadesis, retronychia, or erosion of the nail bed. Onychomadesis is a spontaneous arrest of the nail plate that leads to nail shedding and is a more severe manifestation of the same pathophysiologic process that produces Beau lines. Onychomadesis is commonly seen as a delayed onset effect of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Infectious diseases, trauma, autoimmune/systemic diseases, and medications may also injure the nail matrix, leading to onychomadesis. Rare cases of idiopathic forms of onychomadesis include familial autosomal dominant inheritance, as well as sporadic genetic mutation. This case illustrates the possible link between CMGT and onychomadesis.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^508b809f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Often described with its eponym Mees' lines, the bands may have other causes. To be more appropriate with the definition, the white lines should be defined in these cases as trauma-induced transverse true leukonychia. When only the fingernails are affected, manicure mistakes are the possible culprits (Fig. 5). When the toenails are affected, bands may result from pressure on the free edge of the nail plate not trimmed short (Fig. 6). Among traumatic etiologies, cryotherapy of warts on the proximal nail fold should also be mentioned but also direct occupational contact with aggressive substances such as concentrated chemicals. A single transversal band may be induced by one relevant trauma or skin diseases of the proximal nail fold. When both fingernails and toenails are affected, a systemic cause should be ruled out: a matrix-toxic substance such as thallium, strontium, and arsenic, for instance, but chemotherapeutic drugs are the therapeutic agents most frequently involved. No specific drug, combination of drugs, or drug class is responsible but cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are those most frequently involved. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies or systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus may provoke transverse true leukonychia (Fig. 7), hematologic disorders, neurovascular disorders, empyema, heart failure, severe hypocalcemia, and systemic infections, including COVID-19. Occasionally transverse bands are reported to be the result of climbing at high altitude (Everest nails) due to severe hypoxia and catabolic stress and to the combined use of drugs for the prevention and therapy of acute mountain sickness such as acetazolamide and naproxen.

### Nail plate split of the fifth toenail [^6a8e7a07]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the next best step in diagnosis?
A. Nail bed biopsy
B. Nail clipping for hematoxylin and eosin
C. Referral to genetics
D. Radiograph
E. Magnetic resonance imaging

Answers:
A. Nail bed biopsy – Incorrect. Well-developed accessory toenails, as seen in this patient, have no histologic abnormality of the nail matrix or bed. Excision shows all characteristics of a normal fifth toenail: proximal nail fold, matrix, and short nail bed.
B. Nail clipping for hematoxylin and eosin – Incorrect. Similar to answer choice A, there is no histologic abnormality of well-developed accessory toenails.
C. Referral to genetics – Incorrect. Double fifth toenail is thought to be autosomal dominant, but expression is variable. There have been reports that this is common in Han Chinese, but additional reports have shown a broad range of races and ethnicities with this presentation. Double fifth toenail diagnosis alone does not require a genetics evaluation.
D. Radiograph – Correct. In a previous series, 10 patients with clinical findings of a double fifth toenail underwent foot radiographs, with 30% demonstrating a Y-shaped distal phalanx. Other reports have not shown any abnormalities on foot radiographs, but 2 nail plates and 2 matrices were seen on ultrasound. The pathophysiology of the accessory nail is not well understood. There is question of whether the presence of bone in some patients induces nail formation or if the presence of nail epithelium causes underlying mesenchymal cells to generate bone. Our patient underwent radiographs of his feet which did not show any bone abnormalities. Radiographs prior to intervention also help evaluate for other possible diagnoses such as subungual exostosis.
E. Magnetic resonance imaging – Incorrect. Advanced imaging is not necessary for diagnosis or treatment planning.

### Onychoheterotopia: pathogenesis, presentation, and management of ectopic nail [^13020ce4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Onychoheterotopia is an extremely rare condition in which the nail tissue grows outside the classic nail unit of the dorsal fingers and toes. It presents as either small outgrowths of a deviant nail or a complete double fingernail malformation. The histology of the onychoheterotopia matrix is oftentimes very similar to the normal nail matrix, although it plays a central role in diagnosis.

Objective

We sought to review the current literature on the clinical and histologic aspects of onychoheterotopia.

Methods

A literature search was performed to evaluate peer-reviewed articles on the topic.

Results

Detailed reports have characterized many features of onychoheterotopia. The various etiology and treatment options are reviewed.

Limitations

The study was limited to those articles in the English-language literature.

Conclusions

In this article, we provide a review of the literature based on the current understanding of onychoheterotopia, its diagnosis, and its management.

### Crusted scabies triggering autonomic dysreflexia in a patient with spinal cord injury [^fe80f5d8]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Intermittent attacks of autonomic dysreflexia, or "sympathetic storm", are well reported in patients with spinal cord injury at or above T6 spinal levels because of a decentralized spinal cord with interruption of descending modulation of thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons above that level. Acutely, patients present with hypotension and bradycardia, but autonomic imbalance and dysregulation of splanchnic circulation lead to sympathetic overactivity, hypertension, and a baroreceptor-reflex-mediated bradycardia. Compensatory parasympathetic activity above the level of spinal injury could also cause secondary diaphoresis, rhinorrhea, and flushing. Patients can experience up to 40 attacks daily; thus, swift identification of triggers is vital because devastating cardiophysiologic effects and even fatal complications can occur. Autonomic dysreflexia is well established in response to a number of noxious visceral and somatic stimuli below the level of injury, including urinary tract infections, deep vein thrombosis, constrictive clothing, pregnancy, orchitis, hemorrhoids, and surgical interventions. Cutaneous triggers of autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients include skin infections, ulceration, and ingrown toenails. However, to our knowledge this is the first reported case in which scabies infestation has been implicated; this is supported by the resolution of the patient's rash, peripheral eosinophilia, photophobia, bowel and bladder dysregulation, and labile blood pressures, with successful treatment of the infestation.

### Increasing hospitalizations and general practice prescriptions for community-onset staphylococcal disease, england [^3b7b0993]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To verify that observed trends were not part of a generalized increase in hospital admissions, we used HES data to examine trends in the following control conditions: appendicitis, cholecystitis, conjunctivitis, fractured forearm, gastroenteritis/diarrhea of presumed infectious origin, ingrown toenail, and erysipelas. These conditions were chosen as examples of acute community-onset conditions that are not normally caused by staphylococci. We also examined trends in hospitalizations for septicemia in which staphylococci were not identified as the causative organism.

We analyzed data from the Prescription Prescribing Authority, which collects information on all prescriptions issued by general practitioners and dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing general practitioners (PACT data). The information collected includes the name of the drug and the number of items dispensed (an item is defined as each preparation on the prescription). The data cannot be linked routinely to patient demographic or clinical data. Hence, they cannot be used to calculate age- and sex-specific prescribing rates or to look at prescribing rates for specific conditions. We obtained data on all GP prescriptions of floxacillin (including co-fluampicil) and fusidic acid (excluding Fucidin eyedrops but including combined steroid and fucidic acid preparations) for England from 1991 through 2006. We focused on prescriptions of floxacillin and fusidic acid because staphylococcal infection is the only indication given for these conditions in the British National Formulary. We used national population data to calculate crude annual prescribing rates. Analyses used anonymous aggregate data and did not require ethical approval.

### Risk factors and frequency of ingrown nails in adult diabetic patients [^d7809acb]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The present study evaluated the properties of nails, frequency of ingrown nails in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), risk factors for developing ingrown nails, and effect of diabetic polyneuropathy and vasculopathy on the development and outcome of ingrown nails. Our 6-month epidemiologic prospective study included 300 patients with type 2 DM attending a DM outpatient clinic for routine examinations. The general characteristics and foot changes of the study population were investigated. Diabetic polyneuropathy and vasculopathy were evaluated using a biothesiometer, monofilament tests, and arterial Doppler ultrasonography. The frequency of ingrown nails was 13.6%. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression showed that body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007 to 1.15; p = .03), previous trauma (OR 2.828, 95% CI 1.017 to 7,867, p = .042), a weak dorsalis pedis pulse (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.30, p = .02), trimming type (OR 2.3, 95 CI 1.06 to 4.98), p = .35), onychogryphosis (OR 9.036, 95% CI 2.34 to 34.87, p = .001), and subungual hyperkeratosis (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.99 to 9.3, p = .001) were predictive variables for ingrown nails in our population. The incidence of onychomycosis was significantly greater in patients with ingrown nails (p = .032) than in patients without ingrown nails. The nail curvature ratio was greater in the patients with ingrown nails than in the group with normal nails. Arterial Doppler ultrasound examinations showed peripheral arterial disease in 19 patients (46.9%) with ingrown nails. The prevalence of ingrown nails was greater in the patients with DM than in the healthy population. Our results indicate that nail type, nail morphology, and diabetic vasculopathy affect the formation and evolution of ingrown nails.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^1188a877]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Brimonidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is widely used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topical application of brimonidine gel may reduce facial erythema by inducing cutaneous vasoconstriction of rosacea. Brimonidine, with the characteristics of rapid metabolism and systemic clearance, has no significant affects on the heart rate and blood pressure. However, some medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may influence brimonidine's metabolism.

The etiology of paronychia mainly includes an ingrown toenail, trauma, and infection. Surgery is an effective method to treat paronychia, but complications such as PG cannot be avoided, especially if postoperative infection occurs. PG is a disorder of benign vascular proliferation, with rapidly growing erythematous nodules developing into pedunculated tumors that may be subject to erosion and bleeding. The exact pathogenic mechanism is not fully clear and has been associated with trauma, infection, foreign body reactions, pregnancy, immunosuppression, several drugs, and delayed wound healing. The current available treatment options include topical or systemic pharmacotherapies, silver nitrate, surgical intervention, semi-invasive therapies, laser, and others. In terms of topical pharmacotherapies, beta blockers, such as timolol or propranolol, toll-like receptor 7 agonists, such as imiquimod, and other medicines are available. Overall, the relapse rate of PG is about 4.56%; surgical excision among the surgical management options is the most effective method, with a lower recurrence rate (2.94%) compared with nonsurgical treatments (3.67%), including cryotherapy, laser, liquid nitrogen refrigeration, and topical pharmacotherapies.

### Retinopathy, neuropathy, and foot care: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d6d7b9c6]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Education and initial foot care recommendations in diabetes — All people with diabetes (and their caregivers), particularly those with the aforementioned high-risk conditions, should receive general foot care education, including appropriate management strategies, and this education should be provided to all newly diagnosed people with diabetes as part of an annual comprehensive examination and to individuals with high-risk conditions at every visit; evidence also suggests that knowledge is quickly forgotten and needs to be reinforced regularly. The selection of appropriate footwear and footwear behaviors at home should also be discussed (e.g., no walking barefoot, avoiding open-toed shoes). Therapeutic footwear with custom-made orthotic devices have been shown to reduce peak plantar pressures, but a systematic review showed there was no significant reduction in ulcer incidence after 18 months compared with standard insoles and extra-depth shoes, and evidence to prevent first ulcerations was nonexistent. Initial treatment recommendations should include daily foot inspection, use moisturizers for dry, scaly skin, and avoidance of self-care of ingrown nails and calluses; well-fitted athletic or walking shoes with customized pressure-relieving orthoses should be part of initial recommendations for people with increased plantar pressures; individuals with deformities such as bunions or hammertoes may require specialized footwear such as extra-depth shoes, those with Charcot joint disease may require custom-made footwear, and individuals with any ulceration or unexplained swelling, erythema, or increased skin temperature should be referred urgently to a foot care specialist or interprofessional team.

### Is slow nail growth a risk factor for onychomycosis? [^008ea755]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was carried out to determine whether slow nail growth is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis or if onychomycosis results in slow nail growth. Forty-nine patients with unilateral onychomycosis of the great toenail were enrolled and classified in two groups according to the size of affected area, i.e. more than half or less than half of the toenail. The growth rates of affected and unaffected great toenails of all patients were measured. Before a normal appearance was reached, the growth rates of affected great toenails, when the affected area occupied more than half of total nail plate, was slower than that of the unaffected great toenails. After a normal appearance was achieved, there were no differences in growth rates between affected and unaffected great toenails. Therefore, this study of patients with unilateral toenail onychomycosis did not support the hypothesis that slow nail growth rate is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis.

### Treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenail associated with granulation tissue by partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse carbon dioxide laser [^957cde6e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with carbon dioxide (CO2) laser for the treatment of ingrown great toenails remains unclear.

Objective

This study sought to determine the effectiveness of partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser in the treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenails associated with granulation tissue.

Materials and Methods

Fourteen patients with a total of 18 recurrent ingrown great toenails were randomly selected for participation in this study. Partial nail avulsions followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser were performed on the involved nails. After at least 6 months, we evaluated the recurrence of ingrown toenails, regrowth of the nail spike, duration of post-treatment pain and post-treatment infection.

Results

Partial nail avulsion followed by matricectomy with sharpulse CO2 laser in the treatment of ingrown toenails resulted in a high cure rate, short postoperative pain duration and low risk of postoperative infection.

Conclusion

This method we advocate is convenient and effective for the treatment of recurrent ingrown great toenail associated with granulation tissue.

### Predicting the risk of future diabetic foot ulcer occurrence: a prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes in tanzania [^fd96206f]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Foot deformity was assessed as structural abnormalities in the foot such as claw/hammer toe and hallux valgus or prominent MTHs, status after Charcot foot, amputations and other foot surgery were considered as having foot deformity. Skin status was considered as: dry when epidermis lacks moisture or sebum, and normal: well-balanced skin eudermic that is neither too oily nor too dry. Dry skin is very common in patients with diabetes where the skin lacks adequate moisture. On visual examination dry skin looks rough, shows signs of itching, have flaking, scaling or peeling. Fine lines and crack can be seen on the skin, which leads to deep cracks that may bleed and ulcers. In addition, the skin becomes gray and ashy. Mycosis was considered as fungal infection in between the toes and macerated skin.

Nail ingrowth was considered as in-growing toe nail (also known as onychocryptosis) and it was considered as present when the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the paronychium or nail bed. Swelling was considered as present when swelling of foot sufficiently pronounced to leave a clear imprint of the pressure by a finger. Presence of callus was also considered to be present based on the protocol proposed in IWGDF guidelines. Specific categorical parameters for each participant were defined as if these occurred on either or both feet for each participant.

### Genetic hair and nail disorders [^429a61a7]. Clinics in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hair and nails are skin appendages that share with other ectodermal tissues a common developmental pathway. Inherited disorders affecting these two structures therefore very often involve other epithelial components and present with multiple anomalies, generating both physical and psychological distress among patients and their families. The present review briefly describes major recent advances in our understanding of hair and nail genodermatoses.

### Intrauterine big toenail imprints: a new cause of congenital skin dimples [^6f81a1b7]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Congenital skin dimples (SD) are small cutaneous depressions that can be noted on any part of the body and may be caused by traumatic, mechanical, metabolic, and genetic factors as well as by exposure to infections or drugs. We describe 3 cases of unrelated healthy newborns displaying SD and discuss as a possible explanation the persistent friction of the big toenail onto the immature skin of the fetus during intrauterine life causing as depression in the skin.

### Predicting the risk of future diabetic foot ulcer occurrence: a prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes in tanzania [^82c8b8dd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

Participants who were vulnerable to future diabetic foot ulceration occurrence showed distinct characteristics in few foot-related parameters including higher VPT and lower sensitivity to touch, and lower sensitivity and higher tolerance to both warm and cold stimuli. The results of the current study indicate the need to assess small fiber neuropathy as a major risk factor for DFU occurrence in patients. The current study also highlighted that, the presence of nail ingrowth and dry skin each increase the likelihood of future DFU by more than four times.

In addition to the common measures of neuropathy associated with large fiber (ie, VPT and monofilament), measurements related to small fiber impairment (ie, TST and TTT; and touch sensation test) need to be included in the risk assessment for DFU occurrence.

### An irregular black patch on the nail plate [^51b144e2]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

History

A 57-year-old woman presented with a progressively enlarging irregular black patch of 1-year duration on the left fourth toenail (Fig 1). The patient denied new medications, history of trauma, or previous nail dyspigmentation. Proximal and lateral nail folds were not involved and pigmentation of the hyponychium was not evident. The patch could not be removed with scratching of the nail plate. Dermoscopy revealed nonlongitudinal, black to brown, reticular pigmentation with overlying white scale and distal onycholysis (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Nevus of the nail matrix
B. Fungal melanonychia
C. Subungual melanoma
D. Trauma-related nail plate hemorrhage
E. Exogenous pigment
