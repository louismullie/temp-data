## Question

Is a botulinum injection a permanent remedy for ET?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether botulinum toxin injections provide a permanent remedy for essential tremor or if the effect is temporary and requires repeat treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism and time course of botulinum toxin's effect. Then, I should review disease-specific guidelines on botulinum toxin use in essential tremor. Next, I will examine real-world treatment patterns and randomized trial designs to see if re-injection is standard. After that, I will compare with more durable surgical options to contextualize "permanence". Finally, I'll synthesize a clear bottom line for clinical counseling, cross-checking each claim against high-quality guideline and trial sources [^116SGyAh] [^115RrDzq] [^111zDqq3].

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology and expected duration of action, because if the mechanism is transient neuromuscular blockade, permanence would be implausible by design; botulinum toxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, producing a reversible chemodenervation with paresis starting in 2–5 days, peaking around 5–6 weeks, and wearing off in roughly 2–3 months, after which neuromuscular transmission gradually recovers and symptoms recur, so by mechanism and clinical kinetics it is inherently time-limited, not permanent [^116SGyAh] [^114V8zyb].

> I should confirm how guidelines frame botulinum toxin in essential tremor specifically; the AAN 2005 practice parameter states botulinum toxin A may be considered for limb, head, or voice essential tremor refractory to medications, which signals a role but not a cure, while the IPMDS 2019 evidence-based review classifies botulinum toxin A as likely efficacious for upper limb ET and emphasizes the need for specialized monitoring, again implying ongoing management rather than permanent resolution, and neither guideline describes sustained remission after a single injection series [^115RrDzq] [^111zDqq3].

> Wait, let me verify the real-world cadence of treatment to see if re-injection is customary; across movement disorders treated with botulinum toxin, reinjection commonly occurs every 12–16 weeks, and in large observational cohorts of cervical dystonia most patients are indeed reinjected on that schedule, with many reporting waning benefit before 12 weeks, which mirrors the pharmacologic time course and points to non-permanence, and practical guidance papers also note substantial variability with many patients preferring intervals shorter than 12 weeks, reinforcing the expectation of repeat dosing to sustain effect [^113uwGrB] [^11594S5v].

> Hold on, I should verify this in essential tremor trials themselves; in the randomized NEJM trial for essential or isolated head tremor, patients received injections at baseline and again at week 12, and the primary outcome was assessed 6 weeks after the second injection, a design that explicitly presumes waning of effect and the need for reinjection, and earlier hand tremor trials show transient improvements over weeks with dose-limiting weakness rather than durable remission, which collectively argues against permanence and for cyclical therapy to balance benefit and adverse effects [^117PoRWs] [^115nFJy6].

> Next, I should review voice tremor and laryngeal use patterns to check consistency; neurolaryngology cohorts treating laryngeal dystonia and essential tremor of the vocal tract describe botulinum toxin as safe and effective but not curative, requiring periodic injections, and a notable proportion of patients benefit from intervals shorter than 90 days, which is consistent with the 2–3 month pharmacologic window and again incompatible with permanence [^111gBjJE].

> But wait, what if the question is really about "more permanent" options for severe, medication-refractory limb tremor; I need to contrast with surgical therapies; for upper limb ET, thalamic deep brain stimulation is guideline-supported for refractory cases and provides long-term benefit with adjustability, and MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy has durable multi-year outcomes in carefully selected patients, though both are invasive and head/voice tremor responses differ with less robust evidence, meaning that "durable" options exist but they are distinct from the temporary chemodenervation produced by botulinum toxin [^116peR97] [^113dnsQZ] [^114rZktz] [^112eTgbU].

> I should also consider long-term immunogenicity as another reason effects may wane rather than become permanent; systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that with repeated exposure some patients develop neutralizing antibodies or secondary treatment failure depending on dose, indication, and product, prompting strategies to minimize immunogenicity over chronic use, which underscores that botulinum toxin is an ongoing therapy with potential loss of response over time rather than a one-time cure [^116szzd4] [^1136ePSz].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the bottom line; based on the reversible mechanism, the well-characterized 2–3 month duration of effect, guideline positions that frame botulinum toxin as an option requiring monitoring rather than a disease-curative intervention, and trial and real-world patterns that build reinjection into standard care, botulinum toxin injections are not permanent for essential tremor; they provide temporary symptom suppression and typically require repeat dosing approximately every 3 months to maintain benefit, with the exact interval individualized by response and adverse effects [^116SGyAh] [^111zDqq3] [^117PoRWs] [^113uwGrB].

---

No, botulinum toxin injections are **not a permanent remedy** for essential tremor (ET). They provide **temporary symptom relief** for approximately 2–3 months, necessitating repeat injections [^115RrDzq] [^116SGyAh]. ET is a chronic, progressive disorder; botulinum toxin does not alter its course or produce lasting remission. For durable control, consider **deep brain stimulation** or **focused ultrasound thalamotomy** in refractory cases [^1141VQGJ] [^114xGS6R].

---

## Mechanism of action and duration of effect

Botulinum toxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, causing temporary chemodenervation and reduced muscle activity [^114V8zyb]. This effect is **reversible**, with neuromuscular transmission typically recovering within 2–3 months as new synaptic connections form [^116SGyAh]. Thus, symptom relief is transient, necessitating ongoing injections.

---

## Clinical evidence on efficacy and duration

Clinical trials show botulinum toxin can reduce tremor severity, but effects are **temporary**:

- **Hand tremor**: Significant reduction in postural tremor for 4–16 weeks; kinetic tremor improved only at 6 weeks; functional gains were inconsistent [^115nFJy6].
- **Head tremor**: About 31% had meaningful improvement at 18 weeks, but effects waned and required reinjection [^117PoRWs].
- **Voice tremor**: Improvement lasts 2–3 months, necessitating repeat injections [^111gBjJE].

These data confirm a **temporary benefit**, requiring routine reinjection to maintain control.

---

## Long-term outcomes and need for repeated injections

Long-term management with botulinum toxin involves **regular reinjection** every 2–3 months to sustain benefit [^116SGyAh]. Over time, patients may require dose adjustments or experience reduced efficacy, sometimes due to neutralizing antibodies [^1136ePSz]. Sustained benefit depends on ongoing treatment, not a one-time cure.

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Botulinum toxin is generally safe, but **dose-dependent weakness** is common, especially in hand tremor [^115nFJy6]. Other risks include:

- **Local effects**: Injection-site pain, bruising, unintended muscle weakness.
- **Systemic effects**: Rare spread causing generalized weakness, dysphagia, or respiratory issues [^112hi3NB].
- **Immunogenicity**: Neutralizing antibodies can reduce efficacy over time [^1136ePSz].

These risks underscore the need for **careful dosing and monitoring**.

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Botulinum toxin is best for **focal tremors** or when oral drugs are ineffective or poorly tolerated. For **durable control**, consider **deep brain stimulation (DBS)**, which provides sustained tremor reduction with adjustable therapy [^1141VQGJ], and **MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy**, likely efficacious with acceptable risk for upper limb ET [^114xGS6R]. These options offer **longer-lasting control** than botulinum toxin.

---

## Patient selection criteria

Botulinum toxin is **appropriate** for patients with:

- **Focal tremors**: Hand, head, or voice tremors refractory to medication [^111zDqq3].
- **Medication intolerance**: Poor response or side effects from oral agents.
- **Preference**: Desire to avoid or delay surgery.

Careful selection and **individualized dosing** optimize outcomes.

---

## Conclusion

Botulinum toxin injections are **not a permanent remedy** for essential tremor; they provide **temporary relief lasting 2–3 months** and require ongoing treatment. ET remains chronic and progressive, so consider DBS or focused ultrasound for **longer-lasting control** in refractory cases.

### Time to onset and duration of botulinum toxin efficacy in movement disorders [^116SGyAh]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is one of the most potent biological toxins and has emerged as a valuable and versatile therapeutic agent for many neurological applications. BoNT acts by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal at the neuromuscular junction, leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release and, therefore, temporary weakness of the target muscle. Paresis is typically expected to occur 2–5 days after injections, reaches its peak at 5–6 weeks, and lasts for 2–3 months.

There are three main BoNT type A preparations used in Europe in clinical practice: onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A), abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A), and incobotulinumtoxinA (incoBoNT-A). These three formulations are considered to have similar efficacy and safety profiles, but different excipients and diluents are used for each preparation of the commercial vial, so the potency of the units of the three formulations does not have a comparable effect in clinical practice. Generally, it is estimated that 1 U of onaBoNT-A corresponds to 1 U of incoBoNT-A and 3–5 U of aboBoNT-A.

Time to onset and duration of efficacy of BoNT may vary widely among patients. Differences may be related to genetics, target muscles (mass, size, thickness, depth below the skin), units injected, and technique of injection; however, data are missing regarding the influence that clinical-demographic data, type of BoNT, indication for which BoNT is used, and doses utilized may have. Also, only a few data are available on the time to onset of BoNT effect, since the vast majority of studies focus on duration rather than onset.

### How satisfied are cervical dystonia patients after 3 years of botulinum toxin type A treatment? Results from a prospective, long-term observational study [^111pPH2m]. Journal of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Primary cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common type of adult focal dystonia and is primarily characterized by involuntary twisting or turning of the neck, causing an abnormal head position. Disability with functional impairment, pain, and embarrassment with social withdrawal are often prominent features of CD, and numerous studies highlight the negative impact of CD symptoms on everyday functioning and quality of life.

Over the past 3 decades, local chemodenervation with botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) has become the first-line and mainstay of therapy for people living with CD. Although the evidence levels differ across BoNT serotypes and brands, abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A), incobotulinumtoxinA (incoBoNT-A), onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT-A), and rimabotulinumtoxinB (rimaBoNT-B) each have regulatory approval for CD across several countries and are commonly used.

In the pre-BoNT-A era, natural history studies reported an initial worsening of symptoms over the first years before a period of symptom stabilization. As a rule, primary CD is not associated with spread to other body parts, although a proportion of patients will also have postural limb tremor and/or another focal dystonia. Remission from CD symptoms is rare, and most patients repeatedly return for BoNT-A re-injection to maintain control of their symptoms. Since the average age of diagnosis is around 40 years old, patients usually need treatment over decades. Surveys of CD patients have found that the most common reason for stopping BoNT-A treatment is a perceived lack of efficacy, even when the treatment is administered regularly.

### Some unresolved issues with botulinum toxin [^115tfSeQ]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Issues concerning botulinum toxin still need resolution in the laboratory and clinic. Assay nomenclature is unsatisfactory, and attempts to establish common units and/or equivalents are misguided and dangerous. Optimum toxin concentrations for most indications are unknown. Loss of response is too readily ascribed to antibody formation. New therapeutic indications for the toxin raise the possibility of additional mechanisms of action.

### Botulinum toxin treatment of objective tinnitus because of essential palatal tremor: A systematic review [^116kZDc9]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

In contrast to subjective tinnitus, objective tinnitus can be heard by both the examiner and the patient. It can be triggered by various etiologies, including idiopathic muscular tremor in the soft palate, known as essential palatal tremor (EPT). Among the investigated treatment modalities, only Botulinum toxin (BT) injections have shown promising results.

- **Goal**: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BT treatment on objective tinnitus due to EPT through a systematic review of the literature.

- **Methods**: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted in three databases.

- **Results**: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, predominantly case reports and case series. In the literature, 51 BT-treated patients diagnosed with EPT were identified. The studies were assessed with a focus on diagnostics, injection technique and BT dose, follow-up, effect on objective tinnitus, complications, and adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: The included studies exhibit an extremely low evidence level with several sources of bias. When optimally injected, BT appears to be an effective treatment for objective tinnitus due to EPT, with few adverse effects and complications. We suggest BT injections as the first choice for EPT and present a guideline regarding diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up.

### Essential tremor-plus: a controversial new concept [^116gX3w4]. The Lancet Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to redefining essential tremor (ET), the 2018 consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society on tremor coined a new term: essential tremor-plus (ET-plus). This term is uncertainly defined as tremor with the characteristics of ET, with additional neurological signs of uncertain clinical significance. If ET-plus had been defined on the basis of a difference in underlying pathology or an appreciable difference in prognosis, it would have a valid, scientific rationale, as does the term Parkinson-plus. However, there is no such evidence, so the basis for the term is questionable. In fact, ET-plus might only represent a state condition (i.e. patients with ET might develop these additional clinical features when the disease is at a more advanced stage). We caution against coining new terms that are not supported by a firm scientific basis and encourage research into the creation of essential tremor subsets that are defined with respect to differences in underlying causes or pathophysiology.

### Botulinum toxin for the treatment of tremor [^112oh4Nq]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). High credibility.

Tremor is one of the common movement disorders worldwide. In the recent classification, tremor has been classified into two axes (I and II). Based on axis I, tremor can be classified as isolated and combined tremor syndrome. Common tremor syndromes include Parkinsonism-associated tremors, essential tremor including essential tremor plus, dystonic tremors, and others. Tremor may also occur secondary to demyelinating, infectious, inflammatory diseases, and stroke.

Adequate management of tremor has been an unmet need in clinical practice. Most of the anti-tremor medications have limited efficacy and are associated with undesirable adverse effects, especially in elderly patients. Several studies have reported good outcomes with the use of botulinum neurotoxin for the treatment of tremor, and it has emerged as a useful therapeutic option in tremor syndromes refractory to pharmacological agents. This review describes the role of botulinum neurotoxin in different tremor conditions. This article is part of the Special Issue "Tremor" edited by Daniel D. Truong, Mark Hallett, and Aasef Shaikh.

### Essential pitfalls in "essential" tremor [^116Cu73d]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although essential tremor has been considered the most common movement disorder, it has largely remained a diagnosis of exclusion; many tremor and non-tremor features must be absent for the clinical diagnosis to stand. The clinical features of "essential tremor" overlap with or may be part of other tremor disorders, and not surprisingly, this prevalent familial disorder has remained without a gene identified, without a consistent natural history, and without an acceptable pathology or pathophysiologic underpinning. The collective evidence suggests that under the rubric of essential tremor there exist multiple unique diseases, some of which represent cerebellar dysfunction, but for which there is no intrinsic "essence" other than a common oscillatory behavior on posture and action.

One approach may be to use the term essential tremor only as a transitional node in the deep phenotyping of tremor disorders based on historical, phenomenological, and neurophysiological features to facilitate its etiologic diagnosis or serve for future gene- and biomarker-discovery efforts. This approach deemphasizes essential tremor as a diagnostic entity and facilitates the understanding of the underlying disorders to develop biologically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### Botulinum toxin type A and other botulinum toxin serotypes: a comparative review of biochemical and pharmacological actions [^116jiS7b]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin type A is an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of movement and other disorders. As the clinical uses of botulinum toxin type A expand, it is increasingly important to understand the biochemical and pharmacological actions of this toxin, as well as those of other botulinum toxin serotypes (B-G). Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes exhibit differences in neurotoxin complex protein size, the percentage of neurotoxin in the activated or nicked form, intracellular protein target, and potency. These properties differ even between preparations that contain the same botulinum toxin serotype due to variations in product formulations. As demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies, these differences result in a unique combination of efficacy, duration of action, safety, and antigenic potential for each botulinum neurotoxin preparation.

### Botox [^1143Kf3Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The recommended dose for Botox treatment is 200 Units, and this dosage should not be exceeded.

- **200 Unit vial of Botox**: Reconstitute a 200 Unit vial of Botox with 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, and mix the vial gently. Draw 2 mL from the vial into each of three 10 mL syringes. Complete the reconstitution by adding 8 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, into each of the 10 mL syringes and mix gently. This process will result in three 10 mL syringes each containing 10 mL (approximately 67 Units in each), totaling 200 Units of reconstituted Botox. Use immediately after reconstitution in the syringe and dispose of any unused saline.

- **100 Unit vial of Botox**: Reconstitute two 100 Unit vials of Botox, each with 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, and mix the vials gently. Draw 4 mL from each vial into each of two 10 mL syringes. Draw the remaining 2 mL from each vial into a third 10 mL syringe, resulting in 4 mL in each syringe. Complete the reconstitution by adding 6 mL of preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, into each of the 10 mL syringes and mix gently. This process will result in three 10 mL syringes each containing 10 mL (approximately 67 Units in each), totaling 200 Units of reconstituted Botox. Use immediately after reconstitution in the syringe and dispose of any unused saline.

### Case of essential palatal tremor: Atypical features and remarkable benefit from botulinum toxin injection [^112LBJ58]. Movement Disorders (2001). Low credibility.

We describe a 21-year-old man with essential palatal tremor. The patient had rhythmic contractions not only of the tensor veli palatini but also of facial, lingual, temporalis, pharyngeal, and neck muscles. He had some voluntary control of the palatal tremor and ear clicks. He was treated with 5 units of botulinum toxin-A (BOTOX) injected into each tensor veli palatini, resulting in a complete resolution of all the symptoms.

### Botulinum neurotoxin treatment in jerky and tremulous functional movement disorders: A double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension [^114pH1je]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The limitations of this study include the small study population and the large number of eligible patients screened to reach the required patient count. Additionally, the analysis of a patient after 1 year instead of the protocol-specified 4 months constituted a major protocol violation.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^111cTaSZ]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Some patients, especially children and adolescents, may require long-term treatment with BoNT-A. An emerging body of evidence and guidelines emphasizes the importance of approaching BoNT-A treatment of chronic conditions with protocols to minimize the immune response and maximize patient responsiveness. Immunogenicity should therefore be a key factor in the choice of BoNT-A therapy; where efficacy and safety are comparable, a BoNT-A formulation that is potentially less likely to cause immunogenicity should be considered as a first-line therapy. Thus, initiating treatment with a BoNT-A formulation with lower potential immunogenicity may reduce the risk of NAb production and future treatment failure, especially if higher doses of BoNT-A are applied.

The choice of BoNT-A formulation is especially important since sensitive, affordable, standardized tests are not currently available to allow routine monitoring of NAbs during BoNT-A treatment. There is a need for better, affordable, and standardized NAb testing to allow routine monitoring of NAb levels during BoNT-A treatment, to better monitor patients, and to help identify reasons for partial or full non-response to BoNT therapy.

### Review of botulinum toxin uptake and novel theory regarding potential spread days after injection [^115SWaXT]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Although most clinicians agree that diffusion of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) occurs, its extent, timeline, and clinical importance have been debated. A literature search on PubMed (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) was conducted up to January 15, 2023, using the search terms: botulinum toxin A uptake, botulinum toxin A diffusion, and botulinum spread. A total of 421 publication titles were found and analyzed. Based on titles, the author selected 54 publications as potentially applicable and reviewed each one in depth, along with its supporting references.

There are several publications that support a novel theory that small amounts of BoNT can remain in the area days after injection and spread to adjacent muscles. Although the prevailing thinking is that BoNT is completely taken up within hours, making its spread days after injection seem implausible, the following literature review and case report support a novel theory.

### DystoniaBoTXNet: Novel neural network biomarker of botulinum toxin efficacy in isolated dystonia [^117LQwPL]. Annals of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Isolated dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, with an estimated incidence of up to 35.1 per 100,000 in the general population. Dystonia is a chronic disorder that causes abnormal, often painful, postures and repetitive movements due to sustained or intermittent involuntary muscle contractions. Chronically impaired motor control has a debilitating impact on a patient's quality of life and, in the majority of cases, leads to long-term occupational disability, continuous psychological stress, social isolation, psychiatric comorbidities, and increased suicidal risk. Based on symptom distribution, the most common form is adult-onset focal dystonia, followed by segmental dystonia, and much rarer childhood- or adolescent-onset generalized dystonia. The pathophysiology of dystonia involves complex disorganization of functional and structural neural networks; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear, limiting the range of available therapies for these patients.

Currently, botulinum toxin (BoTX) injections into the affected muscles are considered the first line of therapy. Yet, only 61% of patients are treated. The highest use of BoTX is reported in laryngeal dystonia and blepharospasm, which, however, constitutes only 49% of these patients. About 40% of treated patients do not receive any benefits. The poor clinical response of dystonic symptoms to BoTX injections is commonly a result of inadequate dosing, improper injecting technique, or imperfect choice of muscle location for injection (pseudo nonresponse).

### Comparison of neuromuscular blockade and recovery with botulinum toxins A and F [^116TqFgS]. Muscle & Nerve (2002). Low credibility.

Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin A is used to treat focal dystonias. Because immunoresistance has been documented in some patients, other molecular forms of the toxin have been evaluated clinically. The present investigation compared the time course and extent of neuromuscular blockade and recovery of botulinum toxin types A and F using an electromyographic monitoring system implanted in the rat hindlimb.

For a given dose, the degree and duration of blockade were more complete with type A toxin. Delayed onset of recovery in animals that received high doses of type A toxin allowed time for denervative changes to prevent a full return to baseline, as confirmed histologically. Conversely, animals receiving type F toxin fully recovered within 30 days at all dose levels. The rapid recovery with type F toxin suggested that neuromuscular transmission was restored via the original terminals rather than through functional collateral sprouting. The reversible nature of blockade with this molecular species puts in question its future clinical utility.

### Practice parameter: Therapies for essential tremor [RETIRED]: Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116CrpPF]. Neurology (2005). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for essential tremor, specifically concerning agents with no evidence for benefit, the AAN 2005 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the use of amantadine, clonidine, gabapentin (as adjunct therapy), glutethimide, L-tryptophan/pyridoxine, metoprolol, nicardipine, olanzapine, phenobarbital, quetiapine, or theophylline for the treatment of limb essential tremor.

### Neurotoxins: Evidence for prevention [^114iqJy8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Onabotulinum toxin A is the gold standard treatment for temporary dynamic rhytid reduction. Clinicians have observed long-term and preventive benefits for patients beyond muscle relaxation, particularly in those receiving repeated treatments over time. These benefits include progressive reduction of rhytides, prevention of dynamic rhytides, and improvements in skin quality. In this brief paper, we review basic science, clinical, and anecdotal evidence that explores the long-term and potential preventive effects of Onabotulinum toxin A injections.

### Assessment of patients receiving short-interval botulinum toxin chemodenervation treatment for laryngeal dystonia and essential tremor of the vocal tract [^111gBjJE]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The gold-standard treatment for laryngeal dystonia (LD) and essential tremor of the vocal tract (ETVT) is botulinum toxin (BoNT) chemodenervation. Although this treatment is safe and effective, it is not curative, requiring periodic injections. Notably, some medical insurance companies only cover injections at three-month intervals, though some patients benefit from more frequent injections.

- **Objective**: To determine the proportion and characteristics of patients who receive BoNT chemodenervation treatment at intervals shorter than 90 days.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This retrospective cohort study was conducted across three quaternary care neurolaryngology specialty practices in Washington and California. It included patients who underwent at least four consecutive laryngeal BoNT injections for LD and/or ETVT in the past five years. Data collection occurred from March through June 2022, and analysis was conducted from June through December 2022.

- **Exposure**: Laryngeal BoNT treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Biodemographic and clinical variables, injection characteristics, evolution during the three inter-injection intervals, and lifetime laryngeal BoNT treatment data were collected from patient medical records. Logistic regression assessed the association with the short-interval outcome, defined as an average injection interval shorter than 90 days.

- **Results**: Of the 255 patients included from the three institutions, 189 (74.1%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 62.7 (14.3) years. The predominant diagnosis was adductor LD (n = 199 [78.0%]), followed by adductor dystonic voice tremor (n = 26 [10.2%]) and ETVT (n = 13 [5.1%]).

### How are we doing with the treatment of essential tremor (ET)? Persistence of patients with ET on medication: Data from 528 patients in three settings [^111F4Jf3]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of essential tremor (ET) is not optimal. Only two first-line medications are available, and troublesome side effects are common. It is not uncommon for patients to simply stop taking medication, yet no published data substantiate or quantify this anecdotal impression.

- **Objectives**: To determine, among patients with ET who were prescribed medication for tremor, what proportion are still taking medication and what proportion have stopped.

- **Methods**: Five hundred and twenty-eight patients with ET from three distinct study settings (clinical, brain donors, population) were interviewed.

- **Results**: A clear pattern emerged across settings that the proportion of patients with ET who had stopped medication was sizable and consistently similar (nearly one-third): 31.4% (clinical), 24.3% (brain donors), 30.0% (population), 29.8% (overall). A similarly high proportion of cases with severe tremor had stopped their medication: 31.9% (clinical) and 36.4% (brain donors). For the four most commonly used medications (propranolol, primidone, diazepam, topiramate), one-half or more of the treated patients had stopped the medication; among the less commonly used medications, the proportion who stopped was even higher.

- **Conclusions**: Nearly one of every three patients with ET who had been prescribed medication for tremor had discontinued pharmacotherapy. A similar proportion of cases with severe tremor also stopped medication. These data make it tangibly evident that there is a sizable population of patients with ET who are untreated.

### Effective long-term treatment with incobotulinumtoxin (Xeomin®) without neutralizing antibody induction: a monocentric, cross-sectional study [^116GSkhC]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To demonstrate the differences in antigenicity between BoNT/A preparations, careful long-term studies are warranted with comparable doses per session, inter-injection intervals, and duration of treatment since these three factors mainly influence NAB formation. Furthermore, precise estimations of the incidence and prevalence of NAB formation must be determined for each BoNT/A formulation. This study aims to determine the incidence and prevalence of NAB formation under incoBoNT/A long-term treatment and the confounding effect of preceding injections with a complex protein-containing preparation (abo- or onaBoNT/A). Long-term efficacy is also controlled to demonstrate that the clinical response matches the findings on the antigenicity of incoBoNT/A.

### Essential palatal tremor treated with botulinum toxin [^116xqmgV]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Palatal tremor is a rare movement disorder characterized by rhythmic movement of the soft palate. There are two subtypes: essential and symptomatic palatal tremor. Essential palatal tremor is characterized by tinnitus and an absence of other neurological deficits. Different treatment options have been used to treat palatal tremor, with varying success rates. Here, we describe a patient with essential palatal tremor who was treated with botulinum toxin injections.

### Outcomes from stereotactic surgery for essential tremor [^116czwdk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

When discussing the surgical options for patients with essential tremor (ET), it is important to present the merits and drawbacks of the surgical modalities that the patient is a suitable candidate to receive. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been safely used for decades and is considered by many surgeons and neurologists as the treatment of choice for most patients with medically refractory or severe ET. Radiofrequency (RF) thalamotomy has also been used for decades and has proven effective in controlling tremor. However, RF thalamotomy is associated with a higher complication rate than DBS.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) thalamotomy, performed for several decades by various groups, has been criticized due to the absence of intraprocedural target confirmation and delayed treatment effects. Focused ultrasound (FUS) thalamotomy, the newest modality for tremor treatment, has gained attention for its transcranial capabilities, immediate effects, and potential for procedural target refinement. However, FUS thalamotomy studies have faced criticism for incidents of tremor recurrence, paraesthesia, and gait disturbance. These factors should be carefully considered by both neurosurgeons and patients when selecting an appropriate treatment for ET.

### Is essential tremor a single entity [^1126S6r3]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is a frequent movement disorder. The new tremor classification subdivides ET into the classic form, characterized by bilateral action tremor of the hands with or without the involvement of further tremor locations and without any other explaining signs or symptoms for the tremor, and into 'ET plus', which includes further neurological signs of unknown origin. This classification provides a better foundation for subclassifying the condition.

The immediate cause of ET is a preformed oscillating network within the central nervous system, as revealed by electrophysiological methods. The reason why this network enters the tremor mode remains unclear. Pathology has not convincingly demonstrated neurodegeneration for the condition, but adaptive changes in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, are likely. Genetics have not yet provided insight into the molecular causes of the condition, but several genetic diseases presenting with an ET syndrome have been uncovered.

Treatment options include medications such as propranolol, primidone, and topiramate, as well as surgical interventions with deep brain stimulation, gamma-knife surgery, and the recently introduced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided focused ultrasound lesioning. Further progress is anticipated from the better integration of large prospective cohort assessments and basic science studies on possible etiologies. In particular, aging-related tremor may explain a large number of the patients seen in clinical practice. Currently, ET is considered a clinically relatively uniform condition with presumably various underlying mechanisms.

### Outcomes from stereotactic surgery for essential tremor [^114i5r5a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

During the natural history of essential tremor (ET), many patients may experience asymmetric symptoms, with tremor more severely affecting or disabling one upper extremity. In these circumstances, patients may elect to undergo unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery or a thalamotomy procedure to treat the affected upper extremity. Tremor in the contralateral side often progresses and may warrant additional surgical treatment. In these circumstances, DBS is the best option since several studies have reported unacceptably high rates of neurological deficits in speech, swallowing, and cognition following bilateral thalamic lesioning procedures.

- **Surgical treatment recommendations for essential tremor**: For patients with predominant unilateral tremor symptoms, contralateral DBS or thalamotomy with radiofrequency (RF), focused ultrasound (FUS), or gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) are all surgical options. For eligible patients with bilateral tremor symptoms who wish to have both upper extremities treated, bilateral DBS can be performed safely. Bilateral thalamic DBS can be offered in a single operation, in a staged fashion, or in a delayed staged fashion (months or years after initial surgery). For patients who received unilateral DBS and whose contralateral symptoms progress or become disabling, staged contralateral DBS is an option. Among patients who received unilateral DBS but who do not want to undergo secondary DBS surgery, RF or GKRS thalamotomy procedures can be performed. For patients who have had infections or do not want additional implanted devices, RF thalamotomy is a good option.

### Practical guidance for CD management involving treatment of botulinum toxin: a consensus statement [^11594S5v]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Increasingly, patients and physicians find that an injection schedule with fixed intervals of 12 weeks may not be appropriate for all patients. Thus, the variability in the duration of response to BoNT was studied in 404 patients across 38 centers. Only 49.3% of patients rated the duration of response as ≥ 12 weeks for all BoNT-A preparations. A further study assessed treatment duration (TD) — the time between injection and patient-reported waning of effect — in 59 patients and showed that the mean TD per patient was 7.8 ± 1.4 to 21.0 ± 3.9 weeks. A patient satisfaction survey conducted in patients treated with BoNT-A/Ona or BoNT-A/Abo also showed that patient satisfaction with treatment declines prior to re-injection, and many (46%) patients would prefer an injection schedule of less than 12 weeks.

Subsequently, Evidente et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of BoNT-A/Inco versus placebo in pre-treated or treatment-naive CD patients. A flexible dosing schedule was evaluated over a 68-week extension to the initial study of pre-treated or treatment-naive patients. In those who received ≥ 2 injections, the median intervals were: 6 to ≤ 10 weeks in 22.5%; > 10 to ≤ 12 weeks in 24.6%; > 12 to ≥ 14 weeks in 19.4%; and > 14 weeks in 33.5%.

This suggests that it might be useful to adopt a flexible dosing schedule. Flexible schedules may require some service adjustment to accommodate but not necessarily an increase in the number of injections delivered overall, since the mean injection interval seen for these "flexible" patients was still 12 weeks.

### Treatment of patients with essential tremor [^114h3ire]. The Lancet Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Essential tremor is a common movement disorder. Tremor severity and handicap vary widely, but most patients with essential tremor do not receive a diagnosis and hence are never treated. Furthermore, many patients abandon treatment due to side effects or poor efficacy. A newly developed algorithm, based on the logarithmic relation between tremor amplitude and clinical tremor ratings, can be used to compare the magnitude of effect of available treatments. Drugs with established efficacy, such as propranolol and primidone, produce a mean tremor reduction of about 50%. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic nucleus ventrointermedius or neighboring subthalamic structures reduces tremor by about 90%. However, no controlled trials of DBS have been conducted, and the best target remains uncertain. Better drugs are needed, and controlled trials are required to determine the safety and efficacy of DBS in the nucleus ventrointermedius and neighboring subthalamic structures.

### Formulation composition of botulinum toxins in clinical use [^117TaV8s]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Use of botulinum toxin (BoNT) has become the treatment of choice for various debilitating neuromuscular diseases and for aesthetic medicine. BoNT products are licensed as prescription-only medicines by the health authorities of each country in which they are approved. The authors detail the status of BoNT formulations and precisely describe the contents of each product. Previously, these data have been presented in a fragmented way in papers discussing the characteristics of BoNT products, without a detailed examination of the formulations. This information is essential for clinicians to make informed decisions about which products to use clinically. The authors also examine developments that are either in progress or likely to occur, based on currently available information.

### Mds evidence-based review of treatments for essential tremor [^112cQVeh]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Essential tremor is one of the most prevalent movement disorders. Many treatments for essential tremor have been reported in clinical practice, but it is uncertain which options have the most robust evidence. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force on tremor to review clinical studies of treatments for essential tremor.

- **Objectives**: To conduct an evidence-based review of pharmacological and surgical treatments for essential tremor, using standardized criteria defined a priori by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

- **Methods**: We followed the recommendations of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Evidence-Based Medicine Committee.

- **Results**: Sixty-four studies of pharmacological and surgical interventions were included in the review. Propranolol and primidone were classified as clinically useful, similar to topiramate, but only for doses higher than 200 mg/day. Alprazolam and botulinum toxin type A were classified as possibly useful. Unilateral Ventralis intermedius thalamic DBS, radiofrequency thalamotomy, and MRI-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy were considered possibly useful. All the above recommendations were made for limb tremor in essential tremor. There was insufficient evidence for voice and head tremor as well as for the remaining interventions.

- **Conclusion**: Propranolol, primidone, and topiramate (> 200 mg/day) are the pharmacological interventions in which the data reviewed robustly supported efficacy. Their safety profile and patient preference may guide.

### How satisfied are cervical dystonia patients after 3 years of botulinum toxin type A treatment? Results from a prospective, long-term observational study [^113uwGrB]. Journal of Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Study exposure to BoNT-A treatment

The mean ± SD length of study exposure was 34.20 ± 9.90 months, and the number of treatment cycles was 8.65 ± 3.25. At baseline, 689 subjects received aboBoNT-A, 247 subjects received onaBoNT-A, and 59 subjects received incoBoNT-A. Injection practices were generally in line with BoNT-A prescribing information. As previously reported for baseline interim data, the most frequently injected muscle groups at baseline/first visit were the splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, levator scapulae, semispinalis capitis, and scalene group. These six muscle groups remained the most frequently injected muscles throughout the study. Most subjects were reinjected at intervals of 12–16 weeks (58.6%), and switches between BoNT-A preparations were uncommon (14.9%).

- **BoNT-A treatment parameters**: Of the 113 active sites, 68 sites treating 583 subjects completed the survey of injection schedule practice. Of these, 7.2% of subjects were injected at fixed re-injection intervals, 37.4% with a flexible schedule (depending on patient needs), and 55.4% with a mix of both.

Subject self-reported satisfaction with symptom control

Overall, 55.6% of subjects reported satisfaction at the end of their last treatment cycle at 3 years ('Today satisfaction'). Rates of satisfaction at peak effect ('Highest satisfaction') were higher, with 89.9% of subjects reporting satisfaction over the treatment cycle.

### Medications used to treat tremors [^1138NkLR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Low credibility.

Tremor is one of the most common movement disorders, though it can arise in the context of several unrelated neurological disorders whose pharmacology and anatomical origins differ greatly. Treatment of tremors can take advantage of several medications and neurosurgical treatments. Medications useful for treating tremor are discussed in this review, including those for action tremor, as seen in essential tremor, the resting tremor of Parkinson's disease, orthostatic tremor, cerebellar tremor, Holmes tremor, dystonic tremor, and drug-induced tremors. A medication that is useful for most types of tremors is the beta-blocker propranolol, though even in essential tremor it can fail to be effective at tremor control.

### A new paradigm for the management of essential vocal tremor with botulinum toxin [^115EFmiN]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

The objectives of the study were twofold: first, to clarify the phenomenology of essential voice tremor (EVT); and second, to report a management paradigm for EVT using botulinum toxin.

- **Study design**: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data.

- **Methods**: Phenomenology from patients diagnosed with EVT between April 1996 and March 2012 was recorded, charted, and analyzed. A treatment paradigm for EVT using botulinum toxin, based on individualized clinical findings, is discussed.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients were included. Fewer than 50% of patients responded to centrally acting oral medications. Fifteen patients analyzed had horizontal laryngeal tremor and received botulinum toxin injections to bilateral thyroarytenoid muscles. Thirteen patients had vertical laryngeal tremor and underwent additional strap muscle injections. All patients experienced symptomatic improvement with reduced tremor amplitude. Dose adjustments over time depended on the degree of symptomatic improvement.

- **Conclusions**: Management of essential voice tremor with botulinum toxin is optimized by individualizing treatment based on the tremor phenomenology observed during clinical examination.

### Handling botulinum toxins: An updated literature review [^117Lgy1C]. Dermatologic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) has been in use since the late 1970s, and over the last 20 years, its use has been extended to new indications in various areas of medicine. During these years of clinical use, some of the initial ideas have changed, and others have remained stable along with increasing experience with and knowledge about BoNTs.

- **Objective**: To review the literature and prescribing information on all of the available products and to update the concept of handling toxins (preparations, reconstitution, storage, sterility, and dilution).

- **Methods**: A review (not Cochrane-type analysis) of the medical literature based on relevant databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, specialist textbooks, and manufacturer information) was performed.

- **Conclusions**: Many of the precautions around BoNT use, often recommended by the manufacturers, are described in the clinical literature as too restrictive. The literature suggests that toxins may be sturdier and more resistant to degradation than previously understood.

### Essential tremor suppression with a novel anti-tremor orthosis: A randomized crossover trial [^111dK8ao]. Movement Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is characterized by action tremor of the arms, which can interfere substantially with daily activities. Pharmacotherapy may be ineffective or associated with side effects, and stereotactic surgery is invasive. Hence, new accessible treatment options are urgently needed. An easy-to-use and lightweight orthotic device that exerts joint damping may provide an alternative solution for reducing tremor in daily activities.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to assess the efficacy of a novel anti-tremor orthosis (STIL) in reducing clinical and accelerometry measures of distal arm tremor in ET.

- **Methods**: In a randomized crossover single-blinded trial in 24 ET patients in a hospital setting, we compared three conditions: no orthosis (baseline), a sham device, and the anti-tremor orthosis (order randomized). The orthosis, but not the sham device, passively damped joints in the forearm. Participants performed seven tasks from the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Scale (TETRAS). The two co-primary outcome measures were clinical tremor severity (video-scored TETRAS) and tremor power (accelerometry). Patient satisfaction was self-assessed using the Dutch Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology. Conditions were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

- **Results**: The anti-tremor orthosis significantly reduced TETRAS scores compared to sham and baseline (baseline: 19.0 ± 3.2, sham: 13.7 ± 3.9, orthosis: 9.9 ± 3.6; mean ± standard deviation). Similar effects were observed for tremor power, which was reduced by 87.4% (orthosis vs. baseline).

### Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for essential tremor: 5-year follow-up results [^113dnsQZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

The observed change in total QUEST scores from baseline at the annual follow-up was calculated using separate t-tests per visit. Boxes indicate medians with interquartile ranges; whiskers represent ranges, and plus signs denote means. Mean score values (standard deviations) are noted in blue type. This figure is available in color online only.

When examining each dimension of the QUEST individually, both physical and psychological subscores showed improvement from baseline to the 1-year follow-up (p < 0.0001), with these levels of significance maintained over 5 years of follow-up. Specifically, the physical dimension subscore was 73 ± 19 at baseline and decreased to 32 ± 27 at 12 months, 35 ± 24 at 2 years, 40 ± 25 at 3 years, 44 ± 26 at 4 years, and 46 ± 25 at 5 years (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons; see Fig. 5A). The psychological dimension subscore was 41 ± 24 at baseline, decreasing to 13 ± 17 at 12 months, and subsequently to 18 ± 21, 17 ± 19, 18 ± 17, and 19 ± 19 at the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year visits, respectively (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons; see Fig. 5B).

The observed change in QUEST dimension subscores from baseline at the annual follow-up was also calculated by separate t-tests per visit. Boxes indicate medians with interquartile ranges; whiskers represent ranges, and plus signs denote means. Mean score values (standard deviations) are noted in blue type. Graphs are shown only for the significant dimension outcomes, and the figure is available in color online only.

The QUEST work and finance dimension showed improvement from baseline at 1 year. This improvement was maintained over the 5 years, with various levels of significance.

### Botox [^112hi3NB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effect**: Postmarketing safety data from Botox and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In both unapproved uses and approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than those used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory disorders occur.

No definitive serious adverse event reports of distant spread of toxin effect associated with Botox for blepharospasm at the recommended dose (30 units and below), severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis at the recommended dose (100 units), strabismus, or for chronic migraine at the labeled doses have been reported.

### Treatment for essential tremor: A systematic review and Bayesian model-based network meta-analysis of RCTs [^113boVGR]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent movement disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the global population, with incidence rates rising to 4%–5% among individuals aged 65 and older. While most ET patients initially exhibit mild symptoms that progressively worsen, it is estimated that 30%–50% will eventually experience more severe manifestations. In such cases, the severity of hand and limb tremors escalates markedly, profoundly impairing their ability to perform fine motor tasks like writing and holding objects. This escalation not only diminishes their quality of life but also significantly hinders their work capabilities, leading to broader impacts on their daily living and independence.

The management of ET includes a diverse array of treatment modalities, broadly categorized into medication treatment, surgical treatment, and non-medication non-surgical treatment. Before initiating treatment, patients usually experience a prolonged course of the disease. Once treatment begins, patients typically start with oral medication therapy. In medication therapy, according to guidelines established by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Italian Movement Disorders Association (IMDA), propranolol and primidone are the preferred prescriptions, with medications like gabapentin, topiramate, and benzodiazepines also frequently utilized. However, it is important to note that only about half of the patients experience a significant reduction in tremor severity with these medications. When pharmacological treatments are ineffective or have significant side effects, exploring other treatment options becomes critical.

### Pharmacology and immunology of botulinum toxin serotypes [^114V8zyb]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin preparations can provide patients with a therapeutic modality that may improve both their medical condition and quality of life. The mechanism of action of the various botulinum toxin preparations and serotypes is similar: they all block neurotransmitter release. The majority of clinical conditions treated are based upon the targeted temporary chemodenervation of the selected organ. The antinociceptive effects of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A), based on preclinical studies and clinical experiences in treating movement disorders and other painful conditions, will also be reviewed to illustrate how this compound may act as it alleviates the discomfort associated with various conditions. Chronic therapies with preparations containing the lowest amount of neurotoxin protein provide the best chance for long-term therapy by minimizing the potential of the patient to form neutralizing antibodies. Differences in formulations or serotypes impart unique efficacy and safety profiles and thus do not support a simple dose ratio conversion between products.

### Diffusion, spread, and migration of botulinum toxin [^111AGtxe]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and a neuromuscular blocking agent used for the treatment of a variety of neurologic and medical conditions. The efficacy and safety of BoNT depend on the accurate selection and identification of intended targets but may also be determined by other factors, including the physical spread of the molecule from the injection site, passive diffusion, and migration to distal sites via axonal or hematogenous transport.

The passive kinetic dispersion of the toxin away from the injection site in a gradient-dependent manner may also play a role in toxin spread. In addition to the unique properties of the various BoNT products, volume and dilution may also influence the local and systemic distribution of BoNT. Most local and remote complications of BoNT injections are thought to be due to unwanted spread or diffusion of the toxin's biologic activity into adjacent and distal muscles.

Despite the widespread therapeutic and cosmetic use of BoNT for more than three decades, there is a remarkable paucity of published data on the mechanisms of distribution and its effects on clinical outcomes. The primary aim of this article is to critically review the available experimental and clinical literature and place it in a practical context.

### Do the unintended actions of botulinum toxin at distant sites have clinical implications [^112J3pu7]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, botulinum toxin (BT) has enjoyed phenomenal success as a safe and effective therapeutic tool for neurologic and non-neurologic conditions. Even though recent evidence-based conclusions are limited by the availability of data, clinicians confidently recommend BT for many clinical conditions. Besides being effective, BT injected locally has also been considered safe because no evidence showed that the toxin acts at distant sites. Recent findings from basic scientific research now challenge this conviction and raise concerns that the toxin may have a less localized function than previously thought.

Studies in rodents show that the toxin is retrogradely transported and even transcytosed to second-order neurons in the CNS. We therefore need to reappraise whether BT injected into muscles, glands, or cutis might induce previously unconsidered central actions and whether these actions might have clinical implications. In eliciting clinical benefits, BT's peripheral and central actions probably summate. Whether BT acts centrally mainly through retrograde transport, transcytosis, or both remains unclear. Whatever the mechanism, the lack of deleterious central effects implies that while research into action mechanisms continues, physicians can safely use BT for therapy.

### Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment in functional movement disorders: long-term follow-up [^1159s1Hf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

We recently reported on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effect of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in 48 patients with chronic (> 1 year) jerky and tremulous functional movement disorders (FMD). The RCT demonstrated an improvement in motor symptoms in both treatment arms: 64% of patients (16 out of 25) receiving BoNT improved compared to 57% (13 out of 23) in the placebo group. The proportion of improved patients increased to 81% (35 out of 43) at the end of the open-label phase. Despite symptom improvement, there was no corresponding change in quality of life and disability. In the present study, our aim was to assess the long-term outcome of this study population.

### Treatment patterns in essential tremor: Real-world evidence from a United Kingdom and France primary care database [^116xJumh]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite its limited efficacy, pharmacological therapy remains the main therapeutic approach for treating patients with essential tremor (ET). However, information regarding the overall treatment patterns of ET patients is still scarce, generally focused on US data, and limited to small samples. We therefore conducted a retrospective cohort study aimed at describing the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with ET, treatment patterns, and potential variables affecting the use of ET medications in two large cohorts of patients from France and the United Kingdom.

### Comparative effectiveness of propranolol and botulinum for the treatment of essential voice tremor [^114HHLNo]. The Laryngoscope (2016). High credibility.

To assess the comparative effectiveness of botulinum toxin and propranolol in patients with essential vocal tremor (EVT), an individual prospective cohort study was conducted. Study patients were recruited at the Emory Voice Center from those seeking treatment for EVT. Exclusion criteria included current β-blocker treatment, spasmodic dysphonia, or other diseases preventing the use of propranolol therapy. A 10-week washout period from prior botulinum toxin treatment occurred before enrollment. Patients were assessed via the Voice-Related Quality-Of-Life (VRQOL) questionnaire, the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor questionnaire, and a blinded perceptual voice assessment. These assessments were conducted at baseline, 2 weeks after propranolol therapy, and 4 weeks after botulinum toxin injection.

Eighteen patients were enrolled. After 2 to 4 weeks of propranolol therapy, with a maximum dosage of 60 mg to 90 mg per day, patients reported an average ΔVRQOL of 9.31. Six patients reported significant VRQOL improvement over 10, while the rest reported changes between -7.5 and 7.5. Fifteen patients were followed for at least 4 weeks after botulinum toxin injection, reporting an average improvement in scaled VRQOL of 22.00. Blinded perceptual voice assessment demonstrated an improvement in the overall severity of tremor with botulinum toxin.

In conclusion, in some patients with EVT, propranolol led to significant vocal improvement without major side effects. Although botulinum toxin remains the gold-standard therapy for patients with EVT, propranolol showed potential benefits when botulinum toxin was not suitable or available.

### Botulinum toxin: Evidence-based medicine criteria in rare indications [^111MvPgi]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Presently, there are more than 50 possible indications for the application of botulinum toxin. In some instances, the use of botulinum toxin has already been approved; others are about to be approved. For most of these indications, a sufficient number of studies have been published. However, for rare indications, there are an insufficient number of studies available. In part, there are only published case reports. Classification according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine is thus difficult. This paper aims to describe the range of possible indications for botulinum toxin A and assess its therapeutic value for rare indications. The number of studies available on botulinum toxin B is still limited.

### Letybo [^114Paitq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Spread of toxin effects**: Postmarketing safety data from other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, blurred vision, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death related to the spread of toxin effects. In both unapproved uses and approved indications, symptoms consistent with the spread of toxin effects have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than the maximum recommended total dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Letybo is not approved for any conditions other than glabellar lines. Patients or caregivers should be advised to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech, or respiratory difficulties occur.

- **Lack of interchangeability between botulinum toxin products**: The potency units of Letybo are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products, and therefore, units of biological activity of Letybo cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Description (11)].

- **Serious adverse reactions with unapproved use**: Serious adverse reactions, including excessive w

### Botulinum toxin in clinical practice [^115TwASn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin, the most potent biological toxin, has become a powerful therapeutic tool for a growing number of clinical applications. This review draws attention to new findings about the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and briefly reviews some of its most frequent uses, focusing on evidence-based data. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, as well as open-label clinical trials, provide evidence that when appropriate targets and doses are selected, botulinum toxin temporarily ameliorates disorders associated with excessive muscle contraction or autonomic dysfunction. When injected not more often than every three months, the risk of blocking antibodies is slight. Long-term experience with this agent suggests that it is an effective and safe treatment not only for approved indications but also for an increasing number of off-label indications.

### Trial of botulinum toxin for isolated or essential head tremor [^117PoRWs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Local injections of botulinum toxin type A have been used to treat essential head tremor but have not been extensively studied in randomized trials.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adult patients with essential or isolated head tremor to receive botulinum toxin type A or placebo. Botulinum toxin or placebo was injected under electromyographic guidance into each splenius capitis muscle on the day of randomization (day 0) and during week 12. The primary outcome was improvement by at least 2 points on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI) scale at week 6 after the second injection (week 18 after randomization). The CGI scale was used to record the patient's assessment of the degree of improvement or worsening of head tremor since baseline; scores range from 3 (very much improved) to -3 (very much worse). Secondary outcomes included changes in tremor characteristics from baseline to weeks 6, 12, and 24.

- **Results**: A total of 120 patients were enrolled; 3 patients were excluded during screening, and 117 patients were randomly assigned to receive botulinum toxin (62 patients) or placebo (55 patients) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Twelve patients in the botulinum toxin group and 2 patients in the placebo group did not receive injections during week 12. The primary outcome — improvement by at least 2 points on the CGI scale at week 18 — was met by 31% of the patients in the botulinum toxin group as compared with 9% of those in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.37; 95% confidence interval).

Regarding medical management for essential tremor, particularly with respect to pharmacotherapy, the AAN 2005 guidelines recommend considering either propranolol or primidone for initial therapy in patients with limb essential tremor (ET). Offer propranolol, long-acting propranolol, or primidone based on medical conditions and potential side effects.

Consider increasing the dose of propranolol or primidone over 12 months of treatment. If monotherapy does not sufficiently reduce tremor, consider offering combination therapy with primidone and propranolol.

### Essential tremor-the most common movement disorder in older people [^116svrix]. Age and Ageing (2006). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) affects approximately 4% of the population above 65 years of age. The traditional view that ET is a familial monosymptomatic disorder with a benign prognosis has recently been challenged, as it is now known to be a progressive and clinically heterogeneous condition with sporadic and familial forms. The pathogenesis of ET is not fully understood, though a disordered central mechanism is the most likely site of origin with possible modulation by muscle adrenoreceptors. Limited post-mortem studies have not shown consistent abnormalities in the brains of ET patients.

ET is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, particularly in the older population. Tremor amplitude increases with age, accounting for substantial disability in older people. Therapy, both pharmacological and neurosurgical, has significant limitations in older individuals. A better understanding of its pathophysiology in the future will help in developing more effective therapy, including neuroprotective strategies.

### Daxxify [^111m548Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning: Distant spread of toxin effect**: The effects of all botulinum toxin products, including Daxxify, may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life-threatening, and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity, an unapproved use for Daxxify, but symptoms can also occur in adults, particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Essential tremor [^114gzzGW]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2021). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders, affecting more than 60 million individuals worldwide. The definition and underlying pathophysiology of ET are contentious. Patients present primarily with motor features such as postural and action tremors but may also have other non-motor features, including cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Genetics account for most of the ET risk; however, environmental factors may also be involved. The variable penetrance and challenges in validating data make gene-environment analysis difficult.

Structural changes in cerebellar Purkinje cells and neighboring neuronal populations have been observed in post-mortem studies, and other studies have found GABAergic dysfunction and dysregulation of the cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuitry. Commonly prescribed medications include propranolol and primidone. Deep brain stimulation and ultrasound thalamotomy are surgical options for patients with medically intractable ET.

Further research in post-mortem studies, alongside animal and cell-based models, may help identify new pathophysiological clues and therapeutic targets. Additionally, advances in omics and machine learning may facilitate the development of precision medicine for patients with ET.

### Commentary: Botulinum toxin in clinical medicine [^115U4nKS]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

The recent introduction of botulinum toxin (BTX) into clinical medicine has revolutionized the practice of medicine and surgery forever. Who would have ever thought that the world's most deadly toxin would be used for therapeutic purposes? The discovery of the beneficial effects of BTX has transformed the lives of many individuals who have suffered from various unrelated disorders, which have been virtually impossible to treat. With the help of BTX, these and hopefully many other ailments will be easily managed with a few simple injections.

### Treatment patterns in essential tremor: Real-world evidence from a United Kingdom and France primary care database [^114tcvWP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

All patients actively registered in the list of participating GPs in both the United Kingdom and France between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, were considered. Access to a GP is regulated differently in the two countries: in the United Kingdom, GPs manage a list of patients and act as gatekeepers for their access to all healthcare services, whereas in France, patients can choose different GPs as required. Therefore, a subgroup of GPs was identified by the THIN® network as representative of the French population. Based on these considerations, we included all patients recruited in the UK database and only those patients referred to representative GPs in France.

In these two cohorts, all individuals who reported at least one of the following diagnosis codes during the study period were identified: ET (ICD10/France: G25.0); ET and other specified forms of tremor (Read code/UK: F131.00); benign ET (Read code/United Kingdom: F131.00); essential and other specified forms of tremor not otherwise specified (Read code/United Kingdom: F131z00).

In accordance with a previous study and to ensure the selection of incident cases, individuals were included only if they had at least 3 years of database history prior to the date of the first coded ET diagnosis (index date [ID]), as well as ≥ 2 years of follow-up. With this approach, we limited the possibility of including prevalent cases that were diagnosed before the patient joined a practice participating in THIN® because the ET definition requires the symptoms to persist for at least 3 years before diagnosis.

### Essential tremor: Differential diagnosis and current therapy [^115LgxhE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that affects between 5 and 10 million persons in the United States. It is characterized primarily by an action and postural tremor most often affecting the arms, but it can also affect other body parts. Essential tremor is a progressive neurologic disorder and can cause substantial disability in some patients.

Although there is no cure for essential tremor, pharmacologic and surgical treatments can provide some benefit. Primidone and propranolol are first-line treatments. Other medications with potential efficacy include benzodiazepines, gabapentin, topiramate, and botulinum toxin. Patients with medication-resistant tremor may benefit from thalamotomy or deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. The use of medical and surgical therapies can provide benefit in up to 80% of patients with essential tremor.

### A randomized, double masked, controlled trial of botulinum toxin type A in essential hand tremor [^115nFJy6]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin type A injection in essential tremor of the hand, a randomized study was conducted involving 133 patients. Botulinum toxin type A is recognized for its effectiveness in treating dystonia, spasticity, and other movement disorders and has shown promise in open-label studies and a previous double-masked study for essential hand tremor.

- **Methods**: Patients with essential tremor were randomized into three groups: low-dose (50 U) or high-dose (100 U) botulinum toxin type A (Botox) or vehicle placebo treatment. Injections were administered to wrist flexors and extensors, with patients followed for 16 weeks. Treatment effects were evaluated through clinical rating scales, motor tasks, functional disability assessments, and a global assessment of treatment. Hand strength was measured using clinical ratings and a dynamometer.

- **Results**: Both doses of botulinum toxin type A significantly reduced postural tremor on clinical rating scales after 4 to 16 weeks. However, kinetic tremor reduction was significant only at the 6-week examination. Improvements in motor tasks and functional disability were inconsistent. Grip strength was diminished in both the low- and high-dose botulinum toxin type A groups compared to placebo. Adverse reactions were primarily dose-dependent hand weakness.

In conclusion, botulinum toxin type A injections for essential tremor of the hands led to significant postural tremor improvement but limited kinetic tremor and functional efficacy, with hand weakness being a dose-dependent side effect.

### Essential tremor [^114Vn2eM]. The Lancet Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological diseases, although it is a disease about which we are only beginning to develop an understanding. Effective treatment options for the disorder are severely limited. The traditional view of ET as a benign, familial, monosymptomatic disorder is being replaced by the understanding of ET as a disease or family of diseases with aetiological, clinical, and pathological heterogeneity.

Recent identification of putative environmental toxins linked to ET provides hope for disease prevention through a reduction in exposure to risk factors. Pathological and genetic studies will yield new insights into disease pathogenesis and mechanisms, which may result in the development of more effective symptomatic therapies developed with an understanding of the disease biology. These insights also have the potential to form the basis for neuroprotective therapies.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of secondary treatment failure and immunogenicity with botulinum neurotoxin A in multiple indications [^1136ePSz]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The reported frequencies of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) following botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections are generally higher among conditions usually treated with higher BoNT doses, such as urological conditions, spasticity, and especially dystonia. In some studies, NAb formation was reported to be lower with both abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA injections for glabellar lines than for cervical dystonia (CD). Regarding the injection site, injections into anatomical regions rich in lymph nodes, such as the neck, appear more likely to produce an immune response than injections into other locations in some studies but not in others. Additionally, injection guidance techniques improve precision but are not always used or available, especially ultrasound guidance. This may contribute to the variance in secondary treatment failure (STF) and NAb incidence reported between studies.

In this meta-analysis, the incobotulinumtoxinA group had zero patients with persistent NAbs (despite all identified studies of incobotulinumtoxinA using the sensitive mouse hemidiaphragm assay (MHDA), increasing the chance of finding NAb-positive patients) or STF, regardless of indication. Patients with CD treated with first-line abobotulinumtoxinA had relatively higher proportions with NAbs (≤ 4%) and STF (≤ 9%). Rahman et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 43 studies involving 8833 patients over the period 2000–2020 and reported an overall incidence of NAbs after BoNT-A treatment of 1.8% (all indications). Our study indicated NAb rates after first-line abobotulinumtoxinA as high as 5% and 2% after first-line abobotulinumtoxinA in patients treated for CD or spasticity.
