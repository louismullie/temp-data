## Question

can clindamycin be used in klebsiella infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clindamycin can be used for Klebsiella infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clindamycin's labeled antibacterial spectrum and intrinsic activity. Then, I should verify the microbiology of Klebsiella and whether that aligns with clindamycin's activity. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations for treating Klebsiella across common syndromes to see if clindamycin is ever endorsed. Finally, I need to consider stewardship and safety implications to frame a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm clindamycin's labeled activity. The FDA labeling indicates clindamycin is for serious infections due to susceptible anaerobes and certain gram-positive organisms, specifically streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci, with cautions to reserve use because of C. difficile risk; there is no indication for gram-negative Enterobacterales such as Klebsiella, and its labeled spectrum does not include these organisms [^114QPBjx] [^112qdYXd] [^114vKwKX].

> Wait, let me verify the organism profile. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative Enterobacterales pathogen implicated in urinary, respiratory, intra-abdominal, bloodstream, and invasive syndromes; this microbiology places it outside clindamycin's gram-positive and anaerobe-focused spectrum, so a priori clindamycin would not be expected to be active or appropriate as definitive therapy against Klebsiella [^112tbt8h].

> Next, I should review guideline-supported therapies to ensure I'm not missing a niche use. Contemporary IDSA guidance for antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections recommends carbapenems for serious ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, with step-down to TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones if susceptible, and for CRE it recommends ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol; clindamycin is not listed for Klebsiella in any syndrome, including UTI, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, or bacteremia, which reinforces its lack of role here [^112T6Th6] [^115ivtWb] [^116GR3iW] [^117Nsaet] [^116bAmow].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some cephalosporins are labeled for Klebsiella, but I should confirm the ESBL caveat. Clinical failures have been documented when ESBL-producing Klebsiella tested "susceptible" to third-generation cephalosporins, underscoring why carbapenems are preferred for serious ESBL infections despite in vitro results, so choosing a beta-lactam with reliable activity matters and again, clindamycin offers no coverage here [^115c3d1o] [^112T6Th6].

> But wait, what if the infection is polymicrobial with anaerobes or MRSA where clindamycin is sometimes used adjunctively? I need to check that nuance. For skin and soft tissue abscesses, clindamycin can be considered for MRSA and anaerobic coverage, yet even there it would not address Klebsiella and would require combination therapy with an agent active against gram-negative bacilli; product labeling for ceftazidime explicitly notes it may be coadministered with clindamycin in severe polymicrobial infections, which highlights clindamycin's adjunct-only role when Klebsiella is present, not monotherapy [^116zAVhn] [^11573KMp].

> I should double-check safety and stewardship before recommending anything. Clindamycin carries a boxed warning for C. difficile–associated colitis and is associated with superinfection from overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, so using it against a pathogen it cannot treat exposes patients to harm without benefit and violates core antimicrobial stewardship principles that emphasize using the narrowest effective agent with proven activity [^1127rxvp] [^116GXcMA] [^114E4RKG] [^111ucaWD].

> Let me think about appropriate alternatives to ground the recommendation. Aminoglycosides like tobramycin and beta-lactams such as ceftazidime are labeled as active against Klebsiella in serious infections, and guideline-preferred agents should be selected based on site of infection and susceptibilities, with carbapenems for ESBL disease and modern beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations for CRE when indicated; these are the clinically appropriate paths rather than clindamycin [^114qZV8o] [^11573KMp] [^112T6Th6] [^115ivtWb].

> Bottom line, after verifying labeling, microbiology, guidelines, and safety, I should conclude clearly: clindamycin has no reliable activity against Klebsiella and is not appropriate therapy for Klebsiella infections; if present in a polymicrobial process, it may be used only as an adjunct for anaerobes or gram-positive coverage alongside a drug active against Klebsiella, chosen per susceptibility results and site-specific guidance [^114QPBjx] [^112T6Th6] [^116zAVhn].

No, **clindamycin should not be used** for Klebsiella infections because Klebsiella is intrinsically resistant, owing to its Gram-negative outer membrane and efflux pumps. Clindamycin is indicated only for anaerobes and Gram-positive cocci, **not for Gram-negative bacilli like Klebsiella** [^114QPBjx]. Using clindamycin in this setting risks treatment failure and promotes resistance [^111ucaWD]; instead, select susceptibility-guided therapy, with carbapenems [^112T6Th6] or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors [^115ivtWb] for severe or resistant infections.

---

## Microbiological rationale against clindamycin use in klebsiella infections

Klebsiella species are Gram-negative bacilli [^112tbt8h] whose outer membrane limits clindamycin penetration, and they possess intrinsic resistance mechanisms (e.g. efflux pumps, ribosomal protection) [^114rCWo7], **rendering clindamycin ineffective** [^114QPBjx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend clindamycin for Klebsiella infections [^112qhAQC]. Clindamycin is indicated for anaerobes and Gram-positive cocci, not Gram-negative bacilli like Klebsiella [^114QPBjx]. For ESBL-producing Klebsiella, **carbapenems are preferred** [^112T6Th6]. For carbapenem-resistant strains, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors [^115ivtWb] or cefiderocol [^113rvZvW] are recommended.

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

There is **no evidence supporting clindamycin** for Klebsiella [^114QPBjx], and its use risks treatment failure, resistance, and adverse outcomes [^115eTga2]. Appropriate, susceptibility-based therapy is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113A1zGS].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Recommended alternatives include:

- **Carbapenems**: meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, ertapenem [^112T6Th6] for severe or ESBL-producing infections.
- **Β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors**: ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam for carbapenem-resistant strains [^115ivtWb].
- **Cefiderocol**: for multidrug-resistant or carbapenem-resistant [^113rvZvW] infections [^115ivtWb].
- **Aminoglycosides**: tobramycin, amikacin [^114qZV8o] as adjuncts or alternatives based on susceptibility [^116GR3iW].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin [^116GR3iW] for susceptible strains.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of clindamycin use

Clindamycin carries significant risks, including:

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: severe, potentially fatal colitis [^1127rxvp].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, DRESS, toxic epidermal necrolysis [^115DJhLG].
- **Nephrotoxicity**: risk of acute kidney injury [^115DJhLG].
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: promotes resistance in Klebsiella and other pathogens [^111ucaWD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Clindamycin is **ineffective against Klebsiella** due to intrinsic resistance and is not recommended by guidelines [^112qhAQC]. Use susceptibility-guided therapy — carbapenems or β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors [^116SVP69] for severe or resistant infections — to ensure effective treatment and limit resistance.

Clindamycin is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. It is also indicated for serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or those for whom, in the judgment of the physician, penicillin is inappropriate. Due to the risk of colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING, physicians should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives, such as erythromycin, before selecting clindamycin.

- **Anaerobes**: Serious respiratory tract infections such as empyema, anaerobic pneumonitis, and lung abscess; serious skin and soft tissue infections; septicemia; intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess, typically resulting from anaerobic organisms resident in the normal gastrointestinal tract; infections of the female pelvis and genital tract like endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection.

- **Streptococci**: Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.

- **Staphylococci**: Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.

- **Pneumococci**: Serious respiratory tract infections.

### Management of serious nosocomial bacterial infections: Do current therapeutic options meet the need [^113A1zGS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired bacterial infections pose a formidable challenge for healthcare providers, as patients often need to be treated empirically, at least initially, although delay of appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy is known to significantly increase morbidity and mortality among affected patients. This elevated risk is compounded by the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Prompt initiation of treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial agent active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms is prudent for patients with nosocomial infections. As the continued usefulness of vancomycin comes into question, the number of alternative agents that provide efficacy equal to that of vancomycin remains limited. The development of novel and effective alternative agents, such as tigecycline, is therefore important.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to the management of carbapenem-resistant *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend considering the administration of older antibiotics. These should be chosen from among the in-vitro active antibiotics on an individual basis and according to the source of the infection, particularly for the treatment of non-severe or low-risk carbapenem-resistant *P. aeruginosa* infections. This approach should be undertaken with due consideration of antibiotic stewardship.

### Impact of antibiotic prescription on the resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae at a tertiary hospital in China, 2012–2019 [^116brwRX]. American Journal of Infection Control (2021). Low credibility.

The incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infections is worrisome. Previous studies have shown that increased antibiotic treatment might affect the resistance profile of this organism. The objective of this study was to describe the resistance profile of KP strains and to correlate it with antibiotics consumption.

- **Methods**: A retrospective observational analysis was performed to examine exposure to antibiotics and resistant profile, comparing the results of different measuring outcomes of resistance (the incidence and the percentage of resistant KP) from January 2012 to June 2019 using the autoregressive integrated moving average and transfer function model.

- **Results**: During the study period, the use of some third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems continued to increase, and a total of 5,519 KP isolates were collected. There were positive relationships between amikacin-resistant KP, ciprofloxacin-resistant KP, and corresponding antibiotic use in the transfer function models, both for the incidence rate and the resistant rate (time lag = 0) (P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: The present study confirms that the history of amikacin or ciprofloxacin use influences the susceptibility of these agents against KP with no delay. Similar results were obtained with different measuring outcomes of resistance.

### A call to arms: The imperative for antimicrobial stewardship [^111ucaWD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. The prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging NAP1 strain of *Clostridium difficile*, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, *Acinetobacter* species, *Klebsiella pneumoniae* carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus*, is increasing nationwide. The sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

As the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. Such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.

Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae have been reported with increasing frequency, thereby limiting the choice of effective antimicrobial agents available to clinicians. This has prompted the increased use of polymyxins and tigecycline, but resistance to these agents is already emerging. We report 2 cases of infection with panresistant K. pneumoniae.

### Outcome of cephalosporin treatment for serious infections due to apparently susceptible organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: Implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory [^115c3d1o]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Although extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) hydrolyze cephalosporin antibiotics, some ESBL-producing organisms are not resistant to all cephalosporins when tested in vitro. Some authors have suggested that screening Klebsiellae or Escherichia coli for ESBL production is not clinically necessary, and a recent survey indicated that the majority of American clinical microbiology laboratories did not make efforts to detect ESBLs.

We performed a prospective, multinational study of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, identifying 10 patients treated for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae bacteremia with cephalosporins. Their infecting organisms were not resistant in vitro to the utilized cephalosporin. Additionally, we reviewed 26 similar cases of severe infections previously reported. Out of these 36 patients, 4 had to be excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 32 patients, 100% (4 of 4) experienced clinical failure when the MICs of the cephalosporin used for treatment were in the intermediate range. Furthermore, 54% (15 of 28) experienced failure when MICs were in the susceptible range.

It is clinically important to detect ESBL production by Klebsiellae or E. coli, even when cephalosporin MICs are in the susceptible range (≤ 8 μg/ml), and to report ESBL-producing organisms as resistant to aztreonam and all cephalosporins (with the exception of cephamycins).

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections [^112qhAQC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections. This guidance document focuses on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR P. aeruginosa), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This updated document replaces previous versions of the guidance document.

- **Methods**: A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-E, AmpC-E, CRE, DTR P. aeruginosa, CRAB, and S. maltophilia. Because of differences in the epidemiology of AMR and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of AMR infections in the United States.

- **Results**: Preferred and alternative suggested treatment approaches are provided with accompanying rationales, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, transitioning to oral therapy, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are discussed briefly. Suggested approaches apply for both adult and pediatric populations, although suggested antibiotic dosages are provided only for adults.

- **Conclusions**: The field of AMR is evolving rapidly, and ongoing adjustments to treatment guidance will be necessary to keep pace with emerging data.

### Microbiota-mediated protection against antibiotic-resistant pathogens [^116JUsgz]. Genes and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

For many bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridioides difficile, colonization of the intestinal tract is the first step on the pathway to acute infection. Despite these three pathogens ultimately causing a different spectrum of diseases, colonization of the intestinal tract is a shared point in their pathogenesis; thus, understanding this key step in disease could lead to treatments that are broadly effective against multiple pathogens.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative Proteobacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is a commensal of the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract in several mammals, including humans, with human carriage estimated to be around 3–8%. In hospital patients, the incidence of gastrointestinal colonization can be significantly higher (up to 38%). Beyond its human host, it is also found in environmental reservoirs such as water, sewage, and soil. In a fraction of its hosts, K. pneumoniae causes respiratory, urinary tract, wound, and bloodstream infections. Classically, it has been considered an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen with higher incidence in neonates, the elderly, immunocompromised, and notably patients receiving antibiotic treatment. This view of K. pneumoniae as a purely nosocomial pathogen has, however, been reevaluated with a growing number of infections now also being identified in the community and not solely in patients with comorbidities.

### Finding order in the chaos: Outstanding questions in Klebsiella pneumoniae pathogenesis [^113d9NfR]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae are Gram-negative facultative anaerobes found within host-associated commensal microbiomes. However, they can also cause a wide range of infections that are often difficult to treat. These infections are caused by different pathotypes, referred to as either classical or hypervirulent strains.

Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly with respect to the management of Enterobacterales infections, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend considering administering monotherapy. This should be chosen among the in vitro active old drugs on an individual basis and according to the source of infection. This is applicable for the treatment of non-severe or low-risk carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections, under the consideration of antibiotic stewardship.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^115gXGo1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections, specifically Enterobacterales infections, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as the preferred options for treating uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems serve as alternative options, but avoid using carbapenems if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. As another alternative option, administer a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin, which is recommended for E. coli only.

### Combined comparative genomics and clinical modeling reveals plasmid-encoded genes are independently associated with Klebsiella infection [^112tbt8h]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (hereby referred to as Klebsiella) is comprised of several species capable of causing severe infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections (UTI). The member species are K. pneumoniae, K. variicola, K. quasipneumoniae, K. quasivariicola sp. nov., and K. africana, which are genetically distinct but often clinically indistinguishable. Klebsiella infections are a serious public health concern because they are a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, can harbor multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, and can be hypervirulent.

Antimicrobial-resistant Klebsiella complicates disease treatment, leading to high mortality and healthcare costs, whereas hypervirulent Klebsiella cause unique clinical manifestations such as pyogenic liver abscess and meningitis. Klebsiella colonization is the primary risk factor for disease, with the gut acting as a reservoir for disease-causing Klebsiella strains. Patient variables, including comorbidities and baseline laboratory values, partially explain which patients will progress to infection. Furthermore, the high relative abundance of Klebsiella colonizing the gut is associated with an increased risk of infection in colonized patients.

For hypervirulent Klebsiella, the genes associated with their unique presentations have been well-defined by molecular epidemiology and experimental studies. However, little is known about the Klebsiella genes contained by non-hypervirulent strains, including multi-drug resistant ones.

### Cleocin phosphate (0009–6582) (standalone) [^114E4RKG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A review of experience at the time of writing suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for changes in bowel frequency. Cleocin phosphate products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis, and in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Use of Cleocin phosphate may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Cleocin phosphate should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus but should be infused over at least 10–60 minutes as directed in the dosage and administration section.

Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of the clindamycin half-life has been found. However, studies have postulated that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary, although periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.

Prescribing Cleocin phosphate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a proper indication is not advisable.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically pertaining to general principles, the ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend selecting antibiotic treatment for pan-resistant, carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This involves choosing the antibiotic with the least resistance based on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) relative to the breakpoints, but primarily emphasizes optimal source control.

### Cell-wall-inhibiting antibiotic combinations with activity against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli [^112bxW3W]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of hospital and community-acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens is rapidly limiting the options for effective antibiotic therapy. Systematic studies on combinations of already available antibiotics that could provide an effective treatment against MDR bacteria are needed. We tested combinations of antibiotics that target one important physiological function — peptidoglycan synthesis — at several steps, and studied Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli), for which multidrug resistance associated with ESBL-producing plasmids has become a major problem.

To measure the effectiveness of antibiotics, both alone and in combination, we used checkerboard assays, static antibiotic concentration time-kill assays, and an improved in-vitro kinetic model that simulates human pharmacokinetics of multiple simultaneously administered antibiotics. The target strains included an MDR K. pneumoniae isolate responsible for a recent major hospital outbreak. A double combination (fosfomycin and aztreonam) and a triple combination (fosfomycin, aztreonam, and mecillinam) were both highly effective in reducing bacterial populations in all assays, including the in vitro kinetic model. These combinations were effective even though each of the MDR strains was resistant to aztreonam alone. Our results provide an initial validation of the potential usefulness of a combination of antibiotics targeting peptidoglycan synthesis in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative bacteria.

### Management of Kpc-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections [^1111HbDK]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has become one of the most important contemporary pathogens, especially in endemic areas.

- **Aims**: To provide practical suggestions for physicians managing KPC-KP infections in critically ill patients, based on expert opinions.

- **Sources**: PubMed search for relevant publications related to the management of KPC-KP infections.

- **Contents**: A panel of experts developed a list of 12 questions to be addressed. Due to the lack of high-level evidence, they provided answers based on their knowledge and experience in the field. The panel identified several key aspects to address when managing KPC-KP in critically ill patients, including preventing colonization in the patient, preventing infection in the colonized patient and their contacts, and reducing mortality in the infected patient by rapidly diagnosing the causative agent and promptly adopting the best therapeutic strategy. Related suggestions were based on available observational literature and the experience of panel members.

- **Implications**: Diagnostic technologies could expedite the diagnosis of KPC-KP infections. Combination treatment should be preferred over monotherapy in cases of severe infections. For non-critically ill patients without severe infections, results from randomized clinical trials are needed to weigh the benefits and costs of using combinations rather than monotherapy. Multifaceted infection control interventions are needed.

### β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options [^116vNZeZ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp, is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such as piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Lyszx4-NCA, a new endolysin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity for topical treatment [^114sNJFZ]. Virus Research (2024). Low credibility.

The species Klebsiella pneumoniae, a Gram-negative pathogen, is generally divided into opportunistic, hypervirulent, and multidrug-resistant groups according to its large number of accessory genes of plasmids and chromosomal gene loci. As the second most opportunistic pathogen in nosocomial infections, K. pneumoniae, especially highly virulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) and multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae (MDR-KP), tends to infect critically ill people with defective immune functions, causing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, burn infections, bacteremia, and other complications. Through horizontal gene transfer, the recombination and selection processes can lead to the emergence of multidrug-resistant highly virulent K. pneumoniae (MDR-hvKP), wherein virulence and resistance genes coexist within the same bacteria. The diminishing efficacy of antibiotics against MDR-hvKP has consequently amplified the demand for non-antibiotic alternatives.

### Management of nonfermenting gram-negative infections: A critique of the guidelines [^113a7dPc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

In the present narrative review, we discuss the characteristics and differences between the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines in terms of their recommendations and suggestions for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections.

Treatment of severe infections caused by nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria (NF-GNB) is posing both novel hopes and novel challenges to physicians worldwide, and both the IDSA and the ESCMID have recently updated or released their guidelines or guidance documents. These updates are based on different philosophies and provide recommendations for the treatment of NF-GNB infections. In order to correctly exploit recent advances in the treatment of such infections, IDSA and ESCMID approaches should be viewed as complementary and evolving and should not preclude further revision based on accumulating evidence on the use of novel β-lactams and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

A joint consideration of both philosophies should leave the door open for the wise use of novel agents, ultimately building precious experience on their use that could favorably influence future guidelines revisions.

### Gut colonisation with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae worsens Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection [^111H9hSf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Akkermansiaceae relative abundance increased in mice exposed to clindamycin (median 5.8%) or colonised by CPE (median 9.9%) compared with controls (median 0.1%) and tended to decrease after FMT (median 0.6%). Akkermansia muciniphila colonises the mucus of the gut and is considered to present beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. However, an overabundance of Akkermansia (defined as > 4.8%) was associated with worse overall survival in patients with advanced cancer. Moreover, antibiotic use was associated with a relative dominance of Akkermansia in this cohort. In our model, an increase in Akkermansia may be explained by antibiotic use, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of Akkermansia overabundance on the worse lung outcomes.

### Incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States: A systematic literature review [^115Z7Ysg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite a reported worldwide increase, the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States is unknown. Understanding the incidence and trends of ESBL infections will aid in directing research and prevention efforts.

- **Objective**: To perform a literature review to identify the incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella infections in the United States.
- **Design**: Systematic literature review.
- **Methods**: MEDLINE via Ovid, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for multicenter (≥ 2 sites) US studies published between 2000 and 2015 that evaluated the incidence of ESBL-E. coli or ESBL-Klebsiella infections. We excluded studies that examined resistance rates alone or did not have a denominator that included uninfected patients, such as patient days, device days, number of admissions, or number of discharges. Additionally, articles that were not written in English, contained duplicated data, or pertained to ESBL organisms from food, animals, or the environment were excluded.
- **Results**: Among 51,419 studies examined, 9 were included for review. Incidence rates differed by patient population, time, and ESBL definition and ranged from 0 infections per 100,000 patient days to 16.64 infections per 10,000 discharges, and incidence rates increased over time from 1997 to 2011. Rates were slightly higher for ESBL-Klebsiella infections than for ESBL-E. coli infections.

- **Conclusion**: The incidence of ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-Klebsiella infections in the United States has shown an increase over the years studied.

### Rapid genomic characterization and global surveillance of Klebsiella using Pathogenwatch [^115v7NeG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Increasing constraints around treatment options for multidrug-resistant Klebsiella infections and the accompanying rise in hypervirulence have led to an urgent need for novel drugs. Some have recently reached the market, including ceftazidime-avibactam and plazomicin, but more are needed. There is also renewed interest in the development of a preventative vaccine for K. pneumoniae infections. Potential vaccine candidates include K-antigens belonging to the bacterial capsule polysaccharide (CPS) and O-antigens comprising the outermost part of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, these antigens are variable and may differ across geographic regions or infection types, underlining the need for seroepidemiology.

Pathogen surveillance provides a powerful tool for understanding the evolution and spread of resistant bacteria and defining their clinically relevant features. With more widespread adoption of genomic approaches, there is a growing need for tools that streamline whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses, circumvent the need for user expertise in bioinformatics, and deliver results for public health utility. Here, we describe the Klebsiella scheme of the web application Pathogenwatch, which incorporates community-driven tools together with additional functionality to provide detailed typing and phylogenetic analyses of Klebsiella isolates and the integration of genomic and epidemiological data. We illustrate features of Pathogenwatch by analyzing Klebsiella genomes from four low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) participating in the National Institute for Health Research Global programme.

### Effectiveness of adjunctive clindamycin in β-lactam antibiotic-treated patients with invasive β-haemolytic streptococcal infections in US hospitals: A retrospective multicentre cohort study [^1173e549]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Clindamycin is strongly recommended as an adjunctive treatment to β-lactam antibiotics in patients with severe invasive group A β-haemolytic streptococcal (iGAS) infections. However, there is little evidence of a benefit in the use of clindamycin in humans, and its role, if any, in treating patients with invasive non-group A/B β-haemolytic streptococcal (iNABS) infections is unclear.

- **Methods**: For this retrospective multicentre cohort study, we used a dataset from the Cerner Health Facts database, which contains electronic health-based data from 233 US hospitals. We queried the database for inpatients (no age restriction) admitted to the hospital between 2000 and 2015, with any clinical cultures positive for β-haemolytic streptococcal taxa of interest, and who had received β-lactam antibiotics within 3 days either side of culture sampling. This group of patients was then queried for those who had also received intravenous or oral clindamycin within 3 days either side of culture sampling. Patients were excluded if they had polymicrobial growth or clindamycin non-susceptible isolates, received linezolid, or had missing variable data needed for analysis. Patients were categorised by Lancefield group (iGAS or iNABS); β-lactam antibiotic-treated patients who had received clindamycin were propensity-matched (1:2) to those who did not receive clindamycin separately for iGAS and iNABS cohorts, and logistic regression was then used to account for residual confounding factors. The primary outcome was the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of in-hospital mortality.

### The new antibiotics [^117KEgUa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

It is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of information available on the new antibiotics and difficult to keep abreast of the appropriate indications for each of them. For most patients with community-acquired infections, the first-line agent is usually not one of the newer agents but a standard regimen, or at times, no antibiotic at all. The development of resistance is likely to parallel the extent to which these agents are prescribed. They should be used only when standard treatment fails, when compliance with treatment is a real and serious issue, or when the patient has a real allergic reaction to the standard regimen.

### Combination of pre-adapted bacteriophage therapy and antibiotics for treatment of fracture-related infection due to pandrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae [^114szjty]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The increasing number of cases of fracture-related infection (FRI) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria limits treatment options, and surgical re-interventions are often necessary. Among the MDR nosocomial pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major concern because of its ability to form biofilms, to avoid the immune system, and to acquire genes coding for rapidly evolving enzymes, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases.

Biofilms are structures elaborated by bacterial communities attached to the surface of implants or avascular tissue fragments. Within biofilms, persister cells form a subpopulation of metabolically dormant cells that play a major role in the capacity of biofilms to survive and recover from antibiotic treatment.

The treatment of FRI caused by MDR bacteria is very challenging, as it increasingly requires long-term administration of high doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics, often associated with reversible and irreversible adverse events and low success rates. Phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to treat bacterial infections, is emerging as an additional tool in the fight against MDR bacteria. Usually, phages only infect a subset of strains belonging to a single bacterial species. That is why personalized phage therapy approaches use one or more phages selected from a preprepared bank, based on their lytic activity against the bacterial strains isolated from the patient's infection. When time and resources permit, the selected phages can be pre-adapted or trained.

### Resistance in gram-negative bacteria: Enterobacteriaceae [^114rCWo7]. American Journal of Infection Control (2006). Low credibility.

The emergence and spread of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae are complicating the treatment of serious nosocomial infections and threatening to create species resistant to all currently available agents. Approximately 20% of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections and 31% of Enterobacter spp. infections in intensive care units in the United States now involve strains not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins.

Such resistance in K. pneumoniae to third-generation cephalosporins is typically caused by the acquisition of plasmids containing genes that encode for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and these plasmids often carry other resistance genes as well. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are now relatively common in healthcare settings and often exhibit multidrug resistance. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have now emerged in the community as well. Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae that cause gastroenteritis may also be ESBL producers, which is of relevance when children require treatment for invasive infections.

Resistance of Enterobacter spp. to third-generation cephalosporins is most typically caused by overproduction of AmpC beta-lactamases, and treatment with third-generation cephalosporins may select for AmpC-overproducing mutants. Some Enterobacter cloacae strains are now ESBL and AmpC producers, conferring resistance to both third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. Quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is usually the result of chromosomal mutations leading to alterations in target enzymes or drug accumulation.

### Tobramycin [^114qZV8o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tobramycin is indicated for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below:

- **Septicemia**: This occurs in the neonate, child, and adult, and is caused by P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Klebsiella sp.

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Caused by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp. Enterobacter sp. Serratia sp. E. coli, and S. aureus (both penicillinase and non-penicillinase-producing strains).

- **Serious central nervous system infections (meningitis)**: Caused by susceptible organisms.

- **Intra-abdominal infections**: This includes peritonitis, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella sp., and Enterobacter sp.

- **Skin, bone, and skin-structure infections**: Caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp. E. coli, Klebsiella sp. Enterobacter sp., and S. aureus.

- **Complicated urinary tract infections**: Caused by P. aeruginosa, Proteus sp. (indole-positive and indole-negative), E. coli, Klebsiella sp. Enterobacter sp. Serratia sp. S. aureus, Providencia sp., and Citrobacter sp.

Aminoglycosides, including tobramycin sulfate, are not indicated for uncomplicated initial episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics having less potential toxicity. Tobramycin may be considered in serious staphylococcal infections when penicillin or other potentially less toxic drugs are contraindicated, and when bacterial susceptibility testing and clinical judgment indicate its use.

### Desirability of outcome ranking for the management of antimicrobial therapy (DOOR MAT) reveals improvements in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients from the Veterans Health Administration [^114NaTe7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Reductions in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics are a cornerstone of antimicrobial stewardship. We aim to demonstrate the use of the Desirability of Outcome Ranking Approach for the Management of Antimicrobial Therapy (DOOR MAT) to evaluate the treatment of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections in patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) across a decade.

- **Methods**: Using electronic records, we determined empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments, clinical characteristics, and 30-day mortality of patients with monomicrobial E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections hospitalized in VHA medical centers from 2009 to 2018. Focusing on patients treated with parenteral β-lactams and with available antibiotic susceptibility testing results, we applied a range of DOOR MAT scores that reflect the desirability of antibiotic choices according to spectrum and activity against individual isolates. We report trends in resistance and desirability of empiric and definitive antibiotic treatments.

- **Results**: During the 10-year period analyzed, resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones increased in E. coli but not in K. pneumoniae, while resistance to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam remained unchanged. In 6451 cases analyzed, we observed improvements in DOOR MAT scores consistent with de-escalation. Improvement in the desirability of definitive treatment compared with empiric treatment occurred in 26% of cases, increasing from 16% in 2009 to 34% in 2018. Reductions in overtreatment were sustained and with…

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of cefepime instead of ceftriaxone. This is suggested as an alternative for infections caused by less commonly recovered organisms, such as H. alvei, C. youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica, S. marcescens, Morganella morgannii, or Providencia species. These recommendations are particularly relevant in cases with a high bacterial burden and limited source control, such as endocarditis or CNS infections, even if the organism tests susceptible to ceftriaxone.

### Gut colonisation with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae worsens Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection [^115YKEaJ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We characterized the gut microbiota alterations associated with antibiotic (clindamycin) or CPE exposure. The gut microbiome of control mice and mice exposed to CPE only (without antibiotics) were similar 14 days after CPE exposure in terms of composition and α-diversity (Fig. 1d, e). Mice colonized by CPE (clindamycin and CPE exposure) presented the lowest α-diversity index and significant modifications in microbiota composition.

- **Muribaculaceae abundance**: This family of bacteria within the order Bacteroidales represented 35.5% of the abundance of control mice, 25.9% after CPE exposure alone, 17.4% following administration of clindamycin, and 0.03% in cases of CPE colonization (clindamycin and CPE exposure). Muribaculaceae were significantly decreased in CPE colonized mice compared to mice exposed to clindamycin alone (p < 0.0001) [differential abundance testing by DESeq2 in Supplementary Tables 1, 2].

- **Changes in other bacterial families**: The relative abundance of Akkermansiaceae increased in mice colonized by CPE compared to controls (p < 0.0001), although this was not statistically significant compared to mice exposed to clindamycin (p = 0.56). Gut colonization by CPE was related to a specific dysbiosis characterized by a consistently marked decrease in Muribaculaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group compared to gut dysbiosis associated with clindamycin alone. Relative abundance in Enterobacteriaceae was increased in mice exposed to clindamycin or colonized by CPE compared with controls (Supplementary Table 1).

At the genus level, Escherichia/Shigella were increased in mice ex.

### Prevention and treatment of neonatal infections in facility and community settings of low- and middle-income countries: A descriptive review [^1161SBKE]. Neonatology (2025). Low credibility.

Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)-acquired infections are commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for bloodstream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, as well as Acinetobacter baumannii, responsible for respiratory tract infections and BSIs. In contrast, approximately 60% of community-acquired infections are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., and Escherichia coli, with BSIs predominating.

As efforts to decrease neonatal infections largely depend on the prevention and control of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development and spread, judicious antibiotic use is critical in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) context where there is recognized misuse and overuse. Antimicrobial stewardship is defined as a coherent set of actions that promote the responsible use of antimicrobials. This commonly includes the optimization of antimicrobial selection, dosage, timing of the first dose, dose interval, duration of therapy, or route of administration.

Recent systematic reviews recommend the prioritization of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), alongside infection prevention and control interventions, to effectively and holistically address the newborn mortality burden. Although there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of ASPs and IPC practices in mitigating newborn infection and AMR among the neonatal population in LMIC settings, ASPs are associated with a 21% reduction in antibiotic consumption in pediatric hospitals from LMIC and high-income country settings collectively. In addition, handwashing with soap is associated with a 17% reduction in acute respiratory infections in patients.

### The use of noncarbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase infections [^111dXfjN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The continued rise in infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens is recognized globally as one of the most pressing concerns facing the healthcare community. Carbapenems are widely regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of ESBL-producing infections, even when in vitro activity to other β-lactams has been demonstrated. However, indiscriminate carbapenem use is not without consequence, and carbapenem overuse has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The use of non-carbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of ESBL infections has yielded conflicting results. In this review, we discuss the available data for the use of cephamycins, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of ESBL infections.

### Hospital-acquired infections in the neonatal intensive care unit — Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111UkJpA]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections, including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as neonates. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with ESBL-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options, and increased morbidity and potentially mortality. Hence, prevention through the implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing, and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third-generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.

### Outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and the impact of antimicrobial and adjunctive therapies [^115eTga2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging healthcare-associated pathogen. The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiology and clinical outcomes associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection and to identify risk factors associated with mortality among patients with this type of infection.

The setting for the study was Mount Sinai Hospital, a 1,171-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in New York City. The design involved two matched case-control studies.

- **Methods**: In the first matched case-control study, case patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection were compared with control patients with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae infection. In the second case-control study, patients who survived carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection were compared with those who did not survive, to identify risk factors associated with mortality among these patients.

- **Results**: There were 99 case patients and 99 control patients identified. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection was independently associated with recent organ or stem-cell transplantation (P = 0.008), receipt of mechanical ventilation (P = 0.04), longer length of stay before infection (P = 0.01), and exposure to cephalosporins (P = 0.02) and carbapenems (p < 0.001). Case patients were more likely than control patients to die during hospitalization (48% vs 20%; p < 0.001) and to die from infection (38% vs 12%; p < 0.001). Removal of the focus of infection (i.e. debridement) was independently associated with patient survival (P = 0.002). The timely administration of antibiotics was essential for positive patient outcomes.

### Innate effector systems in primary human macrophages sensitize multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae to antibiotics [^114pCfk1]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Low credibility.

Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae are difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. Thus, alternative strategies to control the growth of MDR Klebsiella are warranted. We hypothesized that activation of innate effector systems could sensitize MDR K. pneumoniae to conventional antibiotics. Human primary macrophages were stimulated with compounds known to activate innate immunity, such as vitamin D3, phenylbutyrate (PBA), and the aroylated phenylenediamine HO53, and then infected with MDR Klebsiella in the presence or absence of antibiotics.

Antibiotics alone were ineffective against MDR Klebsiella in the cellular model, whereas vitamin D3, PBA, and HO53 reduced intracellular growth by up to 70%. The effect was further improved when the innate activators were combined with antibiotics. Vitamin D3- and PBA-induced bacterial killing was dependent on CAMP gene expression, whereas HO53 required the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This was demonstrated in cells where the CYBB gene was silenced and in cells from a patient with reduced ROS production due to a deletion in the CYBB gene and skewed lyonization.

The combination of innate effector activation by vitamin D3, PBA, and HO53 proved effective in sensitizing MDR Klebsiella to conventional antibiotics in a primary human macrophage model. This study provides new evidence for future treatment options for K. pneumoniae.

### Implementing whole-genome sequencing for ongoing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: Exemplifying insights into Klebsiella pneumoniae [^111GcFtk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The promises of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are broad and point toward a revolution in clinical microbiology (e.g. for diagnostics and identification of risk to enhance patient management), enhanced insights into transmission dynamics, and increased infection control. Furthermore, the ability to observe the underlying evolutionary and population dynamics of pathogens promises to enhance our ability to develop, implement, and monitor interventional approaches such as new antimicrobials and vaccines, as well as nontherapeutic interventions. The collation of WGS data combined with relevant phenotypic, clinical, and epidemiological data at local, regional, national, and international levels will lead to a landscape of data-informed pathogen monitoring, which will enhance public health decision-making and have a concomitant impact on control.

The potential for us to observe, learn from, and mitigate the risk from the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of pathogens is an intensive area of research, and there are increasing bodies of evidence to indicate feasibility and potential routes toward policy and stakeholder impact. However, while the promises are vast, the practicalities of WGS implementation for AMR surveillance are challenging and broad, spanning local and international infrastructure (both laboratory and computational), workforce training and retention, and supply chain and reagent availability, to name a few areas. In addition to practical challenges, we are tasked with the challenges of evolution; pathogens continue to evolve, requiring ongoing adaptation of our methods and strategies.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections [^116SVP69]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically in the context of Enterobacterales infections, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of extended-infusion meropenem (or imipenem/cilastatin) for the treatment of infections caused by non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. These are strains exhibiting susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem (minimal inhibitory concentration ≤ 1 mcg/mL) but not susceptible to ertapenem (minimal inhibitory concentration ≥ 1 mcg/mL).

- **Preferred treatment options**: Administer ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, or imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam for the treatment of infections caused by non-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales not exhibiting susceptibility to any carbapenem.

### Oral vs intravenous antibiotics for patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess: A randomized, controlled noninferiority study [^112VpXh3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KLA) is emerging worldwide due to hypermucoviscous strains with a propensity for metastatic infection. Treatment traditionally includes drainage and prolonged intravenous antibiotics. This study aimed to determine whether oral antibiotics were noninferior to continued intravenous antibiotics for KLA.

- **Methods**: This noninferiority, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial recruited hospitalized adults with liver abscess and K. pneumoniae isolated from blood or abscess fluid. Participants had received ≤ 7 days of effective antibiotics at 3 sites in Singapore. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral (ciprofloxacin) or intravenous (ceftriaxone) antibiotics for 28 days. If day 28 clinical response criteria were not met, further oral antibiotics were prescribed until a clinical response was achieved. The primary endpoint was clinical cure assessed at week 12, which included the absence of fever in the preceding week, C-reactive protein < 20 mg/L, and reduction in abscess size. A noninferiority margin of 12% was utilized.

- **Results**: Between November 2013 and October 2017, 152 patients (mean age, 58.7 years; 25.7% women) were recruited following a median of 5 days of effective intravenous antibiotics. A total of 106 (69.7%) underwent abscess drainage; 71 out of 74 (95.9%) randomized to oral antibiotics met the primary endpoint compared with 72 out of 78 (92.3%) randomized to intravenous antibiotics (risk difference, 3.6%; 2-sided 95% confidence interval, -4.9% to 12.8%). Effects were consistent in the per-protocol population. Nonfatal serious adverse events occurred in 12 out of 72 (16.7%) in the intravenous group.
