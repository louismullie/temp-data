## Question

Statin used for lowering triglycerides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about using statins to lower triglycerides, including how effective they are, when they should be used, and how guidelines position them relative to other therapies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the magnitude and mechanism of statin-mediated triglyceride lowering. Then, I should verify how baseline triglyceride level modifies the percent reduction. Next, I will review guideline positions for different triglyceride ranges and ASCVD risk contexts. After that, I need to compare statins with triglyceride-specific agents and clarify when to add them. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight safety and monitoring considerations, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the magnitude of triglyceride reduction with statins. In general, statins lower triglycerides by about 7% to 30% on average, with larger relative reductions in patients who start with higher triglycerides, often in the 20% to 50% range in hypertriglyceridemia, and the effect is dose dependent and greater with high-intensity regimens [^117MxcDT] [^116S5BRa] [^116xmsDG]. Wait, let me verify the dose-response claim; yes, doubling statin dose yields roughly 4% to 7% greater lowering of atherogenic lipids, including triglycerides, though the correlation with triglyceride change is weaker than with LDL-C or non-HDL-C, which aligns with clinical observation that TG responses are more variable [^116xmsDG].

> I need to check which statins and doses are most potent for triglyceride lowering. High-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin produce the largest triglyceride reductions, with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg typically reducing triglycerides by about 15% to 30% and atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg by roughly 20% to 30% in hypertriglyceridemic patients, while simvastatin 20 to 80 mg reduces triglycerides by about 20% to 31% in dedicated hypertriglyceridemia studies [^111r47Xd] [^114rCEFH]. Hold on, I should verify the comparative potency; head-to-head and meta-analytic data show atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are more potent than simvastatin for LDL-C and generally achieve greater triglyceride reductions at comparable doses, which is consistent with clinical experience favoring high-intensity statins when triglycerides are elevated and ASCVD risk is high [^115FF7DV] [^111r47Xd].

> Next, I should review the mechanism to ensure the clinical effect is coherent. Statins upregulate hepatic LDL receptors, which increases clearance of LDL and also clears triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, explaining why triglyceride lowering tracks with LDL-C and non-HDL-C reductions even though the percent change in triglycerides is smaller than for LDL-C [^116JjXLn]. Let me consider whether this translates to remnant cholesterol lowering; yes, detailed lipoprotein profiling shows statins substantially reduce IDL and small VLDL particles, which carry remnant cholesterol and correlate with triglyceride concentration, supporting a biologically plausible mechanism for ASCVD risk reduction beyond LDL-C [^116JjXLn].

> Now, I will examine guideline positions for mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, typically 150 to 499 mg/dL. Both the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommend statins as first-line therapy to reduce ASCVD risk in high-risk patients with triglycerides above about 200 mg/dL, using triglyceride elevation as a risk-enhancing factor that favors statin initiation or intensification when baseline risk is borderline or intermediate [^114rv7WJ] [^1178237d]. I should double-check the ACC 2021 expert consensus; it explicitly notes a 10% to 30% dose-dependent triglyceride reduction with statins and integrates persistent hypertriglyceridemia into risk-based statin decisions, reinforcing this approach [^116S5BRa] [^113ULMDZ].

> For severe hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting triglycerides 500 mg/dL or higher, I initially thought statins should not be used at all because they are inadequate for pancreatitis prevention, but wait, let me verify that nuance. The Endocrine Society advises that statins should not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, yet both AHA/ACC and ESC/EAS allow that in adults 40 to 75 years with triglycerides 500 mg/dL or higher and elevated ASCVD risk, it is reasonable to initiate or intensify statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction while concurrently addressing pancreatitis risk with lifestyle and triglyceride-specific agents, so I should correct my earlier blanket statement and emphasize combination strategy rather than exclusion of statins [^115Xcrpc] [^114rv7WJ] [^1178237d]. Hold on, I should verify the practical implication: yes, guidelines prioritize fibrates or high-dose omega-3s to prevent pancreatitis in this range, with statins added for ASCVD risk reduction when indicated, which is the clinically sound synthesis [^114rv7WJ] [^113VoWBc].

> I will now compare statins with triglyceride-specific therapies to clarify when to add them. Fibrates, prescription omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin achieve larger triglyceride reductions, typically 25% to 45% or more, and are preferred when the primary goal is pancreatitis prevention or when triglycerides remain elevated despite high-intensity statin and lifestyle therapy, particularly in the 200 to 499 mg/dL range where residual ASCVD risk may persist [^11156j6r] [^1119xTS4]. Let me reconsider the outcomes data; while fibrates and omega-3s consistently lower triglycerides, cardiovascular outcome benefits when added to statins have been inconsistent overall, with signals of benefit in subgroups with elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C, which is why guidelines often frame them as adjuncts rather than replacements for statins [^11156j6r] [^116QiLZM].

> Next, I should review combination therapy and safety. In patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia on maximally tolerated statin, adding fenofibrate or icosapent ethyl can be considered, with fenofibrate preferred over gemfibrozil when combined with statins to mitigate myopathy risk, and icosapent ethyl supported by REDUCE-IT for high-risk patients with triglycerides 150 to 499 mg/dL on statins, acknowledging that part of the benefit may be beyond triglyceride lowering alone [^1119xTS4] [^114ifUBt]. I need to ensure I note monitoring; when combining a statin with a fibrate, check liver enzymes and creatinine periodically and counsel on muscle symptoms, and when using omega-3s, monitor for bleeding risk and gastrointestinal effects, tailoring choices to patient comorbidity and preferences [^1119xTS4].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations by triglyceride level and risk. For triglycerides 150 to 499 mg/dL, prioritize lifestyle therapy, address secondary causes, and initiate or intensify statin therapy based on ASCVD risk, expecting about a 20% to 30% triglyceride reduction with high-intensity statins and reassessing non-HDL-C or ApoB to guide further therapy if goals are unmet [^114rv7WJ] [^116S5BRa]. For triglycerides 500 mg/dL or higher, implement a very low-fat diet, avoid alcohol and refined carbohydrates, and add a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 to prevent pancreatitis, while still considering statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction in appropriate patients, with close follow-up of liver and renal function and symptom surveillance [^114rv7WJ] [^1119xTS4]. I should confirm that nonfasting triglycerides are acceptable for screening; yes, nonfasting samples are endorsed by contemporary guidelines, though fasting panels are preferred when triglycerides are severely elevated or when assessing secondary causes and response to therapy [^111FPAsh].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and monitoring are explicit. Statins are generally well tolerated, but I should remind myself to screen for hepatotoxicity, myopathy risk factors, and drug interactions, and to obtain a baseline lipid panel and liver enzymes before initiating therapy, repeating lipids 4 to 12 weeks after changes and then every 3 to 12 months to assess adherence and efficacy, adjusting therapy to maximize atherogenic cholesterol lowering while balancing tolerability and patient preferences [^114GR2PC] [^117MxcDT]. Hold on, I should verify the LDL-C percentage reduction targets; yes, high-intensity statins are expected to lower LDL-C by 50% or more, and this expectation can be used to gauge whether the chosen regimen is achieving an evidence-based magnitude of benefit in risk reduction [^114GR2PC].

---

Statins are **first-line therapy** for moderate hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) [^114rv7WJ], lowering triglycerides by about 10–30% [^116S5BRa] and reducing ASCVD risk [^11156j6r]. They are **not sufficient alone** for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) [^115Xcrpc] because they do not reliably prevent pancreatitis; fibrates or omega-3s are required for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk reduction [^113VoWBc]. Statins are most appropriate when ASCVD risk is elevated [^1178237d] or when triglycerides are moderately elevated with concomitant LDL-C elevation [^115Xcrpc].

---

## Mechanism of triglyceride lowering by statins

Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, **upregulating LDL receptors** [^116JjXLn] and increasing clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, chylomicrons) [^116JjXLn]. This produces a modest, dose-dependent triglyceride reduction of about 10–30% [^116S5BRa], with larger effects in hypertriglyceridemia [^117MxcDT].

---

## Clinical evidence for triglyceride lowering

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show **statins reduce triglycerides** by 10–30% [^116S5BRa], with greater reductions at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline triglycerides [^116xmsDG]:

- **VOYAGER meta-analysis**: In patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dL, rosuvastatin 10–40 mg reduced TG by 15–31% [^111r47Xd].
- **Simvastatin trials**: 20–80 mg reduced TG by 20–31% in hypertriglyceridemia [^114rCEFH].
- **Atorvastatin trials**: 10–80 mg reduced TG by about 20–30% in hypertriglyceridemia [^115Xcrpc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for statins in hypertriglyceridemia** |
|-|-|
| AHA/ACC 2018 | - First-line for moderate hypertriglyceridemia (150–499 mg/dL) [^notfound] when ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% [^114rv7WJ] <br/> - Consider initiation/intensification in severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) if ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% [^114rv7WJ] |
| ESC/EAS 2019 | - First-line for high-risk patients with TG > 200 mg/dL [^1178237d] to reduce ASCVD risk [^112Z18YD] |
| Endocrine Society 2012 | - Do not use statins as monotherapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 1000 mg/dL) [^115Xcrpc] <br/> - Consider for moderate hypertriglyceridemia when ASCVD risk modification is indicated [^113cwvDs] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Severity of hypertriglyceridemia**: Statins are insufficient for severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 500 mg/dL) [^115Xcrpc] and do not reliably prevent pancreatitis; fibrates or omega-3s are required [^113VoWBc].
- **Individual variability**: Response varies with baseline lipids, genetics, and adherence [^116xmsDG].
- **Safety profile**: Generally well tolerated; monitor for myopathy and hepatotoxicity, especially with high doses or combinations [^115Xcrpc].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

When statins are insufficient or contraindicated, **consider**:

- **Fibrates**: Lower TG by 30–50% [^11156j6r]; first-line for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^113VoWBc] or when TG remain elevated despite statins [^1135ETkY].
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Lower TG by 20–45% [^11156j6r]; useful adjuncts, especially for pancreatitis risk reduction [^111AU7b3].
- **Niacin**: Effective but limited by side effects; reserved for select cases [^115RbqU7].

---

## Clinical outcomes and cardiovascular risk reduction

Statins reduce ASCVD events in patients with elevated triglycerides, largely via LDL-C lowering and modest TG reduction [^11156j6r]. Residual risk persists in some patients, prompting use of add-on therapies (e.g. omega-3s) in high-risk settings [^114ifUBt].

---

Statins are **effective for moderate hypertriglyceridemia** [^114rv7WJ], providing a 10–30% TG reduction and ASCVD risk benefit [^116S5BRa]. They are not adequate for severe hypertriglyceridemia [^115Xcrpc], where fibrates or omega-3s are required to prevent pancreatitis [^113VoWBc]. Therapy should be individualized based on TG level, ASCVD risk, and patient factors [^116S5BRa].

Dyslipidemia is common and is associated with the highest population-attributable risk for cardiovascular disease. Of various cardiovascular preventive therapies, the evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting the importance of aggressive lipid lowering is the most robust, particularly for statins. Despite the use of proven therapies, cardiovascular disease event rates remain relatively high, underpinning the development of novel therapies. In addition to testing new drugs to reduce low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, there has been a major focus on treatments that can favorably influence high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. This review provides an overview of the important relationship between lipids and cardiovascular disease, the lipid-modifying therapeutic approaches to reducing cardiovascular disease, new guidelines and recommendations, and the challenges ahead for the treatment of dyslipidemia, particularly whether statins will remain at the forefront of recommended therapies.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^112k2swe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^116KNohX]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Xcrpc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hypertriglyceridemia — statin recommendation and evidence: "We recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. However, statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk (1/⊕⊕○○)". Statins have a modest triglyceride-lowering effect, typically about 10–15%, with high-dose regimens such as atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg lowering plasma triglyceride by 25–30%. Statin monotherapy should not be first-line therapy in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), while addition of statins can be considered to reduce cardiovascular risk in mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl and < 1000 mg/dl) with elevated non-HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects occur in about 5–10% of patients, muscle symptoms occur in about 10% of patients, and conditions predisposing to severe myopathy include advanced age, renal failure, polypharmacy, and acute illness.

### Dyslipidaemia [^1127AqH7]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The lowering of serum cholesterol is increasingly recognised as essential in the prevention of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic disease. The success of statin trials and the need to deploy these drugs effectively in the population has led increasingly to the identification of many people whose serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol require clinical assessment, and frequently treatment. Lipid disorders are mainly straightforward, but some are complex or resistant to simple treatment strategies. I have reviewed the clinical manifestations of disordered lipid metabolism (dyslipidaemia) and its management.

### Triglycerides and cardiovascular disease [^115cHtkE]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

After the introduction of statins, clinical emphasis first focussed on LDL cholesterol-lowering, then on the potential for raising HDL cholesterol, with less focus on lowering triglycerides. However, the understanding from genetic studies and negative results from randomised trials that low HDL cholesterol might not cause cardiovascular disease as originally thought has now generated renewed interest in raised concentrations of triglycerides. This renewed interest has also been driven by epidemiological and genetic evidence supporting raised triglycerides, remnant cholesterol, or triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as an additional cause of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Triglycerides can be measured in the non-fasting or fasting states, with concentrations of 2–10 mmol/L conferring increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and concentrations greater than 10 mmol/L conferring increased risk of acute pancreatitis and possibly cardiovascular disease. Although randomised trials showing cardiovascular benefit of triglyceride reduction are scarce, new triglyceride-lowering drugs are being developed, and large-scale trials have been initiated that will hopefully provide conclusive evidence as to whether lowering triglycerides reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### National Lipid Association scientific statement on the use of icosapent ethyl in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high or very-high ASCVD risk [^112qffre]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD risk in statin-treated patients — subgroup findings indicate potential benefit of TG-lowering therapies. Several investigations have identified hypertriglyceridemia as a marker of increased residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in statin-treated patients, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of triglyceride (TG)-lowering treatments that did not enroll based on hypertriglyceridemia did not achieve their primary endpoints of coronary heart disease (CHD) or ASCVD risk reduction; however, a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs with subgroup analyses reported pooled estimates for relative risk reduction of 12% (95% CI: 5%–18%) overall, 18% (95% CI: 9%–27%) for subgroups with elevated TG, and 29% (95% CI: 19%–37%) for subgroups with elevated TG plus low HDL-C.

### A dose-specific meta-analysis of lipid changes in randomized controlled trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin [^115FF7DV]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The available statins exhibit differences in the potency with which they alter serum lipid levels.

Objective

Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the relative potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin (the 2 most commonly prescribed statins) across all possible dose combinations in terms of changes in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects were searched for randomized, head-to-head trials of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients aged ≥ 18 years with elevated levels of serum TC and LDL-C. Reference lists of the identified articles, letters, and editorials also were reviewed. The manufacturers of atorvastatin and simvastatin products were contacted for relevant unpublished data. All studies were reviewed and rated for quality by 2 independent reviewers. The maximum quality score was 4 points; trials with a score of < 2 points were considered to be of poor quality and were excluded from analysis. Dose comparisons were abstracted in pairs from each trial. Meta-analyses were conducted on the fixed-dose pairs for each lipid parameter. Weighted mean differences in the change in TC, LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C were estimated using the Der Simonian and Laird random-effects model.

Results

Seventeen published trials and 1 unpublished study were included in the meta-analyses. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions in TC, LDL-C, and TG in the majority of dose comparisons with simvastatin. The potency of atorvastatin and simvastatin was comparable at dose ratios between 1:2 and 1:4. Higher doses of simvastatin were more effective in increasing HDL-C levels than atorvastatin, with no apparent dose-equivalence point. The HDL-C advantage of simvastatin was greatest when simvastatin 80 mg was compared with atorvastatin 80 mg (weighted mean difference, -4.35%; 95% CI, -5.64 to -3.08, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

In these meta-analyses, atorvastatin was 2 to 4 times as potent as simvastatin in reducing TC, LDL-C, and TG, indicating that the dose equivalence of atorvastatin and simvastatin lay between 1:2 and 1:4. In contrast, simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in increasing HDL-C, but without any indication of a point of dose equivalence.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^117MxcDT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction — For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk. Statins have been shown to reduce serum LDL-C levels by 18% to 55%, non–HDL-C by 15% to 51%, and triglycerides by 7% to 30% (in hypertriglyceridemia the reduction is typically by 20% to 50%, particularly with high-potency statins) and increase HDL-C by 5% to 15%. A large body of RCT evidence demonstrates that statins are safe and generally well tolerated by most patients and that they decrease risk for ASCVD events in both primary and secondary prevention in amounts proportional to their cholesterol lowering, and for these reasons, they are considered to be first-line drug treatment in both primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — statin therapy notes that although commonly recognized for their impact on LDL-C, statins provide a 10% to 30% dose-dependent reduction in triglycerides in patients with elevated triglyceride levels; patients with elevated triglycerides are at increased risk of ASCVD events and can achieve ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy, and an analysis of the 4S trial stratified 1,003 patients by quartile of triglyceride and HDL-C levels.

### The ebbs and flows in the development of cholesterol-lowering drugs: prospects for the future [^1113s6E5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Statins are the mainstay of treatment but do not address all aspects of CVD risk. Other lipid-lowering therapies are available but are less effective than statins. New therapies to lower low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by as much as statins, to reduce triglycerides (TGs), and to modify the metabolism of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are in development.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of ASCVD risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113ULMDZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk-based therapies identify persistently elevated triglycerides (nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dl) as a risk-enhancing factor and outline statin thresholds and effects. In primary prevention patients without diabetes mellitus or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5% to < 20%, the presence of persistent hypertriglyceridemia supports a decision to initiate at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, and for 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% to < 7.5% patient-clinician discussion is recommended regarding initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. Statins provide a 10% to 30% dose-dependent reduction in triglycerides in patients with elevated triglyceride levels; similarly, statin therapy should be initiated or maximized if such patients have a history of diabetes mellitus or ASCVD, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated at ≥ 500 to 999 mg/dL following initiation of statin therapy, the clinician should consider intensification and monitor adherence to therapy.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of ASCVD risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1151dt2R]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia in primary prevention — the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline recommended the use of elevated triglycerides as a "risk-enhancing factor" in primary ASCVD prevention and recommended optimizing diet and lifestyle first, ruling out secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and considering statin therapy in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and elevated 10-year ASCVD risk; in those with severe elevation (triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially ≥ 1,000 mg/dL), primary triglyceride lowering was recommended as a reasonable option to reduce pancreatitis risk, and studies have shown that despite statin therapy, ASCVD event rates remain high in patients with elevated triglycerides.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1135ETkY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy selection by triglyceride level — states that when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) (fibric acids, high-dose [2–4 g/d] long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, or nicotinic acid) should be the first-line agent if the fasting triglyceride concentration is ≥ 1000 mg/dL. For patients with triglycerides of 500 to 999 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin (if no history of pancreatitis) may be reasonable first-line drug options. For patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), a statin will generally be first-line drug therapy, and if maximum tolerated statin therapy does not lower non–HDL-C below goal levels in patients with triglycerides 200 to 499 mg/dL, adding an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides and VLDL-C may help to achieve atherogenic cholesterol goals. Subgroup analyses from cardiovascular outcome studies provide suggestive evidence of reduced ASCVD event risk with the addition of a triglyceride-lowering agent to statin therapy, particularly in patients with the combination of elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes? [^11654srq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients remains high, despite modern effective therapies, such as statins. Some of the risk may be attributed to other components of the metabolic dyslipidemia, namely high TG level, low HDL cholesterol level, and small dense LDL. Current attempts at controlling this form of dyslipidemia have ended with either conflicting or entirely disappointing results. We are in dire need of additional therapeutic options for these high-risk patients. Ongoing trials with currently available therapies are expected to provide some much-needed answers, and new therapies are eagerly expected.

### Statin therapy – what now? [^113KDAgv]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

In England, only 30% of patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and raised serum lipids, and fewer than 4% of individuals eligible for primary prevention, receive lipid-lowering therapy. Target total cholesterol concentrations are achieved in fewer than 50% of patients who do receive such treatment. Here, we review the use of statin therapy in the prevention of CHD events.

### Triglycerides: a reappraisal [^1131cjfw]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated cholesterol levels are clearly independently associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Another class of lipid particles, triglycerides, is also abundant in the human body and has been found in atherosclerotic plaques. Recent observational studies have demonstrated an association between elevated triglyceride levels and increased risk for future cardiovascular events. With this knowledge and the discovery of effective agents to lower triglyceride levels, the management of triglycerides is currently undergoing a renaissance. Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been completed to date, proving that lowering triglycerides will reduce cardiovascular events. In this review we highlight some of the evidence that led to this stage and discuss the current data on pharmacologic intervention of triglyceride levels and the effect on clinical outcomes. Lastly, we want to give the reader insight on what the most recent lipid guidelines state about clinical triglyceride management, mention new pharmacological agents, and highlight the clinical evidence for safe and effective lowering of triglycerides levels with life style modification.

### Pravastatin for lowering lipids [^116dpDxX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A detailed summary and meta-analysis of the dose-related effect of pravastatin on lipids is not available.

Objectives

Primary objective To assess the pharmacology of pravastatin by characterizing the dose-related effect and variability of the effect of pravastatin on the surrogate marker: low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol). The effect of pravastatin on morbidity and mortality is not the objective of this systematic review. Secondary objectives
- To assess the dose-related effect and variability of effect of pravastatin on the following surrogate markers: total cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol); and triglycerides.
- To assess the effect of pravastatin on withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to September 2021: CENTRAL (2021, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Bireme LILACS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of pravastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks in participants of any age with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included, and extracted data. We entered lipid data from placebo-controlled trials into Review Manager 5 as continuous data and withdrawal due to adverse effects (WDAEs) data as dichotomous data. We searched for WDAEs information from all trials. We assessed all trials using Cochrane's risk of bias tool under the categories of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other potential biases.

Main Results

Sixty-four RCTs evaluated the dose-related efficacy of pravastatin in 9771 participants. The participants were of any age, with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease, and pravastatin effects were studied within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. Log dose-response data over the doses of 5 mg to 160 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, and a weak linear dose-related effect on blood triglycerides. There was no dose-related effect of pravastatin on blood HDL cholesterol. Pravastatin 10 mg/day to 80 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 21.7% to 31.9%, total cholesterol by 16.1% to 23.3%, and triglycerides by 5.8% to 20.0%. The certainty of evidence for these effects was judged to be moderate to high. For every two-fold dose increase there was a 3.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2 to 4.6) decrease in blood LDL cholesterol. This represented a dose-response slope that was less than the other studied statins: atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin and cerivastatin. From other systematic reviews we conducted on statins for its effect to reduce LDL cholesterol, pravastatin is similar to fluvastatin, but has a decreased effect compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin and cerivastatin. The effect of pravastatin compared to placebo on WADES has a risk ratio (RR) of 0.81 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.03). The certainty of evidence was judged to be very low.

Authors' Conclusions

Pravastatin lowers blood total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in a dose-dependent linear fashion. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with pravastatin because of the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 48.4% of the randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Figure 2
Overview of Triglyceride Management Adapted From the 2022 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on the Management of ASCVD Risk Reduction in Patients With Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia

Used with permission of the publisher. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; TG = triglycerides.

Although this patient's triglycerides are the primary concern, his LDL-C is well below 100 mg/dL, which may reduce the urgency for statin therapy. However, if triglycerides remain elevated and the patient's ASCVD risk increases (ie, a 10-year risk ≥ 5% or a diagnosis of diabetes), statin therapy should be initiated or intensified and would likely provide the greatest benefit for ASCVD risk reduction. In such cases, statins are recommended to target appropriate LDL-C or non-HDL-C thresholds, as they offer protection against both cardiovascular events and further elevations in triglycerides. In the setting of hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C calculations may be less accurate (especially if the older Friedewald calculation is used), and a more accurate assessment of atherogenic risk may require the usage of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB to help decide on the intensity of lipid lowering. In these cases, it is important to emphasize the role of non-HDL-C and/or ApoB as elevations in either should prompt consideration of statin therapy prior to triglyceride-specific lowering agents such as omega-3 fatty acids or fibrates.

### Patients with metabolic syndrome benefit from statin… [^11733F5y]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular metabolic syndrome is a combination of risk factors that greatly increases the likelihood of diabetes. Diabetes is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease, with cardiovascular disease being the most common cause of death in persons with diabetes. This risk for cardiovascular disease begins before diabetes is diagnosed, during a preceding period of increased insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance. Sowers reviews the usefulness of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in patients with metabolic syndrome. The Health Protection Study looked at the effect of lowering lipids in a large cohort of persons with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. After five years of treatment with simvastatin in a dosage of 40 mg, there was a significant decrease in first major coronary vascular events in persons with no history of coronary disease and persons with prior coronary disease.

These results have since been confirmed with pravastatin in a dosage of 40 mg and gemfibrozil in a dosage of 1, 200 mg per day. The dyslipidemia of persons with metabolic syndrome or diabetes characteristically demonstrates small low-density lipoprotein particles, high triglyceride levels, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Statin therapy reduces LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may increase HDL cholesterol levels slightly, but the benefits of statins seem to be independent of the change in lipid components, because improved outcomes with statin therapy may be noted as soon as four months after initiation of therapy. Statins may have a direct positive effect on vascular walls through an improvement of endothelial function, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic actions, and attenuation of atherogenesis. Simvastatin increases endothelial nitric oxide production and improves nitric oxide–dependent vasorelaxation.

Statins also reduce plasma levels of C-reactive protein and cytokines independently of reduction in LDL cholesterol levels and increase levels of natural antioxidants. Statins decrease fibrinogen levels, decrease blood viscosity, and reduce platelet aggregation and adhesion. The author concludes that statins have direct beneficial effects on vasculature independent of LDL cholesterol lowering. These effects likely contribute to the decrease in cardiovascular disease and strokes in persons with diabetes who are treated with statins.

### From lipids to inflammation: new approaches to reducing atherosclerotic risk [^1167M5YG]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

The introduction of statins ≈ 30 years ago ushered in the era of lipid lowering as the most effective way to reduce risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Nonetheless, residual risk remains high, and statin intolerance is frequently encountered in clinical practice. After a long dry period, the field of therapeutics targeted to lipids and atherosclerosis has entered a renaissance. Moreover, the demonstration of clinical benefits from the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy in subjects with acute coronary syndromes has renewed the enthusiasm for the cholesterol hypothesis and the hope that additional agents that lower low-density lipoprotein will decrease risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Drugs in the orphan disease category are now available for patients with the most extreme hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, discovery and rapid translation of a novel biological pathway has given rise to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-9 inhibitors. Trials of niacin added to statin have failed to demonstrate cardiac benefits, and 3 cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors have also failed to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, despite producing substantial increases in HDL levels. Although the utility of triglyceride-lowering therapies remains uncertain, 2 large clinical trials are testing the influence of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on atherosclerotic events in hypertriglyceridemia. Novel antisense therapies targeting apolipoprotein C-III (for triglyceride reduction) and apo(a) (for lipoprotein(a) reduction) are showing a promising trajectory. Finally, 2 large clinical trials are formally putting the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis to the test and may open a new avenue for cardiovascular disease risk reduction.

### Effects of morning vs evening statin administration on lipid profile: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VGsb3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence about the optimal time of day at which to administer statins is lacking.

Objective

The objective of this study is to synthesize evidence about effects of morning vs evening statin administration on lipid profile.

Methods

We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Embase databases (from inception up to July 24, 2016) to identify the relevant studies. Mean differences (MDs) between the change scores in lipid parameters were pooled using a fixed-effect model.

Results

Eleven articles with 1034 participants were eligible for the analysis. The pooled analysis comparing effects of morning vs evening administration of statins on plasma total cholesterol (TC; P = 0.10), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.90), and triglycerides (P = 0.45) was not statistically significant. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering was statistically greater in the evening-dose group (MD: 3.24 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.23–5.25, P = 0.002). Subgroup analysis according to statin half-lives showed that evening dose of statins was significantly superior to morning dose for lowering LDL-C in case of both short and long half-life statins (MD: 9.68 mg/dL, 95% CI: 3.32–16.03, P = 0.003 and MD: 2.53 mg/dL, 95% CI: 0.41–4.64, P = 0.02, respectively) and also for TC reduction in case of short half-life statins only (P = 0.0005).

Conclusions

LDL-C and TC lowering was significantly greater in the evening dose than in the morning dose in case of short-acting statins. Besides slight but significant effect on LDL-C, the efficacy of long-acting statins was equivalent for both regimens. Therefore, long-acting statins should be given at a time that will best aid compliance. Short-acting statins should be given in the evening.

### Implications for REDUCE IT in clinical practice [^112Z5fEV]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy is effective in primary and secondary prevention, but substantial residual risk remains on statin treatment, especially among high risk and very high risk patients. Add-on therapy with ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin /kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors provides additional risk reduction through further reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Elevated triglycerides/triglyceride rich lipoproteins contribute to atherogenesis and to the residual risk on statin therapy. Addition of icosapent ethyl to statins has recently been shown to markedly lower risk of ASCVD events in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and high risk patients with type II diabetes mellitus. These data are discussed in the context of current guidelines and synthesized in a decision pathway to guide combination lipid-lowering therapy in patients at high ASCVD risk.

### Atorvastatin more effective in reducing LDL cholesterol… [^111sXwVr]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Multiple statin formulations are available that effectively lower cholesterol levels. Determining which statin preparation to prescribe depends on several factors, including cost, adverse effects, and efficacy. All four treatment groups had significant reductions in LDL cholesterol from baseline. The decrease was significantly greater with 10 mg of atorvastatin than with 20 mg of simvastatin at both the starting dosages and the maximal dosages, and more patients taking atorvastatin achieved the LDL cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program at six weeks. All treatment groups also showed significant decreases at week 6 in total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, and VLDL cholesterol levels, as well as increases in HDL cholesterol.

Adverse effects were uncommon and generally mild to moderate, with some patients demonstrating increases in creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransferase, or aspartate aminotransferase levels. No cases of myositis occurred in any participant. The authors conclude that although all treatments improved dyslipidemia, treatment reductions of LDL cholesterol within six weeks of treatment initiation were greater with atorvastatin than with simvastatin among this population of patients. Atorvastatin, therefore, provided greater efficacy in achieving NCEP goals for LDL cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin also provided a greater reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, and VLDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels increased with all treatments, but high-dose simvastatin demonstrated a significantly greater HDL effect.

editor's note: Although the study reviewed in the Karalis article was financed by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of atorvastatin, there is support for its findings in other randomized controlled trials. Andrews and colleagues found that the increased reduction in LDL-cholesterol achieved early in therapy with atorvastatin may increase the likelihood of achieving the goals recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program. Pravastatin has the least influence on these hepatic enzyme systems. Other statin properties that may vary among different drugs in the class include the ability to affect atherosclerotic plaque composition, endothelial function, platelet and clotting factors, and immune functioning. Pravastatin is the only agent in the group demonstrated to significantly reduce platelet-thrombus formation and fibrinogen levels. As we learn more, there may be multiple ways in which the different statin preparations distinguish themselves. — r. s.

### Implications of recent clinical trials for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III guidelines [^116LHhiW]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is < 100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.

### Statins: a brief summary [^116pxaDQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Despite a totality of evidence indicating clear benefits of statin therapy in secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a large number of additional trials are currently planned or in progress to help us better understand, treat, and prevent CVD. Both monotherapy and combination statin regimens are being studied to optimize treatment of the total patient and to assess mechanisms and benefits of various components of the total lipid profile.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Simvastatin and atorvastatin effects on HDL and apo A-I… [^1177XfrF]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

High-density lipoprotein levels are inversely related to the risk of coronary heart disease. Modest increases in HDL cholesterol and reductions in triglycerides have been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of CHD. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy- 3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, known to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, also raise levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipo-protein A-I, the major protein constituent of HDL. Kastelein reports preliminary results after the first 12 weeks of a 36-week, multicenter, double-blind, dose-titration study to evaluate the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on HDL cholesterol and apo A-I levels. Patients with LDL cholesterol levels greater than 160 mg per dL and triglyceride levels less than 350 mg per dL were randomized to receive simvastatin or atorvastatin for 36 weeks.

During the initial 12 weeks of the study, patients taking simvastatin received 40 mg per day for the first six weeks and 80 mg per day for the next six weeks; patients randomized to atorvastatin received 20 mg per day for the first six weeks followed by 40 mg for the next six weeks. This difference in effect appears true for men and women and in patients with low-versus high-baseline HDL cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides more than simvastatin, but the difference was small relative to the total reductions produced by both statins. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The authors conclude that when comparing simvastatin with atorvastatin, simvastatin produced significantly greater increases in HDL cholesterol and apo A-I levels than atorvastatin. These differences were greater at the higher dose comparison between the two drugs.

Although the relationship of LDL cholesterol and CHD risk is clear, the clinical significance of the variable effect of simvastatin and atorvastatin on HDL and apo A-I is less certain.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin [^117LHUmM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins and is currently widely prescribed. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of rosuvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of rosuvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in participants with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. Secondary objectives To quantify the variability of the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin. To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in the randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 10 of 12, 2014 in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 44), Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 5 November 2014) and BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to 31 October 2014). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of rosuvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. WDAEs information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

One-hundred and eight trials (18 placebo-controlled and 90 before-and-after) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of rosuvastatin in 19,596 participants. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day caused LDL-cholesterol decreases of 46% to 55%, when all the trials were combined using the generic inverse variance method. The quality of evidence for these effects is high. Log dose-response data over doses of 1 to 80 mg, revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. When compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was about three-fold more potent at reducing LDL-cholesterol. There was no dose-related effect of rosuvastatin on blood HDL-cholesterol, but overall, rosuvastatin increased HDL by 7%. There is a high risk of bias for the trials in this review, which would affect WDAEs, but unlikely to affect the lipid measurements. WDAEs were not statistically different between rosuvastatin and placebo in 10 of 18 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.47).

Authors' Conclusions

The total blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of rosuvastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Rosuvastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with atorvastatin, this represents a three-fold greater potency. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with rosuvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 44% of the placebo-controlled trials.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^113HXMy1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy — A moderate- or high-intensity statin should be first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, unless contraindicated; if goal not achieved, intensify atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy or refer to a lipid specialist. In a patient with very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), a triglyceride-lowering drug may be considered for the first-line use to prevent pancreatitis. Monitor response and adherence to therapy every 4–12 months, and in most cases goal levels should be achieved in approximately 6 months.

### Trials in "True" dyslipidemic patients are urged to reconsider comprehensive lipid management as a means to reduce residual cardiovascular risk [^113XzRaG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Who should promote and perform pragmatic cardiovascular outcome lipid trials?

The purpose of healthcare stakeholders of evolving toward personalized evidence‐based medicine calls for pragmatism in future lipid trials, in order to inform physicians and patients about the real cost‐effectiveness of a treatment in certain candidates for the treatment. The design of some new studies suggests that things are hopefully starting to move in this direction.

REDUCE‐IT 60 was aimed to evaluate the efficacy in reducing residual cardiovascular risk of a 4 g daily dose of eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester in patients at elevated cardiovascular risk on LDL‐C–lowering drugs with fairly well‐controlled LDL‐C levels (median 74 mg/dL) and baseline fasting TG levels between 150 and 500 mg/dL (median 216 mg/dL). Even though the effect of the therapy on TG levels was mild (18.3%; −39.0 mg per deciliter), the treatment produced, after 5 years, a 25% reduction of the primary cardiovascular end point. To what extent these effects are the result of TG lowering is not clear, as omega‐3 have many other putative cardioprotective pleiotropic effects. Yet, the trial pragmatically tested a coherent hypothesis in candidates suitable for the intervention in the real‐world clinical practice, responding to a frequent question of physicians: can we reduce residual risk in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia through omega‐3 fatty acids?

Propitiously, STRENGTH, 61 another pragmatic randomized placebo‐controlled trial with omega‐3 fatty acids in statin‐treated patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular events, with well‐controlled LDL‐C, hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 180 to < 500 mg/dL), and low levels of HDL‐C (< 42 mg/dL in men or < 47 mg/dL in women) is ongoing, and the results are awaited by the end of 2019.

Another example of a pragmatic TG‐lowering trial in high‐risk patients is the ongoing PROMINENT trial, 62 a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled cardiovascular outcome trial with the novel fibrate compound Pemafibrate. The PROMINENT trial plans to recruit high‐risk patients with diabetes with and without cardiovascular disease, and, for the first time in fibrate outcome trials, all the patients will have TGs > 200 mg/dL and low HDL‐C despite best evidence‐based treatment, including high‐intensity statin therapy. The results of the PROMINENT trial are awaited by 2022.

### A VOYAGER meta-analysis of the impact of statin therapy on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^111r47Xd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the indiVidual patient meta-analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p < 0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C reduction was substantial and dependent on the choice and dose of statin. TG reduction was numerically less than for LDL-C, and additional TG-lowering therapy may be considered to further reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

### Association between triglyceride lowering and reduction of cardiovascular risk across multiple lipid-lowering therapeutic classes: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Ca6v9]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials of therapies that primarily lowered triglycerides have not consistently shown reductions in cardiovascular events.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and trial-level meta-regression analysis of 3 classes of lipid-lowering therapies that reduce triglycerides to a greater extent than they do low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): fibrates, niacin, and marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids. Key inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial that reported major vascular events. We also incorporated data from a previous meta-regression of 25 statin trials. The main outcome measure was the risk ratio (RR) for major vascular events associated with absolute reductions in lipid parameters.

Results

A total of 197270 participants from 24 trials of nonstatin therapy with 25218 major vascular events and 177088 participants from 25 trials of statin therapy with 20962 major vascular events were included, for a total of 374358 patients and 46180 major cardiovascular events. Starting with non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a surrogate for very-low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins, the RR per 1-mmol/L reduction in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76–0.82; P < 0.0001; 0.78 per 40 mg/dL). In a multivariable meta-regression model that included terms for both LDL-C and triglyceride (surrogates for low-density lipoproteins and very-low-density lipoproteins, respectively), the RR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85; P < 0.0001) per 1-mmol/L (0.79 per 40 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.94; P = 0.0026) per 1-mmol/L (0.92 per 40 mg/dL) reduction in triglycerides. REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial) was a significant outlier and strongly influential trial in the meta-regression. When removed, the RRs became 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76–0.83; P < 0.0001) per 1-mmol/L (0.78 per 40 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81–1.006; P = 0.06) per 1-mmol/L (0.96 per 40 mg/dL) reduction in triglycerides. In regard to omega-3 dose, each 1 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid administered was associated with a 7% relative risk reduction in major vascular events (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91–0.95]; P < 0.0001), whereas there was no significant association between the dose of docosahexaenoic acid and the relative risk reduction in major vascular events (RR 0.96 [95% CI, 0.89–1.03]).

Conclusions

In randomized controlled trials, triglyceride lowering is associated with a lower risk of major vascular events, even after adjustment for LDL-C lowering, although the effect is less than that for LDL-C and attenuated when REDUCE-IT is excluded. Furthermore, the benefits of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids, particularly high-dose eicosapentaenoic acid, appear to exceed their lipid-lowering effects.

### Unmet need for adjunctive Dyslipidemia Therapy in hypertriglyceridemia management [^115X4MUZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the important role of high-intensity statins in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in secondary and primary prevention, substantial residual risk persists, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Considerable attention is currently directed to the role that elevated triglycerides (TGs) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels play as important mediators of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, which is further strongly supported by genetic linkage studies. Previous trials with fibrates, niacin, and most cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors that targeted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol raising, and/or TG lowering, have failed to show conclusive evidence of incremental event reduction after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were "optimally controlled" with statins. Although omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in lowering TG levels and may have pleiotropic effects such as reducing plaque instability and proinflammatory mediators of atherogenesis, clinical outcomes data are currently lacking. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials of TG-lowering strategies with an optimal dosage of omega-3 fatty acids are nearing completion.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^111FPAsh]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Guidance for clinical management

The EAS Consensus Panel believes that targeting a high triglyceride/low HDL-C phenotype is likely to be beneficial in patients with CVD or at high risk of CVD, especially those with cardiometabolic abnormalities. The therapeutic needs of these patients are likely to exceed LDL-C lowering by statin monotherapy. The recommended steps for managing these patients after achieving LDL-C goal, as defined by the most recent European guidelines, are summarized in Figure 6. The Panel proposes triglycerides as a marker for TRL and their remnants. Elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, consistent with European guidelines) and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) are triggers for considering further treatment in both men and women. HDL-C levels < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men and < 1.2 mmol/L (45 mg/dL) in women are also considered a CV risk factor in current European guidelines. It is noteworthy that in ACCORD Lipid, a cutoff for triglycerides of ≥ 2.3 mmol/L identified statin-treated patients at high CV risk, who may respond to fibrates. For simplicity and convenience, measurement of non-fasting plasma lipids is recommended, supported by data from the ERFC, but care should be taken when interpreting triglyceride levels in individuals who have recently consumed a high-fat meal.

### Triglycerides, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular outcome studies: focus on omega-3 fatty acids [^1134Ao2b]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of the roles of triglycerides and triglyceride-lowering agents in atherosclerosis in the context of cardiovascular outcomes studies.

Methods

We reviewed the published literature as well as ClinicalTrials.gov entries for ongoing studies.

Results

Despite improved atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes with statin therapy, residual risk remains. Epidemiologic data and recent genetic insights provide compelling evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway for the development of atherosclerosis, thereby renewing interest in targeting triglycerides to improve ASCVD outcomes. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs) are three classes of triglyceride-lowering drugs. Outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have been inconsistent. With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. Two ongoing OM3FA outcome studies (REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) are testing this hypothesis in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of 200 to 500 mg/dL.

Conclusion

There is consistent evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway of atherosclerosis but inconsistent evidence from cardiovascular outcomes studies as to whether triglyceride-lowering agents reduce cardiovascular risk. Ongoing outcomes studies will determine the role of triglyceride lowering in statin-treated patients with high-dose prescription OM3FAs in terms of improved ASCVD outcomes.

### Hyperlipidemia management in diabetes: first line or supportive therapy? [^114399aC]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes. Current therapeutic approach has changed from glucocentric to vasculoprotective. This brief review highlights importance of management of hyperlipidemia (raised LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) on CHD outcomes in diabetes.

Methods

Literature seach was done till March 2022 (Pubmed, Google scholar) using following search words; lipids, cholesterol, statins, triglycerides, fibrates, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty (Omega-3 PUFAs) acids, LDL, diabetes, coronary heart disease.

Results

Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have reported that LDL cholesterol lowering using moderate to high intensity statins significantly reduces adverse CHD outcomes in diabetes. Evidence of triglyceride reduction using fenofibrate or omega-3 PUFAs is not very robust although a trial of a purified omega-3 PUFAs has shown significant benefit.

Conclusion

Lipid lowering with statins along with comprehensive lifestyle changes in addition to glucose control is recommended as first-line therapy to reduce CHD mortality and morbidity in diabetes.

### Effect of drugs on high-density lipoprotein [^115RbqU7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III found evidence for raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) events supports use of HDL-C to help modify low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering goals, but not to establish new HDL-C-focused treatment recommendations. However, the HDL-C-raising clinical trials provide important lessons to help guide clinical management of dyslipidemic patients. The fibrate outcome trials demonstrate that these drugs reduce CAD events, but not death. Their greatest benefit is in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high triglycerides, small LDL particles, and low HDL-C. Unfortunately, there is no information on whether these drugs extend risk reduction when added to a statin. The niacin outcome trials also demonstrate a reduction in CAD events, both with niacin monotherapy and in combination with a statin. Unfortunately, most of the trials are too small to address the impact of niacin on mortality. In the clinic, statins are most useful for their LDL-C-lowering efficacy, although their modest HDL-C-raising effects can be important in CAD risk reduction. In most cases, other therapies will need to be added to a statin to augment HDL-C-raising, and the most effective drug for achieving this is niacin. The greatest challenge with the use of niacin is managing the vasodilatory side effects, but this can be effectively done in the majority of patients. Fibrates can also be added to a statin for management of atherogenic dyslipidemia. These drugs are among the most effective triglyceride-lowering drugs, and they also increase HDL-C levels, but not as much as niacin. The biggest concern with combining a fibrate with a statin is the enhanced risk of severe muscle toxicity, but this appears to be a problem unique to gemfibrozil, and not fenofibrate. In the research center, new approaches are under development for enhancing the availability of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and nascent HDL particles to promote enhanced reverse cholesterol transport, increasing the production of transport molecules, in particular, ATP-binding cassette A-I, to facilitate delivery of cholesterol within the macrophage cell to the cell surface, where it can be taken up by nascent HDL particles for transport to the liver, and inhibiting the cholesteryl ester transport protein to promote retention of cholesteryl esters within the HDL core for delivery back to the liver. In addition, new insights into the role of prostaglandin D(2) in the niacin flush and discovery of the niacin receptor has led to a search for a more efficacious and "flushless" niacin.

### 2021 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the management of ASCVD risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113kWZdr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 40 years with diabetes mellitus, no ASCVD, and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL or nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL and triglycerides < 500 mg/dL — management emphasizes LDL-C risk-based therapy, for which maximally tolerated statin therapy is the treatment of choice; in patients with a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%, it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to achieve ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. High-intensity statin therapy is consistently associated with greater triglyceride reduction compared with moderate- or low-intensity statin therapy. After lifestyle interventions, optimization of statin therapy, consideration of ezetimibe at 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%, and improved glycemic control, a repeat fasting lipid panel should be performed. For persistent hypertriglyceridemia, the primary prevention cohort of REDUCE-IT supports the consideration of IPE for adults aged ≥ 50 years with diabetes mellitus, at least 1 additional ASCVD risk factor, and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 with triglycerides < 500 mg/dL; in this subgroup, treatment with IPE resulted in a 12% nonsignificant relative risk reduction compared with placebo (HR: 0.88; 0.70–1.10) and an absolute between-group difference of 1.4 percentage points, while the larger secondary prevention cohort experienced a 27% relative risk reduction (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.65–0.81; P value for interaction = 0.14). Adults aged < 50 years with diabetes or aged ≥ 50 years with no additional ASCVD risk factors and fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 and triglycerides < 500 mg/dL have a paucity of randomized controlled trial evidence for ASCVD risk reduction with triglyceride risk-based nonstatin therapy.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113VoWBc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in reaching low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride targets: the Treat-to-target (3T) study [^116dovck]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease call for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction as the primary target of treatment and reduction of triglycerides (TG) as an additional target.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of atorvastatin and simvastatin to reduce LDL-C and TG concentrations and to meet 3 target lipid levels: LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L; TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L; and both LDL-C ≤ 2.6 mmol/L and TG ≤ 1.5 mmol/L.

Methods

The Treat-to-Target (3T) Study was a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. Using the double-blind, double-dummy technique, adult patients aged 35 to 75 years with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia, defined as LDL-C concentration ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (≥ 155 mg/dL), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-daily oral treatment with 20 mg atorvastatin or 20 mg simvastatin. Fasting (12-hour) blood samples for the estimation of lipid levels and clinical laboratory values were collected after 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks. The dose was doubled after 12 weeks if the target National Cholesterol Education Program level of LDL-C (≤ 2.6 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) was not reached at 8 weeks.

Results

The intent-to-treat analysis included 552 patients (418 men, 134 women) randomized to receive atorvastatin and 535 (404 men, 131 women) randomized to receive simvastatin. The number of patients enrolled in the study allowed the evaluation fo the drugs' effects on TG. Patient demogrpahic characteristics were similar for the 2 treatment groups, and there were no differences in baseline lipid values. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions in LDL-C (8 weeks: -46% vs -40%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -49% vs -44%, P < 0.001) and in TG (8 weeks: -23% vs -14%, P < 0.001; 52 weeks: -24% vs -16%, P < 0.001). Compared with simvastatin-treated patients, a significantly greater number of atorvastatin-treated patients reached the LDL-C target after 8 weeks (45% vs 24%; P < 0.001). Fewer atorvastatin patients needed to have their dose doubled; nevertheless more atorvastatin patients reached the LDL-C target after 52 weeks (61% vs 41%; P < 0.001). Both statins were well tolerated. Muscular symptoms occurred in 12 patients (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group and in 13 patients (2.4%) in the simvastatin group.

Conclusions

Atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d for up to 1 year of treatment was significantly more effective than simvastatin 20 or 40 mg/d in reducing LDL-C and TG levels and at achieving recommended lipid targets in this selected patient population with cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. Both statis were well tolerated.

### Prevalence of dyslipidemia and lipid goal attainment in statin-treated subjects from 3 data sources: a retrospective analysis [^111zg4F7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment guidelines for reducing cardiovascular risk focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the basis of extensive evidence from primary and secondary prevention trials with statins. Treatment goals for LDL-C, as specified by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, are risk stratified: < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients (coronary heart disease [CHD] or CHD risk equivalents, 10-year risk > 20%), < 130 mg/dL for moderate-risk patients (≥ 2 risk factors, 10-year risk 10% to 20%), and < 160 mg/dL for low-risk patients (0 to 1 risk factors). CHD risk assessment is generally evaluated with the Framingham scoring system, which takes into account cigarette smoking, treated or untreated systolic hypertension, sex, age, total cholesterol level, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The 2004 update to the NCEP ATP III added an optional LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL for very high-risk patients (established cardiovascular disease [CVD] with multiple major risk factors), which also has been endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association. –

Although statins are excellent at reducing LDL-C and remain the mainstay of lipid-modifying therapies, patients optimally treated with statins continue to have cardiovascular events. One potential reason for this might be suboptimal non–HDL-C levels. The NCEP ATP III recommends non–HDL-C as a secondary target in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) (≥ 200 mg/dL) after the LDL-C goal has been achieved.

There is some confirmation, based on recent evaluations and reviews, that non–HDL-C does have an impact on cardiovascular outcomes. – Additionally, Boekholdt et al, in a meta-analysis evaluating statin-treated patients, concluded that elevated non–HDL-C imparted just as much high risk for cardiovascular events as elevated LDL-C. With the growing evidence that non–HDL-C is a better predictor of outcomes, the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Diabetes Association Consensus Conference, in 2008 endorsed non–HDL-C as a cotarget in patients with cardiometabolic risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

ACC 2021 persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia 500–999 mg/dL — management includes emphasizing a low-fat diet and that it is reasonable to consider a very low-fat diet in select patients, with consideration of fibrate or prescription omega-3 fatty acids to reduce risk of pancreatitis; for the right-column pathway, actions also include to increase intensity of statin therapy and optimize statin adherence while continuing the same diet and triglyceride-lowering options. Fenofibrate is specified as the preferred fibrate due to safety and interaction profile, and the narrative notes it is reasonable to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very-low-fat diet (10% to 15%), avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, and prescription omega-3. The text also states that the initial step in guideline-based management of severe hypertriglyceridemia is to provide lifestyle counseling.

### National Lipid Association scientific statement on the use of icosapent ethyl in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high or very-high ASCVD risk [^114ifUBt]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

National Lipid Association scientific statement — icosapent ethyl (IPE) for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction in statin-treated adults with elevated triglycerides: In the randomized, placebo-controlled REDUCE-IT cardiovascular outcomes trial, icosapent ethyl (IPE) 4 g/d in selected high- or very high-risk, statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides reduced the primary outcome of first major adverse cardiovascular event by 25% (95% confidence interval 17%–32%, P < .001). Based on this review, the position states that for patients aged ≥ 45 years with clinical ASCVD, or aged ≥ 50 years with diabetes mellitus requiring medication plus ≥ 1 additional risk factor, with fasting triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL on high-intensity or maximally tolerated statin therapy (± ezetimibe), treatment with IPE is recommended for ASCVD risk reduction (evidence rating: class I; level of evidence: B-R).

### Clinical trial design for triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-lowering therapies: JACC focus seminar 3 / 3 [^1142j4YL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) are a source of residual risk in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and are indirectly correlated with triglyceride (TG) levels. Previous clinical trials studying TG-lowering therapies have either failed to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events or shown no linkage of TG reduction with event reduction, particularly when these agents were tested on a background of statin therapy. Limitations in trial design may explain this lack of efficacy. With the advent of new RNA-silencing therapies in the TG metabolism pathway, there is renewed focus on reducing TRLs for major adverse cardiovascular event reduction. In this context, the pathophysiology of TRLs, pharmacological effects of TRL-lowering therapies, and optimal design of cardiovascular outcomes trials are major considerations.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia: common questions and answers [^111AU7b3]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia, defined as fasting serum triglyceride levels of 150 mg per dL or higher, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglyceride levels (500 mg per dL or higher) increase the risk of pancreatitis. Common risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Less common risk factors include excessive alcohol use, physical inactivity, being overweight, use of certain medications, and genetic disorders. Management of high triglyceride levels (150 to 499 mg per dL) starts with dietary changes and physical activity to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering carbohydrate intake (especially refined carbohydrates) and increasing fat (especially omega-3 fatty acids) and protein intake can lower triglyceride levels. Moderate- to high-intensity physical activity can lower triglyceride levels, as well as improve body composition and exercise capacity. Calculating a patient's 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is pertinent to determine the role of medications. Statins can be considered for patients with high triglyceride levels who have borderline (5% to 7.4%) or intermediate (7.5% to 19.9%) risk. For patients at high risk who continue to have high triglyceride levels despite statin use, high-dose icosapent (purified eicosapentaenoic acid) can reduce cardiovascular mortality (number needed to treat = 111 to prevent one cardiovascular death over five years). Fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, or niacin should be considered for patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, although this has not been studied in clinical trials. For patients with acute pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin infusion and plasmapheresis should be considered if triglyceride levels remain at 1,000 mg per dL or higher despite conservative management of acute pancreatitis.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypertriglyceridemia, general principles, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider addressing reversible causes of high triglyceride levels and initiating statin therapy in 40–75 years old adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL or ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) and ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^111mvxjf]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In summary, statins firmly remain the first line treatment of choice for attainment of LDL-C goal in patients at high risk of CVD. After LDL-C goal attainment however, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, as defined by recent European guidelines) and HDL-C low (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, then addition of a fibrate or niacin may be considered (Figure 6).

Figure 6
Proposed algorithm for the management of high-risk individuals with elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol at LDL cholesterol goal. a LDL-C at goal as recommended by the most recent European guidelines (2007); < 2.5 mmol/L in high-risk patients, decreasing to < 2.0 mmol/L in very high risk patients. High-dose omega-3 fatty acids, fibrate, or niacin may be considered if the patient has very high TG (> 5.0 mmol/L) to prevent pancreatitis. b If the patient still has elevated TG (≥ 1.7 mmol/L, as recommended by the most recent European guidelines) and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L) despite intensive lifestyle intervention, and addressing compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, additional lipid-modifying therapy may be considered. c Based on clinical outcome data and safety considerations for combination statin–fibrate therapy, fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate. This fibrate may have particular value in patients with T2DM and mild-to-moderate retinopathy. d Greater LDL-C lowering may be achieved by the addition of ezetimibe to a statin. Ezetimibe has a dose-sparing advantage in patients intolerant of higher dose statins, although outcome evidence to support its use is awaited.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113F5L9m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — management of hypertriglyceridemia recommends lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals as the initial treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia; for severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dl), we recommend combining reduction of dietary fat and simple carbohydrate intake with drug treatment to reduce the risk of pancreatitis; we recommend that the treatment goal for patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia be a non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level in agreement with NCEP ATP guidelines; we recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis; we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels; and we recommend that statins not be used as monotherapy for severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia, although statins may be useful for the treatment of moderate hypertriglyceridemia when indicated to modify cardiovascular risk.

Primary prevention — patients declining or intolerant of statins: In patients who may not wish to take a statin or may not tolerate the recommended intensity, it may be reasonable to use LDL-C–lowering drugs proven safe and effective in RCTs (monotherapy or combined with a statin); consideration may be given to use of ezetimibe; BAS may be considered as an optional alternative for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL, but there is no evidence for a cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statins; given the marginal additional benefit for this lower-risk group, the writing committee does not recommend routine use of nonstatin therapy for primary prevention patients with ASCVD risk < 20%.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^112x5qQp]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

### Clinical review on triglycerides [^11156j6r]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Therapy — approved pharmacologic treatments

All commonly available lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, fibrates, omega-3-fatty acids, and niacin affect TG levels. The effect of LDL-lowering drugs such as statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors on TG levels is usually modest (5–15%), while fibrates, omega-3-fatty acids, and niacin have more profound effects (25–45%). Seminal randomized cardiovascular outcome studies with TG-lowering drugs are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4
Randomized cardiovascular outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering drugs

Clinically, there are two distinct aspects to TG reduction: (i) modifying lipid levels to decrease ASCVD risk; and (ii) reducing TG to decrease the risk for acute pancreatitis. Although LDL-lowering drugs have only moderate effects on TG levels, they reduce ASCVD risk in patients with and without HTG. Therefore, depending on the absolute risk, specific LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals should be achieved.

Once the LDL-C goal is achieved, it must be decided, whether residual TG-associated risk for acute pancreatitis and/or ASCVD is sufficiently high to justify initiation of specific TG-lowering drugs, such as fibrates, omega-3-fatty-acids, or niacin. There is a lack of convincing outcomes evidence for ASCVD reduction when these medications are added to statin therapy. There are also no high-quality trial data demonstrating that acute pancreatitis risk decreases with specific TG-lowering therapy.

Fibrates can reduce TG by up to 70%, albeit with marked interindividual variation. As monotherapy, fibrates likely reduce ASCVD risk. But when used in combination with statins no further risk reduction was observed, although subgroup analyses indicate that patients with HTG and low HDL-C may benefit from such combination therapy. It is currently unclear whether the failure to show benefit relates to true failure or methodological issues with study design and enrolment criteria. An ongoing ASCVD outcome trial using the new agent, pemafibrate, will probably report in 2021. Many lipid clinics in the USA and Canada consider fibrate therapy in patients with elevated ASCVD risk and persistent TG concentrations > 200 mg/dL despite reaching LDL-C goal and despite lifestyle modifications.

### Effects of simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^114rCEFH]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with elevated levels of serum triglycerides (TG) often have other associated lipid abnormalities (e.g., low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) and are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. Although the therapeutic benefits of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in hypercholesterolemic patients have been well established, less is known about the effects of statins in patient populations with hypertriglyceridemia.

Hypothesis

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the lipoprotein-altering efficacy of simvastatin in hypertriglyceridemic patients.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In all, 195 patients with fasting serum triglyceride levels between 300 and 900 mg/dl received once daily doses of placebo or simvastatin 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks.

Results

Compared with placebo, simvastatin treatment across all doses resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.05 - < 0.001) in serum levels of triglycerides (-20 to -31% decrease) and TG-rich lipoprotein particles. Significant (p < 0.001) reductions were also seen in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-25 to -35%) and non-HDL-C (-26 to -40%). Levels of HDL-C were increased (7–11%) in the simvastatin groups compared with placebo (p < 0.05 - < 0.001).

Conclusion

The results of this study demonstrate the beneficial effects of simvastatin in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^117QyuKf]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

LDL-C pharmacological treatment in adults — statin-first approach with evidence-based add-ons. Patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) may benefit from pharmacotherapy, including those with very high baseline LDL-C levels suggestive of a genetic cause such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), individuals with multiple risk factors for ASCVD, or those already diagnosed with ASCVD. Statin therapy, which is the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for LDL-C reduction, reduces ASCVD risk in most individuals, and based on meta-analysis of 27 statin RCTs, for every 1 mmol/L (∼39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C there is a corresponding 22% reduction in ASCVD event risk. It should be noted that statin therapy does not seem to reduce ASCVD in adults receiving hemodialysis or those who have significant heart failure, and stopping statin therapy in these individuals is not advised if it is well tolerated. Given variability in individual response even at full therapeutic doses, routine monitoring for both efficacy and tolerability is essential to guide ongoing management. Based upon contemporary clinical trial evidence, LDL-C lowering therapy should start with statins, then if response is incomplete or a tolerated statin regimen cannot be found, nonstatin LDL-C lowering pharmacotherapy should be considered, with medicine selection based on factors including safety, tolerability, LDL-C lowering efficacy, RCT evidence supporting use, desirable LDL-C and expectations of treatment, patient preference, convenience and cost of therapy, and availability. Nonstatin pharmacotherapy also reduces ASCVD risk, with randomized trials showing risk reduction when ezetimibe is added to moderate intensity statin and when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody inhibition (PCSK9i) is added to high-intensity statin therapy. Additional options include bempedoic acid, which has demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in high-risk adults (especially those with diabetes mellitus) on low dose or no statin because of intolerance, and high dose icosapent ethyl, which has minimal impact on LDL-C but demonstrated ASCVD risk reduction in adults with established ASCVD or high-risk patients with diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia. While niacin is no longer recommended as a routine therapy for LDL-C lowering or ASCVD risk reduction due to lack of incremental benefit when added to statins in contemporary trials, it may have a limited role and may be considered in rare cases of multidrug intolerance or if cost or access constraints limit other options. Bile acid sequestrants can be used but have a high degree of limiting side effects and have been mostly abandoned because of their side effects and modest potency.

LDL-C risk-based therapy in clinical ASCVD with persistent hypertriglyceridemia — "The LDL-C risk-based treatment of choice for patients with ASCVD, regardless of the presence of hypertriglyceridemia, is maximally tolerated statins", and this population is described as "persistent hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides > 150 and < 500 mg/dL)"; such therapy is noted to have greater TG lowering with high-intensity regimens. For patients "at very high risk", candidates for nonstatin addition include those with " < 50% reduction of LDL-C from baseline and LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin therapy and with persistent fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 and < 500 mg/dL"; "Ezetimibe is the initial drug of choice, and for those with LDL-C persistently ≥ 70 mg/dL, the addition of a PCSK9i is reasonable (2)". Also, "Bempedoic acid is also FDA approved as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in patients with ASCVD who require additional lowering of LDL-C (107)".

### Fibrates for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^116QiLZM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrates are effective for modifying atherogenic dyslipidaemia, and particularly for lowering serum triglycerides. However, evidence that fibrates reduce mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), or overall mortality and morbidity, in the primary prevention of CVD is lacking.

Objectives

This Cochrane Review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of fibrates versus placebo or usual care or fibrates plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science (all from inception to 19 May 2016). We searched four clinical trial registers (last searched on 3 August 2016) with the help of an experienced professional librarian. We searched the databases to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical effects of fibrate therapy in the primary prevention of CVD events. We did not impose any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We aimed to include all RCTs comparing the effects of fibrate monotherapy versus placebo or usual care, or fibrates plus other lipid-modifying drugs versus other lipid-modifying drugs alone. Included studies had a follow-up of at least six months for the primary prevention of CVD events. We excluded trials with clofibrate, because it was withdrawn from the market in 2002.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potential study inclusion. Two review authors independently retrieved the full-text papers and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for aggregate data on primary and secondary outcomes. We tested for heterogeneity with the Cochrane Q-test and used the I 2 statistic to measure inconsistency of treatment effects across studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and used the GRADE profiler software (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5 to create 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified six eligible trials including 16,135 individuals. The mean age of trial populations varied across trials; between 47.3 and 62.3 years. Four trials included individuals with diabetes mellitus type 2 only. The mean treatment duration and follow-up of participants across trials was 4.8 years. We judged the risks of selection and performance bias to be low; risks of detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias were unclear. Reporting of adverse effects by included trials was very limited; that is why we used discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects as a proxy for adverse effects. Patients treated with fibrates had a reduced risk for the combined primary outcome of CVD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke compared to patients on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate-quality of evidence). For secondary outcomes we found RRs for fibrate therapy compared with placebo of 0.79 for combined coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate-quality of evidence); 1.01 for overall mortality (95% CI 0.81 to 1.26; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low-quality of evidence); 1.01 for non-CVD mortality (95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; participants = 8471; studies = 5; low-quality of evidence); and 1.38 for discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects (95% CI 0.71 to 2.68; participants = 4805; studies = 3; I² = 74%; very low-quality of evidence). Data on quality of life were not available from any trial. Trials that evaluated fibrates in the background of statins (2 studies) showed no benefits in preventing cardiovascular events.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that fibrates lower the risk for cardiovascular and coronary events in primary prevention, but the absolute treatment effects in the primary prevention setting are modest (absolute risk reductions < 1%). There is low-quality evidence that fibrates have no effect on overall or non-CVD mortality. Very low-quality evidence suggests that fibrates are not associated with increased risk for adverse effects.

### Dyslipidaemia in 2013: new statin guidelines and promising novel therapeutics [^112wGSTK]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

The new ACC/AHA guidelines on treatment of blood cholesterol focus on intensity of statin therapy rather than target levels of lipids. Early studies show substantial reductions in LDL-cholesterol level with antibodies against PCSK9. MicroRNA silencing and gene-repair techniques to treat dyslipidaemia are promising strategies under development.

### Frequency of obtaining national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^117DkTZj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported. Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk > 20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, current dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

### Management of non-high-density lipoprotein abnormalities [^115yLgpn]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence supports the use of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), and low-density lipoprotein particles as markers of atherogenic risk. Treatment guidelines also identify these as additional targets of lipid-modifying intervention in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG). Even when TG are only moderately elevated, many patients on statin monotherapy who have achieved targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) fail to reach non-HDL-C treatment goals, and even fewer reach apoB goals. Combination lipid-modifying therapy is therefore indicated for comprehensive lipid management, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in whom LDL-C levels are often considered 'optimal' Of the available options, adding either a niacin, fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids provides greater opportunity to achieve non-HDL-C and apoB targets, given complementary profiles of lipid-modifying activity and supported by evidence from clinical studies. Improvement in lipid control and reduction in atherogenic risk could be anticipated to translate to benefits in clinical outcomes.

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates and niacin as therapeutic options in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: a review of the literature [^111Dk1sF]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia affects approximately 33% of the US population. Elevated triglyceride levels are independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and severe hypertriglyceridemia is a risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Guidelines for the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 5.6 mmol/L [≥ 500 mg/dL]) recommend immediate use of triglyceride-lowering agents; however, statins remain the first line of therapy for the management of mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (1.7–5.6 mmol/L [150–499 mg/dL]). Statins primarily target elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but have also been shown to reduce mean triglyceride levels by up to 18% (or 43% in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 3.1 mmol/L [≥ 273 mg/dL]). However, individuals with hypertriglyceridemia may need additional reduction in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnant particles to further reduce residual CVD risk. A number of guidelines recommend the addition of fibrates, niacin, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acids if elevated triglyceride or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels persist despite the use of high-intensity statin therapy. This review evaluates the impact of fibrates, niacin, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It also assesses the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions associated with these triglyceride-lowering agents, because although they have all been shown to effectively reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, they differ with regard to their associated benefit-risk profiles. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be a well-tolerated and effective alternative to fibrates and niacin, yet further large-scale clinical studies are required to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes and CVD risk reduction in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

### National Lipid Association scientific statement on the use of icosapent ethyl in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides and high or very-high ASCVD risk [^114JJNTq]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2019). High credibility.

Icosapent ethyl in REDUCE-IT — non–HDL-C change versus event reduction — shows that the placebo-corrected reduction in non–HDL-C at year 1 was 15.5 mg/dL (0.37 mmol/L); meta-regression indicates each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in non–HDL-C relates to 20% (95% CI: 18%–23%, n = 19 trials) with statins and 21% (95% CI: 12%–29%, n = 8 trials) with fibrates, so the expected relative risk reduction would be ~8.8%, which is well below the 21.8% observed and the HR risk reduction of 24.8%, and therefore "it is reasonable to hypothesize that the risk reduction may be attributable, in part, to mechanisms other than effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins".

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^112rpny1]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Drugs affecting lipoprotein metabolism (Table 13) — statins lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ↓18%–55%, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) by ↓15%–51%, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by ↑5%–15%, and reduce triglycerides (TG) by ↓7%–30%; TG reduction with statins is higher in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, producing reductions in the range of 20% to 50%. Bile acid sequestrants lower LDL-C by ↓15%–30%, non–HDL-C by ↓4%–16%, raise HDL-C by ↑3%–5%, and TG 0%–10%. Nicotinic acid lowers LDL-C by ↓5%–25%, non–HDL-C by ↓8%–23%, raises HDL-C by ↑15%–35%, and reduces TG by ↓20%–50%. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor lowers LDL-C by ↓13%–20%, non–HDL-C by ↓14%–19%, raises HDL-C by ↑3%–5%, and lowers TG by ↓5%–11%. LDL-C may increase in patients with very high triglycerides when using fibric acids or long-chain omega-3 fatty acid drugs except for omega-3 products that contain eicosapentaenoic acid only, and no docosahexaenoic acid.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

Statin-fibrate combination therapy: current status

- Recent evidence from a meta-analysis suggests that fibrate therapy on a background of statin treatment provides clinical benefit in subgroups of patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (Table 4)

- A large prospective trial to determine the long-term cardiovascular effects of a statin–fibrate combination in patients with the high triglyceride and low HDL-C phenotype is urgently needed

Table 4
Subgroup analyses of cardiovascular outcome studies with fibrates

Combination of a statin with a fibrate (primarily fenofibrate) incrementally decreased plasma triglycerides by 15–20% and raised HDL-C by 5–20% vs. statin monotherapy. – Similar effects were seen in FIELD and ACCORD Lipid, although the placebo-corrected increments in HDL-C in the total study cohorts were less than 3%. In ACCORD Lipid, the only completed outcome study of combination therapy, fenofibrate–simvastatin had no effect on the primary outcome vs. simvastatin alone for all patients. Importantly, however, in the fenofibrate–simvastatin group, there was a 31% reduction in CV risk in the subgroup with baseline triglycerides in the upper tertile (≥ 2.3 mmol/L or 204 mg/dL) and HDL-C levels in the lower tertile (≤ 0.88 mmol/L or 34 mg/dL) vs. simvastatin monotherapy (Table 4). The available data also suggest that fenofibrate exerts microvascular benefits, notably in preventing progression of retinopathy in T2DM patients.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1154wzMH]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Initiation of drug therapy — statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to < 50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥ 50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination with added risk reduction by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention where the absolute risk reduction is much less are more difficult, involving LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination.

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^112MM9yq]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

Until now, there were no direct "head to head" statin vs. fibrate comparisons at all. Only recently intermediate-size (274 patients) RCT have demonstrated that bezafibrate was significantly better than pravastatin (a relatively weak statin) in reduction of cardiovascular events. Anyway, even intensive statin therapy does not eliminate the cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL or/and high triglycerides (atherogenic dyslipidemia)! Current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with combined dyslipidemia (which included atherogenic dyslipidemia) at high residual risk for coronary events. Figure 3 A is a graphic representation of the definition of residual cardiovascular risk in patients treated by conventional statin therapy. The significant residual cardiovascular risk is still present and is not affected by standard LDL - lowering therapy.

### Meta-analysis of comparative efficacy of increasing dose of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin versus simvastatin on lowering levels of atherogenic lipids (from VOYAGER) [^116xmsDG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statins, the impact of increasing dose has not been fully elucidated. An individual patient data pooled analysis was performed of 32,258 patients in studies comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin or simvastatin. The impact of increasing dose on lowering LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B was investigated. Doubling the dose of each statin was accompanied by a 4% to 7% greater degree of lowering of all atherogenic lipids. A stronger correlation was observed between changes in LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (r = 0.92, p < 0.001) or apolipoprotein B (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) than triglycerides (r = 0.14, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, baseline lipid level (p < 0.0001) and increasing statin dose (p < 0.0001) were strong predictors of achieving treatment goals in high-risk patients. Increasing age was a strong independent predictor of achieving goal for all atherogenic lipids (p < 0.0001). Achieving LDL cholesterol goals was also more likely in women (p < 0.0001), patients with diabetes (p < 0.0001), and patients without atherosclerotic disease (p = 0.0002). In contrast, normal triglyceride levels were more often observed in men (p < 0.0001) and patients without diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03). In conclusion, doubling statin dose was associated with greater lowering of LDL cholesterol by 4% to 6% and non-HDL cholesterol by 3% to 6%. Greater lipid goal achievement with increasing dose supports the use of high-dose statin therapy for more effective cardiovascular prevention.

### Residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in relation to reductions in very-low-density lipoproteins [^113dpXmY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The finding that greater triglyceride reduction was not associated with incremental risk reduction is of interest, given that this marker has been taken as a surrogate for this lipoprotein family in clinical practice and research. However, although in this substudy greater triglyceride reduction with statin was not associated with improved outcomes, the median on‐statin triglyceride level was only 101 mg/dL. Meta‐analysis of clinical trials of triglyceride‐lowering, including ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), FIELD (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes), and others, demonstrated that patients with low levels of triglyceride (< 200 mg/dL) may not derive benefit from further reduction; however, individuals with elevated baseline levels (> 200 mg/dL) might experience reductions in ASCVD risk with triglyceride lowering. 28 Thus, our findings are consistent with past analyses and likely do not carry negative implications for ongoing and planned triglyceride‐reduction–based clinical trials, such as REDUCE‐IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events Outcomes), STRENGTH (Study to Assess Statin Residual Risk Reduction With Epanova in High CV Risk Patients With Hypertriglyceridemia), and PROMINENT (Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular Outcomes by Reducing Triglycerides IN Patients With Diabetes), in which patient inclusion is limited to those with triglyceride levels 200 to 499 mg/dL. Rather, the findings related to small VLDL species suggest that even among individuals in whom targeted triglyceride reduction has historically failed to reduce events (those without elevated triglyceride), some members of this lipoprotein family might remain as important residual risk targets for alternative approaches. Overall, these results suggest that a more granular understanding of an individual's circulating lipid/lipoprotein milieu could be required to successfully identify and treat the spectrum of relevant triglyceride‐related mediators in this residual ASCVD risk pathway. The results also support profiling of broader lipid/lipoprotein changes in response to statin therapy as independent markers of individual benefit from statin therapy, and could support more individualized approaches to statin administration.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonstatin therapies and BAS — Choice among nonstatin therapies should account for patient population and therapy attributes; considerations include the extent of available scientific evidence for net ASCVD risk-reduction benefit, safety and tolerability, potential for drug-drug interactions, efficacy of additional LDL-C lowering, cost, convenience and medication storage, pill burden, frequency and route of administration, potential to jeopardize adherence to evidence-based therapies, and, importantly, patient preferences. Before initiation of combination therapy or dose adjustments/additions, it is imperative for clinicians and patients to engage in a discussion addressing potential net benefit, absolute ASCVD risk-reduction benefits and potential harms, prescribing considerations, and patient preferences. BAS may be considered as an optional alternative agent for those with ezetimibe intolerance and with triglycerides < 300 mg/dL or due to patient preferences, but there is no evidence for a net cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of BAS in addition to statin therapy.

The Role of Other Atherogenic Lipids

Beyond LDL‐C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. Current AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk‐enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10‐year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL‐C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid‐related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk‐enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

2018 AHA/ACC hypertriglyceridemia — treatment recommendations are as follows: In adults 20 years of age or older with moderate hypertriglyceridemia (fasting or nonfasting triglycerides 175 to 499 mg/dL [2.0 to 5.6 mmol/L]), clinicians should address and treat lifestyle factors, secondary factors, and medications that increase triglycerides. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to reevaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy. In adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL), and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L), it is reasonable to identify and address other causes, and if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^115m8mFL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Examining the Guidelines: Major Similarities But Differences in Interpretation of the Data

Both the 2018 AHA/ACC/MS Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines employ a risk‐based approach to grade intensity of the intervention and use patient history, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data to identify individuals most likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering therapy. Both guidelines identify 4 major, mutually exclusive categories of patients likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering interventions, including those with clinical ASCVD, severe primary hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and primary prevention patients with high 10‐year risk for ASCVD. They recommend treatments based on the premise that the higher the baseline risk, the greater the absolute ASCVD risk reduction derived from the same reduction of LDL‐C. Some key differences in the interpretation of data include the following: definition of risk categories; employment of risk calculation systems that depend on ASCVD death (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) versus fatal and nonfatal ASCVD (Pooled Cohort Equations); use of atherosclerosis imaging tests to inform treatment decisions; value of employing LDL‐C goals, and, in selected hypertriglyceridemic patients, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) and apoB goals, for clinical decision making; and use of pharmacotherapy that is based upon achieved LDL‐C levels. While both guidelines recognize that there is a continuum of risk, the ESC/EAS Guidelines proceed on the premise that ASCVD risk is a continuum from low to very high without categorizing people to primary and secondary prevention, while the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline maintains that differentiation between primary and secondary prevention is warranted based on the results of randomized controlled trials. The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines provide a number of important updates to the previous ESC/EAS Guidelines of 2016 and among other key points, emphasize that lower LDL‐C is better and that the absolute LDL‐C reduction drives the clinical benefit (Data S1, Table S1). This perspective has led to new goals in high‐risk and very high‐risk patients, shifting the focus from high‐intensity statin to high‐intensity lipid‐lowering. The philosophical underpinnings of these documents and their divergent approaches to lipid lowering for ASCVD risk reduction are summarized in Table 1.

### Combination therapy with statins and omega-3 fatty acids [^114PQBDU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Combined dyslipidemia is the concurrent presence of multiple abnormalities in various lipid subfractions, including elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), as well as decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) lowered the cut points for classification of TG levels, established non-HDL cholesterol levels as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TGs of ≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and defined the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of therapy. Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line therapy for most patients with elevated LDL cholesterol, statin monotherapy may not be sufficient to achieve recommended non-HDL cholesterol goals, and statins have only modest effects on reducing TG levels. Similarly, patients whose TG levels remain elevated despite treatment with a TG-lowering agent may require the addition of a statin to provide further TG reduction. In addition, statin therapy may be needed to offset the secondary increase in levels of LDL cholesterol that frequently results from treatment with a TG-lowering agent in patients with marked hypertriglyceridemia. In a number of small studies, the combination of statins and omega-3 fatty acids has been consistently shown to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for combined dyslipidemia. Patients with recent myocardial infarction may also benefit from this combination. When considering risks and benefits of adding a second agent to statins for treatment of combined dyslipidemia, omega-3 fatty acids provide additional lipid improvements without requiring additional laboratory tests and do not increase risk for adverse muscle or liver effects.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^113C6sUg]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment "targets" vs "thresholds".

Cholesterol recommendations from major guideline organizations differ in several aspects, despite each committee being composed of lipid experts, and evaluating essentially the same evidence. A major difference is the LDL-C level at which treatment intensification is recommended. Some guideline organizations (ie, European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology) have opted for a treatment "target", which varies based on guideline organization, and some for a treatment "intensification threshold" (ie, Canadian Cardiovascular Society). The difference is subtle but important. A target level implies that maximal benefit is obtained once the target is attained and may lead to providers possibly back-titrating the dose or even deprescribing medication if the attained level is far below the target. However, most clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering agents were performed by selecting patients with LDL-C exceeding a threshold value, and did not aim for a specific target level: some on-treatment patients attained extremely low LDL-C levels and yet continued to show benefit with respect to ASCVD risk reduction. Advocates for thresholds suggest that these closely approximate the approach used in the clinical trials, and are thus consistent with "evidence-based medicine".

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — adults aged 40 to 75 years: In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to reevaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.6 mmol/L]) and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to address reversible causes of high triglyceride and to initiate statin therapy. In adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL [≥ 5.7 mmol/L], and especially fasting triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL [11.3 mmol/L]), it is reasonable to identify and address other causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing, to further reduce triglycerides by implementation of a very low-fat diet, avoidance of refined carbohydrates and alcohol, consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, and, if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis, fibrate therapy.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety of atorvastatin (10mg) with simvastatin (10mg) at six weeks. ASSET investigators [^116iodtJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The 6-week efficacy and safety of atorvastatin versus simvastatin was determined during a 54-week, open-label, multicenter, parallel-arm, treat-to-target study. In all, 1,424 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (triglyceride 200 to 600 mg/dl [2.26 to 6.77 mmol/L]) were stratified to 1 of 2 groups (diabetes or no diabetes). Patients were then randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg/ day (n = 730) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 694). Efficacy was determined by measuring changes from baseline in lipid parameters including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B. Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin produced significantly greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol (37.2% vs 29.6%), total cholesterol (27.6% vs 21.5%), triglycerides (22.1% vs 16.0%), the ratio of LDL cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (41.1% vs 33.7%), and apolipoprotein B (28.3% vs 21.2%), and a comparable increase from baseline in HDL cholesterol (7.4% vs 6.9%). Atorvastatin was also significantly (p < 0.0001) more effective than simvastatin at treating the overall patient population to LDL cholesterol goals (55.6% vs 38.4%). Fewer than 6% of patients in either treatment group experienced drug-attributable adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate in nature. Diabetic patients treated with either statin had safety characteristics similar to nondiabetics, with atorvastatin exhibiting superior efficacy to simvastatin. In conclusion, atorvastatin, at a dose of 10 mg/day, is more effective than simvastatin 10 mg/day at lowering lipids and reaching LDL cholesterol goals in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Both statins are well tolerated with safety profiles similar to other members of the statin class.

### Metabolomic consequences of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 compared with statin treatment [^113gDUUY]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Currently licensed PCSK9 inhibitors are given either instead of statins — when there is strong evidence of statin intolerance in those with familial hypercholesterolemia — or in addition to maximally tolerated statins in patients with existing vascular disease. Such treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors has been shown to be more efficacious in lowering LDL-C than the most potent statins. –, Mendelian randomization studies comparing PCSK9 and HMGCR gene scores on cardiovascular outcomes have indicated nearly identical protective effects for equivalent reductions in LDL-C. However, when scaling the metabolic effects to an equivalent lowering in LDL-C, the results of the present study indicate subtle differences on multiple lipoprotein lipid measures. The most notable discrepancy was for VLDL lipids, suggesting weaker potency of PCSK9 inhibitors in clearance of these triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as compared with statins. These findings are supported by a recent study providing evidence that statins, but not PCSK9 inhibitors, improve triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism after an oral fat load in normolipidemic men. The causal consequences of these differences in medium-sized and large VLDL particles, that are rich in triglycerides, remain unclear and warrant further investigation; whereas intermediate-density lipoprotein and the smallest VLDL particles can penetrate the arterial wall to cause atherosclerosis, it is commonly perceived not be to the case for larger VLDL particles. We also observed a difference in lowering of VLDL cholesterol levels; the cholesterol concentrations of VLDL particles are strongly associated with risk of myocardial infarction, and some studies have suggested that VLDL cholesterol could underpin the link between triglycerides and cardiovascular risk. If these VLDL particles do play a causal role in vascular disease, the discrepancy between statin therapy and PCSK9 inhibition could translate into slightly more potent cardiovascular risk reduction for the same LDL-C lowering for statins as compared with PCSK9 inhibition. We acknowledge that the present comparison of detailed metabolic effects of statin therapy and PCSK9 inhibition does not directly inform on the cardiovascular benefits of anti-PCSK9 therapies above current optimal care, but potentially in keeping with our findings, the cardiovascular outcome trials on PCSK9 inhibition have demonstrated slightly weaker cardiovascular event lowering compared with meta-analysis of statin trials per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C. Although potential explanations for this discrepancy include the short trial duration and choice of primary end point, other explanations, such as differences in anti-inflammatory effects, have also been suggested. Our results provide an additional hypothesis for exploration: the apparent weaker cardioprotective effects of PCSK9 inhibitors compared with statins per unit reduction in LDL-C may be attributable to weaker reductions in VLDL lipid concentrations by PCSK9 inhibition. This hypothesis warrants further investigation, including elucidation of the causal role of triglyceride-rich VLDL particles in tandem with further examinations of the detailed lipid effect of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^111x2dQ3]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.

### Comparing statin effects on lipoprotein characteristics… [^112NMhZs]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

When atorvastatin is taken at a dosage of 40 mg per day, it has been demonstrated to normalize triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein levels in fasting and postprandial patients with coronary heart disease. Fasting is not necessary for accurate detection of lipid abnormalities if the various cholesterol fractions are measured directly. Comparing the effects of atorvastatin with those of other statins would be useful in choosing appropriate lipid-lowering therapy. Schaefer and associates studied patients with documented CHD who had elevated serum LDL cholesterol levels while not taking lipid-lowering medications. All patients were educated about appropriate nutrition and randomized to receive atorvastatin or one of four other statins, starting at a dosage of 20 mg per day and increasing dosages at four-week intervals up to a maximum dosage.

Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than fluvastatin in reducing all cholesterol parameters at all doses. Compared with lovastatin, atorvastatin was significantly better at reducing all cholesterol parameters at the 80-mg dosage, and reduced LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels more significantly at all dosages. Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than pravastatin in lowering most cholesterol parameters at all dosages. Atorvastatin was significantly more effective than simvastatin in lowering most cholesterol parameters at 20-mg and 80-mg daily dosages. The 40-mg dosage of atorvastatin also significantly increased large high-density lipoprotein particles more than the other statins, except simvastatin. Patients who were hyporesponsive or hyperresponsive to one statin maintained that level of responsiveness when exposed to a different statin. These results correlated well using fasting and postprandial direct measurements.

The authors conclude that atorvastatin taken at dosages of 20 to 80 mg daily effectively alters all cholesterol and triglyceride parameters in the fasting and the post-prandial state in persons with CHD, to a level comparable with a control group. The effectiveness of other statins at every dosage for all parameters was approximately 33 percent for fluvastatin, 50 percent for pravastatin, 60 percent for lovastatin, and 85 percent for simvastatin.

### Metabolomic profiling of statin use and genetic inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase [^116JjXLn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Metabolomic profiling of statin use in longitudinal cohorts uncovered an intricate association pattern of circulating lipoprotein, fatty acid, and metabolite changes, which adds to our understanding of the LDL-C–independent effects of statins. Statin use was associated with pronounced lowering of numerous lipids and fatty acids consistent with the cardioprotective effects. By contrast, statin use did not markedly affect the circulating levels of recently identified biomarkers for cardiometabolic risk such as amino acids, glycolysis- and glycogenesis-related metabolites, or ketone bodies. The genetic proxy for HMGCR inhibition gave rise to a strikingly similar association pattern, providing unconfounded evidence that the observed metabolic changes arise as a consequence of the mechanism-based effect of statins (Central Illustration). These insights into an extensively studied therapeutic agent illustrate how metabolomics, combined with genetic proxies mimicking pharmacological action, can elucidate the molecular effects of known targets, clarify treatment indication, and potentially be used to inform drug development.

Inhibition of HMGCR by statins leads to up-regulated expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the uptake of circulating LDL particles. Using lipoprotein subclass profiling, statin therapy also was shown to be associated with considerable lowering of IDL and very small VLDL particle concentrations, beyond the anticipated decrease in LDL particles. These remnant lipoprotein particles carry 20% to 30% of circulating cholesterol; they are small enough to enter the arterial intima and, therefore, possess the potential to cause atherosclerosis. Because total triglyceride concentration is highly correlated with the amount of IDL and small VLDL particles and their cholesterol levels, the triglyceride measure may partly reflect the cardiovascular risk mediated by the atherogenic remnant particles. Indeed, accumulating genetic evidence suggests that triglyceride levels reflect causal processes related to coronary heart disease; however, the likely underpinning mechanism is the remnant cholesterol carried in the IDL and VLDL particles. Detailed lipoprotein profiling demonstrated that statins are effective in lowering remnant cholesterol, whereas triglycerides are only modestly decreased by statin therapy. These results suggest that statins are substantially more efficacious for lowering remnant cholesterol than would be projected based on their ability to lower triglycerides. If the cardiovascular risk reflected by triglycerides is due to remnant cholesterol rather than triglycerides per se, then our results indicate cardioprotective benefits of statins beyond LDL-C lowering and suggest broader indications for statins in treating remnant hyperlipidemia.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management and monitoring — the goal for LDL-C lowering is defined as percentage responses relative to baseline; the expected percent reduction with high-intensity statin therapy is ≥ 50% and should be used to assess clinical efficacy, and a threshold of LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL is useful to determine whether to intensify lipid management; the maximum percentage change occurs within 4 to 12 weeks after initiation of or change in lipid-lowering therapy, and obtaining lipid profiles every 3 to 12 months is associated with improved adherence and identification of those needing intensification; because the Friedewald equation can underestimate LDL-C with elevated triglycerides, other measurement approaches (eg, Martin/Hopkins) may be desirable.

Combination drug therapy in dyslipidemia management — Therapy with a statin plus a second (or third) agent may be considered for patients who have not reached their treatment goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels, particularly in patients with very high or high risk, and the maximum tolerated statin dosage should generally be used before add-on therapy is considered. Among those treated with high-dose statin therapy, more than 40% did not reach their LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL, demonstrating that statin therapy alone may be insufficient for some individuals to reach goal.

Hypertriglyceridemia with elevated ASCVD risk — statin initiation/intensification (IIa B-R): In adults 40 to 75 years of age with moderate or severe hypertriglyceridemia and ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher, it is reasonable to evaluate ASCVD risk after lifestyle and secondary factors are addressed and to consider a persistently elevated triglyceride level as a factor favoring initiation or intensification of statin therapy; additionally, if an adult patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia has a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥ 7.5% determined by the PCE, it is reasonable either to initiate or intensify statin therapy.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^1117EUvd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years. However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridaemia are associated with a substantially increased long term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to reduction in HDL and increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms, such excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intensive lifestyle therapy is the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Statins are a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. If the primary goal is to lower TG levels, fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate for monotherapy, and in combination with statin; gemfibrozil only for monotherapy) could be the preferable drugs. Also ezetimibe has mild positive effects in lowering TG. Initial experience with en ezetimibe/fibrates combination seems promising. The recently released IMPROVE-IT Trial is the first to prove that adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe) to a statin lowers the risk of future CV events. In conclusion, the classical clinical paradigm of lipids-modifying treatment should be changed and high TG should be recognized as an important target for therapy in their own right. Hypertriglyceridemia should be treated.

### Statins and the liver [^111nVVDQ]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Lipid lowering, particularly with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ("statins"), reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with chronic liver disease present challenges to the use of lipid medications. In the case of most liver disorders, the concern has been one of safety. There is evidence that most lipid-lowering medications can be used safely in many situations, although large outcomes trials are lacking. This review examines lipid physiology and cardiovascular risk in specific liver diseases and reviews the evidence for lipid lowering and the use of statins in chronic liver disease.
