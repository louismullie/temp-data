## Question

How would real-time monitoring of cardiac biomarkers like NT-proBNP and troponin via biosensing technologies impact CHF treatment outcomes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how real-time monitoring of cardiac biomarkers like NT-proBNP and troponin via biosensing technologies would impact chronic heart failure treatment outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and whether continuous biomarker monitoring addresses unmet needs. Then, I should verify the prognostic value of serial NT-proBNP and troponin changes. Next, I will examine the mixed evidence for biomarker-guided therapy and what that implies for real-time use. After that, I need to assess the technological feasibility and potential advantages of continuous sensing. Finally, I will consider implementation, safety, and outline a cautious, evidence-informed conclusion with next steps for research and practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale. Heart failure care has persistent gaps between guideline-directed medical therapy targets and real-world dosing, and decompensation often occurs between clinic visits, so a tool that enables earlier detection and timelier therapy intensification could theoretically reduce hospitalizations and improve outcomes, especially if it captures dynamic biomarker trajectories rather than static snapshots [^e6dc4217] [^25d86610].

> I need to check the prognostic signal in serial NT-proBNP and troponin. Repeated NT-proBNP measurements substantially improve risk prediction over a single value, with increases occurring weeks before events, and achieving NT-proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL by 90 days is associated with markedly lower risks of HF hospitalization and mortality regardless of treatment arm, which supports the concept that dynamic biomarker trajectories track disease severity and prognosis [^3b05784b] [^69c59905]. For troponin, serial high-sensitivity cTnT changes independently predict mortality and HF events in chronic HF cohorts, and even in community-dwelling older adults, serial cTnT informs incident HF risk, reinforcing the value of trending rather than isolated values [^086909b2] [^41e7d92b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I should review the randomized evidence for biomarker-guided therapy itself, which is mixed. The GUIDE-IT trial, the largest to date, did not show that an NT-proBNP–targeted strategy improved outcomes versus usual care, despite similar attainment of the biomarker goal across arms, tempering enthusiasm for algorithmic biomarker targets alone [^93cb2641]. But wait, what if the signal is in subgroups or implementation details? TIME-CHF suggested benefit in patients under 75 years and reduced recurrent events, whereas PRIMA and PRIMA II did not show outcome benefits with discharge or inpatient NT-proBNP targets, highlighting that age, phenotype, and care pathways likely modify effectiveness [^8a36f583] [^0e5df755] [^352e10ef]. Meta-analyses show signals for fewer HF admissions and possible mortality benefit, but heterogeneity and risk of bias limit certainty, so I should be cautious about overpromising clinical impact from biomarker-guided therapy alone [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5].

> Next, I should review the technological feasibility. Emerging biosensor platforms propose continuous, minimally invasive monitoring of NT-proBNP and troponin, with preclinical and early translational work demonstrating real-time detection of biomarker fluctuations in coronary sinus or transcutaneous configurations, and the ability to integrate multiple analytes into a single platform, which could overcome the limitations of intermittent sampling and delayed recognition of deterioration [^46d29041] [^3e2039c0] [^27d173bf]. Let me verify the clinical implications: continuous sensing could enable earlier uptitration of GDMT, closer surveillance during vulnerable periods, and potentially closed-loop systems, but I need to ensure we do not conflate diagnostic or prognostic utility with proven therapeutic benefit from acting on those data [^d3222289].

> I will now examine potential advantages and limitations. Potential benefits include earlier detection of hemodynamic or myocardial injury signals, more precise tracking of response to therapy, and the possibility of preemptive intervention to avert decompensation, which aligns with the observed prognostic value of serial biomarker trajectories and the concept that lower NT-proBNP correlates with reverse remodeling and better outcomes, even if the causal lever is therapy intensification rather than the biomarker target itself [^69c59905] [^5f0efef0]. But wait, I should double-check the pitfalls: false positives, confounding by renal function, obesity, age, and atrial fibrillation, and the lack of standardized treatment algorithms for real-time biomarker data could lead to inappropriate therapy changes or alarm fatigue, so clinical integration must be deliberate and protocolized [^f5b0f0ba] [^c5ef5285].

> Let me consider implementation and safety. Continuous biomarker monitoring would require validated devices, secure data pipelines, clinician-facing dashboards with decision support, and clear escalation protocols, ideally embedded within disease management programs that have shown the most consistent signals for benefit when biomarkers are used adjunctively rather than as standalone drivers of care [^304ed90e] [^e10c5d62]. I should confirm that safety monitoring for overdiuresis, hypotension, and electrolyte disturbances is built into any protocol, given the risk of overly aggressive titration in response to biomarker changes without clinical correlation [^a3a9f2e5].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Real-time NT-proBNP and troponin monitoring is technically feasible and biologically plausible to improve risk detection and enable timelier therapy adjustments, but current evidence does not establish that biomarker-guided therapy by itself improves hard outcomes, so the clinical impact will depend on how clinicians act on the data and whether continuous feeds can be integrated into structured, guideline-concordant care pathways that reliably intensify GDMT and address congestion and myocardial injury signals [^93cb2641] [^1f93ebbe]. I should emphasize that the strongest, most consistent signal is prognostic: lower NT-proBNP and favorable troponin trajectories track with better outcomes, so continuous monitoring may refine risk stratification and timing of interventions, but randomized trials of continuous biomarker-guided care are needed to prove outcome benefit before routine adoption [^69c59905] [^086909b2].

> Practical next steps: I need to ensure we prioritize research on closed-loop or protocolized interventions triggered by continuous biomarker trends, define patient populations most likely to benefit (for example, HFrEF patients under 75, those with recurrent decompensation, or those undergoing rapid GDMT titration), and establish standardized thresholds and response algorithms that account for confounders and comorbidities, while simultaneously validating device accuracy, stability, and clinical integration workflows in prospective studies [^09b63e13] [^f5b0f0ba] [^655ac190]. Until such data exist, continuous biomarker monitoring should be considered investigational, with any clinical use framed as part of a structured program where biomarker trends inform, but do not replace, clinical judgment and guideline-directed care [^c39df4cc].

Real-time biosensing of NT-proBNP and troponin could **enable earlier detection** of hemodynamic stress and myocardial injury, allowing preemptive therapy adjustments that reduce decompensation and hospitalizations [^46d29041] [^3e2039c0]. However, **clinical benefit is not guaranteed**; GUIDE-IT showed no outcome improvement with NT-proBNP–guided therapy, and current guidelines do not endorse routine serial biomarker-guided management [^93cb2641] [^c0523a54]. Real-time monitoring may still aid risk stratification and prompt timely intervention, but **robust RCTs are needed** to prove outcome benefits and define optimal thresholds, integration, and safety [^d3222289] [^655ac190].

---

## Clinical rationale for real-time biomarker monitoring

NT-proBNP reflects ventricular wall stress and fluid overload, while troponin indicates myocardial injury; both correlate with HF severity and prognosis [^d3222289] [^e4d23fd6]. Serial measurements improve risk prediction over single values, with NT-proBNP changes preceding events by weeks, supporting the concept of **early detection** [^3b05784b] [^b6939f7b]. Real-time monitoring could detect subclinical rises and enable preemptive therapy, potentially reducing decompensation and hospitalizations [^46d29041] [^3e2039c0].

## Evidence from clinical studies

### NT-proBNP-guided therapy

- **GUIDE-IT**: NT-proBNP–guided therapy did not reduce HF hospitalization or CV death vs usual care in HFrEF, despite similar attainment of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL [^93cb2641].
- **Meta-analyses**: Some show reduced HF admissions and mortality with NP-guided therapy, but heterogeneity and low-quality evidence limit conclusions [^1f93ebbe] [^391594a5].
- **Guidelines**: ACC/AHA/HFSA give NT-proBNP a Class I role for diagnosis/prognosis, but not for routine serial-guided therapy [^b555d6bd] [^c0523a54].

---

### Troponin-guided therapy

Evidence for serial troponin to guide therapy is **limited**; troponin is mainly used for prognosis and risk stratification, not for titrating therapy [^e4d23fd6] [^086909b2]. Its role in real-time-guided management remains investigational [^e500737f].

---

## Technological feasibility and limitations

- **Implantable biosensors**: Early devices enable continuous coronary sinus monitoring of NT-proBNP and troponin, detecting rises hours before systemic changes, but long-term safety, stability, and clinical integration remain unproven [^46d29041] [^3e2039c0].
- **Noninvasive/wearables**: Under development but face challenges in sensitivity, specificity, and validation for clinical decision-making [^27d173bf] [^9582c057].
- **Clinical integration**: Requires validated thresholds, clinician alerts, and protocols to avoid false alarms and inappropriate therapy [^655ac190] [^19737282].

---

## Potential clinical benefits

- **Early detection**: Preemptive therapy for rising NT-proBNP/troponin may reduce decompensation and hospitalizations [^46d29041] [^3e2039c0].
- **Personalized therapy**: Real-time data could tailor diuretics, neurohormonal blockade, and device therapy to dynamic risk [^d5d7fb0a] [^27d173bf].
- **Remote monitoring**: May extend advanced surveillance to broader HF populations, including underserved groups [^27d173bf] [^25d86610].

---

## Potential risks and challenges

- **False positives/negatives**: Comorbidities (renal dysfunction, obesity, AF) and biological variation can confound interpretation [^f5b0f0ba] [^c5ef5285].
- **Clinician burden**: Frequent alerts without clear protocols may cause alarm fatigue and inappropriate changes [^655ac190] [^19737282].
- **Cost and access**: Implantable devices and infrastructure may widen disparities without proven outcome gains [^27d173bf] [^25d86610].

---

## Current guideline stance

Current guidelines support NT-proBNP for diagnosis and prognosis but **do not recommend routine serial-guided therapy** due to insufficient evidence of outcome benefit [^b555d6bd] [^c0523a54]. They advise selective use in structured programs with careful interpretation and clinical judgment [^304ed90e] [^5d3b1b47].

---

## Future research directions

- **RCTs**: Large, rigorously designed trials are needed to test whether real-time biomarker-guided therapy improves hard outcomes [^655ac190] [^391594a5].
- **Thresholds and algorithms**: Define optimal biomarker targets, kinetics, and treatment protocols across HF phenotypes [^e500737f] [^19737282].
- **Integration**: Evaluate workflow, clinician response, and patient-centered outcomes to ensure safe, effective adoption [^655ac190] [^e10c5d62].

---

Real-time biosensing of NT-proBNP and troponin is **technically feasible** and biologically plausible for early detection, but **clinical benefit remains unproven**. It may enhance risk stratification and enable timely intervention, but **definitive RCTs are required** before routine use.

Background

Since 1988 with the discovery of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), many reports have confirmed the elevation of plasma BNP in symptomatic heart failure and confirmed that plasma levels are an independent predictor of death and cardiovascular events in both acute and chronic heart failure.

Methods and Results

A more slender evidence base attests that knowledge of plasma BNP levels can be used to produce clinical benefit. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that measurements of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with heart failure in the community. A second study demonstrated that the provision of plasma BNP data improves the speed of diagnosis and reduces the rates of hospital admission and length of hospital stay (while reducing the costs of care) in patients with heart failure who are seen the emergency department with acute dyspnea. Finally, a randomized controlled pilot study demonstrated that serial measurements of NT-proBNP can be used to more effectively optimize heart failure pharmacotherapy with a concomitant improvement in outcome.

Conclusion

The large body of observational data, coupled with this small but promising evidence base from controlled trials (which attests to beneficial effects on clinical outcomes) encourages an optimistic outlook for the further implementation of plasma BNP and/or NT-proBNP in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure.

### Implantable cardiac patch continuously monitors acute heart Failure biomarkers in Vivo and ex Vivo [^46d29041]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

As per the statistics published by Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), between 2024 and 2050, the number of Americans over 20 living with acute heart failure (AHF) is projected to increase by 70.1%, rising from 6.7 million to 11.4 million. Despite improvements in diagnosis and development of therapeutics for patients with heart failure (HF), the growth trend closely follows an exponential pattern, with an approximate annual growth rate of 1.8%.

Despite advances in targeted therapies (both pharmacologically tested and device-based), early detection of AHF remains a significant clinical challenge, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Because of the correlation of elevated levels of circulating cardiac biomarkers (eg, cardiac troponin I [cTnI] and brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) in predicting AHF exacerbation even in asymptomatic patients, their clinical significance is well-established. BNP and cTnI are indicators of ventricular strain and myocardial injury, respectively. Therefore, minor elevations in cTnI are associated with detrimental outcomes in both AHF and chronic HF populations. Similarly, BNP, a marker of ventricular wall stress and fluid pressure, is indicative of disease severity and prognosis. Real-time, sensitive, and continuous monitoring of these cardiac biomarkers has the potential to aide physicians with prognosis, developing effective therapies, and risk-stratifying patients.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic approach using natriuretic peptides in heart failure — It is easy to understand the logic for measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP as a support of clinical judgement, and both are unmistakably prognostic in acute and chronic heart failure; however, ambiguity and ambivalence remain regarding how to alter treatment based on abnormal concentrations. In acute heart failure, post-treatment natriuretic peptide values may inform alternative treatment strategies, but such strategies have not been validated. In chronic heart failure, lower NT-proBNP concentrations are linked to superior outcomes and reversal of cardiac remodeling, yet an algorithmic biomarker-based outpatient treatment approach remains elusive. Addition of other biomarkers such as ANP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, or soluble ST2 to NT-proBNP or BNP may help to better understand underlying pathophysiology and risk in chronic heart failure.

### Are serial BNP measurements useful in heart failure management? Serial natriuretic peptide measurements are useful in heart failure management [^e6dc4217]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

To deny the fact that standard HF care has substantial opportunity for improvement is at the peril of even worse outcomes in our patients affected by the disorder. We have presented a strong rationale for the value of BNP- and NTproBNP–guided HF management. Experience gained in biomarker-guided HF trials suggests that the approach results in improvement in the quality of care without an excess of adverse events related to more aggressive management. This alone is difficult to ignore given the gaps in care that exist between RCTs and real-world practice. Beyond this fact, studies examining the strategy of biomarker-guided HF care have shown substantial improvement in outcome compared with well-managed control arms, benefits that are confirmed in meta-analysis and pooled data analyses, and justifies the imminent launch of the pivotal RCT that will lead to more widespread adoption of the approach. Compared with standard management, biomarker-guided care appears cost effective, may improve patient quality of life, and may promote reverse ventricular remodeling. Although certain subgroups such as the elderly may respond in a less vigorous manner to the approach, this may reflect the effects of age on HF therapy and how the strategy is deployed in elders rather than a weakness of the approach in older patients. A fair-minded assessment of the available data suggests that care supported by BNP/NT-proBNP–guided HF treatment — as an adjunct to standard clinical acumen — is superior to standard care. The limitation of standard care strategies is evident from the suboptimal uptake and application of proven therapies documented in HF registries. Far from being a crutch to support what we should already be doing (namely, optimally evaluating and managing our patients solely with clinical means), the inclusion of NP measurement within the HF management strategy augments the quality of monitoring and treatment. Denial of the benefits of NP monitoring potentially retards advances in the care of a high-risk population of patients that continues to grow in size and importance every day.

### NT-proBNP and BNP: biomarkers for heart failure management [^df437df3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of heart failure (HF) are based on results from large clinical trials demonstrating benefit. State of the art pharmacological management of HF assumes that target doses should be the same as those used in trials. Thus equal doses are recommended for all in practical guidelines, but this strategy might not fit individual needs. NT-proBNP and BNP emerged as potential biomarkers of clinical interest in HF management. NT-proBNP and BNP are related to HF severity and to clinical status. NT-proBNP and BNP are strongly associated with prognosis across the whole spectrum of HF patients. A pilot study has shown that NT-proBNP-guided therapy is associated with improved outcome in HF. Although at present there are still few data to make firm recommendations on the use of NT-proBNP or BNP levels as biomarkers for HF management, future studies will provide further insight on this issue.

### Continuous molecular monitoring for precision heart Failure care [^d5d7fb0a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

The path toward commercializing a new-to-the-world biosensor platform is an exciting yet challenging endeavor. Current efforts are focused on hardening the biosensor hardware, developing additional molecular switches, and generating robust data through both internal studies and externally validated clinical trials. We believe that CMM will revolutionize the management and understanding of HF by providing real-time trends of multiple HF-associated biomarkers over extended periods of time. When paired with artificial intelligence–driven analysis, these data have the potential to reveal novel insights that remain inaccessible with current clinical approaches. Although our initial focus is HF management, our CMM technology can be leveraged across a wide range of high-impact applications. Potential applications include monitoring biomarkers for chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, enabling therapeutic drug monitoring and closed-loop drug delivery systems, developing real-time pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic monitors for clinical trials, and advancing fundamental research in both clinical and preclinical settings. By delivering a real-time biosensing technology platform that is generalizable across many different types of molecules, we aim to drive breakthroughs in patient care and reduce the economic burden across a wide range of conditions.

### Effect of natriuretic peptide-guided therapy on hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality in high-risk patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^93cb2641]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The natriuretic peptides are biochemical markers of heart failure (HF) severity and predictors of adverse outcomes. Smaller studies have evaluated adjusting HF therapy based on natriuretic peptide levels ("guided therapy") with inconsistent results.

Objective

To determine whether an amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided treatment strategy improves clinical outcomes vs usual care in high-risk patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Design, Settings, and Participants

The Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure (GUIDE-IT) study was a randomized multicenter clinical trial conducted between January 16, 2013, and September 20, 2016, at 45 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. This study planned to randomize 1100 patients with HFrEF (ejection fraction ≤ 40%), elevated natriuretic peptide levels within the prior 30 days, and a history of a prior HF event (HF hospitalization or equivalent) to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or usual care.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to either an NT-proBNP-guided strategy or usual care. Patients randomized to the guided strategy (n = 446) had HF therapy titrated with the goal of achieving a target NT-proBNP of less than 1000 pg/mL. Patients randomized to usual care (n = 448) had HF care in accordance with published guidelines, with emphasis on titration of proven neurohormonal therapies for HF. Serial measurement of NT-proBNP testing was discouraged in the usual care group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the composite of time-to-first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. Prespecified secondary end points included all-cause mortality, total hospitalizations for HF, days alive and not hospitalized for cardiovascular reasons, the individual components on the primary end point, and adverse events.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the study for futility when 894 (median age, 63 years; 286 [32%] women) of the planned 1100 patients had been enrolled with follow-up for a median of 15 months. The primary end point occurred in 164 patients (37%) in the biomarker-guided group and 164 patients (37%) in the usual care group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22; P = 0.88). Cardiovascular mortality was 12% (n = 53) in the biomarker-guided group and 13% (n = 57) in the usual care group (HR, 0.94; 95% CI; 0.65–1.37; P = 0.75). None of the secondary end points nor the decreases in the NT-proBNP levels achieved differed significantly between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In high-risk patients with HFrEF, a strategy of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was not more effective than a usual care strategy in improving outcomes.

Natriuretic peptides in HFrEF — BNP and NT-proBNP are the most studied biomarkers in heart failure and inform diagnosis and prognostication, with higher concentrations in ambulatory HFrEF indicating high risk, particularly when rising. Current clinical practice guidelines give a Class 1 recommendation to measure BNP or NT-proBNP to support diagnosis, assess disease severity, or establish prognosis. Trends in concentrations inform prognosis, congestion severity, and the trajectory of left ventricular remodeling and track with health status; thus, measuring BNP or NT-proBNP at each clinical evaluation may inform clinical decisions, with more frequent measurement appropriate during rapid medication titration or when symptoms are unstable.

### Prognostic impact of repeated NT-proBNP measurements in patients With heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction [^3b05784b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although clinical studies have demonstrated the association between a single N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement and clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure, the biomarker is frequently measured serially in clinical practice.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the added prognostic value of repeated NT-proBNP measurements compared with single measurements alone for chronic heart failure patients.

Methods

In the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) study, 894 study participants with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were enrolled at 45 outpatient sites in the United States and Canada. Repeated NT-proBNP levels were measured over a 2-year study period. Associations between repeated NT-proBNP measurements and trial endpoints were assessed using a joint longitudinal and survival model.

Results

After adjustment for baseline covariates, each doubling of the baseline NT-proBNP level was associated with a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08–1.28; P = 0.0003) for the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Serial measurements increased the adjusted HR for the primary trial endpoint to 1.66 (95% CI: 1.50–1.84; P < 0.0001), and a similar increased risk was observed across secondary trial endpoints. In joint modeling, an increase in NT-proBNP occurred weeks before the onset of adjudicated events.

Conclusions

Repeated NT-proBNP measurements are a strong predictor of outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an increase in concentration occurring well before event onset. These results may support routine NT-proBNP monitoring to assist in clinical decision making.

### Biomarkers in heart failure clinical trials. A review from the biomarkers working group of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^bd7d06f8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

The approval of new heart failure (HF) therapies has slowed over the past two decades in part due to the high costs of conducting large randomized clinical trials that are needed to adequately power major clinical endpoint studies. Several biomarkers have been identified reflecting different elements of HF pathophysiology, with possible applications in diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment monitoring, and even in the design of clinical trials. Biomarkers could potentially be used to refine study inclusion criteria to enable enrolment of patients who are more likely to respond to a therapeutic intervention, despite being at sufficient risk to meet pre-determined study endpoint rates. When there is a close relationship between biomarker levels and clinical endpoints, changes in biomarker levels after a given treatment can act as a surrogate endpoint, potentially reducing the duration and cost of a clinical trial. Natriuretic peptides have been widely used in clinical trials with a variable amount of added value, which such variation being probably due to the absence of a close pathophysiological connection to the study drug. Notable exceptions to this include sacubitril/valsartan and vericiguat. Future studies should seek to adopt unbiased approaches for discovery of true companion diagnostics; with -omics-based tools, biomarkers might be more precisely selected for use in clinical trials to identify responses that closely reflect the biological effects of the drug under investigation. Finally, biomarkers associated with cardiac damage and remodelling, such as cardiac troponin, could be employed as safety endpoints provided that standardization between different assays is achieved.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^da133555]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B-type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT-proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search Methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP-guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow-up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP-guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all-cause mortality using NP-guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP-guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all-cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP-guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD -0.03, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence). We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with heart failure low-quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP-guided treatment while low-quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP-guided treatment for all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all-cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low-quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

### Multiple cArdiac seNsors for mAnaGEment of heart failure (MANAGE-HF)-phase I evaluation of the integration and safety of the heartLogic multisensor algorithm in patients with heart failure [^e10c5d62]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction suffer from a relapsing and remitting disease course, where early treatment changes may improve outcomes. We assessed the clinical integration and safety of the HeartLogic multisensor index and alerts in HF care.

Methods

The Multiple cArdiac seNsors for mAnaGEment of Heart Failure (MANAGE-HF) study enrolled 200 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (< 35%), New York Heart Association functional class II-III symptoms, implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator or and implantable cardioverter defibrillator, who had either a hospitalization for HF within 12 months or unscheduled visit for HF exacerbation within 90 days or an elevated natriuretic peptide concentration (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] of ≥ 150 pg/mL or N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-proBNP] of ≥ 600 pg/mL). This phase included the development of an alert management guide and evaluated changes in medical treatment, natriuretic peptide levels, and safety.

Results

The mean age of participants was 67 years, 68% were men, 81% were White, and 61% had a HF hospitalization in prior 12 months. During follow-up, there were 585 alert cases with an average of 1.76 alert cases per patient-year. HF medications were augmented during 74% of the alert cases. HF treatment augmentation within 2 weeks from an initial alert was associated with more rapid recovery of the HeartLogic Index. Five serious adverse events (0.015 per patient-year) occurred in relation to alert-prompted medication change. NTproBNP levels decreased from median of 1316 pg/mL at baseline to 743 pg/mL at 12 months (P < .001).

Conclusions

HeartLogic alert management was safely implemented in HF care and may optimize HF management. This phase supports further evaluation in larger studies.

(A and B) Device integration and placement in dog and human hearts. (C and D) Continuous measurement of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in dog heart in vivo and artificially perfused human heart ex vivo. Artery was ligated after 60 minutes to mimic heart failure, and perfusion was stopped after 120 minutes to monitor change in concentrations of cTnI with sensitivity. DNA probe tagged with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control for measuring baseline dynamics.

In conclusion, our novel implantable coronary sinus biosensor represents a significant advancement in HF management by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of critical cardiac biomarkers. The device's ability to detect early elevations in troponin I and BNP offers a transformative approach to preventing acute decompensations and reducing hospital readmissions. Future studies will be focused on supplementing our exploratory findings with dynamic measurements of inflammatory biomarkers. Further clinically translatable and long-term studies will be essential to validate these findings and explore integration with existing HF management systems. We believe this technology holds substantial promise for improving patient outcomes and advancing bioelectronic precision cardiology.

### NT-proBNP qualifies as a surrogate for clinical end points in heart failure [^9fccdd64]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) is known as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for heart failure.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ In this study, we investigate whether NT‐proBNP concentrations qualify as a surrogate for clinical composite end points in heart failure trials. Based on data from 25 clinical studies and ~ 100,000 real‐world medical records, we demonstrate that across all subtypes of heart failure the NT‐proBNP event rate relationship follows an E max relationship.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Our quantitative model predicts mid‐term to long‐term event rates in clinical trials based on short‐term response of NT‐proBNP to treatment. The qualification of the model with data from five phase III heart failure studies demonstrates the quantitative accuracy of predictions.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ A model‐based use of short‐term NT‐proBNP response can replace pivotal efficacy event end points in heart failure trials and allows reliable assessments of probability of technical success already in phase II.

### NTproBNP-guided drug treatment for chronic heart failure: design and methods in the "BATTLESCARRED" trial [^4f7bf2e9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

How best to decide when to introduce drugs and what doses are optimal in individual patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), is unclear.

Aims

We will determine whether titration of drug treatment according to plasma NTproBNP is superior regarding clinical outcomes to intensive standardised clinical assessment; whether either of the regimens noted above is superior to usual care; and whether age alters the relative efficacy of NTproBNP guided treatment.

Methods

We will randomise 360 patients, stratified by age, to drug treatment directed by plasma NTproBNP, to intensive standardised clinical assessment, or to usual care. The primary outcome is total mortality, and secondary outcomes include death plus hospital admission for any cardiovascular event plus episodes of outpatient decompensated heart failure. Analyses will be conducted at the end of one and two years.

Results

308 patients have been recruited, the majority being in NYHA functional class II, 60.6% being > 75 years. The entry plasma NTproBNP level is 238, 50–1250 pmol/l, median and range, approximately 400–11,000 pg/ml.

Conclusion

We describe details of a study to test the potential utility of serial measurements of NTproBNP in adjusting the drug treatment of patients with CHF. Projected completion date is 2007.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^033faa4a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B‐type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT‐proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP‐guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow‐up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in‐hospital and out‐of‐hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP‐guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all‐cause mortality using NP‐guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence).

The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP‐guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all‐cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence).

Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP‐guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD ‐0.03, 95% CI ‐1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence).

We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' conclusions

In patients with heart failure low‐quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP‐guided treatment while low‐quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP‐guided treatment for all‐cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all‐cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low‐quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

### Troponin elevation in heart failure prevalence, mechanisms, and clinical implications [^e4d23fd6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Circulating biomarkers have become increasingly important in diagnosing and risk stratifying patients with heart failure (HF). While the natriuretic peptides have received much focus, there is increasing interest in the role of circulating cardiac troponin (cTn) in detecting myocardial injury (often subclinical) in those with HF. Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with chronic and acute HF may have measurable levels of circulating cTn, whose detection and magnitude may have prognostic implications. Furthermore, as new, more sensitive cTn assays are being developed, larger numbers of HF patients are found to have detectable cTn with a persistent relationship between magnitude and outcome. This knowledge improves our ability to understand the mechanism of worsening HF, improve risk stratification, and detect potential injury related to new therapeutics in HF. As investigators begin to understand the relationship of detectable cTn to HF outcomes, as well as temporal changes in its magnitude, and its relationship to other circulating biomarkers, more insight may be gained into the progressive nature of cardiac dysfunction and the transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated HF. Ultimately, this information might allow physicians to guide therapy, choose appropriate therapeutics, and improve HF outcomes.

5 Limitations

Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the heterogeneity observed across the included trials, particularly for composite outcomes and adverse events, complicates the interpretation of our findings. This variability may be due to differences in study populations, HF severity, baseline risk, and treatment protocols across the included RCTs. Additionally, variations in the frequency of NP measurements, target levels, and therapeutic responses in the NP‐guided groups may have influenced the outcomes. The inclusion of the STRONG‐HF trial significantly impacted the heterogeneity of several endpoints, suggesting that study‐specific factors might play a critical role in the overall analysis. Besides, the primary intervention focused on rapid optimization of HF medications rather than therapeutic adjustments explicitly guided by serial NT‐proBNP levels. NT‐proBNP was used for monitoring purposes, and its clinical trajectory was not central to decision‐making. This distinction limits the extent to which STRONG‐HF can be interpreted as evidence for NP‐guided therapy, and this has been acknowledged accordingly in our analysis.

Moreover, the follow‐up periods varied between studies, ranging from 4 to 24 months, which could affect the long‐term applicability of the results. Finally, while we attempted to mitigate bias through robust methodology, the presence of moderate risk in several studies, as assessed by the RoB 2 tool, indicates the possibility of bias influencing the results.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure — evidence summary indicates limited benefit for target-based reduction: Results of the PRIMA II trial demonstrated that NT-proBNP–guided therapy targeting an NT-proBNP reduction of ≥ 30% did not improve 6-month clinical outcomes. Observational data reported that 37%–47% of patients did not achieve the targeted BNP reduction of 30% despite inpatient therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, and failure to reach the targeted threshold for BNP improvement was associated with significantly increased risk of mortality. In a recent study, 44% of admitted patients did not achieve the 30% target BNP threshold and were at significantly increased risk for 180-day mortality compared to patients whose BNP levels responded to treatment.

Conclusion/discussion

Several biomarkers have been developed and their diagnostic and prognostic performances reported. The gold standard markers are the natriuretic peptides and hs‐cTn. Before widespread use of newer biomarkers in clinical care, either as diagnostic or prognostic markers, further research questions should be answered. It is currently not fully established how and why HF therapies and common confounding factors, such as age, sex, renal function, influence these markers, and what the optimal time of sampling is. In fact, the kinetics of even the best studied newer markers over time have not been properly defined in HF patients. Thus, to our opinion, there is a broad field for further studies to demonstrate that these markers reflect specific changes in disease severity or comorbidity, and such data will likely be essential for algorithms for biomarker‐guided therapy, beyond the routine biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides.

The GUIDE‐IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trialis a great example of a well designed biomarker‐guided study. However, the biomarker‐guided approach should probably be changed towards a pre‐set period of time in which the biomarker target level has to be reached well before the end of the study. For any future biomarker‐guided study, information is necessary for what is an expected response in biomarker levels after a medication change, so as to be able to preview the difficulty of attaining the targets on time. The question for future trials is whether attaining a specific target or perhaps an expected target is more realistic.

Clearly, it is ultimately required that patients should benefit from biomarker measurements. To answer the question whether the measurement of biomarkers contributes to an improved outcome in HF, randomized studies with treatment arms should be performed, with treatment allocation made by physicians that are unaware (control) or aware of the biomarker result. If these studies prove that the addition of biomarker measurements improve patients' outcomes, the concept of using biomarkers for routine use in clinical practice will be strengthened.

### Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide testing for inpatient monitoring and treatment guidance of acute destabilized heart failure [^b0713e6e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although typically elevated at presentation in the context of destabilized heart failure (HF), amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values typically decrease rapidly among patients who have a favorable response to therapy. Given this, it is natural to examine the relation between NT-proBNP and therapeutic interventions for acute HF. Both presentation and posttreatment NT-proBNP concentrations have some value for prognostication of recurrent HF hospitalization or death. However, the percent change in NT-proBNP after treatment for acute HF may be a more powerful method for risk stratification. Although prospective studies on the effect of NT-proBNP measurement in guiding therapy in acute destabilized HF are lacking, observational data suggest that a 30% decrease in NT-proBNP values during hospitalization is a reasonable goal. If a baseline measure of NT-proBNP is not available, an NT-proBNP level < 4,000 ng/L after acute treatment is an alternative goal. Because the criteria for determining restabilization from destabilized HF prominently include clinical and routine laboratory testing rather than NP measures, the frequency of NT-proBNP measurement should not be excessive in patients with acute HF, with measures at baseline/presentation and after perceived recompensation to evaluate for the desired decrease in NT-proBNP concentrations. A remeasurement of NT-proBNP may also be useful for evaluation of new or worsened symptoms. In those patients without a decrease in NT-proBNP despite perceived recompensation from HF, a review of adequacy of treatment, goals of therapy, and consideration of prognosis is recommended.

### Improved pharmacological therapy of chronic heart failure in primary care: a randomized study of NT-proBNP guided management of heart failure – SIGNAL-HF (Swedish intervention study – guidelines and NT-proBNP anaLysis in heart failure) [^5deeff81]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) guided by natriuretic peptides has been studied in clinical trials with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to investigate if N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided therapy in symptomatic heart failure patients in primary care would improve clinical outcomes over and above treatment according to guidelines.

Methods and Results

SIGNAL-HF was a 9 month, randomized, single-blind, parallel group study in patients with CHF in NYHA class II-IV, ejection fraction (EF) < 50% and elevated NT-proBNP levels (males > 800, females > 1000 ng/L). All investigators underwent a pre-study educational programme about current CHF guidelines. A control group managed by non-trained investigators was considered not possible for ethical and practical reasons. Patients were randomized to structured treatment of CHF according to guidelines with or without NT-proBNP monitoring. The choice and dose of therapy for CHF was at the investigator's discretion. The primary outcome variable was the composite endpoint of days alive, days out of hospital, and symptom score from the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. In all, 252 patients were randomized. The allocation groups were well balanced with regards to age, NT-proBNP, and EF. Treatment doses of beta-blockers and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were markedly increased towards target doses and to a similar degree in both groups. There were no differences between the groups concerning either the primary endpoint (P = 0.28) or its components [cardiovascular (CV) death, P = 0.93; CV hospitalization, P = 0.88; or symptom score, P = 0.28].

Conclusion

NT-proBNP-guided CHF treatment did not result in important improvements in clinical outcomes in patients with CHF in primary care above and beyond what could be achieved by education and structured CHF treatment according to guidelines.

### Role of biomarkers for the prevention, assessment, and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^71783f41]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Natriuretic peptides have led the way as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for the diagnosis and management of heart failure (HF). More recent evidence suggests that natriuretic peptides along with the next generation of biomarkers may provide added value to medical management, which could potentially lower risk of mortality and readmissions. The purpose of this scientific statement is to summarize the existing literature and to provide guidance for the utility of currently available biomarkers.

Methods

The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through December 2016. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or contemporary clinical practice recommendations.

Results

A number of biomarkers associated with HF are well recognized, and measuring their concentrations in circulation can be a convenient and noninvasive approach to provide important information about disease severity and helps in the detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and management of HF. These include natriuretic peptides, soluble suppressor of tumorgenicity 2, highly sensitive troponin, galectin-3, midregional proadrenomedullin, cystatin-C, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and others. There is a need to further evaluate existing and novel markers for guiding therapy and to summarize their data in a standardized format to improve communication among researchers and practitioners.

Conclusions

HF is a complex syndrome involving diverse pathways and pathological processes that can manifest in circulation as biomarkers. A number of such biomarkers are now clinically available, and monitoring their concentrations in blood not only can provide the clinician information about the diagnosis and severity of HF but also can improve prognostication and treatment strategies.

### High-sensitivity troponin and natriuretic peptide levels and outcomes after intensive blood pressure lowering… [^b3fcc28f]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Intensive SBP control led to large absolute differences in death and HF among patients with abnormal hscTnT and NTproBNP levels. These findings demonstrate that risk associated with elevation of these biomarkers is modifiable with intensive BP control. A prospective, randomized clinical trial is needed to evaluate whether these biomarkers may help guide selection of patients for intensive SBP lowering. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT01206062 Biomarkers that reflect chronic myocardial injury and neurohormonal stress have been shown to identify individuals with and without prevalent cardiovascular disease who are at particularly high risk for heart failure and mortality. 1–5 However, it is not clear to what extent this risk is modifiable.

All-cause mortality and HF were selected as primary end points because both hscTnT and NTproBNP levels are most strongly associated with these outcomes, 1–3, 11 and these are the outcomes most robustly associated with intensive SBP lowering in SPRINT. Furthermore, the reduction in the primary SPRINT end point was driven by significant reductions in HF and death from CVD with no significant effect on myocardial infarction or stroke. All end points were centrally adjudicated by investigators blinded to treatment assignment, as previously described.
8. A similar pattern of results was noted when NTproBNP was evaluated across sex-specific tertiles and continuously on the log scale.

In this ancillary biomarker substudy from a large randomized clinical trial comparing intensive vs standard SBP lowering, we found that elevated baseline levels of hscTnT and NTproBNP identified high-risk subgroups with correspondingly large ARRs in all-cause mortality and HF events with intensive SBP lowering. These findings were particularly prominent among participants with combined elevation of both hscTnT and NTproBNP levels. We observed that elevated hscTnT and NTproBNP levels, and particularly the combined elevation of levels of both biomarkers, identified subgroups of patients enrolled in SPRINT at particularly high risk for HF and mortality. Furthermore, this elevated baseline risk translated into large absolute risk reductions for mortality with intensive SBP control. These findings support development of a future trial testing the role of biomarkers in the personalization of blood pressure targets.

### NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: PRIMA II randomized controlled trial (can NT-proBNP-guided therapy during hospital admission for acute decompensated heart failure reduce mortality and readmissions?) [^352e10ef]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.

Methods

We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the impact of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (> 30% reduction from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels > 1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.

Results

Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP reduction of > 30% (80% versus 64%, P = 0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; P = 0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, P = 0.39). Guided therapy also did not significantly improve any of the secondary end points.

Conclusions

The PRIMA II trial (Can NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP reduction of > 30% after clinical stabilization did not improve 6-month outcomes.

### A current and future outlook on upcoming technologies in remote monitoring of patients with heart failure [^25d86610]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a major health and economic challenge in both developing and developed countries. Despite advances in pharmacological and device therapies for patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure, their quality of life and exercise capacity are often persistently impaired, morbidity and mortality remain high and the health economic and societal costs are considerable. For patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF, diuretic management has an essential role for controlling congestion and symptoms, even if no intervention has convincingly shown to reduce morbidity or mortality. Remote monitoring might improve care delivery and clinical outcomes for patients regardless of LVEF. A great variety of innovative remote monitoring technologies and algorithms are being introduced, including patient self-managed testing, wearable devices, technologies either integrated into established clinically indicated therapeutic devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or as stand-alone are in development providing the promise of further improvements in service delivery and clinical outcomes. In this article, we will discuss unmet needs in the management of patients with heart failure, how remote monitoring might contribute to future solutions, and provide an overview of current and novel remote monitoring technologies.

Cardiotoxicity baseline evaluation and biomarkers note that echocardiography is the principal technique for evaluating cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer, and routine use of radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA) has markedly diminished in recent years, with MUGA exposing patients to radiation and making echocardiogram the preferred modality for monitoring adult and pediatric patients; cardiac troponins are the gold standard biomarker for myocardial injury, and in an emergency department dyspnea study of 600 patients, increased serum NT-proBNP predicted acute congestive heart failure (OR 44; 95% CI 21.0 to 91.0, p < 0.0001) and NT-proBNP testing alone was superior to clinical judgment (p = 0.006), while elevated troponins and BNP/NT-proBNP have been associated with increased all-cause mortality and predict heart failure in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

### Rationale and design of the GUIDE-IT study: guiding evidence based therapy using biomarker intensified treatment in heart failure [^1ddeaac3]. JACC: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) study is designed to determine the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level of < 1,000 pg/ml compared with usual care in high-risk patients with systolic heart failure (HF).

Background

Elevations in natriuretic peptide (NP) levels provide key prognostic information in patients with HF. Therapies proven to improve outcomes in patients with HF are generally associated with decreasing levels of NPs, and observational data show that decreases in NP levels over time are associated with favorable outcomes. Results from smaller prospective, randomized studies of this strategy thus far have been mixed, and current guidelines do not recommend serial measurement of NP levels to guide therapy in patients with HF.

Methods

GUIDE-IT is a prospective, randomized, controlled, unblinded, multicenter clinical trial designed to randomize approximately 1,100 high-risk subjects with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%) to either usual care (optimized guideline-recommended therapy) or a strategy of adjusting therapy with the goal of achieving and maintaining a target NT-proBNP level of < 1,000 pg/ml. Patients in either arm of the study are followed up at regular intervals and after treatment adjustments for a minimum of 12 months. The primary endpoint of the study is time to cardiovascular death or first hospitalization for HF. Secondary endpoints include time to cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, cumulative mortality, health-related quality of life, resource use, cost-effectiveness, and safety.

Conclusions

The GUIDE-IT study is designed to definitively assess the effects of an NP-guided strategy in high-risk patients with systolic HF on clinically relevant endpoints of mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, and medical resource use.

### The role of natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for guiding the management of chronic heart failure [^56a4bc25]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

The current standard treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) is based on clinical judgment, with the goal of achieving the maximally tolerated therapeutic program. The complexity of this approach may contribute to the well-established treatment gaps that exist in HF management; consequently, the risks for morbidity and mortality in this population remain extremely high. Alternative means are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with HF. Natriuretic peptides are biological markers for HF disease — its presence, severity, and prognosis — and show unique interactions with therapeutics known to have benefit in HF. Accordingly, interest has recently developed in "biomarker-guided" care for HF. This approach involves applying these assays to identify patients in need of therapy intensification and to provide an objective "monitor" of disease status. This review examines the biology of natriuretic peptides, discusses the rationale for their use in HF, and details the aggregate experience gained thus far in biomarker-guided care.

### N-terminal fragment of the prohormone brain-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiovascular events, and mortality in patients with stable coronary heart disease… [^9cbb92a2]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

The addition of NT-proBNP level to standard clinical assessment and complete echocardiographic parameters significantly improved the area under the ROC curves for predicting subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Despite the potential of a plasma biomarker such as NT-proBNP to aid clinicians in risk stratification, questions remain about the added value of NT-proBNP relative to other available prognostic measures, such as traditional risk factors, left ventricular ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and measures of ischemia.

Demonstrating the additional usefulness of NT-proBNP level to these other measurements is particularly important for high-risk individuals in which testing with echocardiography, stress tests, and other biomarkers is common and unlikely to be replaced by a single test. We assessed the association of plasma NT pro-BNP levels with subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality in a cohort of 987 ambulatory patients with coronary heart disease. To determine the value of NT-proBNP level as an independent predictor of cardiovascular outcomes, we adjusted for other available prognostic measures, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular mass index, inducible ischemia, exercise capacity, C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin T, and New York Heart Association classification.

In an ambulatory population of 987 individuals with stable CHD, we found that NT-proBNP level predicts subsequent cardiovascular events and death, independent of traditional cardiac risk factors and other prognostic markers commonly used to assess risk, even when these measurements are used in combination. These findings suggest that a simple blood test for NT-proBNP level may aid in the risk stratification of high-risk patients, such as those with CHD, and may guide further testing and treatment strategies aimed at reducing future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We found that NT-proBNP level significantly increased predictive capability when added to standard measures used to assess risk. Furthermore, there was a linear association between NT-proBNP levels and future events among those at greatest risk; and NT-proBNP levels less than 100 pg/mL signaled a very low risk of future adverse events.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^04ea3423]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

ARNI-treated heart failure — prognostic value of NT-proBNP encompasses cardiac remodeling correlations and outcomes. In PROVE-HF, changes in plasma NT-proBNP were significantly correlated with changes in LV and left atrial volumes, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and parameters of diastolic function; both baseline and postrandomization NT-proBNP values, as well as changes from baseline to 1 month after randomization, had a continuous and highly significant relationship with the incidence of the primary outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalizations in PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF. Multiple study investigators have confirmed the high prognostic value of plasma natriuretic peptide levels in patients with heart failure treated with ARNIs, and plasma NT-proBNP levels are accurate markers of ARNIs' effects.

### Autoantibodies against cardiac troponin I in patients with congestive heart failure [^e01f8431]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

In this randomized, double-blind clinical study, we investigated the relationship between autoantibodies against cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and disease severity in elderly congestive heart failure (CHF) patients before and after titration of beta-blocker therapy.

Methods and Results

Anti-cTnI, cTnI, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in blood from 138 patients (73 ± 5.6 years, 48% male) with CHF in American Heart Association stages A-C were measured at baseline and after titration of beta-blockers to maximal tolerated dose. Median follow-up period was 85 days. Anti-cTnI was measured using an experimental assay (Abbott Diagnostics) and is expressed as a relative value unit (RVU) in relation to the mean value of a low-level control sample. Anti-cTnI values in CHF patients were also compared with measurements taken in a normal reference population of 300 healthy individuals (50% male). Cardiac troponin I and NT-proBNP levels were measured using routine assays (Architect Abbott Diagnostics and Roche Diagnostics). Median anti-cTnI was 0.53 and 0.56 RVU in healthy and CHF subjects, respectively (P = n.s.), and increased significantly to 0.67 RVU (P < 0.001) after beta-blocker titration. Mean cTnI values were 0.021 microg/L at baseline and fell significantly to 0.0046 microg/L at follow-up (P < 0.001). Median NT-proBNP values were 352 ng/L at baseline and 414 ng/L after titration (P = n.s.). In contrast to NT-proBNP and cTnI, anti-cTnI was not associated with the severity of CHF at baseline or follow-up.

Conclusion

Levels of anti-cTnI tend to increase in elderly patients with CHF following titration of beta-blocker therapy but do not correlate with disease severity. Anti-cTnI is not a useful biomarker for heart failure diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring. In contrast, levels of cTnI decreased following therapy and did correlate with disease severity.

### Universal definition and classification of heart failure: a report of the Heart Failure Society of America, heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Japanese heart failure society and writing committee of the universal definition of heart failure [^f5b0f0ba]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure — biomarkers in the definition emphasizes that natriuretic peptides, including brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone for brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are the most commonly used biomarker in heart failure (HF), yet despite high guideline support for diagnostic use they are largely absent from HF definitions; in contrast, myocardial infarction definitions centrally incorporate troponin. Access to natriuretic peptide testing is increasing and it is becoming part of standard care, but interpretation must be individualized because conditions such as chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, pericardial disease, pulmonary embolism, and aging can increase levels, and differences by race/ethnicity, sex, and age as well as atrial fibrillation–specific thresholds affect interpretation. In HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or obesity, levels can be lower than in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), complicating use. BNP and NT-proBNP generally track similarly and either can be used if their absolute values and cut points are not used interchangeably. BNP, but not NT-proBNP, is a neprilysin substrate, so angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor therapy may increase BNP but not NT-proBNP. Patient-level changes should be read against baseline because natriuretic peptides are higher during decompensation than during compensated periods, reflecting dynamic temporal changes.

### Management of chronic heart failure guided by individual N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide targets: results of the PRIMA (can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study [^0e5df755]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess whether management of heart failure (HF) guided by an individualized N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) target would lead to improved outcome compared with HF management guided by clinical assessment alone.

Background

Natriuretic peptides may be attractive biomarkers to guide management of heart failure (HF) and help select patients in need of more aggressive therapy. The PRIMA (Can PRo-brain-natriuretic peptide guided therapy of chronic heart failure IMprove heart fAilure morbidity and mortality?) study is, to our knowledge, the first large, prospective randomized study to address whether management of HF guided by an individualized target NT-proBNP level improves outcome.

Methods

A total of 345 patients hospitalized for decompensated, symptomatic HF with elevated NT-proBNP levels at admission were included. After discharge, patients were randomized to either clinically-guided outpatient management (n = 171), or management guided by an individually set NT-proBNP (n = 174) defined by the lowest level at discharge or 2 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was defined as number of days alive outside the hospital after index admission.

Results

HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target increased the use of HF medication (p = 0.006), and 64% of HF-related events were preceded by an increase in NT-proBNP. Nevertheless, HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target did not significantly improve the primary end point (685 vs. 664 days, p = 0.49), nor did it significantly improve any of the secondary end points. In the NT-proBNP-guided group mortality was lower, as 46 patients died (26.5%) versus 57 (33.3%) in the clinically-guided group, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.206).

Conclusions

Serial NT-proBNP measurement and targeting to an individual NT-proBNP value did result in advanced detection of HF-related events and importantly influenced HF-therapy, but failed to provide significant clinical improvement in terms of mortality and morbidity.

### Primer on biomarker discovery in cardio-oncology: application of omics technologies [^e6e2c30e]. JACC: CardioOncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Remarkable progress in cancer treatments has resulted in improved long-term survival. However, cardiovascular complications related to these therapies may result in treatment interruptions and worse oncologic and cardiovascular outcomes. Early diagnosis and management of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity are therefore critical for safe and effective cancer treatment and long-term survival. In this population, established clinical biomarkers such as cardiac troponin (cTn) and natriuretic peptides (B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]) have shown promise, but studies have been limited by variable sensitivity, relatively small study populations with low cardiotoxicity event rates, and inconsistencies in cardiotoxicity definitions and timing of biomarker ascertainment. Additionally, these biomarkers are not specific to drug-induced toxicity. Thus, there is a need to discover novel biomarkers to accurately identify at-risk populations, diagnose toxicity early, monitor disease course, and guide therapies, enabling the implementation of precision cardio-oncology. This paper provides a brief overview of the future of biomarker discovery in cardiotoxicity, translating novel omics technologies to the clinic.

### Essential components in natriuretic peptide-guided management of heart failure: an intervention synthesis [^19737282]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To identify the key components of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment interventions which reduced hospitalisation in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods and Results

We extracted detailed information on the components of interventions from studies of NP-guided treatment of HF identified in a previous systematic review. We used meta-regression techniques to assess univariate associations between components and the strength of the reduction in HF hospitalisations and all-cause mortality. A Bayesian meta-analysis approach was used to re-estimate study-level effects in order to identify the study with the most effective NP-guided monitoring intervention. Finally, we examined the intervention options common to the studies in which the 95% credible interval excluded no effect. We identified eight components of NP-guided treatment from ten studies. Univariate comparisons produced mainly equivocal results, but single trial choice and common components analysis led to similar conclusions. Using a predefined treatment protocol, setting a stringent NP target (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide of 1000 pg/mL or B-type natriuretic peptide 100 pg/mL) and including a relative targetwere potential key components to reducing HF hospitalisations using NP-guided therapy.

Conclusion

This analysis provides a description of the key components of NP-guided treatment which could help policy makers develop specific recommendations for HF management. Our research suggests that NP-guided interventions could be simplified, but more research in relevant health settings, such as primary care, is required.

### Clinical adoption of prognostic biomarkers: the case for heart failure [^72b59ee8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The recent explosion of scientific knowledge and technological progress has led to the discovery of a large array of circulating molecules commonly referred to as biomarkers. Biomarkers in heart failure (HF) research have been used to provide pathophysiologic insights, aid in establishing the diagnosis, refine prognosis, guide management, and target treatment. However, beyond diagnostic applications of natriuretic peptides, there are currently few widely recognized applications for biomarkers in HF. This represents a remarkable discordance considering the number of molecules that have been shown to correlate with outcomes, refine risk prediction, or track disease severity in HF in the past decade. In this article, we use a broad framework proposed for cardiovascular risk markers to summarize the current state of biomarker development for patients with HF. We use this framework to identify the challenges of biomarker adoption for risk prediction, disease management, and treatment selection for HF and suggest considerations for future research.

### Biomarkers for heart failure: an update for practitioners of internal medicine [^fe313f69]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have become an integral part of practicing medicine, especially in heart failure. The natriuretic peptides are commonly used in the evaluation of heart failure, but their role extends beyond diagnosis and includes risk stratification and management of heart failure patients. Newer biomarkers have arrived and are becoming part of routine care of heart failure patients. Both ST2 and high-sensitivity troponin have significant prognostic value for mortality, but also may assist in the titration of medical therapy. Procalcitonin can help guide appropriate antibiotic use in patients with heart failure. The ability to appropriately use and interpret these biomarkers is imperative to the care of heart failure patients, especially as these newer biomarkers become widely used.

### Trials of implantable monitoring devices in heart failure: which design is optimal? [^655ac190]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Implantable monitoring devices have been developed to detect early evidence of heart failure (HF) decompensation, with the hypothesis that early detection might enable clinicians to commence therapy sooner than would otherwise be possible, and potentially to reduce the rate of hospitalization. In addition to the usual challenges inherent to device trials (such as the difficulty of double-blinding and potential for bias), studies of implantable monitoring devices present unique difficulties because they involve assessment of therapeutic end points for diagnostic devices. Problems include the lack of uniform approaches to treatment in study protocols for device alerts or out-of-range values, and the requirement of levels of evidence traditionally associated with therapeutic devices to establish effectiveness and safety. In this Review, the approaches used to deal with these issues are discussed, including the use of objective primary end points with blinded adjudication, identical duration of follow-up and number of encounters for patients in active monitoring and control groups, and treatment recommendations between groups that are consistent with international guidelines. Remote monitoring devices hold promise for reducing the rate of hospitalization among patients with HF. However, optimization of regulatory approaches and clinical trial design is needed to facilitate further evaluation of the effectiveness of combining health information technology and medical devices.

### Long-term results of intensified, N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-guided versus symptom-guided treatment in elderly patients with heart failure: five-year follow-up from TIME-CHF [^09b63e13]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Therapy guided by N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels may improve outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), especially in younger patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. It remains unclear whether treatment effects persist after discontinuation of the NT-proBNP-guided treatment strategy.

Methods and Results

Trial of Intensified versus standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure randomized 499 patients with HF aged ≥ 60 years with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45% to intensified, NT-proBNP-guided versus standard, symptom-guided therapy into prespecified age groups (60–74 and ≥ 75 years) during 18 months. A total of 329 patients (92%) alive at 18 months agreed to long-term follow-up. HF medication was intensified to a larger extent in the NT-proBNP-guided group. During long-term, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve hospital-free (primary end point: hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.06; P = 0.16) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–1.13; P = 0.25) but did improve HF hospitalization-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.90; P = 0.005). Patients aged 60 to 74 years had benefit from NT-proBNP-guided therapy on the primary end point and HF hospitalization-free survival, whereas patients aged ≥ 75 years did not (P < 0.10 for interaction). In landmark analysis, there was no regression to the mean after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy. More intensified HF medication at month 12 was associated with better long-term HF hospitalization-free and overall survival.

Conclusions

Intensified, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve the primary end point compared with symptom-guided therapy but did improve HF hospitalization-free survival. Within the subgroup of patients aged 60 to 74 years, it improved clinical outcome including the primary end point. These effects did not disappear after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy on the long-term. This is possibly attributable to a more intensified HF medical therapy in the NT-proBNP-guided group.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c4f455e0]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Mechanistic and prognostic insights across heart failure stages — determinants of natriuretic peptide release and outcome thresholds. A common misconception is that concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP mainly reflect congestion in all domains; during stabilized disease, the main determinant of BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations is transmural wall stress, helping explain prognostication in stage A or B HF and strong associations with cardiac remodeling in stage C HF. Among acute HF presentations, following diuretic therapy, robust NT-proBNP reduction is strongly linked to subsequent favorable courses, whereas in stage C HFrEF without exaggerated congestion, early decrease in NT-proBNP to < 1000 pg/mL following adjustment by guideline-directed medical therapy was linked to a 74% reduction in subsequent cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization and greater improvement in LVEF by 1 year with larger NT-proBNP reductions.

### Circulating heart failure biomarkers beyond natriuretic peptides: review from the biomarker study group of the heart failure association (HFA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^c5ef5285]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physicians routinely use biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and management of patients with heart failure (HF). Established biomarkers such as N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) are integrated into the current European (European Society of Cardiology, ESC) and American (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA) guidelines. In the ESC guidelines, natriuretic peptides are advocated for their utility in diagnosis of HF, with particular value to exclude HF. However, most data regarding biomarkers in HF report on their prognostic utility, while recognizing these markers may not necessarily improve diagnosis or treatment. To improve performance, it has been advocated to use serial measurements or to implement biomarker guided‐therapies. Factors complicating clinical application of markers include fluctuation in biomarker levels at various time points in clinical decision‐making; for example, at the emergency department, prior to dischargeor in the outpatient clinic. Further, although biomarkers can both be used to assess high and low risk of adverse events, comorbidities and other patient characteristics including age, sex, coefficient of variation within an individual (biological variation), and kidney function potentially confound the biomarker result and its interpretation. Finally, few prospective trials have been conducted to test if biomarker‐based clinical decision‐making improves management or outcomes. As a result, the role of biomarkers in ongoing HF treatment decision‐making remains limited although it is universally accepted that lower peptide serum concentrations associate with a better prognosis. The role and best clinical use of established markers of renal function such as serum creatinine has recently been summarized elsewhere and is not discussed.

### Biometric and psychometric remote monitoring and cardiovascular risk biomarkers in ischemic heart disease [^3b40f6f6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) represent a heterogeneous population at variable risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). While secondary prevention medical therapy with statins, inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system, and antiplatelet therapies, combined with lifestyle interventions, are effective at reducing MACE, IHD remains the leading cause of mortality in both women and men in this population. 1 Furthermore, adherence to secondary prevention medical regimens decreases over time with a drop from 67% at 1 year to 38% within 5 years. 2

A precision medicine approach, using multiple timepoints to assess dynamic changes in MACE risk, may offer a more personalized approach to identifying individuals with stable IHD who may require intensified treatment. Biomarkers such as hs‐CRP (high sensitivity C‐reactive protein), NT‐pro BNP (N‐terminal pro‐b‐type natriuretic peptide), and u‐hs‐cTnI (ultra‐high sensitivity cardiac‐specific troponin I) may provide a better understanding of MACE risk at the individual level. Although higher levels of hs‐CRP predict MACE in community population studies, it has large intra‐individual variability over time that may not necessarily be attributed to cardiac inflammatory risk. 3 High NT‐proBNP and u‐hs‐cTnI values are predictive of heart failure outcomes, because these biomarkers are directly related to myocardial injury and stress. 4, 5

Because MACE typically occurs outside the confines of a hospital, remote patient monitoring (RPM) using biometric and psychometric indices has the potential to provide a precision medicine approach to monitoring MACE risk among patients with stable IHD. Wearable biosensors that monitor dynamic changes in physiologic and activity parameters, such as heart rate and step counts, may provide clinically useful and timely information about the changing health of patients with stable IHD. In addition to monitoring biometric indices with wearable sensors, smartphones now offer a platform to monitor psychometric indices, such as patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), offering another RPM data stream to complement objective physiological and activity metrics. The acceptance and availability of consumer‐grade biosensors continues to improve, driven by advancements in technology and reduction in cost.

In this study, we hypothesized that RPM measures, obtained using wearable biosensors and smartphone‐based collection of PROs, are associated with the primary outcome of levels of serum cardiovascular MACE risk biomarkers in patients with stable IHD. To our knowledge, this is among the first studies to associate RPM data, including biometric and psychometric parameters, with objective biochemical markers of MACE risk among patients with stable IHD.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^53ccaf3a]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was published in the Cochrane library.

Data searches and study selection

The same search strategy was used as in the original review(online supplementary appendix 1). The following databases were searched up to 27 November 2017: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Science Citation Index Expanded and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science, Clinical trials Registry and the WHO International Clinical Trials registry Platform. No restriction was made in terms of year published, language or publication status. All publications were independently double screened first by title and abstract and then by full text (JM, CB, AF). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

All randomised controlled trials (RCT) of NP-guided treatment of HF, both in and out of hospital setting, reporting a clinical outcome were included. NP is a collective term for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Studies compared NP-guided treatment to treatment guided by clinical assessment alone. There was no restriction on the length of follow-up. Participants less than 18 years old were excluded. The outcomes for the systematic review were prespecified. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while HF admission was the secondary outcome.

Data extraction and quality assessment

For each included RCT, data were extracted independently by two people and any discrepancies resolved by consensus (JM, CB). Data extracted included baseline characteristics (gender, age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria and descriptions of the intervention and clinical assessment arms including: NP biomarker used, target NP level and drug algorithms for uptitration of HF medication. Assessment of the methodological quality of the studies was made using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool. The outcomes were extracted as absolute number of events. If a study compared more than one type of control group, then the intervention group data were split equally between the control groups for both outcome events and sample size.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1a2f3ce6]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Analyses completed for the biomarker used suggested no difference between the biomarker used and between the main findings for both all-cause mortality and HF admissions. However, the subgroups for both biomarkers for all-cause mortality were no longer statistically significant (online supplementary appendices 9 and 10).

Sensitivity analyses were completed restricting studies to those with low risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessment and attrition. The GUIDE-IT studywas assessed to be low risk of bias for blinding of the outcome assessment and therefore adding these data in the sensitivity analyses found for both all-cause mortality and HF admission the effect continued to favour NP-guided treatment, but was no longer statistically significant (all-cause mortality: RR 0.92, CI 0.79 to 1.06; HF admission: RR 0.92, CI 0.81 to 1.4).

For the risk of attrition bias, the GUIDE-IT studywas assessed to be unclear and therefore provided no additional data to the original systematic review. Analyse restricted to studies with low risk of attrition bias showed similar results to blinding of outcome assessment for all-cause mortality and HF admissions, though it was no longer statistically significant for all-cause mortality.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c0523a54]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic use — measurement of natriuretic peptides is guideline-endorsed, but BNP-guided treatment has mixed outcome effects; in GUIDE-IT, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve outcomes versus usual care, and target attainment of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL was similar between arms. Guidelines "provide a Class I recommendation for measuring BNP or NT-proBNP for diagnosis or prognosis assessment in the management of chronic HF", and the GUIDE-IT multicenter randomized trial in high-risk HFrEF compared NT-proBNP-guided therapy with optimal medical therapy but "failed to show a benefit of NT-proBNP-guided therapy over usual care", with "no significant difference in the proportions of patients achieving the target of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL at 12 months". A GUIDE-IT substudy found that "patients with NT-proBNP levels less than 1000 pg/mL 90 days after randomization had better outcomes, regardless of achieved GDMT". Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) additions — "ARNIs, sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and ivabradine" — have shown clinical benefit accompanied by "reductions in NT-proBNP/BNP levels".

### Serial measurement of cardiac troponin T using a highly sensitive assay in patients with chronic heart failure: data from 2 large randomized clinical trials [^086909b2]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponins are emerging as important prognostic markers in chronic cardiovascular conditions like stable coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure (HF). Less is known about the relation between serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and future events in HF. We determined the association between changes over time in hs-cTnT and outcome in patients with chronic HF.

Methods and Results

We analyzed 5284 patients with chronic HF from 2 independent randomized clinical trials, the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) (n = 4053) and the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Insufficienza Cardiaca-Heart Failure (GISSI-HF) trial (n = 1231). hs-cTnT was measured at randomization and after 3 months (GISSI-HF) or 4 months of follow-up (Val-HeFT). The association between changes over time of hs-cTnT and various outcomes was tested in multivariable models. In both studies, increases in hs-cTnT levels over time were associated with age, diabetes mellitus, worsening of renal function (reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate), and baseline and increases in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations. Increases in hs-cTnT concentrations were associated with all-cause mortality (incidence rates, 8.19 [7.51–8.88] and 6.79 [5.98–7.61] per 100 person-years in Val-HeFT and GISSI-HF, respectively, with hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] of 1.59 [1.39–1.82] and 1.88 [1.50–2.35]) after adjustment for conventional risk factors and baseline levels of hs-cTnT and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Changes in hs-cTnT concentration modestly improved prognostic discrimination beyond baseline values for fatal outcomes only.

Conclusions

Despite very low circulating concentrations, changes in hs-cTnT concentrations over time are robust predictors of future cardiovascular events in patients with chronic HF but add limited prognostic discrimination.

### N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide-guided management in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: findings from the trial of intensified versus standard medical therapy in elderly patients with congestive heart failure (TIME-CHF) [^fb8a3795]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effects of an NT-proBNP-guided medical management on 18-month outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved LVEF (HFpEF).

Methods and Results

Patients with HFpEF (LVEF > 45%; n = 123) and HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 45%; n = 499) with age ≥ 60 years, NYHA class ≥ II, and elevated NT-proBNP (> 400 ng/L or > 800 ng/L depending on age) were randomized to medical therapy titrated only to reduce symptoms to NYHA ≤ II (symptom-guided) or also to reduce NT-proBNP below the inclusion threshold (NT-proBNP-guided) during a 6-month period. Patients were followed for an additional 12 months. Despite similar treatment escalation, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were less in HFpEF than in HFrEF. Hospitalization-free survival at 18 months was worse in HFpEF than in HFrEF (P = 0.02), while survival and HF hospitalization-free survival did not differ. Among HFpEF patients, NT-proBNP reduction and symptom relief were similar in the symptom-guided (n = 59) and NT-proBNP-guided (n = 64) group despite more aggressive treatment in the NT-proBNP-guided group. In contrast to effects in HFrEF, NT-proBNP-guided management tended to worsen 18-month outcomes in HFpEF, with P-values for the interactions between LVEF stratum and management strategy of 0.2 for hospitalization-free survival, 0.03 for survival, and 0.01 for HF hospitalization-free survival.

Conclusions

Outcomes in HFpEF were not better than in HFrEF, and opposite effects of NT-proBNP-guided management were observed in HFpEF compared with HFrEF. These preliminary findings suggest that, in contrast to HFrEF, NT-proBNP-guided therapy may not be beneficial in HFpEF. Trial registration ISRCTN43596477.

The Cardiosense Monitoring Platform, comprising the CardioTag and machine learning techniques, has the potential to provide a noninvasive alternative to implantable sensors and extend the benefits of hemodynamic-guided therapy to both a broader HF population (eg, patients classified as New York Heart Association functional class II and IV, patients classified as New York Heart Association functional class III who were not hospitalized in the last 12 months) as well as increase use in patients who are already known to benefit from a hemodynamically guided HF management strategy.

### Association of serial measures of cardiac troponin T using a sensitive assay with incident heart failure and cardiovascular mortality in older adults… [^41e7d92b]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context Older adults comprise the majority of new-onset heart failure diagnoses, but traditional risk-factor prediction models have limited accuracy in this population to identify those at highest risk for hospitalization or death. Objectives To determine if cardiac troponin T measured by a highly sensitive assay would be detectable in the majority of community-dwelling older adults, and if serial measures were associated with risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death. results. 6–11 Prior studies have used standard troponin assays that are only able to detect circulating troponin levels in a small proportion of individuals. 9–11 Recently, a highly sensitive cardiac troponin T assay has been developed, designed to improve low-end accuracy to meet and exceed myocardial infarction diagnosis guidelines.

12, 13 This assay has detected circulating cTnT in almost all patients with chronic HF or ischemic heart disease and provides independent prognostic information with respect to HF admission and cardiovascular death in these patients. 14, 15. In contrast, a decrease of more than 50% was associated with a risk-factor adjusted lower risk of HF and lower risk of cardiovascular death compared with those participants with 50% or less longitudinal change. Results were modestly attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for NT-proBNP and CRP. In previous studies of older individuals, detectable levels of cardiac troponins were present in approximately 4% to 8%, and predictive of increased risk of HF, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality. 9–11 Similar to studies in patients with chronic but stable cardiovascular disease, the application of the highly sensitive cTnT.

assay increased the proportion of community-dwelling older adults with detectable cTnT levels approximately 10-fold. 14, 15 Compared with studies that used conventional troponin assays, the markedly increased range of measureable cTnT in our study enables estimation of a gradient of risk across the majority of older individuals, including those with an absence of clinical risk factors, and also permits examination of the significance of changing cTnT concentrations. Previously, we identified in the same population that change in NT-proBNP levels over time augmented prognostication above a single baseline measure. 6 Taken together, these 2 findings suggest that serial measurements of both NT-proBNP and cTnT may improve risk assessment in elderly individuals.

Diagnostic algorithm for heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) classification — In patients with suspected HF, assessment includes clinical history, physical examination, and ECG and labs; natriuretic peptide testing uses NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL or BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL; transthoracic echocardiography is obtained with additional testing if necessary; after HF diagnosis is confirmed, determine cause and classify as HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), HFmrEF (LVEF 41%-49%), or HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%); then evaluate for precipitating factors and initiate treatment.

### Association of long-term change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide with incident heart failure and death… [^b6939f7b]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The use of serial NT-proBNP measurements can help to better risk stratify patients who may benefit most from heart failure prevention efforts. Importance Most studies, especially in primary prevention patients, have evaluated N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide at one time point. Evaluation of change in NT-proBNP may improve risk stratification for incident cardiovascular events. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, 6-year change in NT-proBNP reflected dynamic change in risk for HF events and death among community-dwelling adults without prevalent clinical HF. These results support the utility of serial NT-proBNP measurements to improve risk stratification of patients with pre-HF. Among individuals without cardiovascular disease, elevated levels of circulating NT-proBNP have been shown to be associated with incident clinical HF events, coronary heart disease, stroke, as well as CVD and all-cause mortality.

1–3 The use of biomarkers including natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins. In a study from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort, change in NT-proBNP over a mean of 3. 2 years was a significant predictor of coronary heart disease and atherosclerotic CVD. 22 Meanwhile, a study of participants with stable coronary artery disease from the Heart and Soul study found that 5-year change in NT-proBNP predicted HF events and cardiovascular death. 23 Similarly, an analysis of patients with recent coronary event and type 2 diabetes found that serial NT-proBNP measurements improved prediction of short-term HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death at 6-month follow-up. However, both of these studies included individuals with and without clinical HF. 24 We now show that the utility of serial NT-proBNP measurements in predicting risk for HF events and death among community-dwelling adults without history of clinical HF.

In this study, NT-proBNP change was associated with risk for incident HF events and all-cause mortality among middle-aged adults without clinical HF independent of cardiovascular risk factors. Persistently elevated levels appear to be associated with the highest risk, and decreased levels at follow-up are associated with a lower risk. Our results support the utility of serial NT-proBNP measurements to predict cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic community-dwelling individuals, especially among patients with pre-HF, and may help guide therapeutic interventions to reduce the likelihood of progression to clinical HF.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided heart failure management [^b4cca195]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The natriuretic peptides are important tools to establish diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure (HF). With application of therapies for HF, changes in both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino terminal cleavage fragment (NT-proBNP) parallel the benefits of the HF therapy applied. This dynamic nature of BNP and NT-proBNP relative to therapeutic intervention in HF has led to the concept of using the biomarkers as a 'guide' for intensification of HF care with a goal of not only achieving guideline-directed medical therapy goals accompanied by targeted natriuretic peptide suppression below prognostic thresholds. In studies achieving this combination of therapy optimization and BNP/NT-proBNP suppression, superior outcomes have been observed, and the approach was well tolerated. Natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy has recently been given a recommendation in US HF guidelines to achieve guideline-directed medical therapy (Class IIa) and possibly improve outcome (Class IIb), while other clinical practice guidelines (including those from the European Society of Cardiology) await results from emerging clinical trial data. We will review lessons learned in the past regarding this novel concept of biomarker guided HF care, and discuss future directions for the approach.

### The role of plasma biomarkers in acute heart failure. serial changes and independent prognostic value of NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin-T [^58d462b7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), NT-proBNP and troponins are useful for the assessment of patients with heart failure. Few data exist about their serial changes and their prognostic value in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).

Methods and Results

NT-proBNP and troponin-T plasma levels were measured at baseline, after 6, 12, 24, 48 h and at discharge in 116 consecutive patients with AHF and no evidence of acute coronary syndrome. NT-proBNP levels were 4421 pg/mL at baseline, declined after 24 h and reached their nadir at 48 h (2703 pg/mL). Troponin-T was detectable in 48% of patients. During a median follow-up of 184 days, 52 patients died or had a non-fatal cardiovascular hospitalisation. At a multivariable analysis including clinical and echo-Doppler variables, NT-proBNP plasma levels at discharge, detectable troponin-T plasma levels, and NYHA class at discharge were the only independent prognostic factors.

Conclusion

In patients with AHF, NT-proBNP levels decline 24 h after the initiation of intravenous therapy and troponin-T is detectable in 48% of cases. NT-proBNP levels at discharge, detectable troponin-T levels, NYHA class and serum sodium have independent prognostic value.

Conclusion

The current pooled evidence indicates a beneficial effect of NP-guided therapy on all-cause mortality and on HF admissions. However, despite the publication of the GUIDE-IT study, the largest in this field, there is still insufficient evidence to reach a definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of NP-guided treatment in the management of HF.

### Obesity and serial NT-proBNP levels in guided medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: insights from the GUIDE-IT trial [^a35dcb43]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Procedures

The GUIDE‐IT trial participants underwent extensive baseline testing and physical examination before simple, unrestricted randomization to respective HF management arms. Subjects were followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months for the remaining study period. Each follow‐up visit entailed the collection of blood for NT‐proBNP assessment locally (in biomarker‐guided arm only) and additional sample collection for centralized NT‐proBNP testing (in both arms) at the biomarker core laboratory in Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC. 31 The results from core laboratory assessments were not transmitted back to the investigators. The follow‐up visits also involved focused history collection, physical examination, and medication adjustment with the documentation of the rationale behind the adjustments. Although the specific medication adjustments were at the discretion of the treating physicians, prioritization of the neurohormonal antagonist titration was encouraged over diuretics in the absence of volume overload or congestion. 26, 31 The prespecified primary outcome for the GUIDE‐IT trial was the time‐to‐first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular cause of death, which was adjudicated by a blinded clinical events committee. The trial was discontinued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–appointed data and safety monitoring board at 81% of planned enrollment after 50% of planned primary end point events had occurred, as the study met the prespecified inefficiency criteria. 26

3 Results

3.1 Study Selection and Baseline Characteristics

The study selection is demonstrated in Figure 1. The initial search identified 761 studies (PubMed [n = 228], Embase [n = 438], and Cochrane [n = 95]). After title and abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 15 studies remained to be fully reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of these, 9 RCTs were included, comprising 3992 patients, of whom 2007 (50.29%) were treated according to NT‐proBNP guided. According to the eligibility criteria, six studies were excluded: one due to addressing a different research question, four due to overlapping populations, and one for not reporting the outcomes of interest. A full description of the eligibility criteria per study can be found in Table S1. The included subjects had a mean age of 68.79 years and were mostly male (62.8%). The follow‐up ranged between 4 and 24 months, with a median of 12 months. Study characteristics are in Table 1 and Table S2. Additionally, each study's composite outcome definition and target BNP for optimization criteria for the NP‐guided group can be found in Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### Rapid assay brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure (from the evaluation study of congestive heart failure and pulmonary artery catheterization effectiveness trial) [^1cbb9318]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Rapid-assay biomarkers may predict outcomes in patients with decompensated heart failure (HF). This study assessed whether rapid-assay B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I predicts length of stay and mortality and correlates with pulmonary artery catheter (PAC)-derived hemodynamics in patients hospitalized with acute HF. There were 141 nonconsecutive patients in this prospective cohort study of the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE), a randomized trial testing PACs in 433 patients with severe decompensated HF. Biomarkers were drawn at baseline and discharge and when the first, second, and final hemodynamics were obtained in 69 patients randomly assigned to PACs. Cox analysis was used to model mortality, length of stay, and rehospitalization, and Pearson's correlations were used to describe the relation among BNP, troponin I, and PAC-derived hemodynamics. The median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) BNP levels were 783 pg/ml (329, 1,565) at baseline and 468 pg/ml (240, 946) at discharge. After treatment for HF, the median BNP level decreased by 144 pg/ml (-653, 55; p = 0.004). Patients with baseline BNP levels > 1,500 pg/ml had greater mortality at 6 months and almost twice the length of stay as patients with BNP levels < 500 pg/ml (10.1 vs 5.7 days, p = 0.002). Troponin I did not predict these outcomes. First BNP correlated modestly with first right atrial pressure (r = 0.47, p = 0.005) and first pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (r = 0.54, p = 0.001). Final BNP correlated modestly with final right atrial pressure (r = 0.63, p = 0.001). In conclusion, patients with BNP > 1,500 pg/ml had greater mortality and longer length of stay than patients with BNP < 500 pg/ml. BNP decreased after hospitalization, but correlated modestly with PAC-derived hemodynamics. Rapid-assay BNP may provide information that helps physicians decide when to pursue more aggressive and invasive therapies.

Methods

Study design and patients

The background, design and primary results of the PARADIGM‐HF trial are published. 14, 15, 16 In brief, 8399 patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% receiving recommended treatment for HFrEF including an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta‐blocker (unless contraindicated) and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (if indicated) were enrolled. Patients were required to have a plasma BNP ≥ 150 pg/mL [or N‐terminal pro‐BNP (NT‐proBNP) ≥ 600 pg/mL], or a BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL (or NT‐proBNP ≥ 400 pg/mL) and a HF hospitalization within the past 12 months. The key exclusion criteria included intolerance of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, a history of angioedema, symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 100 mmHg at screening (< 95 mmHg at randomization), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and a serum potassium level > 5.2 mmol/L at screening (> 5.4 mmol/L at randomization). Patients were randomized to sacubitril/valsartan (formerly known as LCZ696) or enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, its components and all‐cause mortality. Of all patients randomized, 1907 (23%) were enrolled in a prospective biomarker substudy and had a measurement of high‐sensitivity troponin T (TnT) in addition to NT‐proBNP.

Definitions of diabetes mellitus and ischaemic aetiology

Diagnosis of diabetes at baseline and aetiology (ischaemic/non‐ischaemic) was based on investigator responses to the relevant questions in the case report form.

Outcomes

We investigated the association between TnT and NT‐proBNP, alone and in combination, and the primary composite outcome and all‐cause mortality.

Laboratory analyses

All samples were collected at the randomization visit. Sample handling and biomarker measurement using the Roche Elecsys NT‐proBNP (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and the fifth generation high‐sensitivity TnT assay (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) have been described previously. 17, 18

### Effect of B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment of chronic heart failure on total mortality and hospitalization: an individual patient meta-analysis [^e5656762]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Results

We identified 11 eligible studies (Figure 1, Table 1), – 8 of which provided individual patient data for all-cause mortality (n = 2000). – Based on excellent concordance between data provided for the meta-analysis and the original published reports, the quality of data was judged to be high. All studies reported endpoints on an intention-to-treat basis. For two studies, data from only two treatment groups (NP-guided and clinically guided) who received intensive clinical follow-up were considered for the analysis, whereas data from the third ('usual care') groups were not included. For two studies, complete individual patient data were not available but aggregate data on overall mortality were obtained from published reports (n = 2431 when aggregate data included). Finally, the ProBNP Outpatient Tailored Chronic Heart Failure Therapy (PROTECT) trial, while not providing overall mortality data, gave robust secondary endpoint results (n = 2151 for individual patients with data for secondary end-points).

Study characteristics

Figure 1
Flow diagram outlining search strategy, study selection, and reasons for exclusion.

Study characteristics

There were differences between studies regarding design relating to duration, target plasma level for the B-type natriuretic peptides, and treatment algorithm (Table 1), but all studies compared a treatment strategy guided by BNP/NT-proBNP with clinically guided treatment. The majority of studies used a single target BNP or NT-proBNP level for the NP-guided group. In two studies, age-stratified NT-proBNP targets were utilized. In one study, a target of ≥ 50% reduction in NT-proBNP was usedand in a further two studies an individualized BNP or NT-proBNP target was utilized based on levels at discharge from hospital. Treatment algorithms differed slightly between studies, but were all based upon stepwise up-titration of guideline-recommended drug therapies.

Patient characteristics

Patient characteristics for the meta-analysis cohort and for individual studies are summarized in Table 2. The average age of participants was 72 years and two-thirds were male. The majority of subjects had LV systolic dysfunction and only 10% had an LVEF > 45%.

### 2021: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure [^a2257c46]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

AATS expert consensus on coronary artery bypass grafting in ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure — biomarkers and emerging therapies are described as evolving, with biomarkers being evaluated but not yet defined for perioperative use. The role of biomarkers in the diagnostic and prognostic domains is evolving, and multiple biomarkers including natriuretic peptides, troponins, and markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and myocardial and matrix remodeling are being evaluated as promising tools in managing heart failure (HF), yet their role in guiding preoperative optimization and postoperative surveillance and follow-up remains to be defined. Despite promising preclinical data, application of stem cells to the treatment of patients with HF has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes and for now should be considered experimental, while other areas of innovation include state-of-the-art wireless monitoring and surveillance, and cardiac contractility modulation, some already in clinical use.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^5d3b1b47]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

ACC HFrEF decision pathway — natriuretic peptide monitoring and interpretation — states that in the setting of worsening symptoms, reassessment of BNP or NT-proBNP may be informative and measuring BNP or NT-proBNP is useful to monitor risk, guide imaging for LV remodeling, and provide objective data for referral. It cautions that sacubitril/valsartan can confound BNP because neprilysin inhibition may modestly raise BNP, whereas NT-proBNP typically decreases more consistently as it is not a neprilysin substrate; thus, in the context of ARNI treatment, NT-proBNP measurement may be preferable. It also notes that severe kidney dysfunction may interfere with natriuretic peptide interpretation.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without heart failure [^cee19c3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Early intervention for those with high cardiovascular risk is crucial in improving patient outcomes. Traditional prevention strategies for CVD have focused on conventional risk factors, such as overweight, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension, which may reflect the potential for cardiovascular insult. Natriuretic peptides (NPs), including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are well-established biomarkers for the detection and diagnostic evaluation of heart failure. They are of interest for CVD prevention because they are secreted by the heart as a protective response to cardiovascular stress, strain, and damage. Therefore, measuring NP levels in patients without heart failure may be valuable for risk stratification, to identify those at highest risk of CVD who would benefit most from intensive risk reduction measures.

Objectives

To assess the effects of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment for people with cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure.

Search Methods

Searches of the following bibliographic databases were conducted up to 9 July 2019: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science. Three clinical trial registries were also searched in July 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials enrolling adults with one or more cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure, which compared NP-based screening and subsequent NP-guided treatment versus standard care in all settings (i.e. community, hospital).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous data, and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data and to verify crucial study characteristics. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, two review authors independently assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included two randomised controlled trials (three reports) with 1674 participants, with mean age between 64.1 and 67.8 years. Follow-up ranged from 2 years to mean 4.3 years. For primary outcome measures, effect estimates from a single study showed uncertainty for the effect of NP-guided treatment on cardiovascular mortality in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and without heart failure (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.17; 1 study; 300 participants; low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis demonstrated that in comparison to standard care, NP-guided treatment probably reduces the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.68; 2 studies; 1674 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This corresponds to a risk of 163 per 1000 in the control group and 85 (95% CI 65 to 111) per 1000 in the NP-guided treatment group. When secondary outcome measures were evaluated, evidence from a pooled analysis showed uncertainty for the effect of NP-guided treatment on all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35; 2 studies; 1354 participants; low-quality evidence). Pooled analysis indicates that NP-guided treatment probably reduces the risk of all-cause hospitalisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.92; 2 studies; 1354 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This corresponds to a risk of 601 per 1000 in the control group and 499 (95% CI 457 to 553) per 1000 in the NP-guided treatment group. The effect estimate from a single study indicates that NP-guided treatment reduced the risk of ventricular dysfunction (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.91; 1374 participants; high-quality evidence). The risk in this study's control group was 87 per 1000, compared with 53 (95% CI 36 to 79) per 1000 with NP-guided treatment. Results from the same study show that NP-guided treatment does not affect change in NP level at the end of follow-up, relative to standard care (MD -4.06 pg/mL, 95% CI -15.07 to 6.95; 1 study; 1374 participants; moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that NP-guided treatment is likely to reduce ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular and all-cause hospitalisation for patients who have cardiovascular risk factors and who do not have heart failure. Effects on mortality and natriuretic peptide levels are less certain. Neither of the included studies were powered to evaluate mortality. Available evidence shows uncertainty regarding the effects of NP-guided treatment on both cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality; very low event numbers resulted in a high degree of imprecision in these effect estimates. Evidence also shows that NP-guided treatment may not affect NP level at the end of follow-up. As both trials included in our review were pragmatic studies, non-blinding of patients and practices may have biased results towards a finding of equivalence. Further studies with more adequately powered sample sizes and longer duration of follow-up are required to evaluate the effect of NP-guided treatment on mortality. As two trials are ongoing, one of which is a large multi-centre trial, it is hoped that future iterations of this review will benefit from larger sample sizes across a wider geographical area.

### N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in chronic heart failure reduces repeated hospitalizations-results from TIME-CHF [^8a36f583]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although heart failure (HF) patients are known to experience repeated hospitalizations, most studies evaluated only time to first event. N-Terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided therapy has not convincingly been shown to improve HF-specific outcomes, and effects on recurrent all-cause hospitalization are uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy on recurrent events in HF with the use of a time-between-events approach in a hypothesis-generating analysis.

Methods and Results

The Trial of Intensified Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Elderly Patients With Congestive Heart Failure (TIME-CHF) randomized 499 HF patients, aged ≥ 60 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%, New York Heart Association functional class ≥ I, I to NT-proBNP-guided versus symptom-guided therapy for 18 months, with further follow-up for 5.5 years. The effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy on recurrent HF-related and all-cause hospitalizations and/or all-cause death was explored. One hundred four patients (49 NT-proBNP-guided, 55 symptom-guided) experienced 1 and 275 patients (133 NT-proBNP-guided, 142 symptom-guided) experienced ≥ 2 all-cause hospitalization events. Regarding HF hospitalization, 132 patients (57 NT-proBNP-guided, 75 symptom-guided) experienced 1 and 122 patients (57 NT-proBNP-guided, 65 symptom-guided) experienced ≥ 2 events. NT-proBNP-guided therapy was significant in preventing 2nd all-cause hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.83; P = 0.01), in contrast to nonsignificant results in preventing 1st all-cause hospitalization events (HR 0.91; P = 0.35). This was not the case regarding HF hospitalization events (HR 0.85 [P = 0.14] vs HR 0.73 [P = 0.01]) The beneficial effect of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was seen only in patients aged < 75 years, and not in those aged ≥ 75 years (interaction terms with P = 0.01 and P = 0.03 for all-cause hospitalization and HF hospitalization events, respectively).

Conclusion

NT-proBNP-guided therapy reduces the risk of recurrent events in patients < 75 years of age. This included all-cause hospitalization by mainly reducing later events, adding knowledge to the neutral effect on this end point when shown using time-to-first-event analysis only.

### Biomarkers for heart failure: small molecules with high clinical relevance [^c41548b6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a rising epidemic due to the ageing population and progress in all areas of medicine. Thus, research efforts are made to ensure a timely diagnosis, to improve prognosis and treatment of the disease and to facilitate risk prediction at the population level. Because of their noninvasive determination with mostly high sensitivity and accuracy, circulating blood biomarkers are becoming increasingly important for daily clinical practice. Natriuretic peptides, especially B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (Nt-proBNP) and midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) and cardiac troponins are established blood biomarkers in HF diagnosis and prognosis of HF-related outcomes. Inflammatory molecules as C-reactive protein (CRP) may have added value in anti-inflammatory therapy guidance. Next-generation biomarkers including soluble source of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), galectin-3 (Gal-3) and diverse microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may have additional benefit in assessment of cardiac remodeling or differentiation of HF subtypes. Multimarker approaches containing different combinations of established and novel biomarkers might improve HF risk prediction at the population level once they are used on top of clinical variables.

### Biomarker-guided therapy in chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bcc11b82]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Measurement of circulating natriuretic peptides has been shown to play an important role in diagnosis and prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure. Whether serial natriuretic peptide measurements to aid in the titration of therapy can improve heart failure outcomes remains uncertain. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials to determine whether titration of therapy based on natriuretic peptide measurements improves mortality in chronic heart failure.

Methods

We identified potentially relevant studies through a search of MEDLINE (1996–2009), ISI Web of Knowledge (1996–2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1996–2009), clinicaltrials.gov, proceedings of major US and European cardiology meetings (2000–2009), and bibliographic review of secondary sources. Search terms were "biomarker", "natriuretic peptide", "B-type natriuretic peptide", "N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide", and "heart failure". Studies were included if they were prospective, randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic heart failure, they randomized patients to a strategy of titrating medical therapy based on the level of a circulating biomarker compared to a parallel control group, and they reported all-cause mortality.

Results

Six studies randomizing 1627 patients met criteria for inclusion. Pooled analysis showed a significant mortality advantage for biomarker-guided therapy (hazard ratio was 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.86) compared to control. There was no quantitative evidence of heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.42).

Conclusions

Titration of therapy incorporating serial BNP or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality compared to usual care in patients with chronic heart failure.

### NT-proBNP goal achievement is Associated with significant reverse Remodeling and improved clinical outcomes in HFrEF [^5f0efef0]. JACC: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aims to assess the association between biomarker-guided therapy and left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Background

In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), it is unclear if lowering natriuretic peptides reflects structural and functional changes in the heart. This study aims to assess the association between biomarker-guided therapy and left ventricular (LV) remodeling.

Methods

The GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) Echo Substudy was a multicenter study that randomized 268 patients with HFrEF (EF ≤ 40%) to either pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)-guided treatment or usual care. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline and 12 months in 124 patients. Remodeling indices and clinical outcomes were compared between treatment arms and by achievement of the NT-proBNP goal of < 1,000 pg/ml at 12 months.

Results

At 12 months, the changes in EF and LV volumes were similar between the biomarker-guided and usual care arms with no difference in clinical outcomes; however, lowering NT-proBNP to < 1,000 pg/ml, regardless of treatment strategy, was associated with a significantly greater increase in EF compared with those not reaching goal (9.9 ± 8.8% vs. 2.9 ± 7.9%; p < 0.001) and lower LV volumes. The extent of reverse remodeling correlated with the change in NT-proBNP: a decrease of 1,000 pg/ml was associated with an increase in EF of 6.7% and a reduction in systolic and diastolic volumes of 17.3 ml/m² and 15.7 ml/m², respectively. Adverse events were significantly lower among patients achieving the NT-proBNP goal (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Among patients with HFrEF, lowering NT-proBNP to < 1,000 pg/ml by 12 months was associated with significant reverse remodeling and improved outcomes. A greater reduction in NT-proBNP was associated with more extensive reverse remodeling. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).

### Serial biomarker measurements in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the importance of change over time [^be051c0a]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been used to estimate prognosis in heart failure; however, most studies have evaluated decompensated patients with single measurements. To determine if there are advantages to serial measurements, we evaluated stable chronic heart failure patients every 3 months for 2 years.

Methods and Results

A cohort of 190 New York Heart Association class III-IV heart failure patients was prospectively enrolled from June 2001 to January 2004. Primary end points were death, cardiac transplantation, or hospitalization. At study enrollment cTnT was < 0.01 ng/mL in 87 (45.8%) patients, 0.01 to 0.03 ng/mL in 50 (26.3%) patients, and > 0.03 ng/mL in 53 (27.9%) patients. An increase in cTnT above normal (< 0.01 ng/mL) carried a 3.4-fold increased risk (P = 0.019). Further increases (≥ 20%) from an elevated level worsened the overall risk (hazard ratio, 5.09; P < 0.001). BNP was elevated (> 95th percentile for age and gender normal population) in 122 (64.2%) patients. An elevation of BNP from normal at any time during the study was associated with a poor outcome, but, once elevated, further changes in BNP (increases or decreases) remained associated with the same risk (hazard ratio, 5.09; P < 0.001). Combined elevations of cTnT (> 0.03 ng/mL) and BNP defined the highest risk group (hazard ratio, 8.58; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Elevations of cTnT or BNP from normal detected at any time during clinical follow-up in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure are highly associated with an increased risk of events. Further increases in cTnT contribute to additional risk. Combined elevations of cTnT and BNP contribute the highest risk. The ability to monitor changes by serial measurements adds substantially to the assessment of risk in this patient population.

### Safety and tolerability of intensified, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide-guided compared with standard medical therapy in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: results from TIME-CHF [^a3a9f2e5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

NT-proBNP-guided therapy results in intensification of medical heart failure (HF) therapy and is suggested to improve outcome. However, it is feared that an intensified, NT-proBNP-guided therapy carries a risk of adverse effects. Therefore, the safety and tolerability of NT-proBNP-guided therapy in the Trial of Intensified vs standard Medical therapy in Elderly patients with Congestive Heart Failure (TIME-CHF) was assessed.

Methods and Results

A total of 495 chronic HF patients, aged ≥ 60, with an LVEF ≤ 45%, NYHA class ≥ II, randomized to NT-proBNP-guided or symptom-guided therapy and ≥ 1 month follow-up were included in the present safety analysis. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded during the 18-month trial period. A total of 5212 AEs were noted, 433 of them serious. NT-proBNP-guided therapy led to a higher up-titration of HF medication and was well tolerated, with a dropout rate (12% vs. 11%, P = 1.0) and AE profile [number of AEs/patient-year 4.7 (2.8–9.4) vs. 5.4 (2.7–11.4), P = 0.69; number of severe AEs/patient-year 0.7 (0–2.7) vs. 1.3 (0–3.9), P = 0.21] similar to that of symptom-guided therapy, although most subjects in both treatment groups (96% vs. 95%, P = 0.55) experienced at least one AE. Age and number of co-morbidities were associated with AEs and interacted with the safety profile of NT-proBNP-guided therapy: positive effects were more frequent in younger and less co-morbid patients whereas potential negative effects-although small and related to non-severe AEs only-were only seen in the older and more co-morbid patients.

Conclusions

NT-proBNP-guided therapy is safe in elderly and highly co-morbid HF patients. Trial registration ISRCTN43596477.

Why it is important to do this review

To date, five out of seven systematic reviews with meta‐analyses have demonstrated that NP‐guided treatment reduces all‐cause mortality in patients with congestive heart failure compared with usual clinical care (Felker 2009; Li 2013; Li 2014; Porapakkham 2010; Savarese 2013), especially in patients younger than 75 years of age (Porapakkham 2010). In 2014, Troughton et al (Troughton 2014) published an individual patient meta‐analysis and Xin et al (Xin 2015) published a meta‐analysis which contradicted this finding for all‐cause mortality in all patients. Uncertainty remains as to whether the monitoring of NP may lead to more harm than benefit compared with usual care. No other review has examined heart failure mortality. Fewer reviews have examined whether NP‐guided treatment increases or reduces heart failure admissions (Li 2013; Li 2014; Savarese 2013, Troughton 2014; Xin 2015) or all‐cause hospital admissions (Porapakkham 2010; Savarese 2013; Troughton 2014; Xin 2015).

Two reviews have examined adverse events (Li 2014; Xin 2015) and no review has examined the cost of treatment. Only Xin 2015 has examined quality of life data.

Monitoring with NP is recommended by NICE only for some patients by a specialist after hospital admission or when up‐titration of medication is problematic (NICE 2010). It is not recommended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline (McMurray 2012) due to uncertainty about whether it is a more effective approach than simply optimising treatment (combinations and doses of drugs, devices) according to guidelines.

In this review, we examined the seven outcomes described above and in addition included heart failure mortality, which has not been examined previously. In addition, we aimed to evaluate whether factors such as age, gender, severity of symptoms or stage of heart failure, and context of care (community or hospital) predicted whether a patient will benefit from NP monitoring, furthermore whether monitoring leads to a greater change in NP. However, only one of these pre‐specified subgroup analyses was possible due to lack of data or inconsistency in reporting for these factors. Four further subgroup analyses were considered post‐hoc: baseline LVEF, duration of follow‐up, type of control, and type of biomarker.

### Comprehensive in-hospital monitoring in acute heart failure: applications for clinical practice and future directions for research. A statement from the acute heart failure committee of the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^7a90fda7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

This paper provides a practical clinical application of guideline recommendations relating to the inpatient monitoring of patients with acute heart failure, through the evaluation of various clinical, biomarker, imaging, invasive and non-invasive approaches. Comprehensive inpatient monitoring is crucial to the optimal management of acute heart failure patients. The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines provide recommendations for the inpatient monitoring of acute heart failure, but the level of evidence underpinning most recommendations is limited. Many tools are available for the in-hospital monitoring of patients with acute heart failure, and each plays a role at various points throughout the patient's treatment course, including the emergency department, intensive care or coronary care unit, and the general ward. Clinical judgment is the preeminent factor guiding application of inpatient monitoring tools, as the various techniques have different patient population targets. When applied appropriately, these techniques enable decision making. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating that implementation of these tools improves patient outcome. Research priorities are identified to address these gaps in evidence. Future research initiatives should aim to identify the optimal in-hospital monitoring strategies that decrease morbidity and prolong survival in patients with acute heart failure.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide–guided discharge assessment and follow-up in acute heart failure — Natriuretic peptides at discharge reflect a more stable hemodynamic state and discharge values compared with admission are more appropriately related to both HF rehospitalization and mortality; measuring NP before discharge sets a baseline for continued longitudinal monitoring and allows individualized decisions on timing, frequency, and intensity of follow-up, with lower discharge values and greater relative reduction associated with substantially better prognoses, whereas higher or nondecreasing concentrations may merit close follow-up including home monitoring; evaluating relative modifications based on each patient's stable (dry) levels may be more informative than a single measurement, and a practical approach is to consider changes > 30% as clinically relevant.

### Continuous molecular monitoring for precision heart Failure care [^27d173bf]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

The monitor measures a HF-specific biomarker panel, including gold-standard markers such as natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide), electrolytes (sodium and potassium), and kidney function indicators (creatinine and urea). Unlike current remote monitoring solutions, such as weight scales or implantable pressure sensors, the HF Monitor provides quantitative molecular biomarker data, offering mechanistic insights into the patient's underlying cardiorenal physiology. Unlike implantable sensors, which are only recommended for a small subset of HF patients because of their invasive nature and high cost, our proposed device is minimally invasive and would be accessible to a broader group of patients. By enabling outpatient monitoring of this HF biomarker panel, our device provides 3 key benefits: it facilitates early detection of clinical deterioration to prevent readmissions, supports safer and more rapid titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), and expands access to advanced monitoring for patients in underserved or rural areas.

The core innovation behind the HF Monitor is a molecular switch technology that employs optically responsive, aptamer-based switches to enable continuous, real-time biomarker monitoring. These molecular switches undergo a highly specific and reversible binding-induced conformational change in the presence of the target analyte, resulting in a concentration-dependent change in fluorescence intensity. Unlike conventional biosensing approaches used in continuous glucose monitors, which are restricted to a few privileged molecules (ie, glucose, lactate, ketones, and alcohol) because of their reliance on naturally occurring enzymes, aptamer-based switches can be engineered de novo to detect a wide range of analytes. This adaptability allows the HF Monitor to address the diverse molecular targets required for HF care, integrating multiple biomarkers into a single device. As a proof-of-concept, we have demonstrated the capability of our prototype device to perform CMM across a diverse range of molecules, including glucose, potassium, lactate, and cortisol (Figure 1B). The platform's development is supported by over a decade of foundational research in aptamer science, biosensor hardware, and validation in preclinical models, providing a robust basis for its application in clinical settings.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f93ebbe]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

GUIDE-IT, the largest trial to date, published in August 2017, evaluating the effectiveness of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment of heart failure (HF), was stopped early for futility on a composite outcome. However, the reported effect sizes on individual outcomes of all-cause mortality and HF admissions are potentially clinically relevant.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to combine all available trial level evidence to determine if NP-guided treatment of HF reduces all-cause mortality and HF admissions in patients with HF.

Study Selection

Eight databases, no language restrictions, up to November 2017 were searched for all randomised controlled trials comparing NP-guided treatment versus clinical assessment alone in adult patients with HF. No language restrictions were applied. Publications were independently double screened and extracted. Fixed-effect meta-analyses were conducted.

Findings

89 papers were included, reporting 19 trials (4554 participants), average ages 62–80 years. Pooled risk ratio estimates for all-cause mortality (16 trials, 4063 participants) were 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.99 and 0.80, 95%CI 0.72 to 0.89 for HF admissions (11 trials, 2822 participants). Sensitivity analyses, restricted to low risk of bias, produced similar estimates, but were no longer statistically significant.

Conclusions

Considering all the evidence to date, the pooled effects suggest that NP-guided treatment is beneficial in reducing HF admissions and all-cause mortality. However, there is still insufficient high-quality evidence to make definitive recommendations on the use of NP-guided treatment in clinical practice.

### Implantable cardiac patch continuously monitors acute heart Failure biomarkers in Vivo and ex Vivo [^a18d2e01]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

However, despite their diagnostic value, current methods are highly dependent on systemic blood sampling at discrete time intervals, which makes little sense in the context of AHF and, in turn, delays detection and intervention. Current implantable devices for HF management, such as pulmonary artery pressure monitors, do not assess any physiologically relevant biochemical markers of myocardial injury, underscoring a critical gap in continuous cardiac monitoring technology.

This gap is addressed in this study by developing a novel implantable biosensor system designed for placement in the coronary sinus to continuously monitor cTnI and BNP levels. The coronary sinus offers a strategically advantageous perspective for detecting early biochemical changes within the myocardium because of its role in transferring deoxygenated blood from most of the myocardium to the right atrium. The unique vantage point also allows for the detection of subtle inflammation biomarkers indicating subendocardial ischemia and cardiomyocyte necrosis before they appear in systemic circulation, enabling timely intervention. The implantable biosensor mentioned in this study leverages advanced lithography and electrochemical sensing technologies to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in detecting biomarker fluctuations in the heart during HF while invoking minimal immunogenic response from the host. The integrated platform has the potential to offer clinicians a comprehensive view of myocardial health of patients, enabling preemptive and rightful adjustments in therapy to mitigate decompensations. By integrating bioelectronics with a patient's physiological data, and utilizing transvenous catheterization, this technology offers a safer alternative to direct cardiac implantation while effectively supporting patient care.

We have performed pilot studies (Figure 1) with wired flexible devices to obtain preclinical data and evaluate the performance of our implantable biosensor in both in vivo and ex vivo models. In vivo testing was conducted in a canine model (n = 2), where the device was implanted in the coronary sinus, and continuous monitoring was performed over a 2-hour period. Induced myocardial ischemia led to detectable increases in troponin I and BNP almost instantaneously, preceding systemic biomarker elevations by several hours. Ex vivo testing was performed using perfused human heart tissue obtained from transplant discards (n = 2), demonstrating the device's sensitivity and responsiveness to incremental biochemical changes in a human myocardial environment. Across both models, the biosensor exhibited excellent stability, specificity, and Biocompatibility, with minimal inflammatory response noted at the implantation site.

### Natriuretic peptide response and outcomes in chronic heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^69c59905]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The GUIDE-IT (GUIDing Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) trial demonstrated that a strategy to "guide" application of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) by reducing amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was not superior to GDMT alone.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the prognostic meaning of NT-proBNP changes following heart failure (HF) therapy intensification relative to the goal NT-proBNP value of 1,000 pg/ml explored in the GUIDE-IT trial.

Methods

A total of 638 study participants were included who were alive and had available NT-proBNP results 90 days after randomization. Rates of subsequent cardiovascular (CV) death/HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality during follow-up and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall scores were analyzed.

Results

A total of 198 (31.0%) subjects had an NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml at 90 days with no difference in achievement of NT-proBNP goal between the biomarker-guided and usual care arms. NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml by 90 days was associated with longer freedom from CV/HF hospitalization or all-cause mortality (p < 0.001 for both) and lower adjusted hazard of subsequent HF hospitalization/CV death (hazard ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.46; p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.34; 95% confidence interval: 0.15 to 0.77; p = 0.009). Regardless of elevated baseline concentration, an NT-proBNP ≤ 1,000 pg/ml at 90 days was associated with better outcomes and significantly better KCCQ overall scores (p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction whose NT-proBNP levels decreased to ≤ 1,000 pg/ml during GDMT had better outcomes. These findings may help to understand the results of the GUIDE-IT trial. (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment [GUIDE-IT]; NCT01685840).
