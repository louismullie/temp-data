## Question

Asymptomatic chollithiasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining asymptomatic cholelithiasis and confirming the natural history and risk of progression. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for expectant management versus prophylactic cholecystectomy. Next, I will examine exceptions where surgery is indicated despite no symptoms. After that, I need to review the evidence base, including randomized trials and meta-analyses. I will then consider special populations such as bariatric surgery, transplantation, cirrhosis, pediatrics, and sickle cell disease. Finally, I should outline a practical follow-up and counseling plan and synthesize a clear recommendation with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't anchor on a misclassification. Asymptomatic cholelithiasis refers to gallstones detected incidentally without biliary colic, dyspepsia, or complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis, and it accounts for roughly 50–70% of gallstone carriers in Western populations, with most remaining asymptomatic over time [^1139hJt7] [^113NB7Ht]. I should double-check the progression risk: the annual rate of developing symptoms is about 2–4%, translating to a 5‑year cumulative risk around 10–20%, and the annual risk of serious complications is low, on the order of 1–3% once symptoms begin, which supports a conservative approach in truly asymptomatic patients [^113NB7Ht].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure my initial inclination aligns with consensus. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do any major societies recommend routine prophylactic cholecystectomy for silent stones? The European Association for the Study of the Liver explicitly recommends against routine treatment of asymptomatic gallbladder stones, and the American College of Gastroenterology advises against routine cholecystectomy in asymptomatic patients, aligning with AAFP guidance favoring expectant management in most cases [^113gkusG] [^111bET28] [^1118opvp]. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking nuances; these recommendations consistently emphasize observation unless specific high-risk features are present, which will guide the exceptions I'll consider next [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp].

> Now, I will examine the exceptions where prophylactic cholecystectomy may be warranted despite no symptoms, and I should verify each against guidelines and evidence. Porcelain gallbladder carries an increased malignancy risk and is a recognized exception where cholecystectomy can be considered, and gallstones larger than 3 cm are associated with higher cancer risk and may justify prophylaxis in selected patients [^113CcsCs] [^113KdHCe]. Patients with sickle cell disease have higher complication rates and some expert groups support prophylactic cholecystectomy, though high-quality pediatric evidence is limited and watchful waiting is also endorsed in broader hematology guidance, so I should frame this as individualized and center-dependent [^116pcFZ3] [^113tfmp2]. In patients with known gallstones undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, access to ERCP is compromised; guidelines suggest considering prophylactic cholecystectomy in this specific anatomy because future ductal issues are harder to manage endoscopically, whereas sleeve gastrectomy patients generally do not require routine prophylaxis [^114KgY87] [^111CEsXF]. For transplant candidates, I initially thought immunosuppression mandates prophylactic cholecystectomy; wait, let me verify — data in renal transplant candidates did not show increased morbidity with expectant management, and heart transplant cohorts similarly support watchful waiting, so routine prophylaxis is not indicated solely for transplant status [^111AkmNo] [^113chKfm]. Finally, in cirrhosis, asymptomatic gallstones should not be treated, and if cholecystectomy is needed, it is generally safe in Child-Pugh A/B but high risk in Child-Pugh C, reinforcing a conservative stance in silent disease [^11363sjb].

> I should now review the evidence base to ensure my recommendations are grounded beyond guidelines. The Cochrane review found no randomized trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no surgery in asymptomatic patients, underscoring the lack of direct RCT evidence for prophylactic surgery in silent stones, which strengthens the case for observation as standard care [^111mY8sM]. Observational cohorts suggest a low annual symptom progression around 1–2% and rare complications in the absence of preceding biliary colic, supporting expectant management when patients are counseled appropriately [^113KdHCe]. But wait, what if I'm conflating symptomatic and asymptomatic data? The C-GALL trial addressed uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease and found no short-term quality-of-life advantage for early cholecystectomy over conservative management, with lower costs for observation; while not directly applicable to asymptomatic patients, it reinforces that many gallstone-related symptoms can be managed without immediate surgery and highlights the importance of shared decision-making and realistic expectations about outcomes [^114StrkJ] [^112N6ZkR]. I should also note that older comparative studies of observation versus surgery in symptomatic cohorts showed higher complication rates with delayed surgery, reminding me not to overgeneralize those findings to asymptomatic populations where baseline risk is fundamentally different [^114RF6Bn].

> Let me consider special populations more granularly so I don't miss context-specific nuances. In bariatric surgery, I should confirm that routine prophylactic cholecystectomy is not recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, whereas urodeoxycholic acid prophylaxis during rapid weight loss is reasonable; for RYGB or BPD/DS, the altered anatomy justifies a lower threshold for concomitant cholecystectomy in selected patients with known stones, but even there, data suggest many remain asymptomatic and can be observed with UDCA and selective surgery [^1148Efi7] [^116zsw7r] [^114KgY87]. In pediatrics, I need to check whether asymptomatic children are managed like adults; evidence is heterogeneous and many centers favor expectant management unless hemolytic disease or other high-risk features are present, so I should avoid extrapolating adult guidance wholesale to children [^11247nbf] [^116GMBC8]. For patients with HIV on atazanavir, I should remember that atazanavir-associated cholelithiasis has been reported; if symptoms occur, temporary interruption and supportive care are reasonable, but this does not convert silent stones into an indication for prophylactic cholecystectomy by itself [^112Xuboj] [^112vkaWK].

> Next, I should review a practical follow-up and counseling plan so the management is clinically coherent. I need to ensure patients understand warning symptoms such as episodic RUQ or epigastric pain lasting more than 30 minutes, fever, jaundice, or persistent nausea, and provide clear return precautions; education reduces delayed presentation if complications arise [^notfound]. Routine scheduled imaging is not necessary for asymptomatic patients, but a one-time follow-up ultrasound at 6–12 months can be reasonable to confirm stability, with further imaging only if symptoms develop; this cadence balances reassurance with avoidance of unnecessary tests [^1148Efi7]. I should confirm that lifestyle counseling on weight management and dietary patterns is offered, as obesity and metabolic risk factors correlate with gallstone formation and symptom progression, even though specific dietary interventions have limited evidence for stone dissolution in established disease [^116cDaCF].

> I will now examine the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating certainty. For the vast majority of adults with truly asymptomatic cholelithiasis, expectant management with patient education and selective follow-up is the evidence-based, guideline-concordant approach; prophylactic cholecystectomy should be reserved for well-defined exceptions such as porcelain gallbladder, very large stones, specific high-risk populations like those with altered post-bypass anatomy, or selected patients with sickle cell disease in centers with appropriate expertise, while transplant candidates and cirrhotic patients generally do not require prophylaxis based on immunosuppression or cirrhosis alone [^113gkusG] [^113CcsCs] [^114KgY87] [^11363sjb]. Hold on, I should verify that I've emphasized shared decision-making and the possibility of persistent or non-biliary symptoms after cholecystectomy; up to 20–40% of patients may have ongoing pain after surgery, so expectations must be calibrated before any elective intervention, even in symptomatic cohorts, reinforcing caution about prophylactic operations in silent disease [^113YkQDf] [^111tpmf5].

> Final recommendation: Do not offer routine cholecystectomy for asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Manage expectantly with education on biliary symptoms, lifestyle counseling, and optional one-time ultrasound follow-up at 6–12 months if clinically useful, reserving prophylactic cholecystectomy for specific high-risk scenarios such as porcelain gallbladder, gallstones larger than 3 cm, or patients with known stones undergoing RYGB/BPD/DS where future endoscopic access is limited, while individualizing decisions in sickle cell disease and avoiding prophylaxis solely for transplant candidacy or cirrhosis in the absence of other indications [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp] [^113CcsCs] [^114KgY87] [^11363sjb].

---

Asymptomatic cholelithiasis is common and typically benign, with a **2–4% annual risk** of developing symptoms or complications [^113NB7Ht]. Routine cholecystectomy is **not indicated**; expectant management with patient education and ultrasound follow-up is recommended [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp]. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is only considered for **high-risk patients** — such as those with porcelain gallbladder, gallstones > 3 cm, sickle cell disease, or those undergoing bariatric surgery with altered anatomy — due to higher complication risks [^113CcsCs] [^113KdHCe] [^114KgY87]. If symptoms or complications develop, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment [^117UtTyq].

---

## Epidemiology and natural history

- **Prevalence**: Gallstones are present in 10–15% of adults, with 50–70% asymptomatic [^114e6DNR] [^1139hJt7].
- **Symptom progression**: Annual risk of symptoms or complications is 2–4% [^113NB7Ht]; cumulative 5-year risk is 7–27% [^1169MDEf].
- **Complications**: Acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis can occur but are less common without prior biliary colic [^113NB7Ht].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Expectant management**: Recommended for asymptomatic patients; no routine treatment or prophylactic cholecystectomy [^113gkusG] [^1118opvp].
- **Patient education**: Teach recognition of biliary colic and red flags (fever, jaundice, persistent pain) [^113KdHCe].
- **Follow-up**: Periodic clinical review; ultrasound if symptoms develop [^1115ZyaN].

---

## Indications for prophylactic cholecystectomy

Prophylactic cholecystectomy is **not routine** but may be considered for select high-risk patients:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Porcelain gallbladder | Increased gallbladder cancer risk [^notfound] |
| Gallstones > 3 cm | Higher cancer risk [^113KdHCe] |
| Sickle cell disease | Higher complication risk [^113KdHCe] |
| Bariatric surgery (RYGB, BPD/DS) | Altered anatomy complicates future ERCP [^114KgY87] |
| Immunocompromised patients | Higher infection/complication risk |

---

## Risks and benefits of surgical intervention

### Benefits

Benefits include **definitive cure** — eliminating gallstones and preventing future episodes — and a **low recurrence** rate, as surgery prevents gallstone-related symptoms and complications.

---

### Risks

- **Operative risks**: Bleeding, infection, bile duct injury, anesthesia complications [^114xLqT4].
- **Post-cholecystectomy syndrome**: Persistent symptoms in 10–40% [^113YkQDf] [^111tpmf5].
- **Cost and recovery**: Higher cost and recovery time vs observation [^117Wmhqx].

---

## Conservative management and follow-up

Conservative management centers on **observation** with periodic clinical review and ultrasound only if symptoms arise [^1118opvp]. Dietary modifications — such as a low-fat diet — may reduce symptoms if they develop. Patient education should emphasize symptom recognition and when to seek care [^113KdHCe].

---

## Special populations

- **Pediatric patients**: Management is heterogeneous; many are managed conservatively unless symptomatic or high risk [^11247nbf].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher surgical risk; observation is often preferred unless high-risk features are present [^1169MDEf].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher complication risk; individualized decisions required [^111wxMjc].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Asymptomatic cholelithiasis is common and usually benign; **expectant management is appropriate** for most patients, with prophylactic cholecystectomy reserved for high-risk scenarios. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred if symptoms or complications develop [^114HEYrU] [^117UtTyq].

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — management of associated intra-abdominal nonvascular disease notes that cholelithiasis is the most common abdominal disease, with a prevalence of 5% to 20%, and asymptomatic cholelithiasis should be left untreated because the risk of acute cholecystitis after elective AAA repair is < 1%; in the presence of a large aneurysm, treatment of a colorectal tumor takes precedence with impending obstruction, bleeding, or perforation, otherwise colon resection should be delayed for 4 to 6 weeks after AAA repair, and simultaneous resection of ovarian or renal tumors may be considered if a staged minimally invasive treatment is not feasible.

Symptomatic cholelithiasis and functional disorders of the biliary tract present with similar signs and symptoms. The functional disorders of the biliary tract include functional gallbladder disorder, dyskinesia, and the sphincter of Oddi disorders. Although the diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis are relatively straightforward, the diagnosis and treatment of functional disorders can be much more challenging. Many aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of functional disorders are in need of further study. This article discusses uncomplicated gallstone disease and the functional disorders of the biliary tract to emphasize and update the essential components of diagnosis and management.

Discussion

Relevant reports on managing asymptomatic CBDS discovered intraoperatively either by intraoperative cholangiogram or intraoperative ultrasound favour a wait-and-see strategy or managing asymptomatic CBDS diagnosed preoperatively by offering duct clearance either before LC or during an LC session.

In this study, we aimed to manage patients who presented with gallbladder stones with asymptomatic CBDS as two different entities, with a wait-and-see strategy for the treatment of asymptomatic CBDS and cholecystectomy for gallbladder stones.

There is general acceptance about the management of symptomatic or complicated common bile duct stones by endoscopic, laparoscopic, or even open surgical management of common bile duct stones; the choice of treatment is affected by many factors, including the timing of presentation, gall bladder status (pre- or post-cholecystectomy), availability of expertise and size of the stones.

The acceptance of managing symptomatic common bile duct stones (CBDS) has become a subject of dispute and contention in regard to quiet CBD stones. These stones may be detected during cholecystectomy using intraoperative ultrasonography or intraoperative cholangiogram, or they may be found incidentally during abdominal scanning for unrelated reasons.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most common accepted method for the management of CBDS, and many reports have revealed an increased incidence of procedure-related complications, especially post ERCP pancreatitis (PEP), in the management of asymptomatic CBDS in comparison to symptomatic CBDS and an increased incidence of PEP in asymptomatic CBD stones compared to symptomatic CBD stones (11/67 [16.4%] vs. 8/358 [2.2%], respectively).

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114StrkJ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the prevention of symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

Design

Parallel group, pragmatic randomised, superiority trial.

Setting

20 secondary care centres in the UK.

Participants

434 adults (> 18 years) with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease referred to secondary care, assessed for eligibility between August 2016 and November 2019, and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive conservative management or laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Interventions

Conservative management or surgical removal of the gallbladder.

Main outcome measures

The primary patient outcome was quality of life, measured by area under the curve, over 18 months using the short form 36 (SF-36) bodily pain domain, with higher scores (range 0–100) indicating better quality of life. Other outcomes included costs to the NHS, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

Results

Of 2667 patients assessed for eligibility, 434 were randomised: 217 to the conservative management group and 217 to the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. By 18 months, 54 (25%) participants in the conservative management arm and 146 (67%) in the cholecystectomy arm had received surgery. The mean SF-36 norm based bodily pain score was 49.4 (standard deviation 11.7) in the conservative management arm and 50.4 (11.6) in the cholecystectomy arm. The SF-36 bodily pain area under the curve up to 18 months did not differ (mean difference 0.0, 95% confidence interval −1.7 to 1.7; P = 1.00). Conservative management was less costly (mean difference −£1033, (−$1334; −€1205), 95% credible interval −£1413 to −£632) and QALYs did not differ (mean difference −0.019, 95% credible interval −0.06 to 0.02).

Conclusions

In the short term (≤ 18 months), laparoscopic surgery is no more effective than conservative management for adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, and as such conservative management should be considered as an alternative to surgery. From an NHS perspective, conservative management may be cost effective for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease. As costs, complications, and benefits will continue to be incurred in both groups beyond 18 months, future research should focus on longer term follow-up to establish effectiveness and lifetime cost effectiveness and to identify the cohort of patients who should be routinely offered surgery.

### Comprehensive review of the management of patients with acute cholecystitis who are ineligible for surgery [^114LBbeH]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Review the current literature for available treatments for acute cholecystitis (AC) in non-surgical candidates and provide guidelines for the management of these patients.

Background

Cholecystectomy is the gold standard treatment modality for AC. A considerable number of patients who are not eligible for surgery are managed by percutaneous and endoscopic techniques. There is recent data regarding endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) and emerging percutaneous approaches to address cholelithiasis and remove drains.

Methods

An expert panel of surgeons, gastroenterologists, and interventional radiologists reviewed the current literature and provided recommendations for AC management in non-surgical candidates. Recommendations were based on relevant evidence, with quality and strength assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.

Results

Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is advised for patients ineligible for lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) or with reversible conditions, aiming to bridge to cholecystectomy. The optimal timing of cholecystectomy after PC remains unclear. In cases where surgery is not feasible, potential definitive treatments such as percutaneous cholecysto-lithotripsy/lithectomy and cholecystoduodenal stenting should be considered. For calculous AC, EUS-GBD with LAMS is recommended as a therapy for never-surgical candidates if they are eligible for monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia and there is institutional expertise and minimal intervening ascites.

Conclusions

The management of AC in non-surgical candidates remains a challenge, with institutional protocols varying based on physician preferences and expertise. The proposed protocol integrates percutaneous and endoscopic approaches and emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary collaboration. Further research is required to evaluate these evolving management techniques, as the current literature is limited.

### Avoid routine cholecystectomy for patients with… [^1139hJt7]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

10% to 20% of people in Western countries have gallstones and 50% to 70% of these are asymptomatic. Incidental discovery of gallstones on imaging performed for unrelated reasons is common, often prompting surgical consultation. Treatment with observation alone is indicated for asymptomatic patients with incidental cholelithiasis, unless diagnosed with related hematologic disease. Cholecystectomy for patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis is too aggressive. For patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis who are undergoing an unrelated abdominal operation, such as gastric bypass, concomitant cholecystectomy may be considered.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of choledocholithiasis [^111wxMjc]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for choledocholithiasis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis, ASGE 2011 guidelines recommend to avoid routine antibiotics unless cholangitis is present, biliary drainage is predicted to be incomplete, or the patient is immunosuppressed.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^1147c4rs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Suspected choledocholithiasis — initial investigations and imaging accuracy — For all patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, obtaining liver transaminases, bilirubin and a transabdominal ultrasound are recommended as preliminary investigations, and ultrasound findings consistent with choledocholithiasis include visualization of a common bile duct stone and a dilated common bile duct greater than 8-mm; the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings should be considered when deciding on management. If diagnosis remains in question, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive option with a sensitivity of > 90% and specificity nearing 100%, though common bile duct stones identified require intervention by another method to be removed; endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has average sensitivity and specificity approximately 95% and 97%, respectively.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116pcFZ3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Curro et al. proposed to conduct cholecystectomies even in cases of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients with sickle cell disease. In symptomatic patients, association with increased operative time, morbidity rate, and postoperative stay could be revealed. However, these results are based on an observational study within a restricted number of 30 patients with cholelithiasis and sickle cell disease. Tannuri et al. observed within their retrospective study with the large time period of 17 years a high percentage of 25% of patients, presenting directly with a complication due to cholelithiasis. Pelizzo et al. most recently identified new diagnostic scores in a small population study to improve surgical timing. They see however that the lack of certain clinical background data causes a selection bias and therefore limits the interpretation of results. We observed 55% of the pediatric patients within our retrospective study being operated on in a time period of day 5–42 after acute signs of inflammation. In the pediatric subgroup, only one patient with acute cholecystitis was treated with a cholecystectomy within 24 h. The inflammatory process within this time slot might unnecessarily complicate surgeries, elongate operation time and cause intra- and postoperative complications. Recommendations of the adult guideline are thus not implemented and their respective value in pediatric management should be carefully discussed.

Furthermore, with this given preference for expectant management, the value of UDCA in pediatrics has to be carefully evaluated. According to the S3-guidelines, therapy with UDCA is recommended in asymptomatic patients. However, in pediatric practice, a relevant number of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis receives UDCA for litholysis. Our results confirm the broad range of application in pediatric management without sufficient success. In 2008, Della Corte et al. claimed the ineffectiveness of UDCA in treatment of cholelithiasis, even though a significant relief of symptoms could be reported. This reduction of symptoms is also confirmed by Baran et al. who reported a study of 74 children, mostly responding to UDCA treatment within the first six months. Larger population studies are required to evaluate the real value of UDCA in pediatric patients.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

A sample size of 194 in each group was needed to detect a mean difference in area under the curve of 0.33 standard deviations derived from the SF-36 bodily pain domain with 90% power and a 5% (two sided α) significance level. As observed in other clinical studies, a difference of 0.33 standard deviations in generic health status is considered clinically relevant in terms of treatment effect size in the small to medium ranges. To allow for 10% of participants with data completely missing, with no area under the curve calculable, we needed 430 participants.

The analysis followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan (see supplementary appendix 1). Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle, with participants analysed as randomised irrespective of crossover. We analysed the primary outcome using a mixed effects regression model, with fixed effects for the minimisation covariates and a random effect for the centre. The area under the curve for each participant was generated by the trapezium rule for those with at least one time point up to 30 months post-randomisation. We imputed missing data at 18 months with multiple imputation using Rubin's rule under a missing at random assumption. A sensitivity analysis was performed including all participants who had at least one time point up to 18 months, with multiple imputation being used for missing data at 18 months. A complete case analysis of the primary outcome was also performed for participants with a score at 18 months, and those without such a score were excluded. The area under the curve is interpreted as bodily pain over 18 months. The results of the condition specific questionnaire, SF-36 (excluding bodily pain), and persistent symptoms were analysed using a repeated measures mixed effects regression model correcting for baseline score, fixed effects for the minimisation covariates, and a random effect for centre. We measured outcomes at 3, 9, 12, and 18 months, and treatment effects were estimated from time-by-treatment interactions at each time point. Missing baseline data were imputed using the centre specific mean of that variable. We analysed complications and need for further treatment using a Poisson model adjusted for minimisation covariates sex (male, female) and age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years) and including a random effect for the centre using robust error variance. Planned subgroup analyses explored the potential treatment effect modification of sex (male, female), age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years), and ethnicity (white versus other, owing to limited data on categories) on the primary outcome using a stricter level of significance (two sided 1% significance level). To assess the effect of compliance on the primary outcome, we used a two stage least squares regression model adjusted for minimisation covariates as fixed effects and adjusted for centre using cluster robust variance. Adherence was defined as participants who received their allocated treatment within 24 months. For the cholecystectomy group, participants who received emergency cholecystectomy were defined as non-adherent. We did not measure adherence with the standard NHS advice on a healthy diet for gallstone disease provided to participants. Continuous variables were summarised using mean (standard deviation), or median and interquartile range, whereas discrete variables were reported as absolute number and percentage in each category. To assess the impact of covid-19, we undertook a sensitivity analysis on the primary outcome for the subset of data pre-covid-19 (data not shown) using the same analysis as described above. Analyses were carried out using Stata statistical software, release 16.

### Cost-effectiveness of a new strategy to identify uncomplicated gallstone disease patients that will benefit from a cholecystectomy [^114xLqT4]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Effectiveness of an intervention is often reported in cost-effectiveness studies as quality-adjusted life years (QALY). However, abdominal pain is the most characteristic feature of uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and therefore the main aim of cholecystectomy in this patient group. In addition, absence of pain after cholecystectomy is the main predictor of a patient-reported successful outcome of the operation. The Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, a patient-reported outcome measure computing quality of life, may not be sufficiently disease-specific. Abdominal pain, for example, is equally scored as flatulence in this questionnaire. Other patient-reported outcome measures computing quality of life are not different in weighing persistent abdominal pain. Furthermore, a quality of life score is less applicable in surgical practice compared to presence or absence of abdominal pain. We therefore selected absence of postoperative abdominal pain as effectiveness outcome.

This study must be considered within the context of some limitations. First, the criteria for selection for cholecystectomy remain non-specific, although they are more specific than current practice entirely based on the surgeons' preference. Second, the criteria of the new strategy were not externally validated, although this may have been challenging to perform due to strong treatment preferences of patients and surgeons. Third, we focused on uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis patients. Patients with complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis were not considered. Exclusion of complicated symptomatic cholelithiasis may not have had a large impact as the patient group with uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis only have an annual 1–3% risk on complications because of the stones. Furthermore, the observation group of a randomized controlled trial of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis did not suffer complications during 14 years of follow-up. Fourth, we excluded patients having a bile duct injury as this specific complication of cholecystectomy has a low incidence of 0.04–1.5%. Fifth, we did not consider additional diagnostic work-up because of lack of data, variability, and patient-dependency. Finally, the new strategy was evaluated from a healthcare perspective for a time horizon of 1 year. If a societal perspective would be taken into account, the restrictive care strategy of having one out of two criteria satisfied would probably be even more cost-effective, because this strategy was more effective in terms of relief of abdominal pain and it prevented cholecystectomies, probably preventing sick leave. Especially, patients with ongoing abdominal pain after cholecystectomy would continue to seek medical help with additional diagnostic interventions.

### Gallstone management in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [^111giDkZ]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Of the 101 Group C patients with asymptomatic gallstones (GS) who underwent LSG alone, five (4.95%) developed acute biliary symptoms, and all required cholecystectomy after a mean duration of 5.2 ± 2.4 months. Morais et al. reported that 3.3% of patients with asymptomatic gallbladder (GB) pathology developed symptomatic GS within the first year following bariatric surgery. Studies have documented the postoperative progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic gallbladder disease (GBD), with reported incidences ranging from 5% to 9.3%–17.6%. Raziel et al. found that 9.3% (4 of 43) of patients required laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after LSG, while Sioka et al. observed a 13% rate (3 of 23). Elgohary et al. reported that 33% of initially asymptomatic GS cases became symptomatic, with the proportion of symptomatic cases increasing from 25% preoperatively to 50% within 2 months post-MBS. Additionally, El Hadidi et al. identified a family history of gallstone disease (GSD), higher preoperative BMI, and increased percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) as independent risk factors for postoperative symptomatic cholelithiasis.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113YkQDf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

From a patient perspective, the defining symptom of gallstone disease is severe and lasting (ie, > 30 minutes) abdominal pain. General abdominal symptoms commonly intensify over a period and become regular pain attacks (biliary colic) that may require medical attention.

A recent large prospective study in the UK (n = 8909 participants) showed that 10.8% of people experienced complications 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, as much as 40% of patients may continue to experience pain and abdominal symptoms after surgery. In particular, persistent pain similar to that experienced preoperatively has been reported in about 20% of people after cholecystectomy, and new pain has been reported in up to 14% of peopleBased on the 61 000 episodes reported for 2018/19, 6600 people would have experienced complications from surgery and 24 400 would continue to experience pain, with a substantial impact on NHS resources and costs.

Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is an umbrella term widely used to describe the range of symptoms patients might experience after surgery. The term persistent post-cholecystectomy symptoms has been suggested as a more accurate description of these symptoms, which include biliary and non-biliary abdominal pain, dyspepsia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Up to 40% of people may experience persistent pain and discomfort, usually described as post-cholecystectomy symptoms. Persistent diarrhoea or constipation are often reported after cholecystectomy, and flatulence may arise as a new symptom.

The C-GALL (laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus observation/conservative management for preventing recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones) trial examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

### Updated guideline on the management of common bile duct stones (CBDS) [^1178tsxF]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Common bile duct stones (CBDS) are estimated to be present in 10–20% of individuals with symptomatic gallstones. They can result in a number of health problems, including pain, jaundice, infection and acute pancreatitis. A variety of imaging modalities can be employed to identify the condition, while management of confirmed cases of CBDS may involve endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, surgery and radiological methods of stone extraction. Clinicians are therefore confronted with a number of potentially valid options to diagnose and treat individuals with suspected CBDS. The British Society of Gastroenterology first published a guideline on the management of CBDS in 2008. Since then a number of developments in management have occurred along with further systematic reviews of the available evidence. The following recommendations reflect these changes and provide updated guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of adult patients with suspected or proven CBDS. It is not a protocol and the recommendations contained within should not replace individual clinical judgement.

### Core outcome set for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease [^114e6DNR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases worldwide, with a prevalence of approximately 10–15 per cent in adult populations, but more common in women and people aged over 40 years. For the majority (around 80 per cent), gallstones are asymptomatic, but 20 per cent of people experience pain and develop gallstone-related complications. These patients are currently offered symptom control and/or surgical intervention. A significant number of these patients (up to 40 per cent) remain symptomatic after intervention. Conducting large, well designed, RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical comparators, which measure and report outcomes that matter to all stakeholders, is of importance in this setting.

A recent in-depth analysisof outcomes that had been reported or were considered relevant to symptomatic gallstone disease highlighted the significant variability between studies. In addition, outcome mapping also included empirical research that identified new, unreported in this context, outcomes of importance. This heterogeneity, and absence of outcomes deemed important to patients (and other stakeholders), brings into question the adequacy of existing evidence. Standardizing outcomes through the development and implementation of core outcome sets (COSs) offers a potential solution to this heterogeneity problem and ensures that the right outcomes are being measured and reported. COSs aim to define a minimum set of outcomes that should be considered essential for the evaluation and reporting of specific interventions or conditions.

This study aimed to develop a COS for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease effectiveness trials, which recommends what outcomes should be measured and reported as a minimum, reflecting the interests of relevant stakeholders to facilitate decision-making.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116hVUqF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In contrast to adults, for whom guidelines on the cholelithiasis treatment exist, there is no consistent treatment of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis throughout national and international departments, most probably due to the lack of evidence-based studies.

Methods

We evaluated the German management of pediatric cholelithiasis in a dual approach. Firstly, a retrospective, inter-divisional study was established, comparing diagnostics and therapy of patients of the pediatric surgery department with the management of patients aged < 25 years of the visceral surgery department in our institution over the past ten years. Secondarily, a nation-wide online survey was implemented through the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

Results

Management of pediatric patients with cholelithiasis was primarily performed by pediatricians in the retrospective analysis (p < 0.001). Pediatric complicated cholelithiasis was not managed acutely in the majority of cases with a median time between diagnosis and surgery of 22 days (range 4 days–8 months vs. 3 days in visceral surgery subgroup (range 0 days–10 months), p = 0.003). However, the outcome remained comparable. The hospital's own results triggered a nation-wide survey with a response rate of 38%. Primary pediatric medical management of patients was confirmed by 36 respondents (71%). In case of acute cholecystitis, 22% of participants perform a cholecystectomy within 24 h after diagnosis. Open questions revealed that complicated cholelithiasis is managed individually.

Conclusions

The management of pediatric cholelithiasis differs between various hospitals and between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based large-scale population studies as well as a common guideline may represent very important tools for treating this increasing diagnosis.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^113hxXo2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Cholelithiasis/gallstone disease management imposes a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, costing about 6.5 billion dollars/year only in the USA itself. The prevalence of gallstones ranges from 0.1% to 50.5% worldwide. Although gallstone disease is usually asymptomatic, certain risk factors drive the progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic illness, with or without complications, making it imperative to treat. Gallstone-related complications include common bile duct stones (CBD stones)/choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis and others. Surgical removal of the gallbladder (known as cholecystectomy) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment option over open cholecystectomy for gallstones and cholecystitis. However, approximately 12% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomy continue to experience pain and recurrent gallstone-related symptoms.

Conservative management (CM), involving pain and symptomatic treatment with gallbladder in situ, carries no risk of operative complications and is also considered an alternative to cholecystectomy. However, among conservatively managed patients with uncomplicated gallstones, recurrence of gallstone symptoms and subsequent development of gallstone-related complications often lead to cholecystectomy. Similarly, several randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing early versus delayed cholecystectomy (DC) for gallstone disease reported recurrence of symptoms/complications in the waiting period before surgery and also reported higher postsurgical complications with delayed surgery. Thus, the effectiveness of early cholecystectomy (EC) over CM/DC is ambiguous. Therefore, we aimed to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesise treatment outcomes between EC and CM/DC. The study's objective is to synthesise treatment outcomes such as (1) gallstone-related complications between EC and CM/DC (2) surgical complications, length of hospital stays and operative time between early and DC.

### Gallstones and bariatric surgery: to treat or not to treat? [^113MjGrV]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Obesity and rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery are risk factors for gallstone disease.

Objectives

The present study sought to evaluate the feasibility of selective concomitant cholecystectomy only in patients with symptomatic disease and study risk factors for the development of symptomatic gallstones after bariatric surgery.

Methods

Between January 2010 and December 2012, 734 consecutive patients presenting to our institution underwent bariatric surgery. From these, 81 patients were excluded due to prior or concurrent cholecystectomy. The remaining 653 patients with in situ gallbladder were followed for 12 months and were clinically screened for symptomatic or complicated cholelithiasis. Clinical and demographic characteristics were compared at baseline and 12 months after surgery.

Results

Of the 653 patients with in situ gallbladder, only 24 (3.3%) developed symptomatic gallstones and only nine presented complicated disease. None of the patients with asymptomatic disease at the time of surgery progressed to symptomatic or complicated disease. Patients who developed symptomatic disease were not significantly different, although there was a trend toward longer obesity evolution, lower insulin levels, and lower hepatic enzymes level. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients with gastric sleeve were more likely to develop symptomatic gallstones.

Conclusions

Although further studies are required, the management of gallstones in morbidly obese patients should not be different from normal-weight patients. Therefore, performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy only in symptomatic patients is an effective approach and asymptomatic gallstones should not be treated at the time of bariatric surgery.

### Expectant management is safe for cholelithiasis after heart transplant [^113chKfm]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of cholelithiasis after heart transplant remains unclear. We use expectant management based on symptoms, without screening studies or prophylactic treatment. We hypothesized that expectant management for cholelithiasis after heart transplant does not result in significant mortality or morbidity from gallstone-associated disease.

Methods

Between November 1985 and August 2004, 409 heart transplants were performed in 402 recipients at the University of Washington. This is a non-concurrent cohort study of these recipients.

Results

Among recipients, 24 underwent cholecystectomy before heart transplant. After transplant, in the remaining 378 patients, 34 were found to have gallstones during the observation period. There was no mortality from gallstone-associated disease. Thirty patients developed morbidity from gallstones, including 25 cases of biliary colic, 3 of acute cholecystitis and 2 of pancreatitis, and there was 1 abnormal liver function test. Acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis were treated with conservative management followed by cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy was performed in 32 patients after transplant. Indications included symptomatic cholelithiasis in 31, and prophylactic cholecystectomy prior to kidney transplant in 1. The laparoscopic approach was performed in 25 of these 32 patients. There was no mortality from cholecystectomy, but there were 4 complications: surgical site infections (n = 2); wound dehiscence (n = 1); and bile duct injury (n = 1). Median hospital stay was 1 day.

Conclusions

Our expectant management for cholelithiasis after heart transplant resulted in no mortality or significant morbidity related to delay in treatment. Symptomatic cholelithiasis was successfully treated with cholecystectomy, mostly with the laparoscopic approach. We believe expectant management is safe for patients after heart transplant.

### Incidence of gallstone disease and complications [^116cDaCF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review was to describe the epidemiology of gallstone disease in the era of ultrasound screening and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Recent Findings

Recent general population cohorts, including ultrasound screenings, have contributed to our understanding of formation and clinical course of gallstone disease. Cohorts of symptomatic gallstone disease have been informative about symptom recurrence and need of treatment. Preventive targets for gallstone formation may include obesity and the associated metabolic changes. The presence of gallstone disease is best described as a continuum from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease, with the latter including both pain attacks and complicated disease. Symptomatic disease causes a persistent high risk of symptom recurrence and need of cholecystectomy. The majority of gallstone carriers will remain asymptomatic and about one in five will develop symptoms. Determinants of disease progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease include sex, age, body mass index, and gallstone ultrasound characteristics.

Summary

Because of the absence of effective gallstone formation prevention, targets against the metabolic changes in obesity should be further explored in randomized controlled trials. To optimize patient selection for cholecystectomy, treatment algorithms including identified determinants of symptomatic disease in gallstone carriers should be explored in prospective clinical trials.

### Systematic review of management of gallbladder disease in patients undergoing minimally invasive bariatric surgery [^1148Efi7]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The introduction and subsequent widespread adaptation of minimally invasive approaches for bariatric surgery have not only changed the outcomes of bariatric surgery but also called into question the management of co-morbid surgical conditions, in particular gallbladder disease. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Foregut Committee performed a systematic review of the published literature from 1995–2018 on management of gallbladder disease in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The papers reviewed generated the following results. (1) Routine prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of bariatric surgery is not recommended. (2) In symptomatic patients who are undergoing bariatric surgery, concomitant cholecystectomy is acceptable and safe. (3) Ursodeoxycholic acid may be considered for gallstone formation prophylaxis during the period of rapid weight loss. (4) Routine preoperative screening and postoperative surveillance ultrasound is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. In the era of minimally invasive surgery, the management of gallbladder disease in patients undergoing bariatric surgery continues to evolve.

Bariatric surgery — gallstones: Ultrasound should be used to evaluate patients with right upper-quadrant pain for cholelithiasis (Grade D). Patients who undergo sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), or biliopancreatic diversion without/with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) are at increased risk for cholelithiasis due to rapid weight loss, and administration of ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended: 500 mg once daily for SG and 300 mg twice a day for RYGB or BPD/DS (Grade A; BEL 1). In asymptomatic patients with known gallstones and a history of RYGB or BPD/DS, prophylactic cholecystectomy may be considered; otherwise, cholecystectomy should be reserved for patients with symptomatic biliary disease due to a generally low incidence of biliary complications (Grade B; BEL 2).

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The economic analysis was conducted according to a prespecified and agreed health economics analysis plan (available from the corresponding author on request). Mirroring the statistical analysis, the principles of the intention-to-treat analysis were followed to compare cost and QALYs between groups. Data for the 24 month follow-up were used as these would better reflect costs and consequences relevant to the economic analysis. Reliance on complete case data for cost effectiveness analysis can introduce bias unless the data are completely missing at random. We implemented multiple imputationas part of the primary economic analysis, using chained equations with predicted mean matching and generating 20 imputed datasets with plausible fitted values assigned for missing cost and utility elements. The imputation model included all the variables in the analysis model (age, sex, treatment group allocation), and auxiliary variables that may help to explain missingness (trial centre, indicator for having surgery, and type of procedure). We used Rubin's rules to pool estimates across multiple imputation datasets. General linear regression models adjusted for minimisation factors (centre, age, sex) and baseline SF-6D score were used. Adjusted mean values by treatment allocation, and the incremental difference between the groups were obtained using the methods of recycled predictions. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was calculated as the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean QALYs for the conservative management group versus the cholecystectomy group. Uncertainty surrounding the joint incremental costs and effects was characterised using non-parametric bootstrapping using 1000 iterations, with the multiple imputation process (κ = 5 and 20 simulated datasets) nested within the bootstrapping process. Based on the bootstrap iterations, we report 95% credible intervals and the probability of the interventions being cost effective at the £20 000 cost effectiveness threshold, following guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The two patient and public involvement (PPI) partners (one grant holder/member of the project management group, and one independent member of the trial steering committee) were actively involved in discussions of the study results with the trial steering committee and the trial investigators, and they contributed to preparing the plain English summary. The PPI group (which was initially established as a focus group for the Core Outcome Setbut remained actively involved in the wider C-GALL project) was actively involved in discussions of the study results with the PPI partners and contributed to reviewing the plain English summary. At the conclusion of the study, the PPI partners reflected on their input and made suggestions for future research.

### Surgical and nonsurgical management of gallstones [^112n3CtX]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is one of the most common and costly of all the gastrointestinal diseases. The incidence of gallstones increases with age. At-risk populations include persons with diabetes mellitus, persons who are obese, women, rapid weight cyclers, and patients on hormone therapy or taking oral contraceptives. Most patients are asymptomatic; gallstones are discovered incidentally during ultrasonography or other imaging of the abdomen. Asymptomatic patients have a low annual rate of developing symptoms (about 2% per year). Once symptoms appear, the usual presentation of uncomplicated gallstones is biliary colic, caused by the intermittent obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone. The pain is characteristically steady, is usually moderate to severe in intensity, is located in the epigastrium or right upper quadrant of the abdomen, lasts one to five hours, and gradually subsides. If pain persists with the onset of fever or high white blood cell count, it should raise suspicion for complications such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. Ultrasonography is the best initial imaging study for most patients, although additional imaging studies may be indicated. The management of acute biliary colic mainly involves pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic pain relievers. Oral dissolution therapy is usually minimally successful and used only if the patient cannot undergo surgery. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the surgical choice for symptomatic and complicated gallstones, with a shorter hospital stay and shorter convalescence period than open cholecystectomy. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is an alternative for patients who are critically ill with gallbladder empyema and sepsis.

### A prospective study of the conservative management of asymptomatic preoperative and postoperative gallbladder disease in bariatric surgery [^113HtLB4]. Obesity Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for weight loss in patients with morbid obesity. One of the most common long-term complications includes cholelithiasis. There is not a clear consensus in how to treat an asymptomatic gallbladder disease before and after bariatric surgery.

Methods

Prospective study with every patient submitted to bariatric surgery from 2012 to 2014. The gallbladder status was assessed with an ultrasound before and after surgery (12 months), and a conservative management was conducted for patients with asymptomatic disease (preoperative and de novo); the need for delayed cholecystectomy was reported. Secondarily, an analysis of weight loss (%EWL) and gallbladder status was performed.

Results

Two-hundred and two bariatric surgeries were performed. The global incidence of preoperative gallbladder disease was 34.3%, with 14.2% presenting sludge, 20.1% asymptomatic gallstones, and 2.3% symptomatic gallstones. The final analysis was based on 146 patients; female sex comprised 81.1% of cases with a mean age of 38.5 years. After 12 months, de novo gallbladder disease was observed in 21.2%. The overall rate of cholecystectomy because of symptomatic disease after 12 months was 3.4% (2% developed acute cholecystitis). There were no differences in %EWL between patients with de novo gallbladder disease and those without.

Conclusion

Conservative management of asymptomatic gallbladder disease in candidates to bariatric surgery is safe and can be offered in every case, based on the low percentage of patients requiring further cholecystectomy after 12 months. Also, a conservative management can be offered to patients developing de novo sludge/cholelithiasis without related symptoms.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy — Surgical management, performed under general anaesthesia, remains the current standard procedure for symptomatic gallstone disease. Occasionally it may be necessary during the procedure to convert to open surgery because of a complication or difficulty in progressing safely. Moreover, an alternative procedure may be performed if difficulty is anticipated in removing the gallbladder safely (eg, drainage of the gallbladder, subtotal cholecystectomy).

Conservative management — Conservative management for gallstone disease can involve observation, and the prescription of analgesics when needed to relieve biliary pain, and it is largely based in primary care in the community. When required, typical treatment for pain includes paracetamol (acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotic analgesics, such as opiates, and antispasmodics (eg, buscopan), together with generic advice on a healthy lifestyle.

Participants who were randomised to the conservative management group were also given a patient information leaflet about medical management, which included steps to take if symptoms recurred or flared up, and standard NHS advice on a healthy diet for gallstone disease.

### Restrictive strategy vs usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with abdominal pain and gallstones: 5-year follow-up of the SECURE randomized clinical trial [^111tpmf5]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The 5-year follow-up from the SECURE trial illustrated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers a mediocre solution for patients experiencing symptomatic cholelithiasis in achieving a pain-free state. In the long term, a restrictive strategy resulted in a significant but small reduction in operation rate compared with usual care and was not associated with increased biliary and surgical complications. A restrictive strategy was equally disappointing as usual care for reaching a pain-free state after cholecystectomy. Overall, an 8.3% reduction in operation rate was observed after a restrictive strategy compared with usual care. A similar trade-off between cholecystectomies saved and pain-free patients was observed after 1 year. However, the patient-reported long-term treatment satisfaction between usual care and the restrictive strategy was not significantly different and increasingly converged over time. Therefore, the long-term outcome of this trial contends that the indications for gallbladder surgery in patients with uncomplicated cholelithiasis should still be critically examined.

Both short- and long-term results of the SECURE trial indicate that surgery represents a poor solution for certain patients presenting symptoms attributable to gallstones. Based on the used definition of pain-free state, persisting pain is reported in 20% to 40% of patients after cholecystectomy. The recently published C-GALL trial accords with our findings and supports the hypothesis that observation/conservative management is an alternative strategy to surgery. This study assessed whether cholecystectomy is cost-effective compared with observation/conservative management at 18 months. The score on the bodily pain domain of the SF-36 was the primary end point of the study. By 18 months, 25% in the observation/conservative management arm and 67% in the cholecystectomy arm had received surgery. The mean (SD) SF-36 norm-based bodily pain score was 49.4 (11.7) and 50.4 (11.6), respectively. The long-term outcome of the trial needs to show whether the lower operation rate is due to waiting lists in the UK and whether observation is sustainable in terms of biliary complications and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, after given detailed information on the alternative options for cholecystectomy, many patients in the C-GALL opted for nonsurgical treatment and even declined participation in the trial to not receive surgery. This observation advocates shared decision making in selecting patients for cholecystectomy.

For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

Cholecystectomy

For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal, but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis.

Women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

### Clinical spotlight review for the management of choledocholithiasis [^114pP6iR]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). High credibility.

Pre-operative choledocholithiasis management — If choledocholithiasis is confirmed pre-operatively, options for clearance of the common bile duct (CBD) include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) before cholecystectomy or common bile duct exploration with cholecystectomy; ERCP is highly sensitive and specific and therapeutic to clear stones, with a success rate of approximately 80–90% for ductal clearance. Reasons for failure include large or impacted stones, duodenal diverticula, altered gastric or duodenal anatomy and intrahepatic stones, and risks include pancreatitis (1.3–6.7%), infection (0.6–5%), hemorrhage (0.3–2%), perforation (0.1–1%) and mortality (up to 1%). Following biliary clearance with ERCP, it is generally recommended to proceed with subsequent cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis which occurs in approximately 20% of patients. However, in patients with advanced comorbidities who are at significantly high risk for operative intervention, ERCP with sphincterotomy without further intervention can also be considered definitive therapy, as there has been no statistical difference in mortality.

### Elective cholecystectomy after roux-en-Y gastric bypass: why should asymptomatic gallstones be treated differently in morbidly obese patients? [^116hidKE]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Gallbladder management in bariatric surgery varies. Some surgeons perform routine cholecystectomy with bariatric surgery, and others selectively base that decision on routine preoperative ultrasound findings. Both approaches treat bariatric patients differently than the normal-weight population in whom cholecystectomy is not performed in asymptomatic patients. We hypothesized that it is possible to apply the commonly used indications for cholecystectomy in the nonobese population safely to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass cohort.

Methods

Data were collected prospectively and retrospectively on consecutive patients at our center undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004. Asymptomatic patients underwent neither preoperative gallbladder ultrasonography nor concomitant cholecystectomy. Age, body mass index, gender, length of follow-up, compliance to ursodiol therapy for 6 months, need for subsequent cholecystectomy, complications, and pathologic diagnoses were recorded.

Results

A total of 692 primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures were performed, of which 661 (95.5%) were completed laparoscopically. Complete data were collected on 417 patients (60.3%). A total of 98 patients (23.5%) had had prior or concomitant cholecystectomy and were excluded from additional study. Of the remaining 319 patients, 47 (14.7%) required subsequent cholecystectomy and 272 (85.3%) did not. The risk of subsequent cholecystectomy correlated inversely with the duration of ursodiol prophylaxis. All pathologic specimens had cholecystitis but gallstones were present in only 48.8%. Two complications (abscess and port-site bleed) occurred, but no common duct stones developed and no patient died. The mean follow-up was 7.5 months (range 13–25).

Conclusion

Asymptomatic gallstones in bariatric patients may be treated safely with secondary cholecystectomy. After a 6-month regimen of ursodiol prophylaxis, 14.7% will require subsequent cholecystectomy. Asymptomatic gallstones in the bariatric patient may be safely managed identically to those in the nonobese population.

Choledocholithiasis — epidemiology and presentation — has a prevalence of approximately 10–15% of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. The clinical presentation can range from completely asymptomatic to biliary colic and symptoms of obstructive jaundice, such as pruritus, dark urine and acholic stools, and although up to a third of patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones will pass them spontaneously without intervention, the majority of patients will require endoscopic and/or surgical intervention.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^117X6UVS]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and participants

C-GALL was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, patient randomised, superiority trial to test if the strategy of standard, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is more effective and cost effective than conservative management. The trial protocol was published in 2021.

We recruited patients from 20 secondary care sites in the UK. Potential participants were adults aged > 18 years with confirmed, symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease (ie, biliary colic or acute cholecystitis) who were electively referred to secondary care and considered suitable for cholecystectomy. Clinical diagnosis of gallstone disease was confirmed by appropriate imaging. Patients who were unable to consent, medically unfit for surgery, pregnant, or had had previous open major upper abdominal surgery were not eligible for the trial. Also excluded were patients with gallstones in the common bile duct, evidence of previous choledocholithiasis, a history of acute pancreatitis, evidence of obstructive jaundice, evidence of empyema of the gallbladder with sepsis, suspicion of gallbladder cancer, perforated gallbladder (recent or old perforation detected on imaging), or haemolytic disease.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either laparoscopic cholecystectomy or conservative management using the remote, computer based randomisation application at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials. The minimisation algorithm used recruitment site, sex (male, female), and age (< 35, 35–64, ≥ 65 years). A random element (20% chance) was incorporated into the minimisation algorithm. Participants, investigators, and the trial statistician were not masked to treatment allocation.

ASGE choledocholithiasis guideline — gallstone pancreatitis management and ERCP role: The panel recommended that same admission cholecystectomy be performed for patients presenting with gallstone pancreatitis. In a very large cohort comparing endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) alone versus ES plus cholecystectomy, 7330 versus 4478 patients were included, with 39.3% recurrent adverse events after ES alone versus 18.0% with ES and cholecystectomy (adjusted OR, .38 [95% CI, .34-.42]). ERCP with prophylactic sphincterotomy to prevent recurrent pancreatitis or other biliary adverse events should not be used as an alternative to cholecystectomy unless surgery is absolutely contraindicated. A Cochrane analysis of 662 patients from 5 RCTs found increased risk with a nonoperative approach after ES and bile duct clearance, including recurrent biliary pain (14.6 [95% CI 5.0–42.8]), jaundice or cholangitis (2.5 [1.15–5.9]), and mortality (1.8 [1.2–2.8]) versus prophylactic cholecystectomy.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^113pQ1Xi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients with gallbladder stones and abdominal pain are subject to change. The symptom criteria for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis differ across international guidelines. Although biliary colic is frequently resolved after cholecystectomy, non-biliary symptoms persist in up to 40 per cent of patients. This review guides surgeons on how to tailor diagnosis and treatment in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Management of cholelithiasis in pediatric patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation [^112egpQu]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and proper management for asymptomatic cholelithiasis in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

Methods

The authors reviewed retrospectively the records of 575 children who underwent bone marrow transplantation at a University bone marrow transplantation unit (BMT) unit between February 1991 and October 1999. Of these patients, 235 underwent abdominal ultrasonography for evaluation of jaundice, sepsis, abdominal pain, or metastasis. To identify risk factors for cholelithiasis, the authors stratified the patients based on their disease and treatment regimen. Finally, the authors analyzed the natural history and management of BMT children with cholelithiasis.

Results

The authors identified 20 cases of cholelithiasis (8.5%) in the 235 BMT patients who underwent ultrasonography. Children who underwent BMT to treat bone marrow failure showed a significantly increased risk of cholelithiasis compared with children treated for malignancy (27% v 7.4%; P < .01). Most children (85%) with gallstones did not require surgical intervention. Specifically, 9 (45%) died from their primary disease, 5 (25%) showed sonographic resolution of their gallstones, and 3 (15%) underwent follow-up nonoperatively with persistent cholelithiasis. Three of the 20 patients with gallstones (15%) had signs of acute cholecystitis and underwent surgery. There were no surgical complications or deaths in the operative group.

Conclusions

Cholelithiasis occurs at a high incidence in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients. Children undergoing BMT for bone marrow failure are at higher risk of having gallstones than those being treated for malignancy. Finally, these data support a strategy of nonoperative management for asymptomatic cholelithiasis in this highly selected group of patients.

### Incremental net benefit of cholecystectomy compared with alternative treatments in people with gallstones or cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cost-utility studies [^116AnaHG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, Scopus and Embase databases in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). This study is part of a more extensive economic evaluation study.

Data sources, screening and study selection

The search was performed from inception to 1 July 2020, in PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases. We followed the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome approach to construct the search terms. The desired population for the study included all the adult patients presenting with cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis who were being considered for a cholecystectomy. Surgical removal of the gallbladder using early, open or LC was the intervention, and non-surgical methods like conservative management, wait-and-watch or endoscopic management covered the comparator strategy. The possible economic outcomes included were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net benefit (INB), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, life years saved and costs saved.

The detailed search terms and search strategies are reported in online supplemental material 1. The total number of studies identified from the database search was 8710, including 2977 from PubMed, 3696 from Scopus and 2037 from Embase. After removing the duplicates (n = 1414), 7296 studies were selected for an initial title and abstract screening.

Titles and abstracts of the studies listed from the electronic database search were screened independently by the authors (BSB, MN and AS) for potential inclusion using the Rayyan software. After screening, the authors (BSB, MN and AS) independently reviewed the full-text articles (n = 660). The final list of studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria was prepared by the authors' mutual consensus (BS, MN and AS).

All full economic evaluation studies with a study population of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis that compared the costs and consequences of intervention with a comparator in terms of QALYs, ICERs or INBs were included in the study. Studies other than cost–utility analysis (CUA), reviews, letters, editorials, abstracts, books, reports, grey literature and methodological articles were excluded from the study. We identified 28 studies for systematic review based on these inclusion–exclusion criteria, and the data were extracted from these papers using a data extraction form. The PRISMA flow chart of the screening process is appended as figure 1.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1179BbM5]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

In the short term (< 18 months), conservative management, as an alternative to surgery, may be effective and cost effective for patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease.

We conclude that the costs and benefits will continue to be incurred in both groups beyond 24 months, so future research should focus on long term follow-up data to establish lifetime cost effectiveness and aid identification of the cohort of patients who will benefit from surgery.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^117VRkes]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the most common abdominal surgical procedure, accounting for over 750 000 operations in the USA and approximately 70 000 operations in the UK each year. A recent studyof National Health Service data showed that the total number of cholecystectomies annually increased by 72.2 per cent between 2000 and 2019 (from 39 022 to 67 204). Although the number of laparoscopic cholecystectomies has increased over recent decades, international guidelineshave provided no reason to broaden the indication for surgery. The 5 per cent increase in the prevalence of gallbladder stones, from 15 to 20 per cent, does not explain the exponential increase in cholecystectomy numbers.

In Europe, approximately one-fifth of the population has gallbladder stones. The majority of gallbladder stones consist primarily of cholesterol (over 90 per cent), whereas a minority are black (bilirubin) and brown (bacterial products) pigmented stones. Predisposing factors include obesity, female sex, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but only one in five develops symptoms. Symptomatic patients mostly suffer from typical symptoms of biliary colic. Frequent episodes of biliary colic or complicated gallstone disease (such as choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis) are accepted indications for cholecystectomy. However, in most patients, gallstones remain without symptoms and are not the primary cause of abdominal pain. Patients with abdominal pain and uncomplicated symptomatic cholecystolithiasis are confronted with two options: wait and see or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, there is lack of consensus regarding selection of those who do or do not benefit from surgery, as 10–40 per cent of patients have persistent abdominal pain after operation. This provides the clinical equipoise to suggest an alternative strategy for better selection of patients for cholecystectomy.

The present review aimed to provide an overview of different guidelines and criteria sets for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis; to summarize outcomes after cholecystectomy; and to give personalized advice on treatment decisions in patients with symptomatic cholecystolithiasis.

### Management of bile leak post minimally invasive subtotal cholecystectomy: a review [^111fqrsj]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Minimally invasive subtotal cholecystectomy is safe alternative to minimally invasive cholecystectomy that prevents bile duct injury. Nonetheless, it is associated with higher rates of other complications, namely post-operative bile leak and symptomatic remnant cholelithiasis.

Summary Background Data

Bile leak presents as biloma requiring drainage and subsequently high bilious drain output. It is more strongly associated with fenestrating subtotal cholecystectomy. Fortunately, the majority are self-limited and do not require endoscopic intervention. Symptomatic remnant cholelithiasis presents as recurrent gallstone disease post-operative cholecystectomy.

Methods

In this paper, we review available literature on these two complications and share our institutional algorithm on the management of bile leak.

Results

Our approach to bile leak advocates for intra-operative drain placement, early characterization of the leak, watchful waiting, the use of sinogram, and reserving ERCP and stenting for high-grade leaks or refractory cases. Symptomatic remnant cholelithiasis is more strongly associated with reconstituting subtotal cholecystectomy, particularly in cases where the gallbladder stump is long or stones are not completely evacuated from the remnant. This complication should be treated with completion cholecystectomy when possible, but can also be managed with gallbladder-preserving choleystolithomy in patients with aberrant biliary anatomy and/or significant comorbidities. Completion cholecystectomy is a technically challenging operation that benefits from hepatopancreaticbiliary expertise and intra-operative adjuncts such as near-infrared fluorescent cholangiography or intra-operative cholangiogram.

Conclusions

Minimally invasive subtotal cholecystectomy effectively prevents bile duct injury but at the expense of increased post-operative morbidity; it is a bailout strategy that should be used judiciously.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of gallstone disease treatment outcomes in early cholecystectomy versus conservative management / delayed cholecystectomy [^111QN436]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Screening and study selection

We carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered the protocol at PROSPERO. We systematically searched the studies indexed in PubMed-Medline, Scopus and Embase. The search terms were constructed based on domains of population, intervention, comparator and outcome (PICO) as described below. The search terms were combined using Boolean operator 'OR' within the same domains, and Boolean operator 'AND' between domains of PICO as described in online supplemental tables 1–3. An initial search was performed on 16 June 2020 and an updated search was performed on 12 January 2021.

According to the inclusion criteria, search results were screened for eligibility. The population included individuals with gallstones (cholelithiasis/cholecystolithiasis) or CBD stones (choledocholithiasis) or acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis. The intervention included surgical removal of the gallbladder through open or laparoscopic methods, where surgery was performed on an emergency basis or within 7 days, treated as EC. The comparator is CM and DC. CM included both observation management (OM) (also known as wait and watch strategy) and Endoscopic management (EM). Under OM, this study considered patients with gallstones who were symptomatically managed using pain killer, antibiotics, diet and lifestyle changes. Under EM, this study considered patients who underwent endoscopic removal of CBD stones with gallbladder left in situ. In DC, we considered patients who were initially managed conservatively and later underwent cholecystectomy after 6 weeks. Outcomes included complications related to gallstone disease, perioperative, intraoperative and postoperative complications with cholecystectomy, length of hospital stays, operative time and the studies included were RCTs. Nonrandomised trials, observational studies, reviews and studies published in non-English languages for which a translation could not be obtained were excluded. Studies were also excluded for their selection of PICO, that is not of study's interest.

Titles and abstracts of studies listed from the electronic database search were meticulously screened independently by authors (BSB, MH, AS) using Rayyan-web application. After screening, authors independently reviewed and selected studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria with authors' mutual consensus (figure 1).

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^11363sjb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Cholecystectomy in cirrhosis — prevalence, indications, and alternatives are as follows: Cholelithiasis is approximately 2-fold more prevalent in cirrhosis, and patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis should not be treated. In Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) A and B cirrhosis, indications for elective cholecystectomy are the same as in noncirrhotic patients, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the procedure of choice. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally safe in CTP A and B but is associated with significantly higher postoperative complications and mortality in CTP class C. For acute cholecystitis, antibiotics and cholecystostomy are the standard of care. When concern or uncertainty exists, perioperative mortality estimation using the VOCAL-Penn score may help decision-making, and for prohibitive surgical risk, antibiotics with percutaneous cholecystostomy, transpapillary drainage, or endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural gallbladder drainage are alternatives.

### Contemporary management of common bile duct stone: what you need to know [^117PaQzm]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Choledocholithiasis is a common presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis encountered by the acute care surgeon. There is a wide spectrum of variation in management of this disease due to evolutions in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. Intricacies in management are related to the timing of diagnosis as well as locally available imaging modalities, surgical expertise, and ancillary advanced endoscopy and interventional radiological support. While individual patient demographics and institutional characteristics will determine management of choledocholithiasis, it is incumbent for the treating surgeon to be well versed in all manners of therapy currently available. The objective of this review is to provide an evidence-based summary of the contemporary management of choledocholithiasis.

### Cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones [^111mY8sM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystectomy is currently advised only for patients with symptomatic gallstones. However, about 4% of patients with asymptomatic gallstones develop symptoms including cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, and gallbladder cancer.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgical removal of the gallbladder for patients with asymptomatic gallstones.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until 2006 for identifying the randomised trials using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group search strategy.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) comparing cholecystectomy and no cholecystectomy were considered for the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Main Results

We were unable to identify any randomised clinical trial comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no randomised trials comparing cholecystectomy versus no cholecystectomy in patients with silent gallstones. Further evaluation of observational studies, which measure outcomes such as obstructive jaundice, gallstone-associated pancreatitis, and/or gall-bladder cancer for sufficient duration of follow-up is necessary before randomised trials are designed in order to evaluate whether cholecystectomy or no cholecystectomy is better for asymptomatic gallstones.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^117Wmhqx]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Prespecified sensitivity analyses showed that adherence to treatment allocation, missing data, and perceived potential impact of covid-19 (when national elective surgery was suspended for many months), did not change findings. Cost analysis showed that conservative management was less costly than cholecystectomy. The trial did not find a statistically significant difference in QALYs between the groups. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was high, meaning important potential savings to the NHS with limited QALY loss by following a conservative management approach in the short term (up to 24 months). Longer term modelling suggested that a conservative management approach might be cost effective, but uncertainty was higher owing to limited information on subsequent surgeries in the randomised groups and quality of life beyond 24 months.

The within trial economic analysis indicated that intention to treat with conservative management was less costly than cholecystectomy over 24 months (mean difference £1033). Consistent with the primary outcome results of the C-GALL trial, a non-significant QALY difference of 0.019 favouring cholecystectomy was observed. The significant cost difference favouring conservative management and a small non-significant QALY difference favouring cholecystectomy resulted in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of £55 235. That is, moving from the standard practice of intention to treat with laparoscopic cholecystectomy to conservative management would on average result in lower costs and QALYs, with a saving of £55 235 per QALY lost. Moreover, at a conventional cost effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY used in the UK, the probabilistic analysis showed conservative management to have a 97% probability of being cost effective. Crucial to these results was the number of cholecystectomy procedures undertaken within the laparoscopic cholecystectomy group, which explained most of the cost difference between the trial groups. Participants crossing over from conservative management to cholecystectomy may erode the cost effectiveness of conservative management over a time horizon longer than the 24 month follow-up in the current trial. Therefore, extrapolation is clearly required beyond the trial follow-up with longer term follow-up of participants in the C-GALL trial.

### Systematic review of the clinical and cost effectiveness of cholecystectomy versus observation / conservative management for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones or cholecystitis [^114RF6Bn]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstone disease is a common gastrointestinal disorder in industrialised countries. Although symptoms can be severe, some people can be symptom free for many years after the original attack. Surgery is the current treatment of choice, but evidence suggests that observation is also feasible and safe. We reviewed the evidence on cholecystectomy versus observation for uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis.

Methods

We searched six electronic databases (last search April 2014). We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised comparative studies where adults received either cholecystectomy or observation/conservative management for the first episode of symptomatic gallstone disease (biliary pain or cholecystitis) being considered for surgery in secondary care. Meta-analysis was used to combine results. A de novo Markov model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of the interventions.

Results

Two RCTs (201 participants) were included. Eighty-eight percent of people randomised to surgery and 45% of people randomised to observation underwent cholecystectomy during the 14-year follow-up period. Participants randomised to observation were significantly more likely to experience gallstone-related complications (RR = 6.69, 95% CI = 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01), in particular acute cholecystitis (RR = 9.55, 95% CI = 1.25–73.27, p = 0.03), and less likely to undergo surgery (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.34–0.73, p = 0.0004) or experience surgery-related complications (RR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16–0.81, p = 0.01) than those randomised to surgery. Fifty-five percent of people randomised to observation did not require surgery, and 12% of people randomised to cholecystectomy did not undergo surgery. On average, surgery costs £1,236 more per patient than conservative management, but was more effective.

Conclusions

Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones. However, approximately half the observation group did not require surgery or suffer complications indicating that it may be a valid alternative to surgery. A multicentre trial is needed to establish the effects, safety and cost effectiveness of observation/conservative management relative to cholecystectomy.

Background

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the natural history of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) with known asymptomatic cholelithiasis in whom prophylactic cholecystectomy was not performed at the time of surgery.

Methods

The records of 144 consecutive patients from a single year experience in RYGBP surgery at the University of California, Davis Medical Center were reviewed. Patients undergoing RYGBP were routinely screened for cholelithiasis by ultrasound. Patients who did not have cholecystectomy were managed with ursodiol for 6 months postoperatively.

Results

13 males (9.0%) and 131 females (91%) underwent RYGBP. The mean age was 43 years (SD 8.55), and mean BMI was 46 kg/m2 (SD 6.5). The comorbidities of our patient population included diabetes (14%), hypertension (48%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (50%), dyslipidemia (35%), obstructive sleep apnea (31%), and musculoskeletal complaints (69%). 22 patients were diagnosed with cholelithiasis by ultrasonography preoperatively. 9 of these patients (41%) were symptomatic and underwent concurrent cholecystectomy and RYGBP. The remaining 13 patients (59%) had asymptomatic cholelithiasis preoperatively but did not undergo cholecystectomy at the time of surgery. Only one of these asymptomatic patients eventually developed symptoms necessitating cholecystectomy at up to 1 year follow-up.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that it may not be absolutely indicated to perform prophylactic cholecystectomy at the time of RYGBP surgery for asymptomatic cholelithiasis. We believe that this phenomenon needs to be further studied in a randomized trial.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^11247nbf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The establishment of evidence-based pediatric guidelines is required in order to reduce insecurities and to deliver scientific facts on the basis of multicenter and prospective studies. These should not only focus on a diagnostic algorithm, but especially on the indications for expectant management versus surgical therapy and further therapeutic options in acute and chronic disease. In an effort to achieve an improved standardized treatment and to emphasize the consensus between pediatricians and pediatric surgeons until results of evidence-based pediatric guidelines are available, we illustrated a flow chart based on our findings and to encourage common strategies (Fig. 3). We especially excluded different marginal subgroups of patients, e.g. symptomatic patients with no clear association between symptoms and cholelithiasis. These may be the subject of subsequent research projects.

Limitations of the study have to be discussed carefully. Aimed at gaining insight into real therapeutic management, we are presenting a foundation for further research and are not able to add results of a large prospective study on this topic. Accordingly, one limitation of our presented retrospective research lies in the relatively small study population over a large period of time, which limits the informative value of our study. However, it reflects the still low incidence. Although representing the diverse patient spectrum in patients with cholelithiasis, the case mix and the variety of complications additionally limit the possibility to draw strong conclusions because of even smaller case numbers within subgroup analyses. Nevertheless, statistically significant differences between the two study groups have been obtained for several parameters of clinical relevance. Certainly, a type II error cannot be excluded for non-significant test results because of the minor statistical power. Furthermore, challenges in the interpretation of data are caused by two aspects of the study design. First, analysis of complicated cases is of special interest and must be seen with caution, as they are analyzed separately and within the whole study group. We aimed at distinguishing between these subgroups to emphasize the need for different management and surgical timing. Second, the study's approach was chosen from the therapeutic endpoint of cholecystectomy, which influences the selection of patients (bias). This study design was chosen based on rising numbers of cholecystectomies, which were not attributable to a changed therapeutic regimen with earlier indication for surgery. Finally, our study does therefore not include any aspects on the effects of an expectant management in asymptomatic cases, which might certainly be a relevant subgroup of patients with cholelithiasis. The presented online survey additionally showed a restricted response rate, but is in the range of other published online surveys. It was designed not to report exact numbers, but to deliver an insight in the current management and to create awareness for the lack of a guideline. This first ever online survey on this topic might therefore hold a high risk of recollection bias, as we asked for individual characteristics in practices. However, even from this restricted point of view, we observed a heterogeneous picture in the pediatric management with a tendency of delayed timing of surgery. We propose to conduct further prospective multicenter studies and international consensus conferences to further explore single aspects on diagnostics and therapy.

### ASGE guideline on the role of endoscopy in the evaluation and management of choledocholithiasis [^117VYidN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2019). High credibility.

ASGE guideline — Strength of recommendation (GRADE) is labeled as either strong or conditional, with standard wording and practical implications by audience. The recommendations are labeled as either "strong" or "conditional" according to the GRADE approach, and the words "the guideline panel recommend" are used for strong recommendations and "suggest" for conditional recommendations. For patients: Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not for strong recommendations, whereas most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not for conditional recommendations. For clinicians: Most individuals should receive the intervention and formal decision aids are not likely to be needed for strong recommendations, whereas for conditional recommendations different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences, and decision aids may be useful. For policymakers: The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations and adherence could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator for strong recommendations, whereas conditional recommendations mean policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Atazanavir [^112Xuboj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis

Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to:

clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir.
loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance.

See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].

5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia

Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^1154g2By]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The C-GALL trial is a multicentre, pragmatic trial to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of conservative management compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease in a secondary care setting. The trial was conducted across 20 secondary care sites in the UK NHS. The trial found no differences in overall bodily pain (primary outcome), quality of life, complications, or the need for further treatment between the two management strategies up to 18 months of follow-up. There was statistically significant evidence that gallbladder specific quality of life measures (condition specific questionnaire total score and condition specific questionnaire persistent symptoms)improved in the randomised cholecystectomy group at 18 months.

Before the trial, the C-GALL group envisaged that clinicians would be reluctant to recruit patients because of a bias towards surgery. Moreover, it was assumed that patients might be unwilling to consent to recruitment, as surgery is usually the only option discussed to relieve symptoms, and alternatives are probably not considered at both primary and secondary care level. During the trial, many patients opted for non-surgical treatment after the C-GALL team provided detailed information on the alternative option. Almost one third of patients randomised to receive conservative management subsequently received surgery, and 30% of those randomised to receive cholecystectomy had not undergone surgery by 24 months. It was also interesting to note the number of patients that opted not to take part in the trial, accepting conservative management over surgery during the trial when alternative treatments were discussed.

### Core outcome set for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease [^117E9ecU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The study was designed using existing best-practice approaches for COS development and included three linked phases: the generation of a longlist of outcomes informed by a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative evidence, and qualitative interviews with patients; a face-to-face meeting with patients to determine which outcomes they considered to be core; and a three-round Delphi survey with healthcare professionals to determine the final COS. The study was registered in the COMET Initiative database. The COS was developed alongside an ongoing RCT comparing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with observation/conservative management for preventing recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstones (C-Gall trial, ISRCTN55215960). The scope of this COS was restricted to interventions (both surgical and non-surgical) for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease in adults.

Phase 1: generation of outcome list

This phase of outcome mapping has been published elsewhere. In brief, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify outcomes reported in trials of interventions for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease, and outcomes from exploratory studies reported by patients with a lived experience of symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease. In addition, a content analysis of individual items in disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was conducted. Outcomes of relevance to patients were identified from analysis of interviews and focus groups with patients who had a diagnosis of symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease, and audio recordings of consultations for a clinical trial evaluating treatments for symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Results

Overall, 2667 patients in 20 secondary care centres were assessed for eligibility between August 2016 and November 2019. Of these, 436 were randomised to receive either conservative management (n = 218) or laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 218; fig 1). After two post-randomisation exclusions, 434 participants were included; one participant withdrew from the conservative management group owing to a previously unstated preference for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and one participant was randomised twice to the cholecystectomy group. For the primary outcome analysis, 217 participants were included in the conservative management group and 217 in the cholecystectomy group. The randomised groups were well balanced at baseline (table 1).

### Management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis for patients awaiting renal transplantation [^111AkmNo]. Surgical Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients awaiting renal transplantation. Cholecystectomy is considered before renal transplantation because of potential worsened complications from cholelithiasis with posttransplantation immunosuppression. This study reviewed the outcomes for operative and nonoperative management of asymptomatic cholelithiasis in patients awaiting renal transplantation.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of all patients who received renal transplant at the authors' institution during the period 1994 to 2000 was completed. All patients underwent pretransplantation abdominal ultrasound.

Results

Of the 411 patients receiving renal transplants (242 men and 169 women with a mean age of 45.7 years), 32 had cholelithiasis at the pretransplantation workup (7.8%), and 35 had gallbladder abnormalities (8.5%): polyps, thickened wall, sludge, bile duct dilation. Before transplantation, 12 of the 32 patients (38%) with cholelithiasis underwent uncomplicated cholecystectomy. None of the remaining 19 patients with cholelithiasis required cholecystectomy after renal transplantation (mean follow-up period 6.2 years). Of the 35 patients with gallbladder abnormalities, 2 required post transplantation elective cholecystectomy.

Conclusions

No evidence was found for increased morbidity related to cholelithiasis or gallbladder abnormalities after renal transplantation. As in the general population, the risks associated with asymptomatic cholelithiasis do not appear to warrant prophylactic cholecystectomy for patients awaiting renal transplantation.

BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of this study

An unexpected problem was the longer than expected time for patients on the surgical waiting list who had been allocated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. When designing the trial, it was anticipated that the waiting time would be, on average, six months. Therefore 18 months was chosen as the primary outcome follow-up time to reflect a time equivalent to 12 months after surgery. During the trial, however, we observed that patients often experienced longer waiting times for surgery, initially due to limited NHS resources, later compounded by the impact of covid-19 related restrictions. To address this, we added a 24 month follow-up point. Our sensitivity analyses on adherence to treatment suggested that the waiting list was unlikely to bias the study findings. The waiting list may, however, limit generalisability to some other countries' jurisdictions. A further limitation was the non-blinding of participants and treating surgeons to allocation. In this trial, the pragmatic research question tested the most effective treatment strategy in a real life setting, leading to an inevitable lack of blinding. Finally, the cost effectiveness analysis was conducted from an NHS perspective, which may impact the generalisability of its results to other healthcare settings.

### Management of gallstones [^113qrVME]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with gallstones can be managed expectantly. Generally, only persons with symptoms related to the presence of gallstones (e.g., steady, nonparoxysmal pain lasting four to six hours located in the upper abdomen) or complications (such as acute cholecystitis or gallstone pancreatitis) warrant surgical intervention. Biliary pain is alleviated by cholecystectomy in the majority of cases. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the most cost-effective management strategy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. Medical management strategies are mostly palliative and are not widely supported. Patients with longer-lasting biliary pain, in combination with abdominal tenderness, fever, and/or leukocytosis, require an ultrasound evaluation to help establish a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Once a patient is diagnosed, having cholecystectomy early in the course of the disease can significantly reduce the hospital stay.

### Surgical treatment for asymptomatic cholelithiasis… [^113KdHCe]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question When is surgery indicated in patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Evidence-Based Answer Surgery should not be offered to patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Cholecystectomy may be beneficial for patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer, infection, or other complications, including younger patients and those with choledocholithiasis, sickle cell disease, gallstones larger than 3 cm, or significant immunosuppression. Evidence Summary Most patients with gallstones have asymptomatic cholelithiasis, defined as the detection of gallstones without related symptoms or sequelae such as colic, cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. 1 There are no randomized clinical trials of surgical treatment of asymptomatic cholelithiasis.

Family physicians should balance the risks of surgery with those of expectant management, which are derived from observational studies.
2. A prospective study followed 298 patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cholelithiasis in a large health maintenance organization for 25 years. 3 Patients developed symptoms at a rate of approximately 1% to 2% per year. Complications were rare except when preceded by biliary colic. Complications typically include acute cholecystitis, obstructive jaundice, acute pancreatitis, and gallstone ileus. Patients who are at high risk of biliary cancer and other operative or disease-related complications may be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks of observation.

1, 5, 9 Patients with asymptomatic choledocholithiasis have a much higher risk of severe complications and should be offered prophylactic cholecystectomy. 1 All patients should be counseled about the symptoms of biliary colic, because most severe gallstone-related complications are preceded by these symptoms. 1.

### Diagnosis and management of cholecystitis and cholangitis [^114HEYrU]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis is a prevalent condition in Western populations. Most cases are asymptomatic but complications can occur. Acute cholangitis, cholecystitis, and gallstone pancreatitis are the most common biliary tract emergencies and are usually caused by biliary calculi. Whenever possible, acute cholecystitis should be treated with early LC. AAC is an uncommon condition usually affecting patients with significant comorbidities. Treatment is usually with percutaneous cholecystostomy, which often is also the only required therapy. Endoscopic drainage is the preferred form of biliary decompression in acute cholangitis and these patients should subsequently undergo elective LC unless unfit for surgery. Effective and optimal management of biliary tract emergencies relies on close cooperation between gastroenterologist, surgeon, and radiologist.

Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm

The assessment of the retrospective study's and the survey's findings prompted the development of a diagnostic and therapeutic proposal in accordance with the adult guidelines due to the lack of large-scale multi-center studies in pediatric patients. This algorithm is depicted in Fig. 3. It emphasizes the close and early interdisciplinary consensus of pediatricians and pediatric surgeons, as well as the clear differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic cholelithiasis and complicated cholelithiasis in cases of acute inflammation or choledocholithiasis. We propose to discuss cases with concomitant diseases early and interdisciplinary due to the continued lack of large-scale population studies for evidence-based guidelines. It certainly cannot provide answers to all therapeutic options (e.g. antibiotic therapy), as large-scale population studies are missing, and information has to be transferred from adult management.

### Gallstone management in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [^112bGokV]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global rise in obesity represents a significant public health concern. Metabolic and bariatric surgeries (MBS) have gained prominence as effective treatment options for managing obesity, particularly in severe cases, offering sustainable outcomes and often leading to improvements or remission of obesity-associated conditions. However, patients undergoing MBS are at an elevated risk of developing gallstones. This increased risk is attributed to a predisposition for cholesterol gallstone formation and the effects of altered neurohormonal regulation on gallbladder contractility in individuals with obesity. Furthermore, obesity itself is a known risk factor for gallbladder disease. The rapid weight loss commonly associated with bariatric procedures further exacerbates this risk by increasing bile lithogenicity, thereby raising the likelihood of gallstone formation.

The management of the gallbladder in patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery remains a topic of ongoing debate, primarily due to the heightened risk of gallstone formation and the controversy surrounding prophylactic cholecystectomy. Advocates of prophylactic cholecystectomy argue that the combination of obesity and the rapid weight loss following bariatric surgery significantly increases the likelihood of gallstone formation. They contend that preemptive gallbladder removal can prevent complications, reduce the need for emergency surgeries, and potentially be more cost-effective in the long term.

Conversely, critics argue that routine cholecystectomy is unnecessary for many patients, as not all develop symptomatic gallstones, and it may expose them to avoidable surgical risks. An alternative approach, endorsed by some experts, is simultaneous cholecystectomy (SCC), particularly when preoperative ultrasonography detects gallbladder pathology. Others recommend limiting SCC to patients with symptomatic gallstones, thereby optimizing the balance between surgical risks and benefits.

The relationship between %EWL, early gallstone formation, and the postoperative presentation of symptomatic and asymptomatic gallstones requires further evaluation. This manuscript examines the management of gallstone disease (GSD), the incidence of postoperative gallstone formation, and the subsequent need for cholecystectomy in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) at a tertiary care center in Egypt.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^113NB7Ht]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (cholelithiasis) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with clinical surveys suggesting prevalence rates of 6% to 25% and a tendency to increase with age. Gallstones are more common in women. A clinical ultrasound survey in the UK reported prevalence rates of 12% and 22% among men and women older than 60 years, respectively.

In the UK and North America, the number of surgical procedures for gallstone disease increased steadily between the 1950s and 1990s, reflecting the rise in prevalence and prompt identification of gallstone disease and the use of cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Rates of surgical procedures stabilised in these countries towards the end of the 20th century. In England, about 61 000 episodes cost the NHS > £200m in 2018/19.

The natural course of gallstones is benign; most people remain asymptomatic and show a relatively low progression to symptomatic disease. A systematic review published in 2007 reported the range for disease progression as 10% to 25% in studies that followed-up patients after initial diagnosis (≤ 15 years of follow-up). The annual risk of developing symptoms has been estimated at 2–4%.

Most people with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstone disease do not develop complications; reported annual rates of developing complications (eg, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis, acute cholangitis obstructive jaundice) have been as low as 1–3%. The Italian Group for the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cholelithiasis study reported an annual incidence for complications of 0.7% in patients with symptoms.

Mortality from gallstone disease is rare — typically less than 1% from gallstone related causes.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116GMBC8]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of cholelithiasis in children and adolescents appears to be increasing, even if the entity remains to be a rare disease within this population. Prevalence is ranking between 0.13 and 1.9%. Diagnostic and therapeutic management seems to be heterogeneous in clinical practice and appears to be based on small population studies. In contrast, different guidelines apply to adults in various countries (e.g. Europe, Japan, USA). In Germany, guidelines by the German Societies for Digestive and Metabolic Diseases and for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract regulate the management of cholelithiasis in adults. Separate treatment guidelines in the pediatric sector on the basis of evidence-based large-scale population studies are either lacking, outdated or represent expert opinions of distinct hospitals (e.g. Sweden, Brazil, India, USA, Egypt, Iran). This is significant with regard to the timing of surgery. The guidelines for adult management updated in 2018 are based on the largest randomized trial in adults so far, the multi-center "Acute cholecystitis: early versus delayed cholecystectomy" trial. Even though the results are being controversially discussed, they recommend an early cholecystectomy within the first 48 h of symptoms of acute cholecystitis and an elective cholecystectomy in symptomatic cases without signs of inflammation.

Aiming at assessing the management and especially the surgical timing of this rare but increasing pediatric disease, we chose a dual approach in this study. Firstly, a retrospective analysis of patients with cholecystectomy was performed within our institution, comparing diagnostics and therapy of children and adolescents in the pediatric surgery department with the management of young patients (aged < 25 years) in the visceral surgery department. Secondarily, diagnostic and therapeutic standards of this entity were evaluated in pediatric patients using an online survey via the German Society of Pediatric Surgery.

### Effectiveness of conservative management versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the prevention of recurrent symptoms and complications in adults with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease (C-GALL trial): pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial [^112BWTgR]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics. Values are number (percentage) unless stated otherwise

BMI = body mass index; CSQ = condition specific questionnaire for gallstones; MCS = mental component summary; PCS = physical component summary; SD = standard deviation.

For SF-36 norm based scores, a higher score (range 0–100) indicates better quality of life. For Otago gallstones CSQ, a higher score (range 0–100) indicates higher symptom burden and therefore poorer quality of life.

By 18 months, 54 (25%) participants in the conservative management group and 146 (67%) in the cholecystectomy group had received surgery. The median time to surgery was 8.1 months (interquartile range 4.0–10.6; n = 53) in the conservative management group and 4.5 months (2.7–6.9; n = 146) in the cholecystectomy group; 46 (85%) and 142 (97%) were elective surgeries, respectively (see supplementary appendix 2, table S2). By 24 months post-randomisation, 64 (29%) participants in the conservative management group and 153 (71%) in the cholecystectomy group had received surgery. Among the 153 participants in the conservative management group who did not undergo surgery by 24 months, 15 (10%) were on a surgical waiting list, 131 (86%) were not on a surgical waiting list, and 7 (5%) withdrew from follow-up. Of the 64 participants in the cholecystectomy group, by 24 months 13 (20%) were on a surgical waiting list, 13 (20%) were not on a surgical waiting list, 5 (8%) withdrew from follow-up, and 33 (52%) declined surgery. Supplementary appendix 2, table S3 shows the baseline characteristics of those randomised to laparoscopic cholecystectomy who did and did not have surgery.

### Management of gallstone disease in children: a new protocol based on the experience of a single center [^1122tSG9]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Gallstones and cholelithiasis are being increasingly diagnosed in children owing to the widespread use of ultrasonography. The treatment of choice is cholecystectomy, and routine intraoperative cholangiography is recommended to explore the common bile duct. The objectives of this study were to describe our experience with the management of gallstone disease in childhood over the last 18 years and to propose an algorithm to guide the approach to cholelithiasis in children based on clinical and ultrasonographic findings.

Methods

The data for this study were obtained by reviewing the records of all patients with gallstone disease treated between January 1994 and October 2011. The patients were divided into the following 5 groups based on their symptoms: group 1, asymptomatic; group 2, nonbiliary obstructive symptoms; group 3, acute cholecystitis symptoms; group 4, a history of biliary obstructive symptoms that were completely resolved by the time of surgery; and group 5, ongoing biliary obstructive symptoms. Patients were treated according to an algorithm based on their clinical, ultrasonographic, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) findings.

Results

A total of 223 patients were diagnosed with cholelithiasis, and comorbidities were present in 177 patients (79.3%). The most common comorbidities were hemolytic disorders in 139 patients (62.3%) and previous bariatric surgery in 16 (7.1%). Although symptoms were present in 134 patients (60.0%), cholecystectomy was performed for all patients with cholelithiasis, even if they were asymptomatic; the surgery was laparoscopic in 204 patients and open in 19. Fifty-six patients (25.1%) presented with complications as the first sign of cholelithiasis (eg, pancreatitis, choledocolithiasis, or acute calculous cholecystitis). Intraoperative cholangiography was indicated in 15 children, and it was positive in only 1 (0.4%) for whom ERCP was necessary to extract the stone after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Preoperative ERCP was performed in 11 patients to extract the stones, and a hepaticojejunostomy was indicated in 2 patients. There were no injuries to the hepatic artery or common bile duct in our series.

Conclusions

Based on our experience, we can propose an algorithm to guide the approach to cholelithiasis in the pediatric population. The final conclusion is that LC results in limited postoperative complications in children with gallstones. When a diagnosis of choledocolithiasis or dilation of the choledocus is made, ERCP is necessary if obstructive symptoms persist either before or after an LC. Intraoperative cholangiography and laparoscopic common bile duct exploration are not mandatory.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^115udxLv]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Postoperative management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy — Patients undergoing uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis may be discharged home on the day of surgery; admission rates despite planned same day discharge are reported to be 1–39% and patients older than age 50 may be at increased risk for admission, while readmission rates range from 0–8%; time to discharge after surgery for patients with acute cholecystitis, bile duct stones, or in patients converted to an open procedure should be determined on an individual basis.

### Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in children and adolescents: does this increasing diagnosis require a common guideline for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons? [^116UPgZS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

We are presenting this study with the specific aim of exploring especially the therapeutic management and the surgical timing in pediatric cases of cholelithiasis. Findings of the retrospective study indicate a preferred expectant management in pediatric patients with an increased time span with symptoms and longer timeframe between diagnosis and surgery. This may be largely determined by the high proportion of primary pediatric medical admissions. Overall percentage of complicated cases was not significantly higher in pediatric patients in comparison to patients of the visceral surgery subgroup. However, we see an increased risk for complications, especially for biliary pancreatitis, in these patients besides the unnecessarily extended duration of symptoms in pediatric patients. The preference for an expectant management in symptomatic or even acute and complicated cases was also reported within the online survey. Based on the results of the dual approach of our study, we can conclude that the management practice is heterogeneous and deviates fundamentally from the guidelines of adult medicine. Moreover, the survey's findings revealed a lack of standardization or homogeneous optimal surgical timing after end of conservative treatment. The ideal surgical timing has been widely discussed in adult medicine so far, which could be partially solved by the guideline for adults. Various publications appear to be in consensus on the association of delayed treatment with increased complication rates. However, certain limitations, such as restricted case numbers, the high risk of selection bias and inconsistent definitions of diagnoses, must be taken into account to properly classify the value of these publications. Sarrami et al. demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of 188 children and adolescents with cholelithiasis that the risk of subsequent hospital admission was increased by 5% for every 10 days with delayed treatment. They speculated that a delay in surgery might increase complication rates, while acknowledging their limitations of an inconsistent definition and therapeutic approach in patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis and the need for large, randomized trails.
