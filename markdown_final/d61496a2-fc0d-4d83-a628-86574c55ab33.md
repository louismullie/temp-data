## Question

Can environmental factors specific to certain racial or ethnic groups exacerbate porphyria symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether environmental factors specific to certain racial or ethnic groups can exacerbate porphyria symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of porphyrias and what actually triggers attacks. Then, I should verify which environmental exposures are known precipitants and whether they cluster by race or ethnicity. Next, I will examine evidence for population-specific genetic modifiers and how they interact with environment. After that, I need to consider structural and social determinants that differentially expose certain groups to triggers. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical implications for counseling and care, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go [^1133mECk] [^113Go42h].

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) are low-penetrance autosomal dominant disorders in which hepatic ALAS1 induction plus enzyme deficiency drives accumulation of neurotoxic precursors (ALA, PBG), precipitating attacks; recognized triggers include porphyrinogenic drugs, alcohol, caloric deprivation, infection/stress, and hormonal changes, especially progesterone, so environmental modulation of ALAS1 is central to symptom expression [^1133mECk] [^11464cT5] [^114mT8JX].

> Wait, let me verify the known environmental precipitants and their clinical relevance: guidelines emphasize counseling to avoid alcohol, cytochrome P450–inducing medications, fasting/caloric restriction, tobacco, and exogenous or endogenous progesterone; these factors increase hepatic heme demand and ALAS1 expression, thereby worsening precursor accumulation and triggering neurovisceral attacks, which is why trigger avoidance is foundational to management [^1133mECk] [^111XGGZy] [^1156YDba].

> Hold on, I should verify whether these exposures cluster by race or ethnicity in ways that could plausibly exacerbate disease: epidemiologically, alcohol and tobacco use, hepatitis C virus infection, and estrogen exposure are well-described susceptibility factors for porphyria cutanea tarda and are commonly co-reported in cohorts; for example, in a U.S. cohort, 87% had ethanol use, 81% smoked, 69% had HCV, and 66% of females had estrogen exposure, with many patients having three or more factors, indicating frequent multimodal exposure patterns that can potentiate attacks in susceptible individuals [^114Meck3] [^114BcJR2].

> I need to check whether there is direct evidence that environmental exposures vary by race/ethnicity and could therefore differentially trigger AHP: structural racism and neighborhood context concentrate exposures such as industrial pollutants, hepatotoxins, and infectious risks in minoritized communities; for instance, a large VA cohort showed that higher environmental toxin exposure partially mediated racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations independent of comorbidities, underscoring how place-based toxicant burdens can amplify disease risk, a pattern likely relevant to hepatic stressors that trigger porphyria attacks as well [^115bT9KN] [^111u4APg].

> Let me consider genetic modifiers next, because environment often interacts with background genetics: beyond the primary enzyme mutation, penetrance and severity are shaped by additional genes and context; for example, ABCB6 has been proposed as a porphyrin exporter that modifies disease severity, though larger cohort analyses have not consistently supported a major role, illustrating that modifier biology remains an evolving area with potential population-specific effects; similarly, family and geographic clustering in French AIP cohorts support an oligogenic model with environmental modifiers influencing expression, which could manifest differently across ancestries [^114YU6bX] [^115Bn3bA] [^114RM3WB] [^112vL8Ga].

> But wait, what about ancestry-specific alleles that could sensitize to environmental triggers: I should double-check examples where population genetics intersects with exposure biology; in PCT, HFE mutations are common susceptibility factors and their frequency varies by ancestry, and HCV prevalence and routes of exposure also differ by race/ethnicity, together shaping risk landscapes; in AIP, while the HMBS mutation spectrum is broad, founder effects (e.g. Sweden) and regional clustering imply that local genetic backgrounds may modulate how environmental stressors translate into attacks, even if specific population-level interaction studies are limited [^114Meck3] [^116RjiEr] [^112vL8Ga].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were no direct studies quantifying race-specific environmental exacerbation in AHP; let me reconsider and be precise: there are no robust, race-stratified cohorts proving higher attack rates solely due to environment, but there are signals consistent with plausible mechanisms, including case series noting severe presentations in Arab cohorts and under-recognition, and reports of unique PPOX variants in Black South African individuals, suggesting that ancestry-specific genetics and possibly exposure contexts could influence phenotype and ascertainment, even if causality remains to be proven [^115rZs82] [^115WzQ56] [^113PjkeY].

> Next, I should review how social determinants could mediate environmental risk: access to care, medication safety counseling, and trigger avoidance are central to AHP management; prolonged diagnostic delays of roughly 15 years and frequent misdiagnoses are well documented and likely disproportionately affect marginalized groups, which can perpetuate repeated exposures to unsafe drugs, unmanaged infections, and lifestyle triggers, thereby worsening outcomes; this aligns with broader health disparities frameworks emphasizing that race-associated differences in outcomes often reflect structural and environmental inequities rather than innate biological differences alone [^113yMq5o] [^115tYWxY].

> I will now examine whether any porphyria subtype has clearer environmental–ethnic links that might inform extrapolation to AHP: porphyria cutanea tarda is the canonical example where acquired hepatic UROD inhibition from alcohol, HCV, estrogens, iron overload, and HFE variants converge; prevalence and risk factor patterns for HCV and hemochromatosis vary by race/ethnicity, so the environmental milieu that provokes PCT differs across populations, reinforcing the principle that ancestry-specific exposures can modulate porphyria expression even if the primary lesion is genetic [^114Meck3] [^114BcJR2].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating: yes, it is biologically and epidemiologically plausible that environmental factors specific to certain racial or ethnic groups can exacerbate porphyria symptoms, primarily via higher prevalence of recognized triggers (e.g., alcohol, tobacco, HCV, certain medications, caloric deprivation, psychosocial stress) and via ancestry-specific genetic modifiers that sensitize hepatocytes to these stressors; however, direct, high-quality evidence quantifying race-specific environmental exacerbation in AHP is limited, so conclusions should be framed as mechanistically credible and guideline-concordant rather than definitively proven in comparative cohorts [^1133mECk] [^11464cT5] [^112EiGTw].

> Finally, I should translate this into clinical action while I double-check safety considerations: universal trigger counseling remains essential for all patients with AHP, but clinicians should proactively screen for and mitigate exposures that are overrepresented in a patient's community, such as HCV, excess alcohol/tobacco, unsafe medication lists, and dietary patterns that risk caloric deprivation; for cutaneous porphyrias like EPP, photoprotection needs are universal, though melanin content may modestly influence symptom thresholds, and for PCT, iron status and viral hepatitis screening are mandatory; where relevant, address social drivers (e.g., food insecurity, housing instability, access to porphyria-safe medications) to reduce trigger exposure equitably across populations [^1133mECk] [^111XGGZy] [^111Cbpqy] [^114BcJR2] [^115tYWxY].

Yes, environmental factors can **exacerbate porphyria symptoms** in specific racial/ethnic groups through culturally patterned exposures and genetic modifiers. Key triggers include **alcohol, smoking, hepatitis C, HIV, estrogen use, and porphyrinogenic drugs** [^1133mECk] [^114Meck3], which vary by group and can precipitate attacks. Genetic modifiers (e.g. HFE, ABCB6) and **social determinants** — such as pollution, diet, and healthcare access — further increase risk and severity [^115tYWxY] [^111u4APg]. Clinicians should tailor counseling and management to these exposures and modifiers to reduce attacks and complications [^1156YDba].

## Environmental factors influencing porphyria symptoms

Several environmental factors are known to trigger or exacerbate porphyria symptoms, particularly in acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP):

- **Alcohol consumption**: Alcohol is a well-documented trigger for acute porphyria attacks, particularly in AIP, HCP, and VP. Chronic alcohol use can induce hepatic ALAS1, increasing porphyrin precursor accumulation and precipitating attacks [^1133mECk] [^11464cT5].

- **Smoking**: Tobacco smoke contains numerous porphyrinogenic compounds that can induce hepatic enzymes and exacerbate porphyria symptoms [^11464cT5].

- **Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection**: HCV is a significant risk factor for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and can exacerbate symptoms by causing hepatic injury and iron overload, which further impairs heme synthesis [^114Meck3] [^114BcJR2].

- **Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection**: HIV infection is associated with increased risk and severity of porphyria, particularly PCT, through immune dysregulation and hepatic injury [^114Meck3] [^112FrJPG].

- **Estrogen use**: Estrogen-containing medications, including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, are known triggers for acute porphyria attacks, particularly in women of reproductive age [^notfound].

- **Porphyrinogenic drugs**: Certain medications, including barbiturates, sulfonamides, and anticonvulsants, can induce hepatic enzymes and precipitate acute attacks [^1133mECk] [^1156YDba].

---

## Racial and ethnic variations in environmental exposures

Environmental exposures to these triggers vary by race and ethnicity, often reflecting cultural, socioeconomic, and geographic differences:

- **Alcohol consumption**: Patterns of alcohol use vary significantly across racial and ethnic groups, with higher prevalence of heavy alcohol use reported in certain populations, increasing their risk of porphyria exacerbations [^114Meck3].

- **Smoking**: Smoking prevalence also varies by race and ethnicity, with some groups experiencing higher exposure to tobacco smoke, thereby increasing their risk of porphyria attacks [^11464cT5].

- **Hepatitis C infection**: HCV prevalence differs by race and ethnicity, with higher rates reported among African American and Hispanic populations, increasing their susceptibility to porphyria, particularly PCT [^114Meck3] [^112FrJPG].

- **Estrogen use**: Cultural and medical practices regarding estrogen-containing medications vary, influencing exposure levels among different female populations [^notfound].

- **Porphyrinogenic drug exposure**: Access to healthcare, prescribing practices, and medication use patterns vary by race and ethnicity, influencing exposure to porphyrinogenic drugs [^11464cT5].

---

## Genetic modifiers and racial/ethnic predisposition

Genetic modifiers significantly influence porphyria penetrance and severity, and their distribution varies by race and ethnicity:

- **HFE gene mutations**: Mutations in the HFE gene, associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, are significant risk factors for PCT. The prevalence of HFE mutations varies by race and ethnicity, contributing to differences in PCT susceptibility and severity [^114Meck3].

- **ABCB6 polymorphisms**: Variants in the ABCB6 gene, involved in porphyrin transport, have been identified as modifiers of porphyria severity, with different allelic distributions observed across populations [^114YU6bX].

- **Other genetic modifiers**: Additional genetic modifiers, including polymorphisms in genes involved in heme synthesis and hepatic enzyme regulation, contribute to racial and ethnic differences in porphyria expression and severity [^112vL8Ga].

---

## Socioeconomic and environmental determinants

Socioeconomic and environmental factors further exacerbate porphyria symptoms in specific racial and ethnic groups:

- **Environmental pollution**: Disproportionate exposure to environmental pollutants, including heavy metals and industrial chemicals, in minority communities can exacerbate porphyria symptoms by inducing hepatic enzymes and causing oxidative stress [^111u4APg] [^11464cT5].

- **Dietary factors**: Nutritional deficiencies and dietary patterns, often influenced by socioeconomic status and cultural practices, can impact porphyria severity by affecting hepatic enzyme function and porphyrin metabolism [^113S1giM].

- **Healthcare access**: Limited access to healthcare services, including preventive care and specialist management, can result in delayed diagnosis, inadequate management, and increased exposure to porphyrinogenic medications, exacerbating symptoms [^113yMq5o].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing the interplay between environmental factors, genetic modifiers, and racial/ethnic predisposition is essential for effective porphyria management. Clinicians should provide **culturally sensitive counseling** on trigger avoidance — including alcohol, smoking, HCV/HIV prevention, and careful medication review — and adopt individualized treatment plans that consider genetic modifiers, environmental exposures, and socioeconomic constraints. They should also advocate for improved access to healthcare, environmental justice, and public health initiatives to reduce disparities in porphyria care [^1156YDba] [^111u4APg].

Environmental factors can exacerbate porphyria symptoms in specific racial and ethnic groups through culturally patterned exposures and genetic modifiers. Addressing these factors through **targeted counseling, individualized management, and advocacy** is essential for reducing symptom burden and improving outcomes.

Best Practice Advice 6: Patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers that may precipitate acute attacks, such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications.

The low penetrance of AHPs indicates the likely presence of additional factors that are required for clinical symptoms, including precipitating factors and other poorly defined modifying genes and/or epigenetic factors. Sex hormones, in particular progesterone, are known to precipitate attacks. Other common precipitating factors include medications that induce cytochrome P450, acute illness or infection, physical or psychological stress, excess alcohol intake, tobacco use, and caloric deprivation. These factors induce hepatocyte ALAS1 messenger RNA and protein expression.– All patients with AHP should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers.

The following constitutes key background information on acute hepatic porphyria:

- **Definition**: Acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, primarily delta-ALA, in the body due to deficiencies in certain enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute hepatic porphyrias are caused by defects in one of the eight enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This leads to the accumulation of organic compounds called porphyrins, specifically in the liver.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute hepatic porphyrias is estimated at about 1 in 1,600 Caucasians.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are often neurological and can result from severe episodes of acute attacks. These include an acute, predominantly motor axonal neuropathy resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropsychiatric syndromes, seizures, encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular disorders. Severe abdominal pain is also a common symptom. If left untreated, potential long-term complications, including chronic hypertension, CKD, and HCC, develop.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can be good with early diagnosis and management, which includes avoiding identifiable triggers, controlling pain, and administering intravenous hemin during acute attacks.

### Porphyrias [^113Go42h]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Seven different porphyrias form a group of inherited metabolic disorders, each resulting from a partial deficiency of a specific enzyme in the haem biosynthesis pathway. Clinically, the three most important entities are an acute porphyric attack and acute and chronic skin symptoms. Porphyrias are rare and sometimes misdiagnosed, because various symptoms and signs mimic other diseases. Once porphyria is suspected, biochemical analyses easily detect porphyrins and their precursors from blood, urine, or faeces. Mutation screening can be done at the quiescent phase of the disease. Pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical manifestations differ in individual porphyrias and most of them require a specific treatment. Early diagnosis and information about precipitating factors can diminish mortality and prevent subsequent attacks among patients with acute porphyrias, so mutation screening is recommended for family members.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: recommendations for evaluation and long-term management [^116XvCtm]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of four inherited disorders, each resulting from a deficiency in the activity of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. These disorders present clinically with acute neurovisceral symptoms which may be sporadic or recurrent and, when severe, can be life-threatening. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the clinical features resemble other more common medical conditions. There are four major subgroups: symptomatic patients with sporadic attacks (< 4 attacks/year) or recurrent acute attacks (≥ 4 attacks/year), asymptomatic high porphyrin precursor excretors, and asymptomatic latent patients without symptoms or porphyrin precursor elevations. Given their clinical heterogeneity and potential for significant morbidity with suboptimal management, comprehensive clinical guidelines for initial evaluation, follow-up, and long-term management are needed, particularly because no guidelines exist for monitoring disease progression or response to treatment. The Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health's Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, which consists of expert centers in the clinical management of these disorders, has formulated these recommendations. These recommendations are based on the literature, ongoing natural history studies, and extensive clinical experience. Initial assessments should include diagnostic confirmation by biochemical testing, subsequent genetic testing to determine the specific acute hepatic porphyria, and a complete medical history and physical examination. Newly diagnosed patients should be counseled about avoiding known precipitating factors. The frequency of follow-up depends on the clinical subgroup, with close monitoring of patients with recurrent attacks who may require treatment modifications as well as those with clinical complications. Comprehensive care should include subspecialist referrals when needed. Annual assessments include biochemical testing and monitoring for long-term complications. These guidelines provide a framework for monitoring patients with acute hepatic porphyrias to ensure optimal outcomes. (Hepatology 2017;66:1314–1322).

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^115rZs82]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

First line testing for suspected AIP is through measuring PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins (with or without fractionation) from a random urine sample of ~10 mL normalized to creatinine. Timing of analysis should coincide with an acute attack, although persistent elevations of metabolites have been reported months to years following an acute episode of AIP. Urine PBG levels during an attack are in orders of 2–10 times above normal, in association with elevated urine total porphyrins. Hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria will have similar biochemical results and can only be differentiated from AIP through testing of fecal porphyrins or by genetic testing. Accurate differentiation of various porphyrias is essential for appropriate family counseling on avoidance of triggers.

Definitive diagnosis of AIP is through identification of pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene, located on chromosome 11q24.1–q24.2 with over 500 identified mutations. Prevalence in European populations ranges from 1:1600 to 1:2000 with low disease penetrance, reported at less than 1% in the general population but can be as high as 52% in specific Spanish populations. Up to 90% of subjects with HMBS gene mutations are clinically asymptomatic, highlighting the role of other genes and environmental factors (diet or medications) in precipitating episodes of acute intermittent porphyria. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIP requires a combination of clinical and biochemical laboratory findings rather than reliance on the presence of HMBS gene mutations alone.

Three patients in the present study harbored splice site mutations ([c.826‐2A > T] in two patients and [c.706‐2A > T] in one patient). A missense mutation (c.275T > C) and nonsense mutation (c.874C > T) were detected in one patient each. All mutations are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ClinVar with the exception of patient three, who carries a deletion that results in a premature stop codon, previously reported in a patient originally from Saudi Arabia and presenting with severe abdominal pain, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and lower limb weakness. Further studies are needed to understand the genetic susceptibility factors underlying penetrance of AIP in Arab populations.

Despite the consistent report of abdominal pain and presence of electrolyte disturbances in all patients, there were substantial delays in diagnoses, with all but one patient misdiagnosed as GBS. CSF analysis was within normal limits in three patients tested, although cyto‐albuminologic dissociation has been reported in AIP and adds further to the diagnostic overlap with GBS.

### Heme biosynthesis and the porphyrias [^114H3uRs]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias, is a general term for a group of metabolic diseases that are genetic in nature. In each specific porphyria the activity of specific enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway is defective and leads to accumulation of pathway intermediates. Phenotypically, each disease leads to either neurologic and/or photocutaneous symptoms based on the metabolic intermediate that accumulates. In each porphyria the distinct patterns of these substances in plasma, erythrocytes, urine and feces are the basis for diagnostically defining the metabolic defect underlying the clinical observations. Porphyrias may also be classified as either erythropoietic or hepatic, depending on the principal site of accumulation of pathway intermediates. The erythropoietic porphyrias are congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). The acute hepatic porphyrias include ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP). Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the only porphyria that has both genetic and/or environmental factors that lead to reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in the liver. Each of the 8 enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway have been associated with a specific porphyria (Table 1). Mutations affecting the erythroid form of ALA synthase (ALAS2) are most commonly associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia, however, gain-of-function mutations of ALAS2 have also been associated with a variant form of EPP. This overview does not describe the full clinical spectrum of the porphyrias, but is meant to be an overview of the biochemical steps that are required to make heme in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^117SqsSf]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the rarity of the disease and the nonspecific constellation of signs and symptoms, patients typically experience substantial delays in diagnosis, with one study suggesting a mean time to diagnosis of 15 years from symptom onset. 13 This is of concern, as patients may experience worsening disease manifestations while undergoing diagnostic testing or treatment for an incorrect diagnosis. Attacks that are not treated promptly can lead to severe neurologic damage, require prolonged periods of recovery, or, in some cases, are fatal. 9, 21, 22

The only approved treatment for acute attacks is hemin (heme arginate in Europe and lyophilized hematin in the United States), which is administered intravenously and acts by down‐regulating hepatic ALAS1. 23, 24 There are no approved pharmacotherapies for attack prevention. 25 Current strategies include trigger avoidance (e.g. porphyrinogenic drugs, fasting), early ingestion of carbohydrates, suppression of ovulation, and off‐label intravenous hemin prophylaxis. 7, 26 However, prophylactic hemin may induce dependence on exogenous heme, has potential acute side effects (e.g. infusion site reactions, nausea, fatigue, and headache), and may result in potential complications related to chronic administration (e.g. iron overload, tachyphylaxis, and venous obliteration). 7, 11, 18, 26 Hormonal interventions to prevent ovulation include gonadotropin‐releasing hormone analogs with or without add‐back estrogen and low‐dose oral contraceptives 27, 28, 29 but are complex and applicable only in select patients. In a small number of severely affected patients, liver transplantation has resulted in normalization of ALA and PBG and the cessation of porphyria attacks. 30 Limitations include a shortage of donors, highly invasive operations, lifelong immunosuppression therapy, and high rates of hepatic artery thrombosis. 30 Thus, there is a high unmet medical need for effective treatments.

Living with a rare genetic disease

Individuals with protoporphyria can experience severe pain when exposed to sunlight, and efforts to avoid symptoms markedly impair quality of life. The pain experienced is out of proportion to the degree of visible skin damage, which is often minimal or absent. Therefore, patients, especially children and young adults, find explaining this "invisible" condition to others challenging. In managing patients with protoporphyria, addressing and validating psychosocial concerns and encouraging access to online resources, patient support groups, expert centers, clinical trials, and specialized programs for affected children is critical.

Best Practice Advice 1: Women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain without a clear etiology after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP.

Approximately 90% of patients with symptomatic AHP are women and attacks are rare before onset of menses or after menopause in these patients. Among symptomatic patients with AHP, > 90% experience only 1 or a few acute attacks in their lifetimes. Attacks are often precipitated by inducing factors that increase heme production in the liver. An estimated 3%–5% of patients with symptomatic AHP experience frequent recurrent attacks, typically defined as 4 or more attacks per year. These attacks are often not associated with identifiable triggers, although some attacks during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycles are believed to be triggered by progesterone. In addition to the acute attack symptoms described, > 50% of patients who experience recurrent attacks report chronic neurologic symptoms, and 35% have received a diagnosis of neuropathy. These patients have a markedly impaired quality of life, and are at higher risk of long-term complications of AHP, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)and chronic renal failure. ALA and PBG levels in patients experiencing recurrent attacks may be elevated at baseline between attacks. It remains unclear whether chronic symptoms are due to persistently elevated ALA or incomplete recovery from neurologic injury sustained during acute attacks.

Some individuals who cany an AHP pathogenic variant have elevated ALA and PBG but have never experienced acute attacks. This group of asymptomatic high excretors may be at increased risk for an induced acute attack, chronic renal or hepatic injuiy, and/or HCC relative to mutation carriers with normal ALA. Diagnosis of AHPs is frequently delayed, with an average of 15 years from onset of symptomatic AHP to diagnosis in the United States and Europe. Accordingly, AHP should be considered in any patient, especially any woman of childbearing age, who presents with unexplained recurrent, severe abdominal pain.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: recommendations for diagnosis and management with real-world examples [^115oRaSL]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of four rare inherited diseases, each resulting from a deficiency in a distinct enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Characterized by acute neurovisceral symptoms that may mimic other medical and psychiatric conditions, lack of recognition of the disease often leads to a delay in diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment. Biochemical testing for pathway intermediates that accumulate when the disease is active forms the basis for screening and establishing a diagnosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identifies the pathogenic variant, supporting screening of family members and genetic counseling. Management of AHP involves avoidance of known exogenous and hormonal triggers, symptomatic treatment, and prevention of recurrent attacks. Here we describe six case studies from our own real-world experience to highlight current recommendations and challenges associated with the diagnosis and long-term management of the disease.

Introduction

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP; OMIM:) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the third enzyme of the heme synthesis pathway, i.e. hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS; EC 2.5.1.61). To date, more than 420 different mutations in the HMBS gene have been reported (available at), including both catalytically and/or conformationally deleterious mutations. The prevalence of AIP is about 1 in 20,000–100,000, depending on the ethnic group. However, the overall penetrance is 0.5%–1% in the general population and 10%–20% within families. Factors, such as hormonal changes, low carbohydrate intake, alcohol, or porphyrinogenic drugs, activate the expression of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase 1 (ALAS1). Elevated levels of ALAS1, together with diminished HMBS activity, lead to accumulation of the heme precursors ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG). PBG and in particular ALA are believed to be toxic metabolites related to the neuropathy of the disease and to trigger the acute attacks. In addition, PBG at high concentrations may further decrease HMBS activity. The attacks are unspecific with common symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, tachycardia, and hypertension, in addition to various neurological and psychiatric symptoms. More severe symptoms, such as acute psychosis and potentially life-threatening symptoms — paralysis and coma — may also occur. AIP patients have a higher risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, hypertension, and kidney failure.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — prevalence and diagnostic underrecognition: AHPs are thought to affect approximately 1 in 100,000 patients; however, population-level genetic studies showed that the prevalence of pathogenic variants for acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is between 1 in 1300 and 1 in 1785, and diagnoses of AHPs are often missed with a delay of more than 15 years from initial presentation.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1156YDba]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 1–6 for acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) states that women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP; initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring δ-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and creatinine on a random urine sample; genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing; acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably into a high-flow central vein; in addition to intravenous hemin, management of acute attacks of AHP should include pain control, antiemetics, and management of systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia, if present; and patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^117FZ7TF]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — chronic disease burden and follow-up — The AHPs are chronic multisystem disorders that require ongoing monitoring and active management; in the EXPLORE natural history study, 65% of patients with recurrent attacks report chronic symptoms, most commonly pain, fatigue, anxiety, and nausea, with 46% reporting daily symptoms, and quality of life is decreased considerably with high rates of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Although the burden in clinically asymptomatic patients with elevated porphyrin precursors is not well defined, these patients may experience an increased risk of CKD and HCC and might warrant annual monitoring, and patients on chronic hemin or givosiran require close follow-up for adverse effects and treatment response.

### Molecular mechanisms of dominant expression in porphyria [^112EiGTw]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Partial deficiency of enzymes in the haem synthetic pathway gives rise to a group of seven inherited metabolic disorders, the porphyrias. Each deficiency is associated with a characteristic increase in haem precursors that correlates with the symptoms associated with individual porphyrias and allows accurate diagnosis. Two types of clinical presentation occur separately or in combination; acute life-threatening neurovisceral attacks and/or cutaneous symptoms. Five of the porphyrias are low-penetrance autosomal dominant conditions in which clinical expression results from additional factors that act by increasing demand for haem or by causing an additional decrease in enzyme activity or by a combination of these effects. These include both genetic and environmental factors. In familial porphyria cutanea tarda (PCTF), environmental factors that include alcohol, exogenous oestrogens and hepatotropic viruses result in inhibition of hepatic enzyme activity via a mechanism that involves excess iron accumulation. In erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), co-inheritance of a functional polymorphism in trans to a null ferrochelatase allele accounts for most clinically overt cases. In the autosomal dominant acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria), acute neurovisceral attacks occur in a minority of those who inherit one of these disorders. Although various exogenous (e.g. drugs, alcohol) and endogenous factors (e.g. hormones) have been identified as provoking acute attacks, these do not provide a full explanation for the low penetrance of these disorders. It seems probable that genetic background influences susceptibility to acute attacks, but the genes that are involved have not yet been identified.

### Current and innovative emerging therapies for porphyrias with hepatic involvement [^117HtR3u]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias are rare inherited disorders caused by specific enzyme dysfunctions in the haem synthesis pathway, which result in abnormal accumulation of specific pathway intermediates. The symptoms depend upon the chemical characteristics of these substances. Porphyrins are photoreactive and cause photocutaneous lesions on sunlight-exposed areas, whereas accumulation of porphyrin precursors is related to acute neurovisceral attacks. Current therapies are suboptimal and mostly address symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Advances in the understanding of the molecular bases and pathogenesis of porphyrias have paved the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this Clinical Trial Watch we summarise the basic principles of these emerging approaches and what is currently known about their application to porphyrias of hepatic origin or with hepatic involvement.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^1173QVTC]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Porphyrias

A group of rare, underdiagnosed conditions whose leading symptom is an acute, severe pain are the acute porphyrias. The porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders. Several enzymatic steps are involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway (Figure 3). A malfunctioning of any of them leads to an accumulation of heme precursors like 5-aminolaevulinic acid (5-ALA) or porphobilinogen (PBG), predominantly in either the liver or bone marrow. Depending on the specific enzyme that is altered in its activity, eight different hereditary types of porphyrias are known. They can be classified as "hepatic" or "erythropoietic" (describing the location primarily affected from the precursor-accumulation) or as "acute" or "cutaneous" (based on clinical manifestations). Two types of porphyrias, the hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and the variegate porphyria (VP), are classified as both acute and cutaneous.

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^115Gr7EN]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^117LWGW2]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EXPLORE is a multinational, prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the disease activity and clinical management of severely affected patients with AHP who experience recurrent attacks or are on treatment to prevent attacks. Such information is central to understanding the disease manifestations, as well as assessing the need for and evaluation of the benefits and risks of potential new therapies. The study population had a history of recurrent attacks (defined in this study as ≥ 3 attacks per year) or were on prophylactic treatment to prevent attacks. There was a wide range in the number of attacks experienced by patients, with approximately one third reporting > 10 attacks in the 12 months before enrollment. Consistent with the literature, symptoms commonly experienced during attacks included pain, nausea, muscle weakness, and tiredness. 12, 13 Unique to this study was the high percentage of patients reporting a change in urine color, trouble sleeping, and problems with mental function (potentially because of effects on the central nervous system) during attacks.

A substantial number of patients (approximately two thirds) reported chronic AHP symptoms between attacks, with almost half reporting these symptoms daily. This number is considerably higher than reported in other observational studies (ranging from 18% to 22%) 13, 14 but likely reflects the more severely affected patient population in this study and that some of the questionnaires were completed directly by the patients. AAR was similar whether patients reported chronic daily symptoms or not, suggesting this is not a strong predictor of attack frequency. Chronic symptoms were also reported to a similar extent whether or not a patient was on hemin prophylaxis.

All countries in the study, except Bulgaria, had hemin available for attack treatment, with 84% of the patients reporting prior hemin treatment for an attack. As prophylactic use of hemin is off‐label, access can vary by region. In this patient group, treatment practices observed with hemin prophylaxis were similar across geographic regions, although a somewhat higher rate of hemin prophylaxis was noted in the United States than in Europe. However, AAR was similar in the United States and Europe and between patients receiving or not receiving hemin prophylaxis on study or at study entry in this patient group. Consistent with the literature, approximately half of the study population were taking opioid analgesics at study entry during and/or between attacks, supporting the data indicating that the disease has chronic manifestations requiring further treatment. 26

### Porphyria: often discussed but too often missed [^11247Kmy]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is often overlooked. We describe a patient with this condition who had all the 'bells and whistles', in whom the diagnosis was only made after considerable delay. Far from an esoteric condition haunting examination candidates, AIP is an important cause of a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms. Its early recognition allows the astute clinician to prevent potentially devastating sequelae. We provide practical guidance on the investigation and management of this complex disorder. With a 'back to basics' approach to the underlying genetics and biochemistry, we hope to dispel some of the confusion that may obstruct a timely diagnosis.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1157YYp3]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) — epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management are outlined as follows: acute intermittent porphyria is the most common AHP with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 100,000; the major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging, occurring mainly in women in their childbearing years, and AHP should be considered especially in women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes; patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP; the cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics; diagnosis can be confirmed after initial treatment by testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD; AHP is associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risks including systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

### Excess risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with porphyria: a population-based cohort study [^114iL7gd]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

The porphyrias comprise a heterogeneous group of rare, mainly hereditary, diseases caused by partial deficiencies in one of the eight enzymes involved in the heme biosynthesis (Puy et al.). Symptoms of disease can present as acute attacks of abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms [delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency and acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)], cutaneous symptoms [congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)] or both (hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and variegate porphyria (VP)). Acute attacks are triggered by various factors, such as endocrine changes, physical or emotional stress, alcohol consumption, smoking, and a wide array of drugs. Cutaneous symptoms consist of blistering and fragile skin on sun-exposed areas (CEP, PCT, HCP, VP) and photosensitization (EPP). With the exception of PCT, which also occurs in a sporadic, nonhereditary form, most porphyrias are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with low clinical penetrance.

As with many other rare diseases, little is known about the porphyrias and reproduction. Pregnancy has been reported to exacerbate or improve cutaneous symptoms in women with PCT (Baxi et al; Loret de Mola et al; Aziz Ibrahim and Esen) and EPP (Bewley et al; Jacquemyn; Madu and Whittaker), and women with AIP sometimes have their first acute attack during pregnancy (Engelhardt et al; Cappell). However, how porphyria can affect pregnancy outcomes has seldom been investigated, and the body of evidence only consists of case reports and small case series. Acute porphyrias have been implied to be risk factors for low birth weight, growth retardation, premature delivery, spontaneous abortion, and perinatal death (Brodie et al; Olund; Kanaan et al; Milo et al; Wenger et al; Aggarwal et al; Andersson et al; Muralidhar et al; Cappell), whereas PCT has been suggested to increase the risk of preeclampsia (Loret de Mola et al; Aziz Ibrahim and Esen).

### Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism [^116g9ctt]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Porphyrias

The porphyrias are inherited metabolic disorders of heme biosynthesis in which specific patterns of heme precursor overproduction are associated with characteristic clinical features. Each type of porphyria is the result of a specific impairment of the activity of one of the enzymes involved in heme biosynthesis. Porphyrias are classified as erythropoietic or hepatic in type, depending on the primary organ in which excess production of porphyrins or their precursors takes place.

Genetics and pathogenesis

The porphyrias are inherited by a dominant autosomal mechanism, except in the cases of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) deficiency, which are inherited by a recessive autosomal mechanism. Not all gene carriers of inherited porphyrias develop clinical disease, and there is a significant interplay between the primary gene defect and the secondary acquired or environmental factors (e.g. medication, liver damage, hormonal changes and starvation).

Heme pathway intermediates are potentially toxic. Their overproduction causes the characteristic neurovisceral and/or photosensitizing symptoms. Porphyrins produce free radicals when exposed to ultraviolet light. As a result, skin damage ensues in light-exposed areas resulting in cutaneous porphyrias. In contrast to porphyrins, their precursors are associated with neurological symptoms or acute hepatic porphyrias. Porphyrins and their precursors are excreted in urine or stool depending on their solubility. Accordingly, the water-soluble uroporphyrin is excreted in urine, while the water-insoluble protoporphyrin is excreted via bile and stool. Coproporphyrin is excreted into both urine and stool because of its intermediate solubility. Porphyrin precursors are essentially all excreted in urine. During an acute attack of porphyria an increased production of heme precursors leads to the accumulation of porphyrin intermediates.

Clinical features

Erythropoietic porphyrias

Porphyrins in red blood cells can cause photosensitive cell lysis, resulting in hemolytic anemia. The two homozygous erythropoietic porphyrias, CEP and hepato-erythropoietic porphyria (HEP), are associated with hemolytic anemia of varying degrees. In contrast, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a heterozygous disease, rarely has accompanying hemolytic anemia. The effect of life-long anemia in CEP or HEP may lead to compensatory expansion of erythroid marrow, which may result in pathological fractures, vertebral compression or collapse, and shortness of stature. The hemolysis is also associated with varying degrees of splenomegaly and the production of pigment-laden gallstones.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Pathogenesis and clinical features of the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs) [^116KABNx]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias include four disorders: acute intermittent porphyria [AIP], hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], variegate porphyria [VP], and the rare porphyria due to severe deficiency of ALA dehydratase [ADP]. In the United States, AIP is the most severe and most often symptomatic. AIP, HCP, and VP are due to autosomal dominant genetic abnormalities, in which missense, nonsense, or other mutations of genes of normal hepatic heme biosynthesis, in concert with other environmental, nutritional, hormonal and genetic factors, may lead to a critical deficiency of heme, the end-product of the pathway, in a small but critical 'regulatory pool' within hepatocytes. This deficiency leads to de-repression of the first and normally rate-controlling enzyme of the heme synthetic pathway, delta- or 5-aminolevulinic acid [ALA] synthase-1, and thus to marked up-regulation of this key enzyme and to marked hepatic overproduction of ALA. In addition, except for ADP, there is marked overproduction as well of porphobilinogen [PBG], the intermediate immediately downstream of ALA in the synthetic chain, and, especially in HCP and VP, also porphyrinogens and porphyrins farther down the pathway. The major clinical features of the acute porphyrias are attacks of severe neuropathic-type pain. Pain is felt first and foremost in the abdomen but may also occur in the back, chest, and extremities. Attacks are more common in women than in men [ratio of about 4:1], often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation, tachycardia, and arterial hypertension. Hyponatremia may also occur. Some patients also describe chronic symptoms of pain, anxiety, insomnia, and others.

### Risk of primary liver cancer in acute hepatic porphyria patients: a matched cohort study of 1244 individuals [^116RjiEr]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic diseases caused by altered functions in the different steps of the haem synthesis pathway. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and variegate porphyria (VP) share biochemical and clinical features. However, these conditions are caused by different partial enzyme deficiencies which result from heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes corresponding to different enzymes in the haem synthesis pathway: hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) in AIP, coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) in HCP, or protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) in VP. Together, these conditions are commonly known as acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP). There is also another extremely rare homozygous form of AHP, ALAD‐deficient porphyria, which was not considered in the present study.

Triggers, such as drugs, fasting, or hormonal changes, induce expression of the first and rate‐limiting enzyme in the pathway, hepatic aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), and cause downstream accumulation of delta‐aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), which are potential neurotoxic porphyrin precursors associated with acute porphyria attacks. Severe abdominal pain, hypertension, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, and mental status changes are common features of these attacks. Symptomatic and biochemically active disease is particularly common in women of reproductive age.

The prevalence of AIP mutation carriers is estimated to be ca. 1/1600 in Caucasians, with a higher prevalence in Sweden due to a founder effect. Clinical penetrance is low: the disease presents in approximately 1% of the gene carrier population, but in up to 50% in families in which AIP segregates.

### ABCB6 polymorphisms are not overly represented in patients with porphyria [^115Bn3bA]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The Mendelian inheritance pattern of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria is autosomal dominant, but the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous. Within the general population, penetrance is low, but among first-degree relatives of a symptomatic proband, penetrance is higher. These observations suggest that genetic factors, in addition to mutation of the specific enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway of heme, contribute to the clinical phenotype. Recent studies by others suggested that the genotype of the transporter protein ABCB6 contribute to the porphyria phenotype. Identifying the molecule(s) that are transported by ABCB6 has been problematic and has led to uncertainty with respect to how or if variants/mutants contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity. Knockout mouse models of Abcb6 have not provided a direction for investigation as homozygous knockout animals do not have a discrete phenotype. To address the proposed link between ABC6 genotype and porphyria phenotype, a large cohort of patients with acute hepatic porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria was analyzed. Our studies showed that ABCB6 genotype did not correlate with disease severity. Therefore, genotyping of ABCB6 in patients with acute hepatic porphyria and erythropoietic protoporphyria is not warranted.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — initial biochemical diagnosis: Best Practice Advice 2 states that initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, and creatinine in a random urine sample, with during acute attacks both ALA and PBG elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal; the levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended, and ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine.

### Congenital erythropoietic porphyria: a single-observer clinical study of 29 cases [^113tu2gi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is an autosomal recessive cutaneous porphyria caused by decreased activity of uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). Its predominant characteristics include bullous cutaneous photosensitivity to visible light from early infancy, progressive photomutilation and chronic haemolytic anaemia. Due to its rarity and genetic heterogeneity, clinical phenotypes are unclear and its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has not been previously assessed.

Objectives

To define comprehensively CEP phenotypes and assess their impact on HRQoL, and to correlate these factors with laboratory parameters.

Methods

A single observer assessed patients with CEP from four European countries.

Results

Twenty-seven unrelated patients with CEP, aged between 7.6 and 65 years, participated in the study. The patients came from the U.K. (17), France (4), Switzerland (4) and Germany (2). Additional data were obtained for two deceased patients. Newly characterized features of CEP include acute-onset cutaneous and noncutaneous symptoms immediately following sunlight exposure, and pink erythematous facial papules. There was a lack of consistent genotype-phenotype correlation in CEP. The main poor prognostic factors in CEP are the early age of disease onset and haematological complications.

Conclusions

CEP is a multisystem disease; cutaneous, ocular, oral and skeletal manifestations also contribute to disease severity and impact on HRQoL, in addition to the haematological complications. The rarity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. The lack of consistent genotype-phenotype correlation in CEP suggests a contribution to phenotype from other factors, such as environment, patients' photoprotective behaviour and genes other than UROS. There is currently an unmet need for multidisciplinary management of patients with CEP.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1113KfQz]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — diagnosis, acute attack treatment, and risk counseling — The key diagnostic test is a spot urine for ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine. Treatment of acute attacks should be with intravenous hemin given by peripherally inserted central catheter line or central port, 3–4 mg/kg body weight/d for 3–5 days, and givosiran should be considered in patients with biochemically and genetically documented AHP and with frequent attacks (4 or more per year). Acute attacks occur especially in women aged approximately 15–50 years, and long-term risks of AHPs include systemic arterial hypertension, chronic liver and renal diseases, and development of HCC even in the absence of cirrhosis, so patients should have ongoing assessments for such potential complications.

### Associations among behavior-related susceptibility factors in porphyria cutanea tarda [^114Meck3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common of the human porphyrias and results from an acquired deficiency of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Some susceptibility factors have been identified; we examined associations among multiple factors in a large cohort of patients.

Methods

Multiple known or suspected susceptibility factors and demographic and clinical features of 143 patients (mean age 52 years, 66% male, 88% Caucasian) with documented PCT (mean onset at 41 ± 8.8 years) were tabulated; associations were examined by contingency tables, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and logistic regression.

Results

The most common susceptibility factors for PCT were ethanol use (87%), smoking (81%), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (69%), and HFE mutations (53%; 6% C282Y/C282Y and 8% C282Y/H63D). Of those who underwent hepatic biopsy or ultrasound, 56% had evidence of hepatic steatosis. Of those with PCT, 66% of females took estrogen, 8% were diabetic, 13% had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and 17% had inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency (determined by low erythrocyte UROD activity). Three or more susceptibility factors were identified in 70% of patients. HCV infection in patients with PCT was significantly associated with other behavior-related factors such as ethanol use (odds ratio [OR], 6.3) and smoking (OR, 11.9).

Conclusions

Susceptibility factors for PCT were similar to previous studies; most patients had 3 or more susceptibility factors. Associations between PCT and HCV, ethanol or smoking could be accounted for by a history of multiple substance abuse; other factors are distributed more randomly among patients.

Racial variability in skin function is an area in which data often conflict. Understanding and quantifying racial differences in skin function are important for skin care and the prevention and treatment of skin diseases. A key feature that characterizes race is skin color: Is deeply pigmented skin different from fair skin in terms of responses to chemical and environmental insults? Is skin care the same? Are there different risks among racial groups of developing a skin disease after exposure to the same insults? The interpretation of pathophysiologic phenomena should consider not only anatomic and functional characteristics of ethnic groups but also socioeconomic, hygienic, and nutritional factors.

Acute hepatic porphyria biochemical testing patterns — In the small population of patients with AHP with recurrent acute attacks, urine ALA and PBG are typically elevated even at baseline between attacks. By contrast, when testing is performed in patients with sporadic AIP when they are asymptomatic, 15%–44% can have normal urine ALA and PBG values; the same, or even higher, percentages are likely true for HCP and VP, and in these patients, confirmatory testing may require repeat testing during an acute attack.

### The severity of hereditary porphyria is modulated by the porphyrin exporter and lan antigen ABCB6 [^114YU6bX]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although elevated porphyrins are a hallmark of multiple types of porphyria, the role of porphyrin transporters (TSPO, ABCG2, ABCB6 and FLVCR1) as modulators of disease severity has not been investigated. Using deep sequencing, biochemical analysis and a new mouse model, we show here that ABCB6 is a genetic modifier of porphyria that mitigates its severity by expelling porphyrins. A previous report showed that ABCB6 was expressed at the red blood cell membrane, but did not uncover a function. This was probably because, among healthy non-porphyric individuals, ABCB6 deficiency per se would not result in excess porphyrin accumulation, although ABCB6 acts as a 'broad spectrum' exporter of multiple porphyrins at the plasma membrane. Accordingly, the impact of ABCB6 deficiency emerges only when porphyrins accumulate during disrupted haem biosynthesis. Although the current porphyria cohort is small, this study indicates that among individuals with porphyrias, functionally defective ABCB6 alleles are strongly associated with disease intensification, providing new mechanistic insights into the genetics and biochemistry of porphyrias.

By stimulating haem synthesis and porphyrin production, a wide array of drugs can exacerbate porphyria symptoms in patients. It is possible that these drugs could elicit porphyria-like symptoms in Lan(−) individuals with normal haem synthetic enzyme genes. Moreover, drugs that also interfere with ABCB6 function might produce similar symptoms. In support of this proposition is our finding that mice lacking one copy of Abcb6 have increased porphyrins. Thus, unanticipated drug or xenobiotic-induced porphyrias might be especially prevalent among Lan(−) individuals.

### From a dominant to an oligogenic model of inheritance with environmental modifiers in acute intermittent porphyria [^112vL8Ga]. Human Molecular Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a disease affecting the heme biosynthesis pathway caused by mutations of the hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene. AIP is thought to display autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. We evaluated the prevalence, penetrance and heritability of AIP, in families with the disease from the French reference center for porphyria (CFP) (602 overt patients; 1968 relatives) and the general population, using Exome Variant Server (EVS; 12 990 alleles) data. The pathogenicity of the 42 missense variants identified was assessed in silico, and in vitro, by measuring residual HMBS activity of the recombinant protein. The minimal estimated prevalence of AIP in the general population was 1/1299. Thus, 50 000 subjects would be expected to carry the AIP genetic trait in France. Penetrance was estimated at 22.9% in families with AIP, but at only 0.5–1% in the general population. Intrafamily correlation studies showed correlations to be strong overall and modulated by kinship and the area in which the person was living, demonstrating strong influences of genetic and environmental modifiers on inheritance. Null alleles were associated with a more severe phenotype and a higher penetrance than for other mutant alleles. In conclusion, the striking difference in the penetrance of HMBS mutations between the general population and the French AIP families suggests that AIP inheritance does not follow the classical autosomal dominant model, instead of being modulated by strong environmental and genetic factors independent from HMBS. An oligogenic inheritance model with environmental modifiers might better explain AIP penetrance and heritability.

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^115WzQ56]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder with heterogenous clinical manifestations caused by mutations in hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene which encodes the third enzyme in heme biosynthesis. It is the most common subtype of acute hepatic porphyrias that encompass disorders such as hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and delta‐aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase–deficiency. Deficiency of HMBS enzyme results in accumulation of neurotoxic heme intermediates, including ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG). Induction of hepatic δ‐aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) associated with hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) deficiency triggers life‐threatening, acute, neurovisceral attacks with severe abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and neuropathy. Two mechanisms has been proposed for nerve cell dysfunction: heme deficiency causing mitochondrial dysfunction or intracellular accumulation of ALA. Autonomic neuropathy with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate result in significant morbidity and mortality. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are also common features. Yet, multisystem manifestations of AIP are frequently overlooked in cases presenting with acute quadriparesis, resulting in significant diagnostic delays.

Neuropathy associated with AIP commonly presents as acute quadriparesis predominantly affecting proximal muscles with electrophysiologic features of motor axonal polyneuropathy. Acute quadriparesis in AIP can inadvertently be diagnosed as axonal variants of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) resulting in delayed management and exposure to therapies known to worsen porphyric neuropathy.

Case series describing clinical features and treatment outcomes in AIP presenting with acute, rapidly progressive polyneuropathy are limited. Genotypes of AIP presenting with acute polyneuropathy in Arab ethnic cohorts have not been previously reported. This may indicate either under‐recognition of cases or the rarity of this presentation in such populations. Early recognition and management of AIP presenting with acute quadriparesis can significantly improve functional outcomes. Herein, we describe clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic findings of six patients with acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute, rapidly progressive quadriparesis. Serial electrodiagnostic studies and functional outcomes are reported when available.

This case series is reported according to CARE guidelines.

Treatment

Recognition and avoidance of precipitating events is a key initial part of treatment. Acute attacks of hepatic porphyrias should be treated by providing sufficient amounts of carbohydrate-derived calories (e.g. by glucose infusion), and intravenous infusion of hematin. Hemolytic anemia in erythropoietic porphyrias may be treated by blood transfusion. Cutaneous photosensitivity of erythropoietic protoporphyria may be treated using oral β-carotene, while photosensitivity associated with PCT can be treated by phlebotomy or oral chloroquine. Liver transplantation can be temporarily beneficial, but transplanted livers are susceptible to protoporphyrin-induced damage. Avoiding precipitating factors such as the use of illicit drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and severe calorie restriction can help to prevent attacks. Additionally the maintenance of a regular, balanced diet, prompt treatment of infections, and reduction of stress can further reduce attacks.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: current diagnosis&management [^112XDm11]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Each of the four acute hepatic porphyrias is due to mutation of an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The accumulation of pathway intermediates that occur most notably when these diseases are active is the basis for screening and establishing a biochemical diagnosis of these rare disorders. Measurement of enzyme activities and especially DNA testing also are important for diagnosis. Suspicion of the diagnosis and specific testing, particularly measurement of urinary porphobilinogen, are often delayed because the symptoms are nonspecific, even when severe. Urinary porphyrins are also measured, but their elevation is much less specific. If porphobilinogen is elevated, second line testing will establish the type of acute porphyria. DNA testing identifies the familial mutation and enables screening of family members. Management includes removal of triggering factors whenever possible. Intravenous hemin is the most effective treatment for acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is sometimes used for mild attacks. Cyclic attacks, if frequent, can be prevented by a GnRH analogue. Frequent noncyclic attacks are sometime preventable by scheduled (e.g. weekly) hemin infusions. Long term complications may include chronic pain, renal impairment and liver cancer. Other treatments, including RNA interference, are under development.

### Acute porphyrias [^113b4CQf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyrias are a group of eight metabolic disorders characterized by defects in heme biosynthesis. Porphyrias are classified into two major categories: 1) the acute or inducible porphyrias and 2) the chronic cutaneous porphyrias. The acute hepatic porphyrias are further classified into acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and porphyria due to severe deficiency of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALADP).

Discussion

AIP is the most common, and ALADP is the least common acute porphyria. The clinical presentations of acute porphyrias are nonspecific. There are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms. The most frequent presenting symptom is abdominal pain, but pain in the chest, back, or lower extremities may also occur. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality during acute attacks, and hypomagnesemia is also common. Both are risk factors for development of seizures, which occur in ∼ 20–30% of acute attacks.

Conclusion

Once suspected, the diagnosis of porphyria can be rapidly established by checking random urinary porphobilinogen. Initial management of acute porphyria includes discontinuation of all potentially harmful drugs and management of symptoms. Acute attacks should be treated emergently with intravenous heme and glucose to avoid considerable morbidity and mortality. Acute attacks last a few days, and the majority of patients are asymptomatic between attacks. Prognosis is good if the condition is recognized early and treated aggressively.

### A review of the clinical presentation, natural history and inheritance of variegate porphyria: its implausibility as the source of the 'royal malady' [^115Qd1Yb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that King George III of Great Britain suffered from the haem biosynthetic disorder, variegate porphyria. This diagnosis is pervasive throughout the scientific and popular literature, and is often referred to as the 'Royal Malady'. The authors believe it inappropriate to view the case for porphyria purely in terms of symptoms, as has generally been the case in his presumptive acute porphyria diagnosis. Accordingly, this review provides a current description of the natural history and clinical presentation of the porphyrias, against which we measure the case for porphyria in George III and his relatives. The authors have critically assessed the prevalence of porphyria in a population, the expected patterns and frequency of inheritance, its penetrance and its expected natural history in affected individuals, and conclude that neither George nor his relatives had porphyria, based on four principal reasons. First, the rarity of the disease mandates a very low prior probability, and therefore implies a vanishingly low positive predictive value for any diagnostic indicator of low specificity, such as a historical reading of the symptoms. Second, penetrance of this autosomal dominant disorder is approximately 40%, and one may expect to have identified characteristic clinical features of porphyria in a large number of descendants without difficulty. Third, the symptoms of both George III and his relatives are highly atypical for porphyria and are more appropriately explained by other much commoner conditions. Finally, the natural history of the illnesses reported in this family is as atypical for variegate porphyria as are their symptoms.

Based on these findings, serum creatinine and eGFR should be monitored at least annually in patients with AHP and more frequently in patients receiving givosiran, and optimal control of systemic arterial hypertension is recommended to prevent additional renal risks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) comprises a group of rare genetic diseases characterized by potentially life‐threatening acute attacks and, in some cases, chronic manifestations that impair daily functioning and quality of life (QOL). The four AHP types include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP, most common), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and delta‐aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase‐deficiency porphyria (ADP). AHP results from hepatic heme biosynthesis defects, leading to induction of ALA synthase 1 (ALAS1), the initial and rate‐controlling enzyme in heme biosynthesis, and accumulation of the heme intermediates ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG), which likely are responsible for disease manifestations.

Common attack symptoms include severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, tachycardia, hypertension, mental status changes, muscle weakness, hyponatremia, and urine color change. Attacks often require hospitalization and, without prompt treatment, may result in paralysis, respiratory failure, and, rarely, death. Some patients experience debilitating chronic symptoms (e.g. pain, neuropathy, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, depression) between attacks. Long‐term AHP‐related (particularly AIP‐related) complications and comorbidities include chronic kidney disease, systemic arterial hypertension, chronic neuropathy, and liver disease. Progressive physical and mental deterioration in patients with recurrent attacks can impair daily living activities and ability to work, and significantly reduce QOL. Patients with recurrent attacks often experience difficulties adjusting to the limitations of AHP, negatively impacting relationships.

Race and ethnicity can contribute to interindividual differences in drug exposure and/or response, which may alter risk-benefit in certain populations. Approximately one-fifth of new drugs approved in the past 6 years demonstrated differences in exposure and/or response across racial/ethnic groups, translating to population-specific prescribing recommendations in a few cases. When data from diverse populations were lacking, additional postmarketing studies were recommended. In this review we highlight several cases where race/ethnicity was central to regulatory decision-making.

3.4 Quality of life

Overall, patients with AHP had impaired QOL at baseline, including those patients in the subgroup with fewer attacks. At baseline, mean (SD) EQ‐VAS scores were 64.6 (20.2), 62.9 (20.8), and 71.8 (15.9) in the total population, in patients with ≥ 3 attacks or prophylaxis, and in patients with < 3 attacks and no prophylaxis, respectively (Figure 3A). Mean (SD) EORTC overall health/QOL scores were 56.5 (23.9), 53.8 (24.6), and 68.0 (17.1) in the total population, in patients with ≥ 3 attacks or prophylaxis, and in patients with < 3 attacks and no prophylaxis, respectively (Figure 3B). Impairment, including significant fatigue, was reported in all the individual domains across all three groups. At baseline, the three dimensions most affected by AHP across all three subgroups were pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression, and ability to perform usual activities (Figure 4).

### The role of inherited and acquired factors in the development of porphyria cutanea tarda in the Argentinean population [^112FrJPG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Inherited and environmental factors are implicated in the expression of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT); the contribution of each factor depends on the population.

Objective

To provide a review of PCT cases diagnosed in Argentina over 24 years and evaluate the role of different precipitating factors in its pathogenesis. Methods Plasma and urinary porphyrin levels and erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) activity were determined. Potential precipitating factors were identified in each patient. Additional tests for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hemochromatosis gene mutations were carried out.

Results

Several factors (mainly alcohol abuse in men and estrogen ingestion in women), alone or combined were identified in our patients. Prevalence of HCV infection was 35.2%. Inherited URO-D deficiency occurs in 25.0% of cases. H63D was the most common hemochromatosis gene mutation. High incidence of PCT associated with HIV infection was found.

Conclusions

PCT is multifactorial. Therefore, knowledge of all risk factors in each patient is important for the management of the disease.

3.3 Patient‐reported outcomes

At baseline, mean (SD) worst pain and average pain in the past 24 h, assessed using the BPI‐SF, were 4.3 (3.1) and 3.6 (2.4), respectively, in the total population (Figure 2). In the total population, 29% (39/136) patients and 8% (11/136) patients reported severe pain (≥ 7 pain score) for worst and average pain, respectively. Among those with available data (n = 112), patients reported their treatments provided, on average, 46% pain relief in the past 24 h. In the subgroup of patients with ≥ 3 attacks or prophylaxis with available data (n = 107), mean (SD) worst pain and average pain scores on the BPI‐SF were 4.5 (3.1) and 3.7 (2.4), respectively, at baseline (Figure 2). In the subgroup of patients with ≥ 3 attacks or prophylaxis, 32% (35/110) patients and 8% (9/110) patients reported severe pain for worst and average pain, respectively. Treatments provided on average 47% pain relief in the past 24 hours in those taking pain medications (n = 94) in the subgroup of patients with ≥ 3 attacks or prophylaxis. In those with < 3 attacks and no prophylaxis (n = 26), mean (SD) worst pain and average pain scores captured on the BPI‐SF were 3.5 (3.1) and 3.3 (2.5), respectively, at baseline (Figure 2). Severe pain was reported by 15% (4/26) patients and 8% (2/26) patients for worst and average pain, respectively. In this subgroup of patients with < 3 attacks and no prophylaxis, pain medications provided on average 44% pain relief in the past 24 h in the 18 patients using these medications.

### Athena speciality certificate examination case for photodermatology [^116pchgY]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The distribution of the rash and the worsening in summer hints that light/photosensitivity plays a role.

Actinic prurigo (AP) is a rare immunological photodermatosis, which typically presents with pruritic papules, sometimes vesicles, and plaques with excoriations and scars over photodistributed sites. Infrequently, it also affects unexposed sites such as the buttocks. Ocular involvement and cheilitis may occur but is less frequently reported in UK cases than in those from South America. AP is more common in females and is much more frequently reported in people of Latin American or Amerindian descent with the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) DR4 subtype (HLA DRB1*0407/). A positive family history may be present in 75% of this patient cohort, whereas it typically occurs in approximately 50% of cases in the UK. Our patient was positive for HLA DRB1*0407 but had no known family history or Latin American/Amerindian ancestry. AP may spontaneously resolve by the late teens but can also persist into adulthood.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) typically presents with immediate pain and oedema on light‐exposed sites and will usually present in early childhood. The genetic background of EPP is typically that of inheritance of a low‐expression allele polymorphism in addition to a recessive mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme ferrochelatase. This can cause accumulation of a haemoglobin precursor, protoporphyrin IX, which is a photosensitizer to visible light. This significantly accumulates in red blood cells, plasma, liver and skin. Thus, photoactivation of protoporphyrin IX causes phototoxic insult, resulting in tissue damage, which manifests as skin pain and sometimes oedema, erythema and waxy scarring on photoexposed sites caused by photosensitivity to visible light. If visible light exposure is not prolonged, the patient will usually have symptoms of pain only on exposed sites, with visible skin changes evident only with more prolonged or repeated exposures. Protoporphyrin IX localizes within the erythrocytes as opposed to the basement membrane localization of uroporphyrinogen III in porphyria cutanea tarda.

### Understanding coproporphyrins and their disposition: coproporphyrinuria is common, of diverse cause, and rarely indicates porphyria [^116qYBcY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Coproporphyrins (CPs) are often mildly increased in plasma and urine, which leads to erroneous overdiagnosis of porphyrias. Herein we provide an overview of normal CP metabolism and factors that influence its disposition. We reviewed extant literature and here summarize and put into context current knowledge of CP metabolism and its disposition. CPs are formed as byproducts of normal heme synthesis. Normally they are removed chiefly by hepatocytes into bile and then stool. Organic anion-transporting peptides (OATPs) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins facilitate the uptake of CPs into epithelial cells and removal. Xenobiotics inhibit the activities of multidrug resistance-associated proteins and/or OATPs and affect the metabolism and disposition of CPs. CP concentrations are used as endogenous probes for assessing altered functions of OATPs. Diverse liver diseases and disorders lead to decreased secretion of CPs into bile and thus to increased concentrations of CPs in plasma and urine. Usually, mild to moderate increases in urinary CPs are due to alcohol, heavy metals, drug effects on transporters, or nonporphyric liver diseases not to porphyrias or to other inherited syndromes.

### ABCB6 polymorphisms are not overly represented in patients with porphyria [^114RM3WB]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The following disease entities comprise the acute hepatic porphyrias (AHPs); acute intermittent porphyria (AIP); hereditary coproporphyria (HCP); variegate porphyria (VP). These are rare diseases of heme biosynthesis that are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with low penetrance. For example, AIP, the most common of the AHPs, arises as a consequence of mutations affecting the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), which is required to convert porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane (the third of eight steps in the biosynthetic pathway of heme). In an international study of genomic/exomic databases, Chen and colleaguesidentified 12 pathogenic sequence variants among ∼92 000 alleles, a frequency of 0.00056. The estimated prevalence of symptomatic patients with heterozygous mutant HMBS is ∼0.000005. Based on these data, the estimated penetrance of pathogenic HMBS mutants is ∼1%. However, among first-degree relatives of affected patients, the penetrance is ∼20%. Together, these data suggest that genetic factors, in addition to mutant HMBS, determine the clinical phenotype of AIP. The basis of the low penetrance observed in AHPs is an area of active investigation, as discovery of genes that modify the disease phenotype would provide both relevant clinical information and a more a detailed understanding of heme metabolism.

### Assessment of exposure to environmental toxins and racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations among US veterans [^115bT9KN]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Residential neighborhood social factors associated with health play a role in the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among racial and ethnic minority populations. Exposure to environmental toxins has been understudied as a relevant neighborhood factor associated with health. Structural racism has relegated racial and ethnic minority populations to residential communities with higher, and multiple, risks of exposure to environmental toxins (eg, communities near industrial facilities). Although this exposure may be associated with increases in COVID-19–related comorbidities (eg, cancers), which might explain some of the racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes, it is unknown whether exposure to environmental toxins is independently associated with increases in COVID-19 susceptibility. This cohort study examined the hypothesis that exposure to environmental toxins mediates the association of racial and ethnic disparities with hospitalizations among veterans with COVID-19 after accounting for individual-level risk factors and comorbidities.

Representation/incidence/prevalence

Among the studies classified as including race/ethnicity as an integral part of analysis, 60% were based on North American data, 13% from Asia, 9% from Africa and 2% from Oceania/Australasia, a detailed breakdown of the studies is shown in Fig. 2A. Next, we examined trends over time and found a relatively similar number of studies were published in 5-year intervals between 2000–2024, suggesting no change in the rate of PD publications that incorporate race/ethnicity as an integral variable (Fig. 2B).

A Geographic distribution of studies that incorporated race/ethnicity as an integral part of analysis. B Percentage of studies that include race/ethnicity as an integral component that were published in each 5 year time interval between 2000 and 2024.

Among the 55 studies, many assessed representation across diverse groups (n = 19), specifically ten studies that showed a higher incidence/prevalence of PD in White versus African American or black populations –; and two studies indicated race differences in age of onset and age of diagnosis with black individuals showing a younger age of onsetand a later age of diagnosis. In addition, there were three studies which found no association of ethnicity or differences in frequency/incidence/prevalence across race or ethnicity.

Risk for PD

Findings from studies (n = 17) that examined PD risk factors by race/ethnicity included (1) lifestyle factors or prior disease morbidity such as cancer, gout, restless leg syndrome, alcohol consumption, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, head injury, high/low weight, constipation, hypotension, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, fatigue, depression, memory symptoms, neck pain, shoulder pain, rigidity, balance difficulties, tremor and epilepsy; (2) environmental exposures such as PM2, selenium, air pollutants, noise, road proximity, metal emissions, smoking; (3) past pharmacotherapy including beta 2 agonists; metformin and sulfonylureas, and calcineurin inhibitors. Importantly, when examining the results from these studies overall, the lack of overlap in risk factors examined, populations compared, and outcome variables, in addition to the shear low number of studies overall (17/1142), make generalized conclusions near impossible. Moreover, some studies show differences in risk variables by race/ethnicity, sometimes these are simply a difference in magnitude of association as opposed to directional differences in risk.

### Clinical, biochemical, and genetic characterization of north American patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^111Cbpqy]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Autosomal recessive erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) are rare photodermatoses presenting with variable degrees of painful phototoxicity that markedly affects quality of life. The clinical variability, determinants of severity, and genotype/phenotype correlations of these diseases are not well characterized.

Objective

To describe the baseline clinical characteristics, genotypes, and determinants of disease severity in a large patient cohort with EPP or XLP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective observational study was conducted among patients with confirmed diagnoses of EPP or XLP from November 1, 2010, to December 6, 2015, at 6 academic medical centers of the Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. Detailed medical histories, including history of phototoxicity and treatment, were collected on standardized case report forms. Patients underwent baseline laboratory testing, total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ePPIX) testing, and molecular genetic testing. Data were entered into a centralized database.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Results of biochemical and genetic tests were explored for association with clinical phenotype in patients with EPP or XLP.

Results

Of the 226 patients in the study (113 female and 113 male patients; mean [SD] age, 36.7 [17.0] years), 186 (82.3%) had EPP with a FECH (OMIM 612386) mutation and the common low-expression FECH allele IVS3–48T > C, and only 1 patient had 2 FECH mutations. Twenty-two patients had XLP (9.7%; 10 male and 12 female patients), and 9 patients (4.0%) had elevated ePPIX levels and symptoms consistent with protoporphyria but no detectable mutation in the FECH or ALAS2 (OMIM 301300) gene. Samples of DNA could not be obtained from 8 patients. Patients' mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 4.4 (4.4) years. Anemia (107 [47.3%]), history of liver dysfunction (62 [27.4%]), and gallstones (53 [23.5%]) were commonly reported. Higher ePPIX levels were associated with earlier age of symptom onset (median ePPIX levels for those who developed symptoms before vs after 1 year of age, 1744 vs 1567 µg/dL; p = 0.02), less sun tolerance (median ePPIX levels for those reporting symptoms before vs after 10 minutes of sun exposure, 2233 vs 1524 µg/dL; P ≤ .001), and increased risk of liver dysfunction (median ePPIX levels for those with liver dysfunction vs normal liver function, 2016 vs 1510 µg/dL; p = 0.003). Patients with EPP and FECH missense mutations had significantly lower ePPIX levels than those with other mutations (1462 vs 1702 µg/dL; p = 0.01). Male patients with XLP had significantly higher ePPIX levels, on average, than did patients with EPP (3574 vs 1669 µg/dL; P < .001). Marked clinical variability was seen in female patients with XLP owing to random X-chromosomal inactivation.

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that higher ePPIX levels are a major determinant of disease severity and risk of liver dysfunction in patients with EPP or XLP. These findings provide a framework for clinical monitoring and management of these disorders.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^113HAKZw]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute hepatic porphyria comprises a group of rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes involved in heme biosynthesis. Patients can experience acute neurovisceral attacks, debilitating chronic symptoms, and long‐term complications. There is a lack of multinational, prospective data characterizing the disease and current treatment practices in severely affected patients.

Approach and Results

EXPLORE is a prospective, multinational, natural history study characterizing disease activity and clinical management in patients with acute hepatic porphyria who experience recurrent attacks. Eligible patients had a confirmed acute hepatic porphyria diagnosis and had experienced ≥ 3 attacks in the prior 12 months or were receiving prophylactic treatment. A total of 112 patients were enrolled and followed for at least 6 months. In the 12 months before the study, patients reported a median (range) of 6 (0‐52) acute attacks, with 52 (46%) patients receiving hemin prophylaxis. Chronic symptoms were reported by 73 (65%) patients, with 52 (46%) patients experiencing these daily. During the study, 98 (88%) patients experienced a total of 483 attacks, 77% of which required treatment at a health care facility and/or hemin administration (median [range] annualized attack rate 2.0 [0.0‐37.0]). Elevated levels of hepatic δ‐aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 messenger ribonucleic acid levels, δ‐aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen compared with the upper limit of normal in healthy individuals were observed at baseline and increased further during attacks. Patients had impaired quality of life and increased health care utilization.

Conclusions

Patients experienced attacks often requiring treatment in a health care facility and/or with hemin, as well as chronic symptoms that adversely influenced day‐to‐day functioning. In this patient group, the high disease burden and diminished quality of life highlight the need for novel therapies.

### Assessment of exposure to environmental toxins and racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations among US veterans [^111u4APg]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, exposure to environmental toxins partially mediated the association of racial and ethnic disparities with COVID-19 hospitalizations, independently of COVID-19–related comorbidities. Exposure to environmental toxins may weaken the respiratory and immune systems of exposed individuals, who disproportionately belong to racial and ethnic minority populations, increasing their susceptibility to serious COVID-19 independently of comorbidities and tobacco use. Limitations of this study include its limited generalizability to children, lack of accounting for other neighborhood factors associated with health (eg, poverty), potential for measurement error (eg, participants' residential histories and mobility), and possibility of being underpowered to detect mediation in smaller racial and ethnic minority groups.

Future research may examine exposure to specific environmental toxins. Addressing racial and ethnic health disparities requires equity-focused planning and environmental policies that address pollution and promote environmental justice for racial and ethnic minority communities. Advocating for environmental justice may also aid future disaster-preparedness efforts.

### EXPLORE B: a prospective, long-term natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with chronic symptoms [^113dDAkN]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study population

A total of 136 patients were enrolled from 18 countries: 43 patients (32%) provided consent from Part A, and 93 were new patients (68%). One hundred fifteen patients (85%) withdrew before completing the 36‐month study period, primarily because of termination of the study by the sponsor (40%), patients leaving to enroll in another study (ENVISION) (15%), or patients leaving to receive givosiran outside of a clinical study (12%) (Figure 1). Of the 136 enrolled patients, 83 (61%), 37 (27%), and 21 (15%) completed 12, 24, and 36 months of the study period, respectively. Patients spent a median (range) duration of 14.6 (2.0–41.5) months in the study. Mean (SD) age of patients at enrollment was 41.0 (12.6) years. Most patients were female (90%), and most were white (85%) (Table 1). Most patients had AIP (90%), followed by VP (8%) and HCP (1%).

### Racial / ethnic differences in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents in the United States [^114p21QV]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

A key strength of our study is the implementation of NCOs, which are outcomes not expected to show racial/ethnic differences due to COVID-19. This approach enhances the reliability and interpretability of our findings. By analyzing these alongside our primary outcomes, we enable the detection of systematic bias from unmeasured confounding variables. This approach allows us to calibrate results from the DiD model. Importantly, NCOs help mitigate the impact of unmeasured confounding that may change before and after the infection. This is particularly crucial when studying racial/ethnic differences, where many dynamic social and environmental factors may not be captured in our dataset. Furthermore, we carefully addressed potential bias related to differences in follow-up times. To ensure comparability, we standardized the follow-up period for all participants, observing PASC symptoms and conditions over a consistent timeframe of five months (28 to 179 days post-cohort entry). This approach mitigates any bias that might arise from variations in follow-up duration across individuals.

This study has several limitations. First, socioeconomic differences may exacerbate racial/ethnic differences in PASC symptoms and conditions, thereby acting as a mediator effect in the causal pathway between race/ethnicity and clinical outcomes. Such influences have been suggested as risk factors for acute COVID-19 by Chisolm and colleagues in a RECOVER EHR study. Future research on PASC outcomes is of interest to study such mediation effects.

Secondly, health-seeking behavior or healthcare access is an important consideration, known as ascertainment bias. Limited access to care and associated medical records among certain minority racial/ethnic groups may contribute to potential bias in the observed racial/ethnic differences. Related issues were recently described by Nasir et al. for the ascertainment of PASC symptoms and conditions in adult populations through EHR. Nevertheless, we tried to address the ascertainment bias by including healthcare utilization factors in the propensity score model, such as the number of inpatient, outpatient, and ED visits during the baseline period.

### How I treat erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^114z3CqQ]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

EPP and XLP are nonblistering cutaneous porphyrias characterized by excess protoporphyrin in the bone marrow and high levels of circulating protoporphyrin, resulting in photosensitivity and an increased risk of biliary stones and liver damage. Recommended management includes monitoring for liver damage and other disease-related complications. Although the understanding of the molecular basis and clinical presentation of protoporphyrias has advanced, the development of novel and promising new therapies has occurred only recently. Therefore, it is becoming even more important for physicians to be aware of the diagnosis and management of these rare, but often undiagnosed, conditions.

Acute intermittent porphyria as a mimic of cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute intermittent porphyria occurs infrequently and generally does not present before puberty. It can present with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain, mimicking CVS, but usually has 1 or more symptoms of anxiety, depression, hallucination, seizures, cranial nerve weakness, and paresis of the extremeties. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding an increased urinary d-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in a spot urine during the episode.

Variegate porphyria (VP) is a rare subtype of porphyrias characterized by dysfunction of enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway leading to an accumulation of porphyrins and their precursors. The resulting buildup can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms and photosensitive blistering eruptions on sun-exposed skin. We report a case of VP in a 9-year-old girl with many confounding medical factors that warranted alternative explanations for her cutaneous lesions. VP has been reported infrequently in the pediatric population and is associated with more severe neuropsychiatric outcomes compared to adult-onset disease.

### Systematically testing human HMBS missense variants to reveal mechanism and pathogenic variation [^114LaLp7]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP; MIM:) is caused by deficiency in the heme biosynthetic enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS; MIM: EC 2.5.1.61; also known as porphobilinogen deaminase [PBGD]). AIP, the most frequent acute hepatic porphyria, is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in ∼1,700. The clinical penetrance of AIP is low (1%–38%), and ∼65% of AIP heterozygotes remain asymptomatic (i.e. have "latent AIP") throughout their lives. AIP is characterized by potentially life-threatening acute attacks, precipitated by genetic and environmental factors that induce aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1; MIM:), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in heme synthesis. HMBS encodes both erythroid-specific and ubiquitous (housekeeping) isozymes, differing in that the erythroid isoform has a later translational start site that eliminates 17 amino acids at the N-terminus. In classical AIP, both erythroid-specific and ubiquitous HMBS isoforms are deficient. However, ∼5% of AIP cases are non-erythroid, caused by a variant that affects only the ubiquitous isoform of HMBS. In cases of increased heme demand in the liver, the combination of ALAS1 induction and HMBS deficiency results in the accumulation of the porphyrin precursor porphobilinogen (PBG), as well as δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is likely neurotoxic.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^116JUmnR]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute hepatic porphyria comprises a group of rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes involved in heme biosynthesis. Patients can experience acute neurovisceral attacks, debilitating chronic symptoms, and long-term complications. There is a lack of multinational, prospective data characterizing the disease and current treatment practices in severely affected patients.

Approach and Results

EXPLORE is a prospective, multinational, natural history study characterizing disease activity and clinical management in patients with acute hepatic porphyria who experience recurrent attacks. Eligible patients had a confirmed acute hepatic porphyria diagnosis and had experienced ≥ 3 attacks in the prior 12 months or were receiving prophylactic treatment. A total of 112 patients were enrolled and followed for at least 6 months. In the 12 months before the study, patients reported a median (range) of 6 (0–52) acute attacks, with 52 (46%) patients receiving hemin prophylaxis. Chronic symptoms were reported by 73 (65%) patients, with 52 (46%) patients experiencing these daily. During the study, 98 (88%) patients experienced a total of 483 attacks, 77% of which required treatment at a health care facility and/or hemin administration (median [range] annualized attack rate 2.0 [0.0–37.0]). Elevated levels of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 messenger ribonucleic acid levels, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen compared with the upper limit of normal in healthy individuals were observed at baseline and increased further during attacks. Patients had impaired quality of life and increased health care utilization.

Conclusions

Patients experienced attacks often requiring treatment in a health care facility and/or with hemin, as well as chronic symptoms that adversely influenced day-to-day functioning. In this patient group, the high disease burden and diminished quality of life highlight the need for novel therapies.

### Hemin (panhematin) [^1177ofYs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

About 50% of the women with acute intermittent porphyria experience an acute attack of porphyria in pregnancy and/or the puerperium. It is most severe in early pregnancy and the puerperium, and can result in fatal outcome. Although anecdotal evidence suggests safe use of hematin during pregnancy, the available human data is not sufficient to establish the presence or absence of drug-associated risk. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with hematin. It is also not known whether hematin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. PANHEMATIN should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

Avoid administering hematin in severe pre-eclampsia because of a theoretical risk of potentiation of the coagulation disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PANHEMATIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PANHEMATIN or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under 16 years of age have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical data for subjects aged 65 and over was not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### A skin disease, a blood disease or something in between? An exploratory focus group study of patients' experiences with porphyria cutanea tarda [^11632uEi]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

PCT is generally defined as a skin disease but, aetiologically, it is also a hepatic and metabolic disorder. Because the symptoms are of a cutaneous nature, one would expect that the patients experienced PCT as a skin condition. However, participants in this study described a shift in focus from skin to blood and began to perceive PCT as a chronic and systemic disease. The tendency to attribute health problems to PCT was striking. We are all 'naïve psychologists' seeking to explain why events occur and to attribute causal explanations. According to the common sense model (CSM) of illness, there are five components of illness representations that help people make sense of their symptoms: the identity or the label given to the condition; the perceived cause of the condition; the predictive understanding of how long the condition will last; the individual's beliefs about the consequences of the condition; and whether the condition can be cured or controlled. In this case, the identity of the condition is 'porphyria'. Porphyrias are a group of diseases, and separating PCT from other porphyrias can be difficult for both patients and healthcare providers. Patients with PCT may perceive the disease as being chronic and systemic because porphyrins, enzymes, blood and genes are involved, and treatment consists of bloodletting. This perception can, in turn, explain why participants in this study attributed a number of their health problems to PCT. The CSM uses the perception of the condition to guide which further actions are taken. Lilly stated that medical experts do not fully understand the possible long-term complications that this patient group might expect, and therefore phlebotomies cannot be an 'easy fix' if symptoms arise. As Lilly commented, 'if it's just a rash that can be treated with draining blood, well, then we can just do whatever we want to, can't we?' The genetic component of PCT also seemed intriguing to the participants. A worry that a PCT mutation might prevent anyone from having children, as was the case in the family of one participant, emphasizes that the perceived cause of the condition and the understanding of its consequences should not be underestimated. When addressing the issue of symptoms, consequences and controllability of PCT in clinical consultation, it is therefore important to recognize that the patient's illness representation can influence perception of risk and how they express and act upon this information.

### Light-related cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria and associations with light sensitivity measurements [^112ZJ2LC]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare and underdiagnosed genetic disease characterized by painful sensitivity to light. A better understanding and characterization of its light-induced cutaneous symptoms may aid in the identification of EPP in patients.

Objectives

To describe the cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and to determine if these symptoms are associated with the degree of light sensitivity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cross-sectional study of adolescent and adult (≥ 15 years) patients with EPP across the US conducted by a single academic hospital via a remotely administered survey, measurements of light sensitivity by light dosimetry and by text message symptom assessments. Data analyses were conducted from November 2020 to April 2022.

Exposures

Sunlight exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported symptoms and association with measured light sensitivity.

Results

The study sample consisted of 35 patients with EPP (mean [SD] age, 39.1 (15.5) years; 21 [60%] female; 14 [40%] male; 35 [100%] White individuals). The patients' median [range] skin tone was 3.0 (1.0–8.0), based on self-reporting from 1 (lightest) to 12 (darkest). A total of 24 participants completed the light dosimeter measurements. Phototoxic reactions were characterized by pain (97%; 34 patients), burning (97%; 34), tingling (97%; 34), pruritus (83%; 29), allodynia (89%; 31), improvement of symptoms with cold (89%; 31), achiness (24%; 12), fatigue (46%; 16), mild swelling (83%; 29), severe swelling (63%; 22), erythema (51%; 18), petechiae (40%; 14), skin cracking (43%; 15), scabbing (46%; 16), scarring (66%; 23), and other chronic skin changes (40%; 14). Patients with EPP reported that their hands, feet, and face were most sensitive to light and that their shoulders and legs were least sensitive; 25.7% (9 patient) reported no chronic skin changes, and 5.7% (2 patients) reported never having had any visible symptoms. None of these findings varied with the degree of light sensitivity except that lower overall light sensitivity was associated with lower ranked sensitivity of the neck and arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that patients with EPP have distinctive cutaneous symptoms that may aid in identification of this underdiagnosed disease. Characteristic EPP symptoms include light-induced cutaneous burning pain and occasional swelling, particularly over the hands, with a prodrome of pruritus and paresthesias. Minimal skin changes or the absence of visible skin changes during reactions to light, including lack of erythema, do not exclude an EPP diagnosis nor suggest low EPP disease burden.

### Updates on the diagnosis and management of the most common hereditary porphyrias: AIP and EPP [^113eUWxU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The porphyrias are a family of metabolic disorders caused by defects in the activity of one of the enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding hydroxymethylbilane synthase, can lead to hepatocyte overaccumulation and systemic distribution of the proximal porphyrin precursors, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). ALA and PBG are toxic to neurons and extrahepatic tissue and cause the neurovisceral clinical manifestations of AIP. Management of AIP includes awareness and avoidance of triggering factors, infusions of hemin for severe acute attacks, and, if indicated for chronic suppressive therapy, maintenance treatment with hemin or givosiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that antagonizes ALA synthase 1 transcripts. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is most commonly caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase (FECH), the heme pathway terminal enzyme. FECH deficiency leads to erythrocyte overaccumulation and high plasma levels of lipophilic protoporphyrins that photoactivate in the skin, causing burning pain and erythema. Protoporphyrins excreted in the bile can cause gallstones, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately liver failure. Management of EPP includes skin protection and afamelanotide, an α-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog that increases melanin pigment and reduces photoactivation. Liver transplantation may be necessary for severe EPP-induced liver complications. Because AIP and EPP arise from defects in the heme biosynthetic pathway, hematologists are often consulted to evaluate and manage suspected or proven porphyrias. A working knowledge of these disorders increases our confidence and effectiveness as consultants and medical providers.

### Systematically testing human HMBS missense variants to reveal mechanism and pathogenic variation [^114sNdZp]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we observed no significant correlation between functional impact scores and either age of disease onset or disease severity, we do not wish to suggest that this question is closed, absent more data and an accepted objective framework for classifying AIP severity. It would be interesting to investigate whether the functional impact scores are more predictive of age of onset or severity after stratifying by the presence or absence of known triggers.

The HMBS variant effects maps we provide could have immediate value in several clinical scenarios. First and most importantly, where an individual has been diagnosed with AIP on the basis of clinical and biochemical data but has an HMBS missense variant that would otherwise be classified as a VUS, a more definitive classification of the variant could enable cascade screening to identify family members with latent AIP. Second, where an individual has highly elevated ALA and PBG but does not have access to a laboratory capable of ruling out the two other acute porphyrias, identification of a definitively classified HMBS variant can establish the correct diagnosis. Third, where an individual has a clinical history consistent with AIP but timely measurements of porphyrin precursors in urine or plasma were not obtained or were inconclusive. Fourth, where an HMBS missense variant is revealed, e.g. through direct-to-consumer genome sequencing, and the client wishes to know if they should be vigilant for symptoms of AIP or avoid its known triggers. In each of these scenarios, a resulting diagnosis of AIP or latent AIP could have the cascading benefit of helping to identify additional cases of AIP or latent AIP in at-risk relatives, thereby increasing the number of individuals for whom vigilance, prevention, or therapy is supported.

In addition to providing a resource for the understanding of HMBS variation, this study also provides proof of principle for broader application of variant effect mapping to other genes associated with acute hepatic porphyria.

In conclusion, we strengthen the evidence that systematic proactive experimental evaluation of missense variant effects on human enzymes can reveal sequence-structure-function relationships and yield clinically relevant insights with potential to guide personalized clinical decisions.

### Photosensitivity disorders in children: part I [^115iH4EE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity disorders in children encompass a diverse group of diseases. Compared to adult patients, underlying systemic disorders, including genetic or metabolic defects, are common causes in pediatric photosensitivity disorders. Photosensitivity in a child should be suspected if the child develops a sunburn reaction in sun-exposed sites after limited sun exposure. Diagnosis of a photodermatosis is made based on careful history taking and a physical examination. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis are essential to minimize long-term complications associated with inadequate photoprotection. In part I of this continuing medical education article, immunologically mediated photodermatoses, photodermatoses caused by exogenous photosensitizers, and the cutaneous porphyrias will be covered.

### EXPLORE B: a prospective, long-term natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with chronic symptoms [^116ZA66Z]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results also suggest that a significant economic burden is associated with AHP. Patients in EXPLORE B, including those with fewer attacks, exhibited high healthcare utilization and a median of 2–3 weeks of workdays lost due to attacks over the year prior to enrollment. Less than 45% of those with fewer attacks and no prophylaxis and less than 35% of those with more attacks or using prophylaxis were in full‐time employment. This observation is consistent with previously reported data from qualitative interviews of patients with AHP, in which more than 50% of respondents reported that they had to stop working due to their disease.

There are several potential limitations to interpretation of results from our study. In EXPLORE B, 85% of patients withdrew before completing the 36‐month study period. In addition, data on attacks and chronic symptoms were patient‐reported and did not require confirmation by a clinician, nor were they corroborated by documentation of ALA and PBG levels. Nonetheless, this method of attack ascertainment is typically used in clinical practice once a patient has been diagnosed with AHP. In real‐world settings, patients are not always seen by a porphyria specialist for every attack, and ALA and PBG measurements are usually not obtained or available in real time at patient presentation. Another potential confounding factor is that patients may have overestimated attacks, given that they could have experienced symptoms similar to those of AHP attacks that were not actually due to AHP.

In conclusion, these data show that, for patients with AHP and recurrent attacks, including those with relatively few attacks, the burden of disease is high, as reflected by patients' reports of chronic symptoms between attacks and QOL assessments.

### Identification of the first variegate porphyria mutation in an indigenous black South African and further evidence for heterogeneity in variegate porphyria [^113PjkeY]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Variegate porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder of haem metabolism resulting from reduced levels of the penultimate enzyme in the pathway, protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Here we investigate the molecular basis of variegate porphyria in four non-R59W South African families. We report the identification of the first mutation in the protoporphyrinogen oxidase gene in a black South African individual (V290M). In addition, we document three further mutations, a missense mutation (L15F), a deletion followed by a substitution [c769delG;770T > A], and a nonsense mutation (Q375X), in individuals of European or mixed ancestry. Our data provide further evidence of genetic heterogeneity in South Africa.

### The cutaneous porphyrias [^115NDVW4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

The porphyrias are a group of mainly inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis where accumulation of porphyrins and/or porphyrin precursors gives rise to 2 types of clinical presentation: cutaneous photosensitivity and/or acute neurovisceral attacks. The cutaneous porphyrias present with either bullous skin fragility or nonbullous acute photosensitivity. This review discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory diagnosis, complications, and current approach to porphyria management. Although focusing mainly on their dermatological aspects, the article also covers the management of acute porphyria, which by virtue of its association with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, may become the responsibility of the clinical dermatologist.

### Hydroxychloroquine [^116YR2rd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Retinal Toxicity

Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula.

Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages ≥ 5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease.

Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.

If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy.

5.3 Serious Skin Reactions

Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate including Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate if these severe reactions occur.

5.4 Worsening of Psoriasis

Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk.

### Acute porphyrias in the United States: features of 108 subjects from porphyrias consortium [^114WDjwZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recent descriptions of the clinical and laboratory features of subjects with acute porphyrias in the US are lacking. Our aim was to describe clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of 108 subjects.

Methods

Between September 2010 and December 2012, 108 subjects with acute porphyrias (90 acute intermittent porphyrias, 9 hereditary coproporphyrias, 9 variegate porphyrias) were enrolled into an observational study. Genetic testing was performed at a central genetic testing laboratory and clinical information entered into a central database. Selected features were compared with data for adults in the US.

Results

Most subjects (88/108, 81%) were female, with self-reported onset of symptoms in the second through fourth decades of life. The most common symptom was abdominal pain. Appendectomies and cholecystectomies were common before a diagnosis of porphyria. The diagnosis was delayed by a mean of 15 years. Anxiety and depression were common, and 18% complained of chronic symptoms, especially neuropathic and other pains. The incidences of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, seizure disorders, and psychiatric conditions were markedly increased. Mutations of the known causative genes were found in 102/105 of those tested, with novel mutations being found in 37, including in 7/8 subjects with hereditary coproporphyria. Therapy with intravenous hematin was the most effective therapy both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.

Conclusions

Acute porphyrias often remain undiagnosed for more than a decade after first symptoms develop. Intravenous hematin is the treatment of choice, both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.

### The management of porphyria cutanea tarda [^114BcJR2]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the commonest of all porphyrias, is usually characterized by blisters and fragility of skin in light-exposed areas. It can be clinically indistinguishable from other disorders including variegate porphyria and the diagnosis can only be made by rigorous biochemical analysis. PCT does not cause acute attacks of porphyria. It is usually an acquired condition caused by inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme in the liver. Hereditary haemochromatosis, hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol, oestrogens and a family history of PCT are the major risk factors for the condition and should be searched for specifically in all patients. Liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is common in patients with PCT, and should be investigated for at presentation by means of a liver biopsy where possible. Patients with severe hepatic pathology or longstanding untreated PCT need to be monitored for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in the long term. Low dose twice weekly chloroquine is the mainstay of treatment, but venesection should be used in patients with severe iron overload or hepatitis C-related liver disease. Subsequently, long-term follow-up is needed in all patients to monitor for relapse.

### Nutrition and bullous skin diseases [^113S1giM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Autoimmune and nonautoimmune bullous diseases can both be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases has increased tremendously, there is still much to learn about the various factors affecting their onset, course, and therapy. In recent years, increasing information has been published about the effect of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients on bullous skin diseases. Some factors are believed to be inducers (thiol and phenol-containing foods in pemphigus), whereas others are believed to be protective (antioxidants in cutaneous porphyrias). This contribution reviews the evidence in the literature of the role of various dietary factors in bullous diseases, including the nonautoimmune and the deficiency dermatoses. Additional studies and new investigations are needed to provide a better understanding of the specific associations of dietary factors with bullous diseases and better management for patients affected by these conditions.

### Update review of the acute porphyrias [^115Y1eDc]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute porphyrias are rare inherited disorders due to deficiencies of haem synthesis enzymes. To date, all UK cases have been one of the three autosomal dominant forms, although penetrance is low and most gene carriers remain asymptomatic. Clinical presentation is typically with acute neurovisceral attacks characterised by severe abdominal pain, vomiting, tachycardia and hypertension. Severe attacks may be complicated by hyponatraemia, peripheral neuropathy sometimes causing paralysis, seizures and psychiatric features. Attacks are triggered by prescribed drugs, alcohol, hormonal changes, fasting or stress. The diagnosis is made by finding increased porphobilinogen excretion in a light-protected random urine sample. Management includes administration of intravenous human haemin and supportive treatment with non-porphyrinogenic drugs. A few patients develop recurrent attacks, a chronic illness requiring specialist management. Late complications include chronic pain, hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic renal failure and hypertension. In the UK, the National Acute Porphyria Service provides clinical advice and supplies haemin when indicated.

ENVISION enrolled 94 patients with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) (89 patients with AIP, 2 patients with variegate porphyria [VP], 1 patient with hereditary coproporphyria [HCP], and 2 patients with no identified mutation). Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once monthly subcutaneous injections of GIVLAARI 2.5 mg/kg or placebo during the 6-month double-blind period. In this study, inclusion criteria specified a minimum of 2 porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home in the 6 months prior to study entry. After the 6 month treatment period patients were enrolled in an open label extension period for up to 30 months. Ninety-three patients were enrolled in the open label extension period. Hemin use during the study was permitted for the treatment of acute porphyria attacks.

The median age of patients studied was 37.5 years (range 19 to 65 years), 89% of patients were female, and 78% were white. GIVLAARI and placebo arms were balanced with respect to historical porphyria attack rate, hemin prophylaxis prior to study entry, use of opioid medications, and patient-reported measures of pain symptoms between attacks.

Efficacy in the 6-month double-blind period was measured by the rate of porphyria attacks that required hospitalizations, urgent healthcare visit, or intravenous hemin administration at home.

Efficacy results for GIVLAARI are provided in Table 3. On average, AHP patients on GIVLAARI experienced 70% (95% CI: 60%, 80%) fewer porphyria attacks compared to placebo.

GIVLAARI also resulted in a reduction in hemin use, urinary ALA, and urinary PBG.

### RNA interference therapy in acute hepatic porphyrias [^1149Yuz8]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with AHP present with episodic attacks of severe abdominal pain and acute autonomic and other neurologic dysfunction (eg, seizures and posterior reversible encephalopathy). Most of the symptomatic patients are female, with disease onset after puberty. Various factors precipitate the acute attacks by increasing the expression of hepatic 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1), either by directly promoting its transcription (eg, dieting or exogenous/endogenous progesterone,) and/or by consuming heme and increasing heme demand in the liver(eg, cytochrome p450-inducing drugs or exogenous/endogenous progesterone). When ALAS1 activity is markedly increased, the respective enzyme deficiencies create a metabolic bottleneck, leading to insufficient hepatic heme production and in turn loss of the negative feedback inhibition of heme on ALAS1. Consequently, ALAS1 activity is further upregulated, and the porphyrin precursors, ALA and porphobilinogen (PBG), accumulate in the liver. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the neurologic dysfunction in the AHPs. Porphyrin precursors, ALA in particular, are likely neurotoxic, and their hepatic accumulation, is thought to be a major mediator of neurotoxicity in acute attacks. Symptomatic improvement after an acute attack correlates with decreased ALA levels. Some patients demonstrate persistent elevations in ALA and PBG after an attack. The pathophysiologic implication of this finding to the neurologic complications and why some patients develop chronic neurologic symptoms remain open questions. In variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, porphyrins (in addition to porphyrin precursors) accumulate, which are photosensitizers and account for the cutaneous photosensitivity of these 2 AHP subtypes.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1142osmr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — chronic kidney disease (CKD) surveillance and epidemiology: Best Practice Advice 11 states that patients with AHP on treatment should undergo surveillance for chronic kidney disease annually with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. In the longitudinal study of the US Porphyrias Consortium, which enrolled symptomatic, asymptomatic, and latent carriers of AHP, CKD and hypertension were reported in 29% and 43% of patients, respectively. In a report from France, porphyria-associated kidney disease (PAKD) occurred in up to 59% of the patients with symptomatic AIP, with an annual decline in the glomerular filtration rate of approximately 1 mL/min per 1.73 m2, and among patients with PAKD, approximately 64% had concomitant hypertension.

### The pillars of health disparities science… [^115tYWxY]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

A health disparity is a preventable or avoidable health difference that is closely linked with social, economic, and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who have experienced systematically greater obstacles to health based on identification as racial and ethnic minority individuals and/or by their socioeconomic status. These fundamental drivers are the foundation of the science that the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institutes of Health, funds. Health disparities research was launched by the landmark Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health that documented disparities in life expectancy as well as selected causes of death by race.

2 One major finding was that 80% of the excess mortality observed among Black or African American and other racial and ethnic minoritized populations was due to cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, chemical dependency, diabetes, homicide, unintentional injuries, and infant mortality. In addition, the life expectancy gap between Black and White persons exceeded 5 years even with overall population improvement; these differences persist today.
3. Ethnicity refers to the broader cultural expression in certain geographic regions and may be based on shared history, traditions, language, and religion. These constructs function centrally in shaping the inequitable distribution of health outcomes within and across populations. Higher chronic psychosocial stressors, less robust social support networks, and less access to high-quality health care often characterize living conditions among persons with lower SES.

Rural communities often confront geographic, economic, and social barriers that limit access to health care services and resources, which compounds health disparities. Sexual and gender minority individuals and persons with disabilities may encounter challenges related to discrimination, stigma, and culturally incompetent health care that can compromise health outcomes. By prioritizing research on the intersectionality of these factors, targeted interventions designed to address the diversity within disadvantaged populations can be developed, tested, and implemented. The possible intersections on which to focus should also be applied to advance science among populations defined by other sociodemographic factors and diagnosed conditions, such as mental illness, diabetes, arthritis, and heart failure. Finally, there are multiple examples of effective interventions that have not been implemented in the most disadvantaged populations.

There is an urgency around identifying and addressing the specific mechanisms through which health disparities persist. Understanding how structural and individual factors interact with members of racial and ethnic minority groups and populations with lower SES will elucidate the complex web of influences that create and maintain disparities.
