## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered for a patient with a concussion and muscle twitching?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests to order for a patient with concussion (mild TBI) and muscle twitching. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what, if any, tests are indicated for concussion itself. Then, I should evaluate how the atypical symptom of muscle twitching changes the workup. Next, I need to check for red flags that would shift testing or urgency. Finally, I will synthesize when no labs are needed versus when targeted labs are reasonable, and I should confirm that my plan aligns with high-credibility guidelines and avoids discouraged tests like blood biomarkers and EEG for mTBI diagnosis [^1135sA1v] [^115UA9xb] [^1157VhDB] [^114Nqyfs].

> Let me first confirm the standard for concussion evaluation, because I need to ensure I am not over-ordering tests. Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis based on history, neurologic examination, and symptom and functional assessments; routine laboratory studies and serum "concussion biomarkers" are not recommended in usual care, and multiple guidelines advise against using serum biomarkers such as S100B, GFAP, UCHL1, NSE, or tau to diagnose or manage mTBI outside research settings [^1135sA1v] [^115UA9xb] [^114Nqyfs].

> Wait, I should also double-check whether ancillary neurophysiologic tests are suggested for concussion, because muscle twitching could tempt me to add them reflexively. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends avoiding EEG to establish mTBI diagnosis or direct care, except when there are clear indicators for immediate referral, reinforcing that EEG is not a routine diagnostic tool for concussion itself [^1157VhDB].

> Now, I will examine the muscle twitching in context, because this is not a classic concussion feature. Typical concussion manifestations span headache, dizziness, cognitive and balance problems, and can include seizure as a more serious complication; muscle twitching is not a core symptom and should prompt me to consider alternatives such as anxiety-related fasciculations, medication effects, or a metabolic disturbance, while keeping seizure on the differential as a red flag presentation that warrants escalation if present [^113tzw2x] [^116iiS8q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering broad panels; I need to ensure any testing is hypothesis-driven and tied to the atypical symptom rather than the concussion itself. Because guidelines emphasize a comprehensive history and physical with assessment of contributing medical and mental health comorbidities, a targeted workup for muscle twitching is reasonable only when clinical features suggest an alternate or contributing cause, anchoring testing to what is found on exam and history rather than routine screening labs for concussion [^112SaQBK] [^114Vmqtx].

> Let me think about when testing becomes appropriate. If the twitching is persistent, generalized, progressive, accompanied by altered awareness, focal deficits, or other red flags, or if medications, substances, or systemic illness are suspected, then it is reasonable to obtain targeted labs to evaluate potential metabolic or endocrine contributors to twitching; otherwise, in an uncomplicated, typical concussion without concerning features, no laboratory tests are required for the concussion diagnosis or routine management [^116iiS8q] [^1135sA1v] [^115UA9xb].

> I should specify what "targeted" means while keeping it clinically grounded. In practice, that often includes serum electrolytes with renal function, calcium and magnesium to assess for neuromuscular excitability drivers, and thyroid-stimulating hormone if clinical features suggest thyroid dysfunction; additional tests such as creatine kinase or toxicology are considered only when history or examination points that way, consistent with guideline emphasis on assessing contributing medical conditions rather than ordering concussion-specific labs or investigational biomarkers [^112SaQBK] [^1135sA1v] [^114Nqyfs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could imaging or EEG be indicated because of the twitching itself rather than for concussion per se? I need to check that threshold. Neuroimaging is not used to diagnose mTBI, but if there are neurologic signs suggesting intracranial pathology or progressive/worsening symptoms without other explanation, use the Canadian CT Head Rule acutely and consider delayed CT/MRI when clinically indicated; EEG is not for routine mTBI diagnosis but may be appropriate if the clinical picture suggests seizure activity, which is a red flag requiring urgent evaluation and possible referral [^115DPvsf] [^114Lbksa] [^112vZbkZ] [^1157VhDB] [^116iiS8q].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations if this is a child, because recommendations about biomarkers and routine testing need to stay consistent. The CDC pediatric guideline likewise advises that serum biomarkers not be obtained outside research and emphasizes clinical assessment and appropriate referral if symptoms are not resolving as expected, reinforcing a conservative stance on labs for concussion itself and a focus on targeted assessments when the clinical course deviates from the expected trajectory [^114Nqyfs] [^114w8wWG] [^111oBKyK].

> Putting it all together, my final synthesis is this: no specific laboratory tests are indicated for the concussion diagnosis or routine management, and serum "concussion biomarkers" and routine EEG should be avoided; muscle twitching, being atypical for concussion, warrants careful clinical assessment and, if persistent, progressive, generalized, or accompanied by red flags or relevant history, a targeted metabolic and endocrine panel may be reasonable, typically including electrolytes with renal function, calcium, magnesium, and thyroid function, with additional tests only if the history, examination, or course points to them, while reserving neuroimaging and EEG for cases that meet established clinical thresholds rather than for concussion per se [^1135sA1v] [^115UA9xb] [^1157VhDB] [^112SaQBK] [^115DPvsf] [^114Lbksa].

In concussion with muscle twitching, **routine labs are not required for concussion itself** [^1135sA1v], but the twitching warrants targeted testing to exclude metabolic, endocrine, or medication-related causes [^112SaQBK]. Obtain **CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphate, TSH, and CK** to screen for electrolyte, renal/hepatic, thyroid, or muscle injury causes. Consider a **toxicology screen** and check **antiepileptic drug (AED) levels** if relevant, and consider EEG [^1157VhDB] or MRI [^114Lbksa] only if seizures or structural lesions are suspected. Laboratory tests are not diagnostic for concussion [^115UA9xb], but they help identify treatable contributors to twitching.

---

## Recommended laboratory tests

### Basic laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Screen for infection, anemia, or systemic illness that could contribute to muscle twitching.

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Evaluate electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium), renal, and hepatic function; electrolyte disturbances or organ dysfunction can cause muscle twitching.

- **Magnesium and phosphate levels**: Hypomagnesemia or hypophosphatemia can cause neuromuscular irritability and twitching.

---

### Endocrine evaluation

Assess **thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**, as hyper- or hypothyroidism can cause neuromuscular symptoms, including muscle twitching.

---

### Muscle injury markers

Measure **creatine kinase (CK)**; elevated levels may indicate muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis, which can present with muscle twitching.

---

### Medication and substance screening

If medication or substance use is suspected, consider a **toxicology screen**, as certain drugs (e.g. stimulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics) can cause muscle twitching. If the patient is on AEDs, check **antiepileptic drug (AED) levels** to ensure therapeutic dosing and to exclude toxicity or subtherapeutic levels.

---

## Additional diagnostic considerations

### Electroencephalography (EEG)

EEG is **not routinely indicated** for concussion, but consider it if seizures or epileptiform activity are suspected in the context of muscle twitching [^1157VhDB] [^112ta3Gd].

---

### Neuroimaging

MRI is **not routinely indicated** [^112pKbyB] for concussion, but consider it if structural brain lesions are suspected or if symptoms persist beyond the expected recovery period [^114Lbksa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **VA/DoD guidelines**: Routine laboratory testing is not recommended for concussion alone; labs should be guided by clinical suspicion of alternative diagnoses or complications [^1135sA1v].

- **EAST guidelines**: Routine biochemical markers (e.g. S100, NSE, serum tau) are not recommended for concussion evaluation outside research settings [^115UA9xb] [^111mFdDj].

- **CDC guidelines**: Biomarker measurements are not recommended outside research settings for pediatric mTBI [^114Nqyfs] [^111oBKyK].

## Summary table of recommended laboratory tests

| **Laboratory test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| CBC | Infection, anemia, systemic illness |
| CMP | Electrolyte imbalance, renal/hepatic dysfunction [^113so4BG] |
| Magnesium, phosphate | Electrolyte imbalance causing neuromuscular irritability |
| TSH | Thyroid dysfunction |
| CK | Muscle injury or rhabdomyolysis |
| Toxicology screen | Medication or substance-induced twitching [^112SaQBK] |
| AED levels | Therapeutic dosing, toxicity, or subtherapeutic levels |

---

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated for concussion alone** [^1135sA1v], but muscle twitching warrants a **targeted evaluation** to exclude metabolic, endocrine, or medication-related causes [^112SaQBK]. Recommended tests include CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphate, TSH, CK, a toxicology screen, and AED levels if applicable. EEG and MRI are **reserved for specific clinical suspicions** [^1157VhDB] [^112pKbyB].

### Fluid biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury and related conditions [^111mFdDj]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as concussion, remain a major unmet clinical need. Moderate to severe TBI can be diagnosed definitively by clinical assessment and standard neuroimaging techniques that detect the gross damage to the brain parenchyma. Diagnostic tools for mild TBI are lacking, and currently, the diagnosis has to be made on clinical grounds alone, as most patients show no gross pathological changes on CT. Most patients with mild TBI recover quickly, but about 15% develop an ill-defined condition called postconcussive syndrome (PCS). Repeated concussions have been associated with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only currently be diagnosed post mortem.

Fluid biomarkers are needed to better define and detect mild TBI and related conditions. Here, we review the literature on fluid biomarkers for neuronal, axonal, oligodendrocytic, astroglial, and blood-brain barrier injury, as well as markers for neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation in the context of mild TBI, PCS, and CTE. We also discuss technical and standardization issues and potential pathways to advance the most promising biomarker candidates into clinical laboratory practice.

### Concussion management in combat sports: Consensus statement from the Association of Ringside Physicians [^114bg5kN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

In addition to the above-mentioned periods of suspension, it is recommended that a combat sports athlete's suspension continue until cleared by a specialist physician trained in concussion management. Specialist physicians trained in concussion management include neurologists, neurosurgeons, and primary care sports medicine physicians.

- **Other baseline testing**: It is recommended that all combat sports athletes undertake a validated neuropsychological (NP) evaluation, with the initial test serving as a baseline. Vestibular, ocular, and balance baseline testing are also recommended, if possible. Repeat baseline testing should occur annually. If any decline is noted, it is recommended that a physician trained in brain injuries and concussion management evaluate the athlete.

- **Education**: All combat sports athletes and their coaches/trainers should be educated and trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of concussion. If a combat sports athlete experiences any signs or symptoms of a concussion during training or competition, they should remove themselves from contact activities and seek immediate evaluation by a healthcare professional.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^1145sWrh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

We developed a list of key findings in 'Summary of findings' tables and determined the certainty in the summary estimates for each test and finding using the GRADE approach (Schünemann 2020a; Schünemann 2020b). Starting at high certainty, we downgraded meta-analyses by one level when at least half of the studies had a high risk of bias on one or more domains. We downgraded for indirectness when at least half of the studies in the meta-analyses had high concerns regarding applicability on at least one domain. We also downgraded for imprecision when fewer people with the target condition were included than would have been needed to achieve the sensitivity estimates listed, with a width of the confidence interval of at most 10 percentage points. Additionally, we downgraded for inconsistency when study estimates differed more than 20 percentage points from each other. We did not consider publication bias to be a problem.

- **Updating**: We will undertake the searches of published literature, preprints, and new test approvals weekly. Depending on the number of new and important studies found, we will consider updating each review with each search if resources allow.

### Brain vital signs detect concussion-related neurophysiological impairments in ice hockey [^1153Wzbi]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion in sport is a global public health issue, with between 1.6 million and 3.8 million sport-related concussions per year in the United States alone. Concussions occur frequently in collision sports such as ice hockey, where players routinely sustain both direct head contact and indirect force transmission to the brain due to body checking, incidental or illegal collisions, and fighting. There is a growing concern because a history of concussion is potentially associated with persistent mental health and cognitive impairments later in life in some athletes. It may also result in an increased risk of progressive neurodegenerative disease.

- **Subconcussive impacts**: Recent evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts can accumulate over time to create functional and structural brain impairment, historically thought to occur only in acute concussive injuries. There is no known objective assessment specifically designed to measure the effects of subconcussive impacts. Concussion protocols are indeed based on an affirmative concern of injury.

- **Need for objective evaluations**: Accurate clinical decision-making is important for sport-related concussion management to achieve the goal of safely returning an athlete to play as soon as possible. Neural tissue requires sufficient time to heal after injury, and athletes are susceptible to potentially far more severe re-injury if cleared to return before fully recovered. However, there is mounting evidence demonstrating that neurophysiological impairments persist even after the observable clinical signs of injury have resolved.

### Diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion evaluation: A prospective, case-controlled study in college athletes comparing newer tools and established tests [^113kzb49]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion tests in college athletes. Athletes completed baseline concussion tests, which included the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), modified Balance Error Scoring System (m-BESS), King-Devick test, and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuits. Testing was repeated in athletes diagnosed acutely with concussion and compared to a matched teammate without concussion.

Data were collected on 41 concussed athletes and 41 matched controls. The test-retest reliability for symptom score and symptom severity, assessed using control athletes, was 0.09 (-0.70 to 0.88) and 0.08 (-1.00 to 1.00) (unweighted kappa). The intraclass correlations were SAC 0.33 (-0.02 to 0.61), m-BESS 0.33 (-0.20 to 0.60), EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit tangential variability 0.70 (0.50 to 0.83), radial variability 0.47 (0.19 to 0.69), and King-Devick test 0.71 (0.49 to 0.84).

The maximum identified sensitivity/specificity for predicting clinical concussion diagnosis of each test was as follows: symptom score 81%/94% (3-point increase), symptom severity score 91%/81% (3-point increase), SAC 44%/72% (2-point decline), m-BESS 40%/92% (5-point increase), King-Devick 85%/76% (any increase in time), and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit tangential variability 48%/58% with radial variability 52%/61% (any increase). The adjusted area under the curve was: symptom score 0.95 (0.89 to 0.99), symptom severity 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99), SAC 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.79), m-BESS 0.71 (0.60 to 0.83), King-Devick 0.78 (0.69 to 0.87), and radial variability 0.47 (0.34 to 0.59).

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^111oBKyK]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, in children is a rapidly growing public health concern, as epidemiologic data indicate a marked increase in the number of emergency department visits for mTBI over the past decade. However, at the time of writing, no evidence-based clinical guidelines have been developed for diagnosing and managing pediatric mTBI in the United States.

The objective of this guideline is to provide a framework based on a systematic review of the literature to develop clinical recommendations for health care professionals regarding the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI.

- **Evidence review**: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Board of Scientific Counselors, a federal advisory committee, established the Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Guideline Workgroup. This workgroup drafted recommendations using evidence obtained and assessed within the systematic review, alongside related evidence, scientific principles, and expert inference. The information includes selected studies published since the evidence review that were deemed relevant by the workgroup. The initial literature search covered January 1, 1990, to November 30, 2012, and the updated search spanned December 1, 2012, to July 31, 2015.

The CDC guideline comprises 19 sets of recommendations on the diagnosis, prognosis, and management/treatment of pediatric mTBI.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^114PRxb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The fundamental starting point for the clinician is to make the diagnosis of concussion. Accurate and timely diagnosis may help facilitate earlier recovery, reduce the risk of early complications, and avoid further head and musculoskeletal injuries. Making an accurate diagnosis is both important and challenging because of concussion's varied and sometimes subtle presentation. Symptoms overlap with other musculoskeletal, psychological, and neurological diagnoses, and a lack of definitive investigations or diagnostic markers raises challenges. Because of these issues, concussion remains a clinical diagnosis.

The first step in diagnosing concussion is to identify the potential injury and evaluate the athlete. At all playing levels of all collision sports, a concussion evaluation is triggered when an athlete is identified as having experienced a forceful impact directly or indirectly transmitted to the head that was associated with:

- **Symptom(s) reported by the athlete**
- **Visible signs**
- **Any clinical suspicion by medical staff**:

Match officials may also report possible concussion to team clinicians. Some sports have implemented education programmes aimed at training match officials to recognize possible concussion and act by stopping the game and notifying the appropriate team clinicians.

In community-level sport, there may not be adequately trained medical staff present. In this situation, any suspicion by a match official, coach, athletic trainer, first aider, or dedicated observer should result in the removal of the athlete from the field.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^113tzw2x]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

Concussion, a disease that can affect both children and adolescents, is associated with numerous symptoms. These symptoms include retinal hemorrhage, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, gait disturbance, headache, anxiety, and seizure. Additional manifestations can involve agitation, anisocoria, neck pain, alcohol consumption, slurred speech, and depression. Emotional lability, vomiting, memory impairment, aggressive behavior, and dizziness are also relevant. Further complications may include insomnia, sleeping disorders, fatigue, nausea, and phonophobia, frequently seen in individuals participating in sports.

- **Motor and sensory disturbances**: Cervical spine injury, irritability, head injury, scalp laceration, blurred vision, impulsivity, diplopia, numbness, and photophobia are known complications. **Cognitive and balance issues**: Confusion, loss of balance, difficulty concentrating, and tinnitus are prevalent symptoms. **Other concerns**: Falls, hearing loss, and disorientation are additional challenges faced by individuals with concussions.

Comprehensive management and preventive strategies are essential in mitigating these wide-ranging consequences associated with concussions.

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^113ATDsU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions is challenging because each patient has different symptoms. An athlete should never be returned to play until completely asymptomatic. Classification systems for concussions are not based on scientific evidence and represent some practitioners' best guess at what is safe for young athletes. Many experienced team physicians believe they can allow an athlete to play safely if there are no symptoms at rest and no symptoms with increasing intensity of exercise. Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance tests show promise for use in the field to increase the sensitivity of our neurological evaluation on injured athletes. Any neuropsychological or balance evaluation is more helpful if baseline data is collected on athletes before they are injured.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury [^115QUKR1]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Low credibility.

To better identify patients who would most benefit from follow-up, some predictive models have been proposed, but to our knowledge, none were externally prospectively validated, and no evidence-based guidelines have been proposed. Consequently, there is a pressing need for ED clinicians to have access to a fast and reliable clinical decision rule (CDR) to predict PPCS in adults who sustained a mTBI.

The main objective of this study was to derive and validate a CDR, called the PoCS Rule (Post-Concussion Symptoms Rule), to predict PPCS 90 days after an mTBI. The secondary objectives were to validate the PoCS Rule for the prediction of PPCS, using other definitions and non-return to work/school at 90 days.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC|mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^112ta3Gd]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Electrophysiological tests**: Electrophysiological tests (EEG, evoked potentials) evaluate electrical activity in the brain. While this is an area of active research, there is currently not enough research to recommend utility in the diagnosis and treatment of SRC.

It is essential that the team physician understand the diagnosis of SRC remains a clinical diagnosis. There are tools and tests that may aid in its assessment but are not to be used as standalone measures. Furthermore, they must comprehend the indications for neuroimaging in athletes.

It is desirable that the team physician understand that formal neurocognitive testing is not required but can provide useful information for baseline and post-injury assessment, and aid in making return-to-learn (RTL) and return-to-play (RTP) decisions. They should also be aware of the indications for and limitations of neurocognitive and neuropsychological testing, as well as the difference between these two types of testing. Impairment in oculomotor function may occur in SRC. Data from the spotter/video review process have been shown to be helpful in elite adult male athletes. Additionally, serum biomarkers, genetic testing, advanced neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic testing are considered research tools. There is a need to educate the athletic care network on the various testing paradigms that exist in the diagnosis of concussion.

- **Neurological sequelae of brain injury**: There are some medical conditions that may be of concern to the team physician and may or may not be related to SRC. These include the following:

- Concussive convulsion
- Second-impact syndrome/diffuse cerebral edema
- ReSRC
- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)

### Concussion management in combat sports: Consensus statement from the Association of Ringside Physicians [^115Yi5Zf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

For phases 1 and 2, there should be at least 24 hours (or longer) for each step of the progression. If any symptoms worsen during exercise, the athlete should go back to the previous step. Phase 3 should be started when concussion symptoms have resolved, and the athlete has completed phases 1 and 2. If symptoms are persistent (e.g. more than 10 days), the athlete should be referred to a healthcare professional who is an expert in the management of concussion.

The majority of non-combat sports concussion protocols at amateur and professional levels require evaluation and clearance by a healthcare provider trained in the management of concussion before returning to contact/competition. The Association of Ringside Physicians (ARP) also believes such a practice should be applied in combat sports. If a combat sports athlete is experiencing concussion signs and symptoms 30 minutes after his or her bout, or lost his or her bout by knockout via strikes to the head, it is most likely the athlete has sustained a concussion. Accordingly, he or she should be evaluated and cleared by a healthcare provider skilled in concussion management before returning to contact/competition. The specialist clearance should be in addition to the above-referenced recommended minimal day suspensions.

Neuropsychological (NP) baseline testing is a helpful tool in making decisions regarding a return to fighting in combat sports athletes who have sustained a concussion. NP testing is also helpful for screening for neurological decline over the course of a combatant's career. Computerized NP baseline testing is now widely available.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: a joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117KDjAe]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Where independent medical personnel are used at the game, they may override team clinicians' decisions and immediately and permanently remove a player from the field (e.g. in rugby union). In other sports (e.g. NFL), the independent unaffiliated neurological consultant provides a second opinion, but the team clinician is responsible for the final decisions regarding diagnosis and removal from the sport. The team clinician is recognized as the person most knowledgeable about the athlete's baseline status and is often in a favorable position to recognize subtle signs of concussion, such as changes in athlete behavior or attitude, which might not be detected by independent neurological consultants. The NFL recognizes that within every medical team, one expert must make the final decision regarding athlete care; in the case of a concussion, this is the team clinician. Team clinicians' decisions regarding return to sport should not be interfered with or challenged by non-medical personnel.

At the professional and elite levels, team clinicians typically have the final say in return-to-sport decisions following a concussion but may choose to seek consultant support for shared decision-making. In all settings, even where the independent clinician's opinion may theoretically be overriding, communication and collaboration among clinicians is strongly encouraged and can be a benefit of the consultant system.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, specifically concerning pediatric patients and their return to activity, the CDC 2018 guidelines recommend counseling patients and families to gradually resume activities that do not exacerbate symptoms. This should occur following the first several days of rest, with close monitoring of the number and severity of symptom expression.

In order to acknowledge the work of researchers in the build-up to 2020/2021 and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific committee has decided to publish a first group of abstracts. These abstracts have undergone a peer-review process and cover all aspects of concussion science and clinical care. We invite you to submit your research on concussion in sport during the second call for abstracts, which will close on 15 June 2022.

Following the conference, the systematic reviews, methodology paper, abstracts submitted during the second call, and updated tools that result from the meeting will be submitted for publication and external peer-review alongside the consensus statement. Of note, the resulting papers are completed and approved by the co-authors of each manuscript, with no review or requirement for approval from the sport organizations who contribute educational grants and funding for the meeting.

### Concussion in combination with whiplash-associated disorder may be missed in primary care: Key recommendations for assessment and management [^1147XNGn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Whiplash and concussion may present similar symptoms, biomechanical mechanisms, and neurophysiological sequelae, but neither benefits from a gold standard diagnostic test. Guidelines for whiplash and concussion are developed and implemented separately. This separate process may lead to misdiagnosis, delay appropriate primary care management, and impair patient outcomes.

In our clinical commentary, we present three cases where signs and symptoms consistent with whiplash were identified in primary care. These symptoms included neck pain, headache, dizziness, and concentration deficits, raising suspicion of coexisting postconcussion syndrome. All cases were referred for specialist physical therapy. Characteristics consistent with poor recovery in both whiplash and postconcussion syndrome were confirmed, and multidisciplinary management, drawing from both whiplash and concussion guidelines, was implemented.

All patients reported improvement in activities of daily living after tailored management addressing both neck and head injury-related factors, suggesting these conditions were not mutually exclusive. Self-reported outcomes included reductions in neck disability and postconcussion symptoms of between 20% and 40%. It may be appropriate for whiplash and concussion guidelines to be amalgamated, enhanced, and mutually recognized on a patient-by-patient basis. Primary health care professionals might consider minimum screening to identify postconcussion syndrome in patients following a motor vehicle collision by administering questionnaires and assessing symptoms.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^1137rUGV]. Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for concussion, particularly with respect to pediatric patients, sport-related concussion and return to sport, the AAP 2018 guidelines recommend considering neurocognitive testing following a sport-related concussion to assess for recovery, but not as the sole determining factor for when a return to play is appropriate. Testing should be conducted by providers trained in the proper conduction and interpretation of such tests.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, which makes diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has changed significantly over the last several years. The previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned in favor of more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to assist in management. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a healthcare provider. Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion are crucial, because repeat concussions can result in decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes.

### Clinical evaluation of concussion: The evolving role of oculomotor assessments [^114y3REZ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016).

Sports-related concussion is a change in brain function following a direct or indirect force to the head, identified in awake individuals and accounting for a considerable proportion of mild traumatic brain injury. Although the neurological signs and symptoms of concussion can be subtle and transient, there can be persistent sequelae, such as impaired attention and balance, that make affected patients particularly vulnerable to further injury.

Currently, there is no accepted definition or diagnostic criteria for concussion, and there is no single assessment that is accepted as capable of identifying all patients with concussion. In this paper, the authors review the available screening tools for concussion, with particular emphasis on the role of visual function testing. Specifically, they discuss the oculomotor assessment tools that are being investigated in the setting of concussion screening.

### Post-concussion symptoms rule: Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule for early prediction of persistent symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury [^113oed6d]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2022). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly known as concussion, is a frequent problem. The Public Health Agency of Canada recently reported more than 5 million emergency department (ED) visits for head injuries between 2002 and 2017, 70% of which were due to concussions or mTBI. This situation is similar elsewhere; in the United States, approximately 2 million people suffer an mTBI each year, and worldwide, mTBI represents approximately 70–80% of all TBIs. Patients with mTBI often suffer from post-concussion symptoms such as headache, dizziness, and concentration problems, which can impede the return to normal function.

Although post-concussion symptoms are usually transient, prevalence rates of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) have been reported in between 13% and 62% of patients, depending on diagnostic criteria. Prolonged symptoms lead to time lost from work, social costs, and adverse impact on quality of life. Early interventions, individualized neuropsychological interventions, and interdisciplinary interventions seem to reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of PPCS and may facilitate the recovery of daily activities and return to work. Unfortunately, predicting long-term mTBI symptoms is challenging in the ED since emergency physicians' diagnostic accuracy for predicting full recovery or PPCS at 3 months post-injury is no better than chance.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC|mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: a consensus statement [^114e5s4x]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Preseason planning and assessment is the period of the athletic year prior to any practice or competition. During this period, the emergency action plan (EAP) should be developed or reviewed, and preparticipation assessment should be performed. EAP and assessments should include protocols and policies for recognition and acute management of SRC.

Each organization should develop SRC protocols and policies including the following:

- **Definition of SRC**: Education on recognizing signs and symptoms of SRC, role of equipment, and avoiding high-risk play behaviors (e.g. leading with the head).
- **Diagnosis**: Only a licensed healthcare provider can make an SRC diagnosis.
- **Acute sideline and post-injury management**.
- **Return to learn (RTL) and return to play (RTP) guidelines**.

Athletes, coaches, parents, administrators, referees, and healthcare providers should be educated about SRC in a manner consistent and compliant with state law, governing body, and school district requirements.

Preparticipation assessment should include:

- **Personal history**: Prior SRC or brain injury, prior cervical spine injury, history of migraines, seizure disorder and other neurological diseases, learning disability and ADHD, depression or other mood disorders, medications, supplements, alcohol, and drug use.

The utility and necessity of baseline assessments are still being researched. When performed, baseline assessments include a symptom checklist, cognitive function, balance/postural stability, and other components of the neurological examination (e.g. most recent Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT)).

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

Concussion is defined as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by direct or indirect biomechanical forces transmitted to the head, characterized by reversible symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.

- **Pathophysiology**: Concussion occurs due to biomechanical forces impacting the head in various settings, including work environments, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreation, and home falls among the elderly.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations typically include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and occasionally malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may lead to post-traumatic epilepsy, post-concussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration, leading to dementia and movement disorders.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Concussions are associated with an increased mortality risk in the elderly, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.34).

### Saliva RNA biomarkers predict concussion duration and detect symptom recovery: A comparison with balance and cognitive testing [^114MGcsm]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pediatric Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) Workgroup recommend that clinicians inform patients and families that some factors predict risk for persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCS), but individual recovery from mTBI is unique. Providers should use a combination of tools when assessing mTBI recovery (i.e. symptom scales, cognitive and balance tests). However, the workgroup also recognized these tools are insufficient to accurately predict recovery, stating, "No factors can individually predict recovery of symptoms and outcome… much of the variance in outcome remains unaccounted for, even when multiple factors are considered".

The best available tool predicts PPCS with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68. More complicated tools to identify PPCS may require time and expertise that may preclude their use by the majority of health care providers. In ambulatory clinics, where patient visits may last only 15 minutes, rapid, objective measures that do not require specialist interpretation are urgently needed. Such tools would improve care for patients with PPCS in two ways: (1) individuals who receive education about prognosis have improved outcomes; and (2) identifying those at risk for PPCS provides an opportunity for early intervention prior to the development of prolonged and debilitating symptoms.

Non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) represent a potential biomarker for PPCS. Several classes of ncRNAs have been implicated in concussion, but the best-studied are microRNAs (miRNAs).

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC / mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: A consensus statement [^116iiS8q]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To ensure accurate evaluation on the sidelines, it is crucial to obtain a detailed history and conduct an in-depth physical examination in a distraction-free environment. This optimizes the assessment of cognitive, somatic, and affective signs and symptoms of SRC, with particular attention to the quantity and severity of symptoms due to their prognostic significance. Perform and repeat neurological assessments, focusing on cognitive function, cranial nerve, and balance testing until the athlete is stable (e.g. SCAT).

Athletes with suspected SRC should be immediately removed from practice or competition. If no licensed healthcare provider is present to evaluate the athlete with suspected SRC, there is no return to play (RTP), even if symptoms resolve. If SRC is confirmed by a licensed healthcare provider, there is no same-day RTP. However, if evaluated by a licensed healthcare provider who determines an SRC did not occur, same-day RTP is an option. The athlete should not be left unsupervised until a disposition decision is made.

Determine disposition for both symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes, including serial assessments and post-injury follow-up. Options include home observation or transport to a hospital. Provide post-event instructions to the athlete and others regarding medications, driving, alcohol, physical and cognitive exertion, and medical follow-up. The final determination regarding SRC diagnosis and management is a medical decision based on clinical judgment.

It is essential the team physician:

- **Signs and symptoms**: Know the signs and symptoms of suspected SRC.
- **Red flags**: Recognize red flags (signs and symptoms) and establish a protocol for emergency hospital transport.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^113cy8Ez]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The timing of return to sport is often the most important issue for athletes, coaches, and parents. Clinicians face the challenge of helping the athlete return at the appropriate time that does not compromise the athlete's health or performance.

At all participation levels, including professional, elite, and community/recreational, an athlete diagnosed with concussion should not be permitted to return to sport on the day the concussion is sustained. All athletes diagnosed with concussion should undergo serial clinical evaluations in the days following the injury.

Athletes participating at the elite level, who are removed from the playing arena with a suspected head injury but are not diagnosed with concussion following a multifaceted, SCAT5-based assessment performed by an experienced clinician, may return to the game.

Even if no diagnosis of concussion has been made, athletes removed from sport with suspected concussion should undergo serial re-evaluations for up to 48 hours because of the possibility of delayed symptom onset. For the athlete who is diagnosed with concussion, monitoring should continue at regular intervals until the athlete is cleared to return to sport.

- **Criteria for return to sport after concussion in team collision sport**: Athletes who have been diagnosed with concussion may only return to sport after:
	- Concussion-related symptom scores, both at rest and with match-intensity exercise, have returned to baseline levels.
	- Neurological examination, including balance testing, is normal.
	- Cognitive testing (computerised assessment) is completed and the athlete is cleared.

### Sensitivity of the concussion assessment battery [^111sWRmp]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Sports medicine clinicians commonly use multiple tests when evaluating patients with concussion. The specific tests vary but often include symptom inventories, posturography, and neurocognitive examinations. The sensitivity of these tests to concussion is vital in reducing the risk of additional injury by prematurely returning an athlete to play. Our study investigated the sensitivity of concussion-related symptoms, a postural control evaluation, and neurocognitive functioning in concussed collegiate athletes.

From 1998 to 2005, all high-risk athletes completed a baseline concussion-assessment battery consisting of a self-reported symptom inventory, a postural control evaluation, and a neurocognitive assessment. Postconcussion assessments were administered within 24 hours of injury to 75 athletes who had physician-diagnosed concussion. Individual tests and the complete battery were evaluated for sensitivity to concussion.

- **Results**: The computerized Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing and HeadMinder Concussion Resolution Index (neurocognitive tests) were the most sensitive to concussion (79.2% and 78.6%, respectively). These tests were followed by self-reported symptoms (68.0%), the postural control evaluation (61.9%), and a brief pencil-and-paper assessment of neurocognitive function (43.5%). When the complete battery was assessed, sensitivity exceeded 90%.

Currently recommended concussion-assessment batteries accurately identified decrements in one or more areas in most of the athletes with concussion.

### Quantifying the diagnostic utility of baseline testing in concussion management: An analysis of collegiate athletes from the NCAA-DOD CARE Consortium dataset [^114qMSrG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although preseason baseline testing is a commonly recommended part of the concussion management process, its "value-added" contribution to the diagnosis of acute concussion compared with normative reference values remains in question.

- **Purpose**: This research aimed to evaluate the diagnostic benefits of baseline testing in acute concussion assessment compared with normative reference values and characterize the athletes who receive the most diagnostic utility from baseline testing.

- **Study design**: Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.

- **Methods**: The investigators selected athletes from the National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium with at least 2 baseline assessments and 1 concussion. Two predictive models were developed that mimic acute concussion assessment using multivariate logistic regression based on a battery of postural control, neurocognitive status, and symptom assessments. The first predictive model gives a concussion status prediction based on change scores computed using individualized baseline testing information, whereas the second model uses normative reference values. The investigators defined and computed a novel metric called the Diagnostic Utility of Baseline Testing by comparing the concussion status predicted by each of these predictive models. The Diagnostic Utility of Baseline distribution was analyzed across athlete demographic characteristics and medical history.

- **Results**: The study included 1081 collegiate athletes (43.9% female) with…

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of mild TBI (concussions): What you need to know [^114U6mAc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents and is a form of mild traumatic brain injury that surgeons will see in their acute care practice. With a rapidly changing evidence base for diagnosis and management, the focus is on the importance of timely identification and diagnosis, as well as the early initiation of active management of pediatric concussion immediately after injury through recovery. This approach involves the application of targeted therapies for specific deficits identified after concussion, addressing the individual pattern of symptoms experienced by patients.

The review covers what is known about the underlying pathophysiology that drives the clinical manifestations of concussion. It also highlights the targeted clinical assessments that can aid in diagnosing concussion and guide the active rehabilitation of deficits observed after concussion. Additionally, the standardized approach to returning to activities will be described, including return to learning and sports.

### Divergent classification methods of post-concussion syndrome after mild traumatic brain injury: Prevalence rates, risk factors, and functional outcome [^111dT4rQ]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2018). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common diagnosis, and approximately one-third of mTBI patients experience a variety of cognitive, emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral post-concussion symptoms. When a cluster of these symptoms persists for more than three months, they are often classified as post-concussion syndrome (PCS).

The objective of this study was to determine prevalence rates, risk factors, and functional outcomes associated with PCS six months after mTBI, applying divergent classification methods. Follow-up questionnaires at six months after mTBI included the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). The RPQ was analyzed according to different classification methods:

- **Mapped International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV)**: These provided the RPQ total score and the RPQ3.
- **Three-factor model**: Used two different cutoff points (mild or worse and moderate or worse).

Our results from a sample of 731 mTBI patients showed that prevalence rates of PCS ranged from 11.4% to 38.7% using divergent classification methods. According to all eight methods, 6.3% (n = 46) of mTBI patients experienced PCS. Applying the divergent classification methods resulted in different sets of predictors being statistically significantly associated with PCS, and a different percentage of overlap with functional impairment, measured with the GOSE.

In conclusion, depending on the classification method and rating score used, prevalence rates of PCS deviated considerably.

### Diagnostic predictive values for sport-related concussions: A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis [^1179xhUJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussions (SRCs) can cause significant neurological symptoms, and approximately 10%-15% of athletes with SRC experience a prolonged recovery. Given the lack of visible injury on brain imaging and their varied presentations, concussions can be difficult to diagnose. A variety of tests and examination methods have been used to elicit a concussion diagnosis; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are variable. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of standardized tests and visible signs like balance and vision changes in the diagnosis of SRC.

- **Methods**: A PRISMA-adherent systematic review of concussion diagnostic examinations was performed using the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases on December 1, 2022. Search terms included "concussion", "traumatic brain injury", "diagnosis", "sensitivity", and "specificity". Each method of examination was categorized into larger group-based symptomatologic presentations or standardized tools. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of concussion. Pooled specificity and sensitivity for each method were calculated using a meta-analysis of proportion and were hierarchically ranked using P-scores calculated from a diagnostic frequentist network meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Thirty full-length articles were identified for inclusion, 13 of which evaluated grouped symptomology examinations (balance and overall clinical presentation) and 17 of which evaluated established formalized tools (ImPACT, King-Deficit Scale).

### Sideline concussion assessment: The current state of the art [^11537mX9]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

More than 200 million American adults and children participate in organized physical activity. Growing awareness has highlighted that concussion, especially when repeated, may be associated with prolonged neurological, cognitive, and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. Objective diagnosis of concussion remains challenging. Although some concussion symptoms may be apparent even to nonmedical observers, diagnosis and removal from play for evaluation depend on validated assessment tools and trained, vigilant healthcare personnel.

Over the past two decades, sideline concussion measures have undergone significant revision and augmentation to become more comprehensive batteries in order to detect a wide spectrum of symptomatology, such as neurocognitive function, postconcussive symptoms, gait/balance, and saccadic eye movements. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art concussion evaluation instruments, ranging from the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) and tools that may enhance concussion detection, to near-term blood-based biomarkers and emerging technology (e.g. head impact sensors, vestibulo-ocular/eye-tracking, and mobile applications).

Special focus is directed at feasibility, utility, generalizability, and challenges to implementation of each measure on-field and on the sidelines. This review finds that few instruments beyond the SCAT provide guidance for removal from play; establishing thresholds for concussion detection and removal from play in the qualification/validation of future instruments is of high importance.

### Diagnosis and management of sports-related concussion: a 15-year-old athlete with a concussion [^115BZkfQ]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Concussion in youth athletes is a growing problem worldwide. During the past decade, significant progress has been made in the standardization of the assessment of young athletes. A growing appreciation of metabolic vulnerability, activity, and cognitive challenges has led to guidelines and suggestions for rest from the field as well as cognitive rest from school.

Outcome data have begun to establish groups linked to symptom class, genetics, and sex who are at risk of worse outcomes from concussions. Decisions regarding return to activity are now based on at-rest symptoms, graded increases in activity, and neuropsychological testing.

Using the case of Ms. X, a 15-year-old otherwise healthy high school student who fell while skiing, evaluation, prognosis, and management of concussion are discussed.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^117KbUzk]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

An advanced care setting represents an enhanced, well-resourced, clinical environment ideal for individualized management of athletes. This setting should be in place when contemplating a faster return to sport and is most appropriate for managing more complicated cases.

- **Key characteristics of an advanced care setting**: Access to a medical doctor experienced in concussion management, such as those with specializations in sports medicine, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, or neurosurgery; computerized and/or formal neuropsychological evaluation; and oculomotor and cervicovestibular evaluation and rehabilitation.

Where advanced care settings are not available, some sports recommend compulsory, age-specific stand-down periods, where physical activity is limited to below the symptom threshold.

- **Specialist testing that may characterize advanced care settings**: Neuropsychological testing is a useful adjunct to medical evaluation of concussion. Formal neuropsychological testing conducted by a neuropsychologist is the gold standard for various situations, including an accelerated return to sport within one month, complex cases (e.g. athletes with a history of multiple concussions), athletes with pre-existing comorbidities (e.g. psychological/psychiatric issues), and decisions regarding athlete retirement for the season or career.

If a specialist neuropsychologist is not available, supervised computerized testing batteries and additional expert clinical opinion should be employed for concussed athletes who return to sport in fewer than seven days.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high, and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. With no valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury provides an additional level of complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms.

While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and Balance Error Scoring System, have been developed specifically for concussion, the vast majority of tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of postconcussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area. The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

### Ocular motor assessment in concussion: Current status and future directions [^11137UyL]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Mild head injuries, such as concussions and subconcussive repetitive impacts, may lead to subtle changes in brain function, making it imperative to find sensitive and reliable tests to detect such changes. Tests involving the visual system, particularly eye movements, can incorporate higher cortical functioning and involve diffuse pathways in the brain, including many areas susceptible to head impacts.

- **Clinical neuro-ophthalmic exam**: This is important for detecting abnormalities in vergence, saccades, pursuit, and visual fixation. On the sidelines, the King-Devick test has been used as a visual performance measure incorporating eye movements and increasing sensitivity in detecting possible concussions. It is used in conjunction with standard sideline tests of cognition, symptom checklists, and balance.

- **Eye movement laboratory**: There is much promise in this area for quantifying changes in saccades and pursuit with concussions using video-oculography. A combination of eye movement tasks, neuroimaging techniques, and other objective biomarkers may lead to a better understanding of the anatomical and physiological consequences of concussion and to a better understanding of the natural history of this condition.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: Concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to base these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes.

Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. Delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

### Concussion guidelines step 1: Systematic review of prevalent indicators [^112gRJvK]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no evidence-based definition for concussion that is being uniformly applied in clinical and research settings.

- **Objective**: To conduct a systematic review of the highest-quality literature about concussion and to assemble evidence about the prevalence and associations of key indicators of concussion. The goal was to establish an evidence-based foundation from which to derive, in future work, a definition, diagnostic criteria, and prognostic indicators for concussion.

- **Methods**: Key questions were developed, and an electronic literature search from 1980 to 2012 was conducted to acquire evidence about the prevalence of and associations among signs, symptoms, and neurologic and cognitive deficits in samples of individuals exposed to potential concussive events. Included studies were assessed for potential bias and confound and rated as high, medium, or low potential for bias and confound. Those rated as high were excluded from the analysis. Studies were further triaged on the basis of whether the definition of a case of concussion was exclusive or inclusive; only those with wide, inclusive case definitions were used in the analysis. Finally, only studies reporting data collected at fixed time points were used. For a study to be included in the conclusions, it was required that the presence of any particular sign, symptom, or deficit be reported in at least two independent samples.

- **Results**: From 5437 abstracts, 1362 full-text publications were reviewed, of which 231 studies were included in the final library. Twenty-six met all criteria required.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: Concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of the statement is to provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. It also aims to establish the level of evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and highlight areas requiring additional research.

- **Importance of an AMSSM statement**: Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussions. They are specifically trained to provide care along the continuum of sports concussion, from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

- **Definition**: Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

- **Pathophysiology**: Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^116MQSHt]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

The CDC 2018 guidelines recommend counseling patients and families during preparticipation athletic examinations. Specifically, in pediatric patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), recovery might be delayed in the presence of several factors. These include the following:

- **Premorbid history of mTBI**: Patients may experience prolonged recovery times.
- **Lower cognitive ability**: This particularly applies to patients with an intracranial lesion.
- **Neurological or psychiatric disorder**: Existing conditions can affect recovery.
- **Learning difficulties**: Challenges in learning can influence the healing process.
- **Increased pre-injury symptoms**: This can exacerbate recovery time.
- **Family and social stressors**: These external factors may contribute to delayed recovery.

### Preliminary use of the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs for detecting subtle motor signs in adolescents with sport-related concussion [^116LwAHq]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). High credibility.

Sensitive examination tools are needed to optimize evaluation after sports-related concussion. The Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs was preliminarily examined for sensitivity to motor changes in a pilot cohort of adolescents aged 13–17 years with sports-related concussion. A total of 15 adolescents (5 female adolescents) with sports-related concussion were evaluated up to three times: within 2 weeks of injury, approximately 1 month later (mean 35 days between visits), and for those not recovered at the second visit, again after clinical recovery (mean 70 days between the first and last visits for all participants). Comparison data were acquired from 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control athletes with no history of concussion who were evaluated twice (mean 32 days apart).

Main effects of group, time, and interaction effects were evaluated with an analysis of covariance, which controlled for socioeconomic status, times tested, and days between testing sessions. Adolescents with concussion had poorer Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs performance than controls did at all time points. Performance improved between visits within the concussion group, with no change within the control group. These findings suggest that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs merits additional study in larger cohorts and in combination with other markers of injury to facilitate an enhanced understanding of sports-related concussion and recovery.

### Time trends in concussion symptom presentation and assessment methods in high school athletes [^115JB9fA]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Concussion rates have increased significantly over the past decade; this may reflect an increase in the knowledge and diagnosis of the symptoms of a concussion rather than a true increase in the incidence. Assessing trends in the way that concussions are presenting to and being identified by clinicians over the same period may provide additional insight into the apparent rise in concussions.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate patterns of change in concussion symptom presentation, diagnostic/evaluation methods, and symptom resolution time reported for United States high school athletes from the 2007–2008 through 2014–2015 academic years.

- **Study design**: Descriptive epidemiology study.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective analysis of a web-based longitudinal high school sports injury surveillance database (High School RIO [Reporting Information Online]) collected from 2007–2008 through 2014–2015. For each concussion, athletic trainers entered data regarding symptom presentation, resolution time, and diagnostic/evaluation tools utilized. Academic year was the primary exposure in assessing each aim. Time trends were then assessed using linear regression or the Cochran-Armitage test for trends, depending on the outcome distribution.

- **Results**: The proportion of concussed athletes presenting with amnesia, loss of consciousness (LOC), and tinnitus significantly decreased from 2007–2008 through 2014–2015, while the proportion presenting with drowsiness, irritability, light sensitivity, and noise sensitivity increased significantly. The use of diagnostic radiography and magnetic resonance imaging was noted, but the data is incomplete in this excerpt.

### Screening for orthostatic intolerance in symptomatic children presenting for concussion care [^113V4AD5]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Following concussion, children often experience nonspecific symptoms that overlap with those of other common pediatric conditions, including orthostatic intolerance (OI). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate OI in youth presenting for clinical care for concussion and reporting symptoms frequently observed in OI. Eighty-two of 114 patients aged 10 to 22 years endorsed symptoms based on eight screening questions, and 24 of those 82 patients met criteria for OI based on an active standing test. No screening question generated clinically useful likelihood ratios for predicting OI. The prevalence of OI in this cohort is considerably higher than estimates in the general pediatric population, suggesting a link between concussion and OI. Future work is needed to evaluate the best method of testing for OI, the natural history of OI symptoms in youth with concussion, and the response to intervention in children with both concussion and OI.

### Recent advances in pediatric concussion and mild traumatic brain injury [^113so4BG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Concussions following a head injury among children continue to be a substantial public health concern. An increasing number of concussions are initially managed by primary care physicians. Despite the availability of ancillary tests such as computerized neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and blood biomarkers, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical diagnosis. Clinically, overlooking other injuries and comorbidities may lead to prolonged recovery for the patient. Addressing concussions through a multidisciplinary approach may help reduce recovery time for patients. Retirement from sport in the pediatric population remains a controversial issue lacking evidence-based studies.

### Natural history of concussion in sport: Markers of severity and implications for management [^111TBXtT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence-based clinical data are required for safe return to play after concussion in sport. The objective of this study was to describe the natural history of concussion in sport and identify clinical features associated with more severe concussive injury, using return-to-sport decisions as a surrogate measure of injury severity.

- **Study design**: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 3.

- **Methods**: Male elite senior, elite junior, and community-based Australian Rules football players had preseason baseline cognitive testing (Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Trail-Making Test-Part B, and CogSport computerized test battery). Players were recruited into the study following a concussive injury sustained while playing football. Concussed players were tested serially until all clinical features of their injury had resolved.

- **Results**: Of 1015 players, 88 concussions were observed in 78 players. Concussion-associated symptoms lasted an average of 48.6 hours (95% confidence interval, 39.5–57.7 hours) with delayed return to sport correlated with ≥ 4 symptoms, headache lasting ≥ 60 hours, or self-reported "fatigue/fogginess". Cognitive deficits using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Trail-Making Test-Part B recovered concomitantly with symptoms, but computerized test results recovered 2 to 3 days later and remained impaired in 35% of concussed players after symptom resolution.

- **Conclusion**: Delayed return to sport was associated with initially greater symptom load, prolonged headache, or subjective concentration deficits. Cognitive testing recovery.
