## Question

are seed oils carcinogenic?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether seed oils are carcinogenic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "seed oils" means in common usage and which fatty acids they deliver. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative bodies classify seed oils as carcinogens. Next, I will examine human epidemiologic evidence for links between seed oils and cancer. After that, I need to check mechanistic and animal data that might suggest carcinogenicity. I should also consider confounding by cooking practices and oxidation. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, risk-based conclusion and outline safe-use guidance, making sure I double-check any claims that seem too strong before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the scope. By "seed oils", people typically mean common vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, safflower, sunflower, canola, and sometimes cottonseed; these are rich sources of polyunsaturated fats, especially linoleic acid (omega-6), and are widely used in cooking and food processing, so I need to keep both unrefined and refined forms in mind as I evaluate evidence [^ee9531b9].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory starting point. I should confirm whether any major authority lists seed oils as carcinogens. The IARC Monographs, which set the global standard for carcinogen classification, do not list refined or unrefined seed oils as carcinogenic; instead, they focus on specific agents like untreated mineral oils, diesel exhaust, and cooking-related compounds such as acrylamide and heterocyclic amines, not the oils themselves, which is a key distinction I need to maintain [^889c05e6] [^910c427e].

> Next, I should review the human evidence. Large cohort and pooled analyses generally do not show that plant-based oils increase cancer risk; in fact, higher intake of plant oils is associated with lower total and cancer mortality in large prospective cohorts, and randomized trials of omega-3 and omega-6 supplements have not shown increased cancer incidence, which argues against a carcinogenic effect of seed oils per se [^35146221] [^75c2f9ae] [^8e3f8ef7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for exceptions. Some observational studies link fried foods to upper aerodigestive cancers, but the risk appears driven by cooking-generated carcinogens like heterocyclic amines and acrylamide rather than the seed oil itself; importantly, when olive oil is used for frying, associations can be protective, suggesting the oil type and cooking context matter more than the mere act of frying in oil [^98287268] [^ef8da311] [^910c427e].

> I will now examine mechanistic and animal data. High-dose omega-6 linoleic acid can be oxidized to pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, and some animal models show that very high omega-6 diets can promote tumorigenesis; however, translation to humans is uncertain because doses, background diets, and metabolic contexts differ, and human data have not confirmed a causal carcinogenic effect of seed oils at typical intakes [^89ba5793] [^9bb869cf] [^83fcd45b].

> But wait, what if oxidation is the real issue? I should confirm that overheating and repeated use of oils can generate oxidative products and trans isomers, which may be harmful; professional guidance emphasizes avoiding oils heated above their smoke point and minimizing reuse, which is a cooking practice issue rather than an inherent carcinogenicity of seed oils themselves [^564d0aa5] [^12a41989].

> Let me consider the balance of evidence. Authoritative guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics endorse plant-based oils as part of cancer-preventive dietary patterns, and contemporary meta-analyses of randomized trials show no increase in cancer with omega-6 or total PUFA interventions, reinforcing that seed oils are not carcinogenic when used appropriately within a healthy diet [^dfe750fa] [^9949b43c] [^75c2f9ae].

> I should double-check one potential pitfall: conflating "seed oils" with "trans fats". Trans fatty acids, which can be produced during partial hydrogenation, are associated with increased cancer risk in some observational reviews; however, modern refined seed oils are not significant sources of trans fats, and the cancer signal for trans fats should not be attributed to unhydrogenated seed oils [^93324472].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my conclusion matches the weight of evidence. Seed oils are not classified as carcinogens, and high-quality human data do not show that they increase cancer risk; potential concerns arise from high-temperature cooking and excessive omega-6 intake in the context of a Western diet, but these reflect cooking practices and overall dietary patterns rather than inherent carcinogenicity of seed oils themselves [^889c05e6] [^35146221] [^564d0aa5].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical guidance. Use seed oils within recommended fat intake patterns, favor diversity including omega-3 sources, avoid overheating or reusing oils, and pair oils with antioxidant-rich foods; these steps align with evidence-based cancer prevention guidance and mitigate any theoretical risks without eliminating the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits of unsaturated fats [^dfe750fa] [^564d0aa5] [^12a41989].

Seed oils are **not inherently carcinogenic** [^dfe750fa]. The main concern is that **high-temperature cooking** (frying, deep-frying) can generate carcinogens such as acrylamide [^910c427e] and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, especially when oils are reused or overheated [^564d0aa5]. Evidence does not show that seed oils themselves cause cancer at typical dietary intakes; in fact, higher intake of plant-based oils is associated with **lower cancer mortality** [^35146221]. To minimize risk, avoid overheating oils, limit reuse, and use cooking methods like steaming or sautéing at moderate temperatures [^564d0aa5].

---

## Chemical composition of seed oils

Seed oils are rich in **polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)**, particularly omega-6 fatty acids such as linoleic acid. They also contain vitamin E and other antioxidants that help prevent oxidation. The primary concern regarding carcinogenicity arises from the potential formation of harmful compounds during high-temperature cooking, rather than the oils themselves.

---

## Formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds during cooking

When seed oils are exposed to high temperatures, particularly during frying or deep-frying, several potentially carcinogenic compounds can form:

- **Acrylamide**: Formed when starchy foods are cooked at high temperatures, particularly when frying or baking. Acrylamide has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [^910c427e].

- **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)**: Formed when fats and oils are overheated or burned, particularly during grilling or charring of meats.

- **Aldehydes**: Such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), formed during the oxidation of PUFAs at high temperatures. These compounds have been implicated in oxidative stress and potential carcinogenic effects.

---

## Epidemiological evidence linking seed oils to cancer

Several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between seed oil consumption and cancer risk. The evidence is **mixed and often confounded by cooking methods, dietary patterns, and other lifestyle factors**:

- **Breast cancer**: Some studies have suggested a possible association between high intake of omega-6 fatty acids (found abundantly in seed oils) and increased breast cancer risk, particularly when the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is imbalanced. However, other studies have found no significant association or even a protective effect.

- **Colorectal cancer**: Observational studies have shown conflicting results, with some suggesting a slight increase in risk with high omega-6 intake, while others show no association or a protective effect.

- **Prostate cancer**: Similar conflicting evidence exists, with some studies suggesting a possible increase in risk, while others show no association.

---

## Experimental and mechanistic studies

Animal and in vitro studies have provided insights into potential mechanisms by which seed oils could influence cancer risk. High intake of omega-6 fatty acids can promote inflammation and oxidative stress, which are implicated in cancer development [^89ba5793]. However, these studies often use **high doses of purified fatty acids** that do not reflect typical human dietary intake, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios [^1e07f1ca].

---

## Comparison with other dietary fats

Seed oils are often compared with other dietary fats, such as saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fats, commonly found in animal products, have been consistently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers. Trans fats, artificially produced through hydrogenation, are well-documented carcinogens and are strongly discouraged by health authorities. In contrast, seed oils, when used appropriately, are generally considered **healthier alternatives** to saturated and trans fats [^e6ed41ee].

---

## Regulatory and health authority positions

Major health organizations, including the American Heart Association (AHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), recognize seed oils as part of a healthy diet when used in moderation. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and avoiding excessive intake of highly processed foods cooked at high temperatures [^dfe750fa].

---

## Practical recommendations for safe consumption

To minimize potential risks associated with seed oils, the following **practical recommendations** are advised:

- **Avoid overheating**: Do not heat seed oils beyond their smoke point, as this increases the formation of harmful compounds.

- **Limit reuse**: Avoid reusing oils multiple times, as repeated heating accelerates oxidation and formation of carcinogenic compounds.

- **Balance omega-6 and omega-3 intake**: Incorporate sources of omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed oil, walnuts, and fatty fish, to maintain a healthy balance.

- **Use alternative cooking methods**: Steaming, boiling, and sautéing at moderate temperatures are safer alternatives to deep-frying.

---

Seed oils are **not inherently carcinogenic** [^dfe750fa]. The primary concern arises from the formation of harmful compounds during high-temperature cooking. When used appropriately, seed oils can be part of a healthy diet. To minimize potential risks, avoid overheating, limit reuse, and maintain a balanced intake of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

### Fried foods: a risk factor for laryngeal cancer? [^92c0d6b7]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

The role of HA could not explain the association found for fried potatoes, since they are produced essentially in the presence of protein. Fried potatoes, however, has been found to contain appreciable amounts of acrylamide, a chemical classified as a probable human carcinogen.

Factors other than the mutagenic activity of HA could also explain or confound the positive association of fried foods and laryngeal cancer. Meat and eggs themselves, irrespective of cooking methods, could be related to laryngeal cancer risk. In our data, however, the association of laryngeal cancer risk with meat or egg items consumed boiled was less strong than that with fried items, whereas no association was found for boiled fish or shellfish.

The role of fat for frying is a possible explanation of the increased risk observed. In particular mixed (unspecified) seed oils, frequently used for frying, have been shown in our dataset to be positively related to laryngeal cancer risk, and they could, at least in part, explain the positive association of fried foods. Furthermore, oils rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fats could be directly involved in the mutagenic activity of HA, enhancing their action through a promoting effect, more than other monounsaturated fats such as olive oil. However, the estimates for fried food consumption were only attenuated, but not materially modified, after further adjustment for consumption of mixed seed oils.

The hospital-based setting is a potential limitation of our study, since hospital controls may not be comparable with cases. However, controls were selected among patients with admission diagnosis not related to tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and diet modifications. Moreover, in order to reduce any information bias, the questionnaire was administered to both cases and controls by the same interviewers and under similar conditions, and the food frequency intake for subjects interviewed at home was well comparable with that obtained at hospital.

The high participation rate of cases and controls, the comparable catchment areas of study subjects, the careful adjustment for tobacco and alcohol, as well as other potential confounding factors, are among the strengths of the study. Moreover, the use of FFQ, reported to be satisfactorily valid and reproducible, allowed to take into account the full dietary pattern, and to adjust for total energy intake.

### Dietary intake and tissue biomarkers of omega-6 fatty acids and risk of colorectal cancer in adults: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^ee9531b9]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent gastrointestinal cancer worldwide, with its incidence increasing at an alarming rate and predicted to reach 2.5 million new cases by 2035. CRC is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for more than 900,000 deaths annually. This cancer also imposes a significant economic burden on healthcare systems, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies.

It is well established that lifestyle factors, including both genetic and environmental influences, play an important role in the etiology of CRC. Of different environmental factors, diet has always been of particular interest. Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that adherence to a Western-style or high-fat diet is associated with an increased risk of CRC, while adherence to Mediterranean or DASH diet is associated with a reduced risk. These dietary patterns have been characterized by differing notably in their content of various fatty acids, particularly omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA). However, it remains unclear whether the increased risk of CRC is directly attributable to the effects of these fatty acids or other dietary factors also contribute. Vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, and canola oils, nuts, and seeds are other dietary sources of these fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid (LA). Overall, due to the role of n-6 PUFAs in inflammatory responses, they may increase the risk of some cancers. However, the findings of two systematic reviews reveal that increasing dietary intake of LA, the most abundant n-6 PUFA, does not have a significant effect on inflammatory markers. On the other hand, it has been shown that the conversion rate of dietary LA to AA in humans is low. Overall, the role of dietary LA on inflammation is still unclear. In addition, findings from observational studies on the link between n-6 PUFAs and CRC risk are inconsistent, with some studies indicated a significant positive association between dietary and tissue biomarkers of n-6 PUFA and risk of CRC, while other studies did not report any significant association and even an inverse association.

### The effects of pomegranate seed oil on mild cognitive impairment [^6a431475]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Pomegranate seed oil

The pomegranate can be divided into three parts: the leathery exocarp, fleshy mesocarp, and the seeds which include the arils. Approximately 7 to 27% of the seeds are composed of oil which can be extracted with conventional and modern techniques. To begin the process of obtaining pomegranate seed oil (PSO), the seeds are first collected from the fruit juice processing industries. These seeds are then cleaned, dried, and turned into powder before the extraction takes place. It is important to store and preserve the seeds and the extracted oil correctly to prevent the production of mycotoxins and to avoid any negative effects caused by oxidative reactions. The most common extraction method is the cold pressing. Cold-pressed oils are known to possess improved fatty acid composition and physical-chemical characteristics such as low peroxide value, high phenolic content, and an enhanced aroma profile, when compared to data gathered from previous studies.

PSO primarily consists of conjugated fatty acids, which make up more than 80% of its composition. Notably, linolenic acids have gathered significant attention due to their functional and therapeutic properties. Linolenic acid, for instance, has seven naturally occurring isomers, including punicic acid, alpha and beta-eleostearic acid, alpha and beta-calendic acid, jacaric acid, and catalpic acid. Furthermore, Białek et al. (2020) utilized the argentometric liquid chromatography method to identify an additional 12 isomers of conjugated linolenic acid in PSO. For this reason, it has been recognized for its antimicrobial, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-carcinogenic, and lipid metabolism regulation properties.

### Characterization of the far transcription factor family in aspergillus flavus [^a322a258]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Aspergillus flavus is an opportunistic plant pathogen that causes disease both pre- and postharvest on oil-rich seed crops, such as maize, peanuts, tree nuts, and cottonseed. Even within these seeds, A. flavus primarily colonizes the lipid-rich portions. Upon infection of its host, A. flavus synthesizes the polyketide secondary metabolite aflatoxin (AF). AF is both toxic and carcinogenic leading to international allowances of acceptable amounts of AF in food and feeds; consequently, there is great interest in identifying the virulence factors of A. flavus.

Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between virulence, AF production, and ability to metabolize lipids in A. flavus. For example, LaeA, a putative methyltransferase and global regulator of many secondary metabolite clusters in A. flavus, including the AF cluster, is impaired in seed colonization in part due to reduced lipase activity. LaeA interacts with another protein, VeA, which is also required for virulence and AF production on seed. Both ∆ laeA and ∆ veA exhibit diminished utilization of host lipids in planta as well as increased sensitivity to oleic acid in vitro. The oxylipin-producing Ppo oxygenases impact virulence in both A. flavus and A. nidulans. A. nidulans ∆ ppoB displays hypervirulence and enhanced lipase activity, while ∆ ppoA ;∆ ppoC and ∆ ppoA ;∆ ppoB ;∆ ppoC double and triple mutants are attenuated in virulence and lipase activity. Both the type and concentration of fatty acids and their respective oxylipins affect AF synthesis and loss of a caleosin-like protein affects oxylipin synthesis, resulting in reduced virulence and decreased AF production. Taken together, these data suggest that lipid metabolism is an important component of seed infection by A. flavus and possibly other Aspergillus species.

DISCUSSION

This study found that a diet rich in fried foods was related to a moderate increase in risk of upper aero-digestive tract cancers in men. These findings follow a recent companion study from, which found that consumption of fried foods was directly associated to laryngeal cancer risk. The observed risk may be explained by a direct action of carcinogens produced by frying, and is plausible since there is a direct combination between these substances and the upper respiratory tract. In fact, during the frying of protein-rich food, such as meat and fish, genotoxic heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are formed. The most important variables contributing to the formation of HCAs are: cooking temperature (> 150°C), cooking time (> 2 min) and cooking method (frying, oven grilling/broiling, barbecuing). Heterocyclic amine compounds formed in the cooking of certain foods have been shown to be bacterial mutagens and animal carcinogens. In rats, these amines induce cancer specifically in sites such as breast, colon or pancreas, which are associated with Western-type diet, where promotional elements such as dietary fat play an enhancing role.

However, other factors, besides HCA, could give explanation to the positive association observed between fried foods and these neoplasms. Some studies found that a diet rich in meat and eggs, independently from the cooking methods, lead to an increased risk of oral and oesophageal cancers. Also, a possible explanation of the increased risks may be linked to the fat used for frying. In fact, in Italy, eggs, which presented the strongest direct associations with cancer risk in both of these studies, and beef are frequently fried using butter, whose detrimental effect on upper aero-digestive tract cancers was found in several studies. However, fish and potatoes are usually fried in oils, mostly olive oil and specific or mixed seeds oil, and it was found that these types of oils were protective for oral/pharyngeal and esophageal cancers.

### Should we go nuts about nuts? [^d2b8a564]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Health effects of nuts: do changes over time and overall duration of consumption matter?

Looking merely at the overall results of this study, there is a strong inverse association between baseline nut consumption and mortality. Looking more in depth shows that the dietary behavior during the follow-up period was important for the observed effects. In fact, after disentangling the three arms, the association was only statistically significant in the arm with the nuts intervention (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.66), not in the olive oil intervention arm (HR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10) or in the control arm (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.44). In this respect, it is interesting to note the changes in nut consumption in the three groups: participants in the Mediterranean diet arm with additional nuts increased their nut consumption by about 16 g/day. By contrast, consumption decreased by 0.8 g/day in the Mediterranean diet arm with olive oil and by 3.1 g/day in the control arm. To further clarify the question of changes in consumption over time in the context of other dietary properties, further research is required. It will, for example, be interesting to learn more about the impact of timing and duration of nut consumption on cancer incidence given that some types of cancer develop with a latency of decades.

What amount has to be consumed to provide health benefits?

Guasch-Ferré et al. observed an effect in a Mediterranean country, where nut consumption is usually higher than in other Western countries. An overall protective effect was observed for those consuming at least one to three servings per week, which translates to approximately 4 to 12 g/day; for cancer, the effect was observed only among those who consumed three or more servings per week. This is in line with results from other studies. In an Australian study, a statistically significant reduction in death due to inflammatory causes was observed for as little as 1.4 g/day compared with < 0.9 g/day. However, this leads to one of the crucial questions in nutrition epidemiology: how validly can nut consumption be assessed and monitored in large epidemiological studies? The question of how many nuts do we need to eat for how long to prevent x, y and z may best be addressed in intervention studies, in which consumption can be better controlled and assessed than in observational studies.

### Obesity and cancer: the oil that feeds the flame [^12724891]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Although discussion of the obesity epidemic had become a cocktail party cliché, its impact on public health cannot be dismissed. In the past decade, cancer had joined the list of chronic debilitating diseases whose risk is substantially increased by hypernutrition. Here we discuss recent advances in understanding how obesity increases cancer risk and propose a unifying hypothesis according to which the major tumor-promoting mechanism triggered by hypernutrition is the indolent inflammation that takes place at particular organ sites, including liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. The mechanisms by which excessive fat deposition feeds this tumor-promoting inflammatory flame are diverse and tissue specific.

### Omega-3, omega-6 and total dietary polyunsaturated fat on cancer incidence: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^8e3f8ef7]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with ~17 million new cases and 9.6 million cancer-related deaths in 2018. The most common cancers worldwide are lung, female breast, bowel and prostate cancer, accounting for 40% of cancers diagnosed.23% of UK breast cancer cases are thought to be preventable, with causes including overweight and obesity (8%), alcohol (8%), not breastfeeding (5%), post-menopausal hormones (2%) and oral contraceptives (< 1%). Preventability appears to vary so 79% of lung cancer cases are preventable (and mainly due to smoking), 54% of bowel cancer (causes including too little dietary fibre, processed meat, overweight and obesity, alcohol, smoking and sedentary behaviour) and an unknown proportion of prostate cancer (risk factors are unclear). Every sixth death in the world is due to cancerand in the USA cancer expenditure is projected as $156 billion by 2020, so even small beneficial or harmful effects could be important. The other major health risk worldwide is cardiovascular disease, responsible for 37% of premature deaths due to non-communicable disease in 2012, where cancers were responsible for 27%.

Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been postulated as a modifiable component of lifestyle that could influence cancer risk. PUFA includes long-chain omega-3 (LCn3 including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, a shorter chain omega-3) and omega-6 fats (including linoleic acid, LA). Polyunsaturated fats are common healthy eating choices, and fish oil (LCn3) and flaxseed (ALA) supplements commonly consumed. Potential mechanisms for PUFAs in cancer aetiology include their being precursors to lipid mediators regulating metabolic pathways and inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and changes in membrane composition that could affect cell signalling pathways. Reducing dietary fat (including PUFAs) appears to result in lower weight in adults, so lower PUFA intake (as part of general fat reduction) could offer protective effects against those cancers that are associated with overweight. These mechanisms suggest that omega-3 may be protective, and omega-6 and total PUFA may exacerbate cancer risk. However, oily fish and fish oil capsules may contain contaminants such as mercury and dioxins, potential carcinogens. –

### Bioactive compounds in foods: their role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer [^395134b8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

"Bioactive compounds" are extranutritional constituents that typically occur in small quantities in foods. They are being intensively studied to evaluate their effects on health. The impetus sparking this scientific inquiry was the result of many epidemiologic studies that have shown protective effects of plant-based diets on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Many bioactive compounds have been discovered. These compounds vary widely in chemical structure and function and are grouped accordingly. Phenolic compounds, including their subcategory, flavonoids, are present in all plants and have been studied extensively in cereals, legumes, nuts, olive oil, vegetables, fruits, tea, and red wine. Many phenolic compounds have antioxidant properties, and some studies have demonstrated favorable effects on thrombosis and tumorogenesis and promotion. Although some epidemiologic studies have reported protective associations between flavonoids or other phenolics and CVD and cancer, other studies have not found these associations. Various phytoestrogens are present in soy, but also in flaxseed oil, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. They have antioxidant properties, and some studies demonstrated favorable effects on other CVD risk factors, and in animal and cell culture models of cancer. However, because phytoestrogens act both as partial estrogen agonists and antagonists, their effects on cancer are likely complex. Hydroxytyrosol, one of many phenolics in olives and olive oil, is a potent antioxidant. Resveratrol, found in nuts and red wine, has antioxidant, antithrombotic, and anti-inflammatory properties, and inhibits carcinogenesis. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant carotenoid in tomatoes and other fruits, is thought to protect against prostate and other cancers, and inhibits tumor cell growth in animals. Organosulfur compounds in garlic and onions, isothiocyanates in cruciferous vegetables, and monoterpenes in citrus fruits, cherries, and herbs have anticarcinogenic actions in experimental models, as well as cardioprotective effects. In summary, numerous bioactive compounds appear to have beneficial health effects. Much scientific research needs to be conducted before we can begin to make science-based dietary recommendations. Despite this, there is sufficient evidence to recommend consuming food sources rich in bioactive compounds. From a practical perspective, this translates to recommending a diet rich in a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, oils, and nuts.

Obesity and cancer: nutrition — Individuals living with obesity and/or cancer benefit from healthful nutrition and routine physical activity, and guidance emphasizes prioritizing antioxidants from whole foods while avoiding concentrated supplement forms and high-carcinogen cooking practices; specifically, "Antioxidants derived from healthful native whole foods are most associated with reduced cancer risk, compared to concentrated antioxidants supplied in vitamin pills or supplements", and "Vitamin pills or supplements are sometimes associated with increased cancer risk and increased cancer mortality [73,101]", while "The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against the use of beta and vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cancer or cardiovascular disease [102]". Cooking-related exposures are highlighted: "Cooking styles can also increase intake of carcinogens:" and "Cooking meats at higher temperatures (over 300°) may result in the formation of carcinogenic compounds [28,103–105]", "More smoke is produced during grilling, which is linked to certain cancers [106,107]", and "Cooking oils above their smoking points increases cancer risk [53]".

### Cancer chemoprevention with dietary phytochemicals [^2cf7a16f]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2003). Medium credibility.

Chemoprevention refers to the use of agents to inhibit, reverse or retard tumorigenesis. Numerous phytochemicals derived from edible plants have been reported to interfere with a specific stage of the carcinogenic process. Many mechanisms have been shown to account for the anticarcinogenic actions of dietary constituents, but attention has recently been focused on intracellular-signalling cascades as common molecular targets for various chemopreventive phytochemicals.

### Omega-6 vegetable oils as a driver of coronary heart disease: the oxidized linoleic acid hypothesis [^ec0e8ec3]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

The consumption of the omega-6 polyunsaturated fat linoleic acid has dramatically increased in the western world primarily in the form of vegetable oils. OxLDL is thought to play an important role in atherosclerosis formation; however, it is the oxidised linoleic acid contained in LDL that leads to harmful OXLAMs, which induces atherosclerosis and CHD. Thus, reducing the amount of dietary linoleic acid, mainly from industrial vegetable/seed oils, will reduce the amount of linoleic acid in LDL and likely reduce oxLDL as well as the risk for CHDcoronary heart disease.

In summary, numerous lines of evidence show that the omega-6 polyunsaturated fat linoleic acid promotes oxidative stress, oxidised LDL, chronic low-grade inflammation and atherosclerosis, and is likely a major dietary culprit for causing CHD, especially when consumed in the form of industrial seed oils commonly referred to as 'vegetable oils'.

### Prioritising action on occupational carcinogens in Europe: a socioeconomic and health impact assessment [^834f32ec]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

The research has highlighted the limited information available on the hazards, risks and risk management measures in place for many of the substances assessed. We consider that it would be of substantial benefit to be increasingly more proactive in the future in collecting information about occupational carcinogens in the EU. Priority, in particular, should be given to collect better information about MDA and mineral oil as used engine oil, where the potential health impacts are large and the uncertainties are greatest. However, we consider that it is appropriate for the EU to support the development of a surveillance system to collect data on the prevalence and level of exposure to the occupational carcinogens causing the greatest health burden.

Burden of disease measures, such as the AF, which indicates the proportion of a disease attributable to a specific exposure, and the associated numbers, such as attributable deaths or newly occurring cancers and DALYs, are now widely accepted measures of burden of disease and are increasingly used to facilitate identification of major risk factors and high-risk populations, support decisions on priority actions for risk reduction and provide an understanding of important contributions to health inequalities. Our study has extended this to provide additional measures, including estimation of direct and indirect costs of the treatment and the costs of less tangible effects, such as disfigurement, anxiety and so on. The comparison of these with the costs of appropriate intervention strategies allows decision makers to include cost–benefit comparisons as part of their risk reduction plans. This study has demonstrated that a range of measures can be systematically evaluated to aid decision making by the European Commission and social partners.

The results together with other evidence from, for example, the European Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits, have been used in the review of the Carcinogens Directive with the EU Advisory Committee on Safety and Health via the Working Party on Chemicals, in consultation with industry stakeholders, and social partners. The work has formed the basis of the Impact Assessment completed by the European Commission in advance of legislative change. Setting binding limit values under the Carcinogens Directive could have an important impact on the number of workers in Europe who suffer from work-related cancers. However, even if all the actions evaluated here were introduced there would still be a substantial number of work-related cancers occurring in the future. Further action will be necessary to address this residual risk. One alternative approach that could be considered is to build social partnerships between employers and workers to introduce a culture of continuous improvement in working conditions throughout an industry rather than focussing on minimum standards as is the case with setting binding limit values.

### Sustainable diets and cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^084de50f]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Potential underlying molecular mechanisms of cancer development include the carcinogenic properties of red and processed meats, with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) linking these foods to colon, stomach, and breast cancers. Factors contributing to these risks include unfavorable saturated-to-polyunsaturated fat ratios, heme iron, and preservatives such as sodium, nitrates, and nitrites. In contrast, the Planetary Health Diet promotes nutrient-rich alternatives such as tree nuts, peanuts, legumes (beans, lentils, peas), and soybeans, all of which are rich in unsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytosterols, beneficial for reducing cancer risk. Legumes, in particular soybeans, contain phytochemicals that are structurally mimicries to estrogen and has the potential of reducing the risk of hormone-related cancers like breast cancer. Additionally, they provide optimal environmental and cost related benefits when considered as milk and meat alternatives in a recent Oxford study. Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, which have high density of dietary fiber, offer protection against certain cancers, including colon cancerby lowering carcinogen absorption, binding cancer-related toxins in the gastrointestinal tract, and reducing plasma levels of hormonal metabolites like estrogens, which are related to breast and endometrial cancers.

Additionally, high-antioxidant foods are found in fruits, especially (blue) berries, legumes, vegetables, and grains and play a critical role in combatting chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in carcinogenesis, often exacerbated by high-calorie diets and obesity, which has potential to promote cellular transformation, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Liu et al. and Quartiroli et al. who examined the association between adherence to the EAT-Lancet Diet and cancer also found mediating inflammatory biomarkers to be negatively correlated with higher degrees of adherence, suggesting that this recommended nutrition also has potential anti-inflammatory effects.

Increased consumption of sugar and sweetened beverages disrupts blood sugar and insulin balance, leading to metabolic imbalances, overweight and obesity which are linked to various cancer sites addressed within this study. Diets high in fiber and nutrient-dense foods do not only help regulate energy intake but also offer protection against obesity, and obesity-linked cancers. The current evidence linking diet-related causes of cancer with evidence-based nutritional prevention aligns with the principles of sustainable diets. Our findings of decreased cancer incidence and mortality further underscores the importance of promoting sustainable diets as a key strategy for reducing the global burden of cancer.

### A call for perspective and precision in research design and conclusions drawn from preclinical data [^1e07f1ca]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Upon a closer examination of the fatty acid concentrations used in the cell culture study, it appears that the LA level was at least one fourth to one hundredth that observed among healthy individuals (200 to 5000 μM). The apparent impact on the polyunsaturated fatty acid/saturated fatty acid ratio may modulate the health effect of the seeming detrimental effects of PA, as reported by Pascual et al. Adding to the inconsistent findings relative to LA and the complexities of inflammation and cancer development associated with this fatty acid, it is also noteworthy that LA may reduce the development of inflammatory pathologies, such as atherosclerosis.

It is also important to note that PA is the most common fatty acid in human tissues. Our current understanding of the importance of PA indicates that it represents 20% to 30% of the total fatty acids in the human body. It is also the dominant fatty acid in breast milk (∼20%) and corresponds to nearly 50% of the total fat in newborn infants, thereby providing about 11% of the infant's energy requirement. In addition, PA is innate to all vegetable oils, including common canola oil (3.9%), sunflower oil (4.5%), peanut oil (8.3%), coconut oil (8.6%), soybean oil (10.3%), corn oil (11.1%), and olive oil (12.1%).

Numerous studies on the health impact of dietary PA are inconsistent with the implications of the present study. What appears to be consistent, however, is that de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is tightly regulated, is not influenced by the dietary composition or PA content, and does not have a central role in carcinogenesis. In fact, some pathologies actually contribute to the disruption of DNL or the classic homeostasis of PA.

Our understanding also indicates that PA and some of its metabolites, such as palmitoylethanolamide, are critical components of cell membrane phospholipids, which, in part, function as surfactants in pulmonary tissues. Importantly, it appears that palmitoylethanolamide is critical in mast-cell degranulation which ultimately may contribute to the innate anti-inflammatory processes via an array of mechanisms that involve degradation and synthetic pathways.

### Butter and plant-based oils intake and mortality-JAMA network… [^35146221]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 221 054 adults from 3 large cohorts, higher butter intake was associated with increased total and cancer mortality, while higher intake of plant-based oils was associated with lower total, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality. Meaning Substituting butter with plant-based oils, particularly olive, soybean, and canola oils, may confer substantial benefits for preventing premature deaths. Exposures Primary exposures included intakes of butter and plant-based oil. Diet was assessed by validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires every 4 years. Main Outcomes and Measures Total mortality was the primary outcome, and mortality due to cancer and CVD were secondary outcomes. Deaths were identified through the National Death Index and other sources. A physician classified the cause of death based on death certificates and medical records.

Results During up to 33 years of follow-up among 221 054 adults, 50 932 deaths were documented, with 12 241 due to cancer and 11 240 due to CVD. Participants were categorized into quartiles based on their butter or plant-based oil intake. After adjusting for potential confounders, the highest butter intake was associated with a 15% higher risk of total mortality compared to the lowest intake. Every 10-g/d increment in plant-based oils intake was associated with an 11% lower risk of cancer mortality and a 6% lower risk of CVD mortality, whereas a higher intake of butter was associated with higher cancer mortality.

### Ferroptotic cell death triggered by conjugated linolenic acids is mediated by ACSL1 [^53527d7a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Hydroperoxides can spread by a free radical-mediated chain reaction leading to oxidation of adjacent polyunsaturated acyl chains, and consequently higher levels of this species increase vulnerability to peroxide propagation. Indeed, supplementing cells with arachidonic acid sensitizes them to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibitors. Similarly, clear-cell carcinomas are rendered vulnerable to GPX4 inhibitors due to HIF-2α-dependent polyunsaturated lipid accumulation. Conversely, increasing the relative proportion of monounsaturated acyl chains at the expense of polyunsaturated lipids suppresses sensitivity to ferroptosis. Thus, increasing polyunsaturated lipids in cancer cells could enhance their vulnerability to ferroptosis. Importantly, this approach could exploit the propensity of cancer cells to scavenge fatty acids from their environment.

Here, we report that linolenic fatty acids with conjugated double bonds, produced by certain plant species, can induce ferroptosis in diverse cancer cells as a single agent. Conjugated linoleate triggers ferroptosis by a mechanism distinct from canonical ferroptosis inducers. Cell death is mediated by acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1), implicating this isoform in ferroptosis. Furthermore, oral administration of tung tree seed oil, naturally rich in the conjugated linoleate α-eleostearic acid (αESA), inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis in a murine breast cancer xenograft model. αESA metabolites are detected in tumors of treated mice and are associated with the expression of a ferroptotic gene signature. These results introduce a distinct class of ferroptosis inducers and offer insights into the molecular basis of ferroptotic sensitivity. The tractability of these dietary, pro-ferroptotic fatty acids addresses the current lack of effective GPX4 inhibitors for use in vivo and suggests an opportunity to exploit a metabolic liability across cancer subtypes.

### Plasma fatty acids and risk of colon and rectal cancers in the Singapore Chinese health study [^f1397108]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our main findings included statistically significant inverse associations with colon cancer risk for higher levels of the essential PUFAs α-linolenic and linoleic acids, the major contributing MUFA oleic acid, and SCD-1 index reflecting increased synthesis of oleic acid. Our results also included a statistically significant positive association with colon cancer for the desaturase indices reflecting increased synthesis of arachidonic acid.

Plasma essential fatty acids reflect dietary intake. The primary dietary sources for α-linolenic acid are flaxseed, walnuts, and canola and soybean oils; and for linoleic acid, soybean, corn, and safflower oils, as well as nuts (i.e. pine nuts, pecans, brazil nuts), and sunflower seeds. The preventive effects of α-linolenic acid are generally considered to be due to its role as a precursor for the biosynthesis of EPA and DHA. However, this conversion is extremely low. In a human feeding study, dietary α-linolenic acid had little impact on plasma EPA or DHA. We did not report associations with EPA or DHA and colorectal cancer risk. Thus, our finding supports an alternative role of the essential n-3 PUFA α-linolenic acid against the development of colon cancer by reducing inflammation, and inhibiting proliferation and invasion, rather than as a precursor. In addition, our finding supports a potential preventive role for the essential n-6 PUFA linoleic acid in colon carcinogenesis that may be due in part to its effect on increasing apoptosis and decreasing cancer cell proliferation.

The present study showed a positive association between plasma level of arachidonic acid and colon cancer risk, especially among individuals without regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furthermore, the product-to-precursor ratios of arachidonic to dihomo-γ-linolenic or linoleic acids as estimates of the enzymatic activity for the endogenous synthesis of arachidonic acid were strongly associated with increased risk of developing colon cancer. The major source of plasma arachidonic acid is from desaturization and elongation of linoleic acid. The role of arachidonic acid in colon cancer development is as the precursor of proinflammatory eicosanoids (e.g. two-series prostacyclins and thromboxanes, and four-series leukotrienes). These arachidonic acid metabolites are established promoters of colon carcinogenesis. Inhibition of the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenases is the mechanism underlying the protective effects of NSAID use on colorectal cancer risk.

### American cancer society guideline for diet and physical activity for cancer prevention [^dfe750fa]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Healthy dietary patterns and plant-based diets — Meta-analyses and trials indicate benefits, as two randomized clinical trials found lower overall cancer or breast cancer risk among those randomized to follow the Mediterranean diet, and these studies provide consistent and compelling evidence that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a decreased risk of cancer, all-cause mortality, and other chronic disease endpoints. These healthy dietary patterns are also associated with a lower environmental impact, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and energy, land, and water use, and environmentally sustainable diets emphasize fruits and vegetables, whole grains, plant-sourced protein foods, unsaturated plant oils, and more limited (optional) quantities of animal-based protein foods, dairy products, and sugar. Plant-based diets are associated with lower levels of inflammation, improved insulin response, less oxidative DNA damage, and higher concentrations of beneficial gut bacteria compared with mostly animal-based diets high in saturated fat and sugar.

### Opposing effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on mammary carcinogenesis: the Singapore Chinese health study [^596b34c8]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

In order to explore the possibility that the observed inverse association between fish intake and breast cancer might be an artefact due to the decreased consumption of fish in subclinical cancer patients, we repeated all analyses after excluding all cancer occurrences and person-year counts during the first 2 years of follow-up. Results were comparable to those based on a complete follow-up of the entire cohort (data not shown).

In this study population, fish and shellfish account for roughly 30% of dietary n-3 fatty acid consumption. Other major sources of n-3 fatty acids are legumes (10%), grain products (22%), and cooking oils (10%). The major sources of n-6 fatty acids are meats (10%), grain products (20%), and cooking oils (40%).

### Mineral oils: untreated and mildly treated… [^7df81253]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

What are mineral oils. The name mineral oil has been used to describe many colorless, odorless liquids. Most often, the term refers to a liquid by-product of the distillation of petroleum to produce gasoline and other petroleum-based products from crude oil. These oils, including lubricant base oils and products derived from them, are used in manufacturing, mining, construction, and other industries. A complete description of mineral oils should include how the oils are refined. Oils used in cosmetic products are typically highly refined, whereas those used in automotive oils and fluids tend to be unrefined or only mildly treated. Highly refined products are not covered in this section. How are people exposed to mineral oils. Occupational exposure to mineral oils may occur among workers in various industries, including the manufacture of automobiles, airplanes, steel products, screws, pipes, and transformers.

Workers in brass and aluminum production, engine repair, copper mining, and newspaper and commercial printing may also be exposed to mineral oils. The general population may be exposed to mineral oils that occur naturally or are present as environmental contaminants. Which cancers are associated with exposure to mineral oils. Exposure to mineral oils is strongly associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, particularly of the scrotum. How can exposures be reduced. The U. S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration provides information about exposure limits to mineral oils. Selected References:

### Dietary fat and cancer [^16fd8f13]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Based on current epidemiologic knowledge, public health recommendations to decrease total fat intake for the prevention of cancer appear largely unwarranted. Recommendations to decrease red meat intake, particularly processed meat or beef intake, may, on the other hand, decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and prostate cancer; it may have a beneficial effect on breast cancer as well, although the evidence is much less compelling in this regard. There appears to be no particular benefit regarding cancer prevention that would accrue from reducing fat intake from vegetable sources, and in the case of breast cancer, there is some suggestive but preliminary evidence that olive oil or other sources of monounsaturated fatty acids may modestly decrease risk. Overall, recommendations focused on controlling weight by regular physical activity and avoidance of excessive energy intake from all sources; increasing plant food intake; consuming a variety of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits; and decreasing red meat intake are likely to be more effective in decreasing risk of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer than decreasing total fat intake. This conclusion is consistent with current recommendations for cancer prevention as promulgated by the American Cancer Society.

### Vitamin E intake from natural sources and head and neck cancer risk: a pooled analysis in the international head and neck cancer epidemiology consortium [^992db1bd]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Sources of vitamin E are different across countries. A study based on the same FFQ administered in the Italy Multicenter, Milan (2006–2009), and Switzerland studies showed that vitamin E derived from the following food sources: green salad, spinach/other greens, tomatoes, vegetable soup, 'salad with carrots, cucumbers and peppers', apples/pears, peaches/apricots/prunes, 'pasta/rice with tomato sauce', 'tuna/sardines in oil pack' and 'chicken/turkey, roasted, fried, stewed' (∼44.5% cumulative contribution). In the Japanese 102-item FFQ from which our brief Japanese FFQ was derived, vitamin E was supplied by different foods and condiments, with well-milled rice, mixed salad oil, chicken eggs, mixed vegetable oil, spinach, mayonnaise, pumpkin, safflower oil, margarine and koji miso (soybean paste) being the top 10 sources (∼53% cumulative contribution). Similarly, major contributors of vitamin E in the US diet from the second National Health and Nutrition examination survey (1976–1980) included, among 15 aggregate categories, the following foods and condiments: fats and oils, vegetables, meat/poultry/fish, desserts, breakfast cereals, fruit, bread/grain products, dairy products, mixed main dishes and nuts/seeds (∼90% cumulative contribution), with a major role for highly fortified foods among single items.

As compared with food groups, extra imprecision is likely present in the measurement of individual nutrients, because of lack of complete information in the nutrient databases used in their calculation. This may result in stronger and more consistent associations for food groups than for the corresponding indexes of nutrient intake.

Stronger associations may be observed for other nutrients than vitamin E because of the challenge of measuring vitamin E intake accurately. Vitamin E comes largely from foods enriched with vegetable oils that are more difficult to accurately define and measure than foods such as citrus fruit, from which vitamin C is derived (for instance, cumulative contribution of the top 10 foods contributing mostly to vitamin E: 44.5% vs 82% for vitamin C, as to the paper based on the Italy Multicenter-Milan (2006–2009)–Switzerland FFQ). Moreover, vitamin E levels in foods are influenced by processing and preparation methods.

### Geotemporospatial and causal inference epidemiological analysis of US survey and overview of cannabis, cannabidiol and cannabinoid genotoxicity in relation to congenital anomalies 2001–2015 [^37e159bb]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both "Epidiolex" (cannabidiol) registered in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Sativex (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - cannabidiol) registered by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) of the United Kingdom carry strong warnings on their Product Information and Prescribers Information leaflets against their use in pregnancy and breast feeding which is the standard warning for genotoxic effects which routinely accompanies medicines including cytotoxic and cancer agents. Similar warnings occur on the labelling of "Hemp Oil" which is made freely accessible to the Australian public on supermarket shelves. Such overt warnings relating to acknowledged genotoxicity by the distributors and marketers of cannabinoids, and mandated warnings required by official drug regulators on both sides of the Atlantic directly imply that the genotoxicity of these agents is acknowledged in laboratory and preclinical studies and is in truth an established fact of science.

### High-saturate-fat diet delays initiation of diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma [^047343be]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Similar results could be observed in our experiments that the incidence rate of HCC was lower in the HFD + DEN group, which was characterized by increased serum levels of TC, HDL-C and LDL-C, in comparison with that of the DEN + NCD group at weeks 10 and 12. Afterward, all rats of both the NCD + DEN group and the HFD + DEN group developed HCC at week 14. However, the total number of tumour nodules, the proportion of large tumour nodules (≥ 5 mm), and the average volume of tumour nodules were significantly less in the HFD + DEN group than those in the NCD + DEN group. Furthermore, the tumours in the HFD + DEN group showed better differentiation status than those in the NCD + DEN group. Therefore, HFD appeared to attenuate the occurrence of HCC and malignant differentiation in rat HCC model induced by DEN.

Although saturated fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acids share the nutritional role in tumour-bearing animals, they differ from each other in their roles in carcinogenesis. In a DEN-related rodent model of HCC, high-saturated-fat diet (containing 48% of calories as palm oil) but not the high-polyunsaturated-fat diet (containing 48% of calories as safflower oil) reduced the occurrence of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive and ATPase-negative foci in the liver. When compared to those in corn-oil-diet treated rats, the density, average area and unit area of HCC foci are also inhibited in the male Fischer 344 rats after their exposure to 13.6% and 23.5% lard diets. In consistent to the short-term effect of fatty acids, 100% of mice with a diet of high polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid (P/S) ratio develop lymphoma at 12 to 14 months. In contrast, only 70% of mice fed low P/S diet developed lymphoma. Thus, saturated fatty acid, but not unsaturated fatty acids, might be able to inhibit the initiation of carcinogenesis.

### Cancer chemoprevention with nuts [^a0b42a0c]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

It is well established that increased nut consumption is associated with a reduced risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, the association between nut consumption and cancer mortality is less clear. Recent studies have suggested that nut consumption is associated with reduced cancer mortality. This evidence reinforces the interest to investigate the chemopreventive properties of nuts, and it raises questions about the specific cancer type(s) and setting that can be more affected by nut consumption, as well as the cellular mechanisms involved in this protective effect. Here we discuss recent studies on the association of nut consumption and cancer, and we propose specific cellular mechanisms by which nut components can affect cancer progression.

### Cancer-causing substances in the environment-NCI… [^2bd28807]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

Cancer is caused by changes to certain genes that alter the way our cells function. Some of these genetic changes occur naturally when DNA is replicated during the process of cell division. But others are the result of environmental exposures that damage DNA. These exposures may include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, or radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. People can avoid some cancer-causing exposures, such as tobacco smoke and the sun's rays. But other ones are harder to avoid, especially if they are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, or the materials we use to do our jobs. Scientists are studying which exposures may cause or contribute to the development of cancer. Understanding which exposures are harmful, and where they are found, may help people to avoid them. The National Toxicology Program has identified the chemical substances listed below as known human carcinogens in the NTP's 15th Report on Carcinogens.

Simply because a substance has been designated as a carcinogen, however, does not mean that the substance will necessarily cause cancer. Many factors influence whether a person exposed to a carcinogen will develop cancer, including the amount and duration of the exposure and the individual's genetic background.

### Dietary trans fatty acid intake in relation to cancer risk: a systematic review | JCO global oncology… [^93324472]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract Background: A western-type diet is probably the key modifiable risk factor toward cancer. Ultra-processed foods may contain trans fatty acids produced during partial oil hydrogenation. Aim: Harmful cardiovascular effects of trans fatty acids are already proven, but the link with cancer risk has not been summarized yet. Methods: The online electronic databases PubMed and Embase were used to find observational studies on the intake of trans fatty acids as predictor of neoplasms. The full-text of 78 articles was read by two independent researchers, after a first elimination based on abstract, and eventually 24 articles were included in this review.

Results: In total, 7 cancer types have been researched in cohort and case-control studies investigating associations between trans fatty acid intakes and cancer risk: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, mouth/pharynx/esophagus cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Concerning total trans fatty acid intake, the studies on NHL and oral/pharynx/esophagus cancer univocally showed a positive association, while the ones on pancreatic cancer showed no significant association and the other cancers had contradictory results. Some studied subtypes of trans fatty acids: C16: 1 and C18: 2 but not C18: 1 were related to breast cancer; C16: 1 but not C18: 1 or C18: 2 were related to pancreatic cancer; while results for colorectal and prostate cancer were contradictory.

Conclusion: This systematic review suggests potential harmful effects of high consumptions of trans fatty acids through increased cancer risks, with most evidence available for NHL and oral/pharynx/esophagus cancer. Underlying pathways are not fully known, but chronic inflammation and oxidative stress possibly play a role. Future studies investigating associations between trans fat intakes and cancer risk should apply higher methodological quality. For targeted prevention strategies, studies should examine which trans fatty acid subtypes are more carcinogenic and what populations are at highest risk.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk: a systematic review [^6ad7a43f]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Omega-3 fatty acids are purported to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have reported mixed results.

Objective

To synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk in prospective cohort studies.

Data Sources

Articles published from 1966 to October 2005 identified through MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CAB Health; unpublished literature sought through letters to experts in the neutraceutical industry.

Study Selection

A total of 38 articles with a description of effects of consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor incidence, prospective cohort study design, human study population; and description of effect of omega-3 among groups with different levels of exposure in the cohort were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed articles using structured abstraction forms; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted detailed data about the incidence of cancer, the type of cancer, the number and characteristics of the patients, details on the exposure to omega-3 fatty acids, and the elapsed time between the intervention and outcome measurements. Data about the methodological quality of the study were also abstracted.

Data Synthesis

Across 20 cohorts from 7 countries for 11 different types of cancer and using up to 6 different ways to categorize omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 65 estimates of the association between omega-3 fatty acid consumption were reported. Among these, only 8 were statistically significant. The high degree of heterogeneity across these studies precluded pooling of data. For breast cancer 1 significant estimate was for increased risk (incidence risk ratio [IRR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.98) and 3 were for decreased risk (RR, 0.68–0.72); 7 other estimates did not show a significant association. For colorectal cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27–0.89) and 17 estimates without association. For lung cancer one of the significant associations was for increased cancer risk (IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2–7.3), the other was for decreased risk (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13–0.76), and 4 other estimates were not significant. For prostate cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.83) and 1 of increased risk (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34–2.93) for advanced prostate cancer; 15 other estimates did not show a significant association. The study that assessed skin cancer found an increased risk (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.27). No significant associations between omega-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer incidence were found for aerodigestive cancer, bladder cancer, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stomach cancer.

Conclusions

A large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between omega-3 fatty acids and cancer incidence. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids is unlikely to prevent cancer.

### Prioritising action on occupational carcinogens in Europe: a socioeconomic and health impact assessment [^787a66e9]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

As part of the effort to reduce occupational cancers, we have undertaken a socioeconomic and health analysis to assess the potential impact of introducing legally binding OELs or reducing those already existing for 25 workplace carcinogens. When evaluating these results and making recommendations for action, we have used a pragmatic weight of evidence approach including taking into account: the numbers of workers currently exposed across the EU and the exposure levels, the numbers of predicted deaths and newly occurring cancers if no action is taken, the size of the risks associated with the cancers of concern, the costs to health and to industry, and the cost–benefit ratios. The detailed evidence for our evaluations is summarised for each substance in the online Supplementary Material (Weight of evidence arguments for prioritising substances for binding OELs).

The cost–benefit ratio together with predicted numbers of deaths as a result of inaction suggests that the strongest cases for the introduction of an OEL are for: respirable crystalline silica, hexavalent chromium, and hardwood dust. Other substances where the weight of evidence (for example, high risk estimates, high health burden with no action or many workers currently exposed) supports the introduction of a limit include: DEE emissions, rubber fume/dust, benzo[a]pyrene, trichloroethylene, hydrazine, epichlorohydrin, o-toluidine, mineral oils as used engine oil, and MDA. It should be noted that our health impact assessment considered only cancers as the end point. However, introducing limits for the above substances could also contribute to reductions in other health-related conditions, such as non-malignant respiratory and skin disease. For many of the substances, there are therefore likely to be substantial additional baseline health costs and further unquantified health benefits from introducing an OEL.

### Use of "natural" oils for moisturization: review of olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil [^3977d01f]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of effective medications for the management of atopic dermatitis and xerosis, patients may use nonconventional therapies such as topical oils. Patients choose these treatments because of the perceived lower risk of natural products and the fear of potential adverse effects of topical steroids. We review the use of topical olive, coconut, and sunflower seed oil in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and xerosis with a focus on children Currently available evidence suggests that olive oil may exacerbate xerosis and atopic dermatitis. Further studies are needed to make definitive recommendations regarding the use of coconut and sunflower seed oil.

### Opposing effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on mammary carcinogenesis: the Singapore Chinese health study [^ae10adc9]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The overall effect of dietary fat on breast cancer risk has been much studied with inconclusive results. There is relatively sparse information on the risk of breast cancer and individual fatty acids, which have demonstrated differential or even opposing effects in experimental systems of mammary carcinogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that fish oil or the constituent n-3 fatty acids may exert a protective effect against breast cancer development. The protective effect has been observed in both the carcinogen-induced tumour model and transplantable tumour model. On the other hand, animal experiments consistently show that n-6 fatty acid promotes mammary tumorigenesis. Experimental data also suggest that the tumour-enhancing effect of n-6 fatty acids can be abrogated by marine n-3 fatty acids.

Relatively sparse data are available on the potentially opposing and interactive effects of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids on breast cancer in humans. Here, we report on the effects of different types of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) and certain individual fatty acids (n-3, n-6) on breast cancer development in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study with a focus on diet and cancer risk. Relative to the better studied western populations, Singapore Chinese consume less dietary fat overall, but have one of the highest consumption rates for fish. Although breast cancer incidence is historically low in Chinese women, breast cancer incidence in the Singapore Chinese has doubled between the 1970s and 1990s.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for the treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer [^8592d241]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Omega (ω)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are naturally occurring substances that are well tolerated and have been used extensively for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. More recently, ω-3 PUFAs have been recognised to have anticancer activity. There is also evidence suggesting improved efficacy and/or tolerability of conventional cancer chemotherapy when administered with ω-3 PUFAs. The purpose of this review is to (i) describe the mechanisms by which ω-3 PUFAs are thought to have antineoplastic activity, (ii) review published preclinical and clinical studies that support anti-colorectal cancer activity and (iii) summarise current clinical trials investigating the potential therapeutic role(s) of ω-3 PUFAs at different stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, from adenoma (polyp) prevention to treatment of established malignant disease and prevention of cancer recurrence.

### Perspectives for cancer prevention with natural compounds [^dfb38392]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Despite the estimated 565,650 deaths in 2008 of Americans as a result of cancer, it is mostly a preventable disease. Simply by modification of diet, maintenance of optimum body weight, and regular physical activity, 30% to 40% of all instances of cancer could be prevented. Modification of diet alone by increasing vegetable and fruit intake could prevent 20% or more of all cases of cancer and may potentially prevent approximately 200,000 cancer-related deaths annually. Because of their safety, low toxicity, antioxidant properties, and general acceptance as dietary supplements, fruits, vegetables, and other dietary elements (phytochemicals and minerals) are being investigated for the prevention of cancer. Extensive research over the past several decades has identified numerous dietary and botanical natural compounds that have chemopreventive potential. In this review, we discuss promising natural chemopreventive compounds, their molecular targets, and their mechanisms, which may help the further design and conduct of preclinical and clinical trials.

Genetically modified crops (bioengineered) — definition, prevalence, labeling, and cancer risk: "Genetically modified or bioengineered crops are made by adding genes from other plants or organisms to increase a plant's resistance to insect pests; retard spoilage; or improve transportability, flavor, nutrient composition, or other desired qualities". Availability and prevalence are noted: "Certain foods produced from genetically modified crops have been approved for sale in the United States since the mid-1990s", and " > 70% of all highly processed foods on US supermarket shelves — including pizza, potato chips, cookies, ice cream, salad dressing, corn syrup, and baking powder — contain ingredients from bioengineered soybeans, corn, or canola plants". Policy context includes that "Growing public concern… led to federal legislation in 2016 requiring uniform labeling of foods containing genetically engineered ingredients". While potential concerns are that "These added genes might create substances that could cause adverse reactions among sensitized or allergic individuals or may result in the presence of elevated levels of compounds with adverse health effects", the guideline states, "there is currently no evidence that foods containing genetically engineered ingredients or the substances found in them that are now on the market are harmful to human health or that they would either increase or decrease cancer risk".

### Vitamin E intake from natural sources and head and neck cancer risk: a pooled analysis in the international head and neck cancer epidemiology consortium [^11c5b165]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Since the mid 1980s, evidence had been accumulating from laboratory and epidemiological studies on a putative role of anti-oxidant nutrients, especially β -carotene and vitamin E, in the prevention of cancer of the oral cavity and cancers at other sites, in general. In the absence of apparent indications of toxicity, these nutrients provided the possibility to be used widely without close medical supervision and were then the target for specific chemopreventive intervention trials, alone or in combination, to take advantage of possible synergies between them. However, the results from these experiments were not in line with previous knowledge and expectations for several reasons.

Besides these aspects, traditional single-nutrient analyses and more recent complementary ones on dietary patterns or total antioxidant capacity support the hypothesis that protection against cancer risk may derive from consumption in complex mixtures with other nutrients and bioactive compounds, as found in the matrix provided by whole foods or from combinations of foods. This aspect may be particularly important for vitamin E intake, as this nutrient derives mainly from vegetables and oils of different origin, including olive oil.

### Icosapent ethyl (icosapent) [^3a047f87]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 0.09, 0.27, and 0.91 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, respectively, males did not exhibit drug-related neoplasms. Hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas of the mesenteric lymph node, the site of drug absorption, were observed in females at clinically relevant exposures based on body surface area comparisons across species relative to the maximum clinical dose of 4 g/day. Overall incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment.

In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 transgenic mice with oral gavage doses of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4.6 g/kg/day icosapent ethyl, drug-related incidences of benign squamous cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the tail was observed in high dose male mice. The papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail associated with fecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. Drug-related neoplasms were not observed in female mice.

Icosapent ethyl was not mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. A chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was positive for clastogenicity with and without metabolic activation.

In an oral gavage rat fertility study, ethyl-EPA, administered at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3 g/kg/day to male rats for 9 weeks before mating and to female rats for 14 days before mating through day 7 of gestation, increased anogenital distance in female pups and increased cervical ribs were observed at 3 g/kg/day (7 times human systemic exposure with 4 g/day clinical dose based on a body surface area comparison).

### The IARC monographs: updated procedures for modern and transparent evidence synthesis in cancer hazard identification [^ec8e7775]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

For nearly 50 years, the Monograph s program of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has been a premier global resource for identifying agents that can cause cancer. The identification of carcinogenic hazards is a necessary initial step in cancer prevention. National and international authorities and organizations use information on causes of cancer to support actions to reduce human exposure to carcinogens.

More than 1000 agents have been evaluated in the Monographs program. These evaluations have addressed chemical, physical, and biological substances, working conditions, dietary constituents, and other exposures of everyday life. Slightly more than half of all agents evaluated have been classified as possibly carcinogenic, probably carcinogenic, or carcinogenic to humans.

The IARC Monographs embody principles of scientific rigor, impartial evaluation, transparency, and consistency. Long-standing hallmarks of Monograph s evaluations include the transparent synthesis of different streams of evidence and their integration into uniform classifications of the strength of evidence for causation. Three streams of scientific evidence are considered: studies of human cancer, studies of cancer in experimental animals, and mechanistic evidence. Human exposure is also characterized. The evaluation process has evolved since the program's inception, in 1971, in parallel with the evolution of the scientific evidence on causation and experience gained over the decades of the program's existence. Starting in 1982, it has been possible to "upgrade" overall evaluations based on results from short-term genotoxicity assays. In 1991, a working group proposed principles and procedures for use of mechanistic evidence for overall evaluations, specifying criteria for mechanistic upgrades to a higher hazard category, as well as criteria for downgrades to a lower category based on the extent of mechanistic understanding. The update of the Preamble described here reflects the changing mix of scientific evidence considered by Monographs ' working groups, notably the predominance of mechanistic evidence for some agents. Advances in the assessment of mechanistic data include the identification of "key characteristics of carcinogens", which provide a framework for organizing mechanistic data and assessing strengths as well as gaps in evidence. The revisions to the Preamble reflect these advances and describe a harmonized process for integrating evidence from epidemiological studies, experimental animal bioassays, and mechanistic data to reach a carcinogenicity classification.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^02f6ad84]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Summary and prospects

From the most recent experimental and epidemiological studies, we conclude that the optimal dietary fat pattern to reduce the risk of both CVD and most cancers should include a low intake of SFAs and omega-6 PUFAs. Small amounts (1% to 2% of energy intake) of the essential linoleic acid - easy to find in most Western foods - are sufficient to prevent omega-6 deficiency. The amounts of omega-6 in most Western foods are so high that it could be difficult to obtain an intake of omega-6 lower than 4% of energy, which would probably be the optimal level. The high average intake of omega-6 PUFAs in Western countries may explain the persistently high rate of CVD complications and the increased incidence of certain cancers, including breast cancer. The intake of omega-3 PUFAs, from plant and marine sources, should be moderate (a minimum of 3 g/day in average for an adult with at least 2 g/day of the essential alpha-linolenic acid), which is far from the case at present in many populations.

Finally, regarding the intake of oleic acid, it is critical to differentiate the food sources, since the health effects of oleic acid obtained from meat or from olive oil are different. To simplify the dietary advice aimed at protecting health - and help consumers to understand it - the best approach is probably the traditional Mediterranean diet model. No dietary pattern has been so extensively studied, and no other has been shown to provide so many benefits without any adverse effects.

### Dietary long-chain n-3 fatty acids for the prevention of cancer: a review of potential mechanisms [^3a5d1ddc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence from animal and in vitro studies indicates that n-3 fatty acids, especially the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, present in fatty fish and fish oils inhibit carcinogenesis. The epidemiologic data on the association between fish consumption, as a surrogate marker for n-3 fatty acid intake, and cancer risk are, however, somewhat less consistent. This review highlights current knowledge of the potential mechanisms of the anticarcinogenic actions of n-3 fatty acids. Moreover, a possible explanation of why some epidemiologic studies failed to find an association between n-3 fatty acid intake and cancer risk is provided. Several molecular mechanisms whereby n-3 fatty acids may modify the carcinogenic process have been proposed. These include suppression of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoid biosynthesis; influences on transcription factor activity, gene expression, and signal transduction pathways; alteration of estrogen metabolism; increased or decreased production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species; and mechanisms involving insulin sensitivity and membrane fluidity. Further studies are needed to evaluate and verify these mechanisms in humans to gain more understanding of the effects of n-3 fatty acid intake on cancer risk.

### Fat reduction to prevent prostate cancer: waiting for more evidence? [^6def299c]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Complementary medicine has become an important area of interest for patients and researchers around the world. The utilization of some of these therapies by many individuals makes it imperative to understand whether they have any role in treatment of cancer or other diseases. Some of such therapies may play a role in the prevention of prostate cancer. Clinical trials are addressing this issue, and whether these products could also improve prognosis of prostate cancer. That dietary fat reduction may help to prevent prostate cancer is supported by numerous case-control studies reported over the past several decades, but recent prospective studies suggest that the impact of fat reduction in this regard may not be great. Clinicians should be careful not to suggest such a benefit until more research provides a better picture of the situation. Breast cancer is probably the best example of why more research into dietary changes for reduction in cancer risk is needed. Once believed to play a significant role, recent prospective studies suggest that dietary fat reduction may have little effect on breast cancer prevention, although some interesting insights have been gained with regard to the method of meat preparation and the influence of genetics. Fat reduction, together with soy products or other plant estrogen foods, may have a symbiotic relationship. Numerous healthy lifestyle changes incorporated and practiced at one time (healthy diet, attainment and maintenance of normal weight, soy consumption, among others) may hold some promise in the area of cancer prevention. In the meantime any healthy lifestyle or dietary change should be encouraged, because it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is still the number one cause of mortality. It is also an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Regardless, complementary medicine should probably be discussed with any patient who is initiating or undergoing conventional treatment, because of the cardiovascular benefits and overall potential impact on all-cause mortality. Whether such therapies impact on prostate carcinoma remains to be determined through additional prospective investigations.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 100 mg/kg/day, 600 mg/kg/day, and 2,000 mg/kg/day, males were treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters for 101 weeks and females for 89 weeks without an increased incidence of tumors (up to 5 times human systemic exposures following an oral dose of 4 grams/day based on a body surface area comparison). Standard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were not conducted in mice.

Omega-3-acid ethyl esters were not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli or in the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster V79 lung cells or human lymphocytes. Omega-3-acid ethyl esters were negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

In a rat fertility study with oral doses of 100 mg/kg/day, 600 mg/kg/day, and 2,000 mg/kg/day, males were treated for 10 weeks prior to mating and females were treated for 2 weeks prior to mating and through lactation. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 2,000 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD of 4 grams/day based on body surface area [mg/m2]).

### Fried foods, olive oil and colorectal cancer [^ef8da311]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The epidemiologic evidence for an etiologic role of fried foods and heterocyclic amines in colorectal carcinogenesis is inconsistent.

Patients and Methods

We have investigated the relation between fried foods and colorectal cancer risk using data from a large, multicentric case-control study conducted in Italy and Switzerland between 1992 and 2000, with 1394 cases of colon cancer, 886 cases of rectal cancer and 4765 controls.

Results

After allowing for major relevant covariates, the multivariate odds ratios (ORs) for an increment of one portion per week of fried foods were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93–1.01] for colon cancer and 1.04 (95% CI = 1.00–1.09) for rectal cancer. When we analyzed the type of fats mainly used for frying, we found that olive oil, but not other types of oils, appeared to protect from colon cancer risk (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.82–0.98).

Conclusions

Our results do not indicate a relevant role of fried foods on colorectal cancer risk. We found a possible favorable effect of (fried) olive oil on colon cancer risk but not on rectal cancer risk.

### Impact of topical applications of sunflower seed oil on neonatal mortality and morbidity in Southern Nepal: a community-based, cluster-randomised trial [^d10cb3f9]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

We did observe an instability of oleic and erucic acids in the mustard seed oil over time in comparison with sunflower seed oil. Oleic acid ranged from 16% to 68% for mustard vs ~22–29% in sunflower seed oil. Erucic ranged from 0% for one period to 39% for another, although levels were 3% or below for four periods. Highly variable levels of erucic acid (2.7–41.4%) were found in mustard oil samples from Bangladesh in the study of oil effects on the skin barrier of a mouse model of infant skin, but no erucic acid was detected in the sunflower seed oil. The mustard and sunflower seed oils used in our trial came from a factory where quality was checked by the government of Nepal prior to sale. Both oils were kept in hygienic conditions at room temperature until dispersed to participants. The source of the observed variability is unknown but may be an inherent property of mustard relative to sunflower seed oil. Sawicka et al reported erucic levels at 3.8% and 22.2% from two cultivars of black mustard. Oral consumption of erucic acid was associated with the development of alopecia and scaly skin lesions but topical application was not discussed. A cosmetic ingredient review of the safety of 102 fatty acids (including erucic acid) in 2019 deemed them to be safe for cosmetics whereby their levels are within non-irritating and non-sensitising ranges. Perhaps the stability of the acid profile of sunflower seed oil, in addition to its high linoleic acid content, may be arguments for its use on skin of newborns.

### Drinking water from private wells and risks to children [^8635d410]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pesticides in private well water — use, detection, classifications, and mitigation are described as follows: 7.7 billion pounds of pesticides are used every year; in one 2009 USGS study of more than 2000 wells, approximately half of the pesticides were measured in nearly all (about 90% or more) of the sampled wells, with other pesticides measured in about 60%; a more recent study tested 1204 wells (in aquifers representing 70% of the volume pumped for drinking water) for 109 pesticides and 116 pesticide residues, finding pesticides and/or residues in 41% with the most common (> 5% of wells) being atrazine, hexazinone, prometon, tebuthiuron, and metolachlor residues. Glyphosate has an MCL for drinking water of 0.7 mg/L, and as of January 2020, the EPA continues to find that there are no risks of concern to human health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label, while the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015 concluded that glyphosate is a "probable" carcinogen and the EPA classified atrazine as "not likely to be carcinogenic" in 2000. In agricultural areas, neonicotinoid insecticides are sometimes used as seed treatments and, in animal studies, neonicotinoids have been shown to have reproductive toxic effects, neurotoxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Point-of-use devices like charcoal filters and reverse-osmosis treatments can be used to remove or minimize pesticides in drinking water.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^650f9678]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

At the same time, omega-3 PUFAs were shown to have chemopreventive properties against various cancers and their complications, including colon and breast cancer. It is therefore important to design dietary strategies that will result in increased omega-3 in diet, blood and tissues, associated with decreased omega-6. In addition to increasing the dietary intake of omega-3, it is possible to stimulate the endogenous synthesis of very long-chain omega-3 PUFAS - often called 'marine' omega-3 - out of their plant substrate alpha-linolenic acid, through the consumption of plant pigments such as the polyphenols found, for instance, in grapes and red wine. Both alpha-linolenic acid and the polyphenol anthocyanins are present in quite large amounts in the traditional Mediterranean diet, also poor in omega-6, which may at least partly explain the remarkable protection this diet provides against cancers. In contrast, the main dietary omega-6 linoleic acid inhibits synthesis and cell incorporation of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs which is in line with the effects of omega-6 on cancer risk as discussed above.

### The effect of a coix seed oil injection on cancer pain relief [^6a279988]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in patients with advanced cancer, but is still less than optimally treated. The effect of traditional Chinese medicine in cancer pain treatment is nowadays getting more and more attention.

Objective

To investigate the effect of a coix seed oil injection on cancer pain relief in a cancer center in a tertiary hospital in China.

Methods

Patients in the treatment group received a coix seed oil injection for 2 weeks, while patients in the control group received equivalent 0.9% saline. The numeric rating scale was used to assess the pain level. The Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 was used to assess life quality. The adverse drug reactions during the treatment process were observed.

Results

Patients in the coix seed treatment group had significantly superior efficacy on pain control over those in the control group. Coix seed therapy significantly improved patients' scores reflecting by the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) scale. In addition, the occurrence of adverse reactions such as constipation and nausea in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group.

Conclusion

The coix seed oil injection effectively reduced the pain level of cancer patients, significantly improved their life quality, and had no obvious adverse effects.

### Mustard oil and cardiovascular health: why the controversy? [^922737b3]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States (US) and worldwide. Among South Asians living in the US, ASCVD risk is four-fold higher than the local population. Cardioprotective dietary patterns necessitate replacement of dietary saturated fats with healthier oils such as canola, corn, olive, soybean, safflower, and sunflower oil. Mustard oil is a liquid oil that is low in saturated fat and is popular in South Asia. It contains a large proportion of erucic acid, a fatty acid associated with myocardial lipidosis in rodents. This evidence prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the use of mustard oil for cooking. However, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union (27 countries) have established upper limits for tolerable intake of mustard oil. In contrast mustard oil is one of the most popular cooking oils in Asia, particularly in India where it is recommended as a heart-healthy oil by the Lipid Association of India (LAI). The conflict between various guidelines warrants clarification, particularly because use of mustard oil in cooking is increasing among both Americans and Indian immigrants in the US, despite the FDA ban on human consumption of mustard oil. Hence, we endeavored to: (1) Review current evidence regarding potentially harmful versus beneficial effects of cooking with mustard oil, (2) Clarify the basis for disparities between the FDA ban on human consumption of mustard oil and dietary recommendations from the LAI and other groups, and (3) Provide practical suggestions for Indians and other South Asians who are accustomed to consuming mustard oil on ways to incorporate alternate heart-healthy oils (E.g. Canola, Olive, Sunflower, Soybean oil) in the diet while enhancing flavor and texture of food. A new FDA review is recommended on the safety limits of erucic acid because 29 countries have allow limited amounts of mustard oil (erucic acid) for human consumption and also because there are some health benefits that have been reported for mustard oil in humans.

### Inter-rater agreement in the assessment of exposure to carcinogens in the offshore petroleum industry [^864928ac]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the reliability of an expert team assessing exposure to carcinogens in the offshore petroleum industry and to study how the information provided influenced the agreement among raters.

Methods

Eight experts individually assessed the likelihood of exposure for combinations of 17 carcinogens, 27 job categories and four time periods (1970–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1999 and 2000–2005). Each rater assessed 1836 combinations based on summary documents on carcinogenic agents, which included descriptions of sources of exposure and products, descriptions of work processes carried out within the different job categories, and monitoring data. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa index and single and average score intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (ICC(2,1) and ICC(2,8), respectively). Differences in inter-rater agreement for time periods, raters, International Agency for Research on Cancer groups and the amount of information provided were consequently studied.

Results

Overall, 18% of the combinations were denoted as possible exposure, and 14% scored probable exposure. Stratified by the 17 carcinogenic agents, the probable exposure prevalence ranged from 3.8% for refractory ceramic fibres to 30% for crude oil. Overall mean kappa was 0.42 (ICC(2,1) = 0.62 and ICC(2,8) = 0.93). Providing limited quantitative measurement data was associated with less agreement than for equally well described carcinogens without sampling data.

Conclusion

The overall kappa and single-score ICC indicate that the raters agree on exposure estimates well above the chance level. The levels of inter-rater agreement were higher than in other comparable studies. The average score ICC indicates reliable mean estimates and implies that sufficient raters were involved. The raters seemed to have enough documentation on which to base their estimates, but provision of limited monitoring data leads to more incongruence among raters. Having real exposure data, with the inherent variability of such data, apparently makes estimating exposure in a rigid semiquantitative manner more difficult.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^89ba5793]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Dietary fat and cancer

In animal studies, omega-6 PUFAs have a strong mammary tumor-enhancing effect. In order to exert their carcinogenic effects, they must first undergo an oxidative metabolization, mainly through the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. The main substrate of these oxidative pathways is arachidonic acid, which is mainly produced from dietary linoleic acid, the most common omega-6 PUFAs in Western foods and cooking fats. Several recent epidemiologic studies have found a positive association between dietary omega-6 PUFAs and breast cancer risk. Certain analyses took into account a genetic predisposition related to omega-6 metabolism. To determine whether 5-lipoxygenase (LOX)-mediated dietary omega-6 metabolism might influence breast cancer risk, investigators examined genetic variants of the LOX enzyme in combination with linoleic acid intakes. They found that women with a genetic aberration affecting the LOX enzyme whose diet provided a high level of omega-6 (linoleic acid) had a significantly increased breast cancer risk. However, when women with the same high-risk genetic profile had a diet lower in linoleic acid, their genotype had no significant effect on their breast cancer risk. This demonstration that a diet-gene interaction increases the risk of cancer may explain why some previous studies were inconsistent or conflicting. Other recent studies have shown interactions between heterocyclic amines and omega-6 PUFAs on the one hand, and between omega-3 and omega-6 on the other hand, in determining the risk of invasive breast cancer. Other factors, such as the obesity status, were shown to affect the association between dietary PUFAs and breast cancer risk. Finally, the food sources of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs, as well as their relative amounts in the diet of individuals, appear to be very important for breast cancer risk.

### Modulation of experimental colon tumorigenesis by types and amounts of dietary fatty acids [^9bb869cf]. Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies and laboratory animal model assays suggest that a high intake of dietary fat promotes colorectal cancer. Several in vivo and in vitro studies support the hypothesis that omega-6 fatty acids promote colon tumorigenesis, whereas omega-3 fatty acids lack promoting activity. Fat intake in the United States traditionally includes high amounts (30% of total caloric intake) of saturated fat rather than omega-6 fatty acids. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare the modulatory effects of a high-fat diet containing mixed lipids (HFML), a diet rich in saturated fatty acids (the average American diet), a diet with fish oil (HFFO) that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and a low-fat corn oil diet (LFCO) on the formation of chemically induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity, and apoptosis during experimental colon carcinogenesis. At 5 weeks of age, groups of male F344 rats were fed a 5% corn oil diet (LFCO). At 7 weeks of age, rats intended for carcinogen treatment received s.c. injections of azoxymethane at a dose level of 15 mg/kg of body weight once weekly for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 day after the carcinogen treatment, groups of rats were then maintained on experimental diets containing 20% HFML or 20% HFFO. Rats were killed at 8, 23, or 38 weeks after azoxymethane treatment. Colonic ACF and tumors were evaluated histopathologically, and apoptosis was evaluated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling method. Colonic mucosae and tumor samples harvested at week 38 were analyzed for COX-2 synthetic activity and expression. The rats fed the HFML diet showed significantly increased total colonic ACF (P < 0.001–0.0001) with a multiplicity of ≥ 4 aberrant crypts/focus (P < 0.0001) compared with the effects of the HFFO or LFCO diets at week 8, 23, and 38. Interestingly, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase (≥ 4) in multicrypt foci in rats given the HFML diet as compared with such foci in rats fed the HFFO or LFCO diets. By week 23, the HFML diet had significantly increased the incidence of colonic tumors (30–60%) and their multiplicity (100–141%) when compared with the effects of the LFCO or HFFO diets. At week 38, the HFML diet had induced 100% colon tumor incidence and a 4-fold multiplicity of adenocarcinomas compared with the LFCO and HFFO diets. At weeks 23 and 38, a significantly lower percentage of apoptotic colonic epithelial cells were observed in the tumors of animals fed the HFML diet as compared with those fed the HFFO diet. The HFML diet caused significantly increased levels of COX-2 activity in colon tumors (P < 0.05–0.01), and these tumors had enhanced levels of COX-2 expression as compared with those in assays with LFCO or HFFO diets. These observations demonstrate for the first time that HFML diets containing high levels of saturated fatty acids (such as those in Western diets) promote colon carcinogenesis. Although the mechanisms involved in colon tumor promotion by a HFML diet are not fully known, our results indicate that the modulation of eicosanoid production via the influence on COX activity and the suppression of apoptosis may play a key role in HFML diet-induced colon tumorigenesis.

### Prioritising action on occupational carcinogens in Europe: a socioeconomic and health impact assessment [^b4e5eee5]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The 25 substances considered are listed in Table 1 with the IARC and EU carcinogen classifications. Twelve of the substances considered were definite human carcinogens (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Group 1), four were probable human carcinogens (IARC 2a) and nine were possible human carcinogens (IARC 2b). There are > 10 different types of cancer that may be caused by exposure to these substances, most commonly lung and bladder cancer (Table 1). For some of these tumour types, survival is good, for example, non-melanoma skin cancer that may be caused by mineral oils as used engine oil or benzo[a]pyrene, although for most of the cancers the prognosis is relatively poor.

Details of the OELs evaluated are also shown in Table 1 along with estimates for the percentage of EU workers currently exposed above the limit. The OEL values for five substances were suggested by the European Commission: hard wood dust, vinyl chloride monomer, hexavalent chromium, respirable crystalline silica, and 1,3 Butadiene. All others were selected as 'typical' of existing OEL values among EU member states (note that the OEL for DEE was from Austria, as this was the only one available). For some OEL values, there is a relatively large proportion of workers judged to be currently exposed above the limit, for example, 75% of workers exposed above a possible hydrazine limit of 0.013 mg m −3. For 14 substance–OEL combinations, including DEE, there are < 1% of workers currently exposed above the suggested limit value representing nearly full compliance; for these, there is little or no health benefit from introducing an OEL at that value.

### Omega-3, omega-6 and total dietary polyunsaturated fat on cancer incidence: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^75c2f9ae]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 47 RCTs (49 comparisons). Thirty-four trials (97,548 participants) assessed effects of LCn3, three (3179 participants) assessed ALA, eight (4976 participants) assessed omega-6 and 9 trials (11,573 participants) assessed total PUFA (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). As several trials assessed multiple PUFA interventions, numbers are not additive. Thirty-eight trials included participants with normal baseline cancer risk, three with cancer risk factors and six trials with previously diagnosed cancer. Most trials provided supplementary capsules, but omega-6 and total PUFA trials often provided dietary advice and/or supplementary foods (enriched margarines or nuts), and one institutional trial provided all food. Mean trial duration was > 30 months and trials were conducted in Europe (20 trials), North America (15), Japan (5), Australia/ New Zealand (2), or over several continents (5). Seventeen RCTs were assessed as being at low summary risk of bias (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1).

Results are discussed briefly here, fuller results are presented in the supplementary materials (Supplementary Figs. 3–5 are funnel plots relating to effects of LCn3, Supplementary Figs. 6–9 are forest plots depicting effects of omega-3, omega-6 and total PUFA on cancer-related outcomes, Supplementary Fig. 10 the funnel plot for effects of total PUFA on cancer diagnosis, Supplementary Figs. 11–15 further forest plots, Supplementary Tables 2–6 detail results of all meta-analyses and GRADE table on effects of omega-3, Supplementary Tables 7–9 detail meta-analyses and the GRADE table for omega-6, Supplementary Tables 10–12 are meta-analyses and GRADE table for total PUFA).

### Eugenol restricts DMBA croton oil induced skin carcinogenesis in mice: downregulation of C-myc and H-ras, and activation of p53 dependent apoptotic pathway [^f5474e3b]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Eugenol is the active component of essential oil isolated from clove (Syzigium aromaticum). Eugenol has antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, anti-inflammatory properties. The anticarcinogenic effect of eugenol was evident in different types of cell lines. However, its anticarcinogenic effect in in vivo has not yet been fully explored.

Objective

The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of eugenol in an experimental skin carcinogenesis mice model system.

Method

Skin tumor was induced by topical application of DMBA croton oil in Swiss mice. To assess the chemopreventive potential of eugenol, it was orally administered 15 days prior carcinogen treatment. The development of skin carcinogenesis was confirmed by histopathological analysis. Cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the skin tumor were analyzed by in situ cellular proliferation and in situ cell death assay. Expression of some proliferation and apoptosis associated genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and protein expression was analyzed by Western blot.

Results

Reduction in incidence and sizes of skin tumors along with overall increase in survival of mice were seen due to eugenol treatment. Restriction of skin carcinogenesis at the dysplastic stage along with reduced rate of cellular proliferation and increase in apoptosis were evident in eugenol treated skin tumors. Eugenol treatment led to the downregulation of c-Myc, H-ras and Bcl2 expression along with upregulation of P53, Bax and active Caspase-3 expression in the skin lesions.

Conclusion

Restriction of skin carcinogenesis at dysplastic stage by eugenol was due to attenuation of c-Myc, H-ras and modification of some p53 associated gene expression.

### Constipation in adults [^d398e7ef]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are defined criteria for the diagnosis of constipation, in practice, diagnostic criteria are less rigid, and in part depend on the perception of normal bowel habit. Constipation is highly prevalent, with approximately 12 million general practitioner prescriptions for laxatives in England in 2001.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of non-drug interventions, and of other interventions, in adults with idiopathic chronic constipation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (BMJ Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 42 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arachis oil, biofeedback, bisacodyl, cascara, docusate, exercise, glycerine suppositories, glycerol, high-fibre diet, increasing fluids, ispaghula husk, lactitol, lactulose, macrogols (polyethylene glycols), magnesium salts, methylcellulose, paraffin, phosphate enemas, seed oils, senna, sodium citrate enemas, sterculia.

Box 2
Overall evaluations of the IARC Monographs

The agent is carcinogenic to humans (group 1): This category is used whenever there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In addition, this category may apply when there is both strong evidence in exposed humans that the agent exhibits key characteristics of carcinogens and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.

The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans (group 2A): This category generally applies when the working group has made at least two of the following evaluations, including at least one that involves either exposed humans or human cells or tissues:

- Limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans

- Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals

- Strong evidence that the agent exhibits key characteristics of carcinogens

Separately, this category generally applies if there is strong evidence that the agent belongs, based on mechanistic considerations, to a class of agents for which one or more members have been classified in group 1 or group 2 A.

The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B): This category generally applies when only one of the following evaluations has been made by the working group:

- Limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans

- Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals

- Strong evidence that the agent exhibits key characteristics of carcinogens (regardless of whether from exposed humans or human cells or from experimental systems)

The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (group 3): Agents that do not fall into any other group are generally placed in this category. Typically, this category is used when there is less than sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate evidence in humans. This category is also used when there is strong evidence that the mechanism of carcinogenicity in experimental animals does not operate in humans and the evidence in humans is inadequate. However, if other tumor sites in experimental animals support an evaluation of sufficient evidence in experimental animals, or if the evidence in humans is limited, a higher classification according to criteria listed above applies.

### Dietary intake and tissue biomarkers of omega-6 fatty acids and risk of colorectal cancer in adults: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^83fcd45b]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings should be interpreted with caution due to several limitations, most of which are common to observational studies and meta-analyses. These include being unable to perform a dose-response meta-analysis due to the limited number of studies in some associations. In addition, since the current meta-analysis was conducted on observational studies, causality cannot be established. Also, the existence of measurement and reporting errors in the estimation of food and nutrient intake is inevitable in observational studies. Moreover, previous studies have not examined the influence of processing and cooking methods or the sources of n-6 PUFAs on the association between these fatty acids and CRC risk. The source of n-6 PUFAs, whether it is derived from plant-based foods or from fast foods and snacks, may have different effects. Therefore, future studies should assess the influence of different food sources of n-6 PUFAs on CRC risk. In addition, differences in n-6 PUFAs intake among geographical regions could have affected the highest and lowest levels of n-6 PUFAs intake and the results from these comparisons. To control these differences, we conducted the subgroup and dose-response analyses.

In conclusion, we found that dietary intake of LA is associated with an increased risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancers. However, no significant association was found for total n-6 PUFAs and AA, either in the highest versus lowest comparison or in the dose-response meta-analysis. Also, in the dose-response analysis, each 1 gr/day increase in dietary LA intake (equal to 3.67 grams of sunflower oil, 1.6 grams of walnut oil, or 2.35 grams of pumpkin oil) was associated with a 1% higher risk of colon cancer. Although the increased risk of 1% with a 1 gr/day more intake of LA might be clinically unimportant, this risk might be large in the higher dosages of LA intake. Among the studies included in the current meta-analysis, the range of LA intake was between 0 and 20 gr/day. Therefore, higher intakes of LA can provide higher risk of colon cancer. In terms of tissue levels of n-6 PUFAs, LA, and AA, no significant association was found with CRC risk. Future studies, particularly well-designed prospective cohort studies, should assess the influence of dietary/tissue levels of n-6 PUFAs on the risk of CRC mortality. Further studies are also needed to investigate whether specific foods rich in n-6 PUFAs are differentially associated with CRC risk.

### Only virgin type of olive oil consumption reduces the risk of mortality. results from a mediterranean population-based cohort [^9bf31205]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence on the association between virgin olive oil (OO) and mortality is limited since no attempt has previously been made to discern about main OO varieties.

Objective

We examined the association between OO consumption (differentiating by common and virgin varieties) and total as well as cause-specific long-term mortality METHODS: 12,161 individuals, representative of the Spanish population ≥ 18 years old, were recruited between 2008 and 2010 and followed up through 2019. Habitual food consumption was collected at baseline with a validated computerized dietary history. The association between tertiles of OO main varieties and all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality were analyzed using Cox models.

Results

After a mean follow-up of 10.7 years (129,272 person-years), 143 cardiovascular deaths, and 146 cancer deaths occurred. The hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval) for all-cause mortality in the highest tertile of common and virgin OO consumption were 0.96 (0.75–1.23; P-trend 0.891) and 0.66 (0.49–0.90; P-trend 0.040). The HR for all-cause mortality per a 10g/day increase in virgin OO was 0.91 (0.83–1.00). Virgin OO consumption was also inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality, with a HR of 0.43 (0.20–0.91; P-trend 0.017), but common OO was not, with a HR of 0.88 (0.49–1.60; P-trend 0.242). No variety of OO was associated with cancer mortality.

Conclusion

Daily moderate consumption of virgin OO (1 and 1/2 tablespoons) was associated with a one-third lower risk of all-cause as well as half the risk of cardiovascular mortality. These effects were not seen for common OO. These findings may be useful to reappraise dietary guidelines.

### Risk factors: diet-NCI-national cancer institute… [^039cb3f6]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

However, these results show only that the dietary component is associated with a change in cancer risk, not that the dietary component is responsible for, or causes, the change in risk. For example, study participants with and without cancer could differ in other ways besides their diet, and it is possible that some other difference accounts for the difference in cancer. Scientists have studied many additives, nutrients, and other dietary components for possible associations with cancer risk. These include: Acrylamide Acrylamide is a chemical found in tobacco smoke and some foods. It can be produced when certain vegetables, such as potatoes, are heated to high temperatures. Studies in animal models have found that acrylamide exposure increases the risk for several types of cancer. However, there is no consistent evidence that dietary acrylamide exposure is associated with the risk of any type of cancer in humans. For more information, see the Acrylamide and Cancer Risk fact sheet.

Artificial sweeteners Many studies have been conducted on the safety of the six FDA-approved artificial sweeteners. In laboratory animal studies, these sweeteners have generally not been found to cause cancer or other adverse health effects. Most studies of the association between artificial sweetener intake and cancer in humans have also shown no increase in risk, although one large cohort study found a slight increase in cancer risk among users of several sweeteners. For more information, see the Artificial Sweeteners and Cancer fact sheet. Charred meat Certain chemicals, called HCAs and PAHs, are formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, and poultry, is cooked using high-temperature methods. Exposure to high levels of HCAs and PAHs can cause cancer in animals; however, whether such exposure causes cancer in humans is unclear.

For more information, see the Chemicals in Meat Cooked at High Temperatures and Cancer Risk fact sheet. Cruciferous vegetables Cruciferous vegetables contain chemicals known as glucosinolates, which break down into several compounds that are being studied for possible anticancer effects. Some of these compounds have shown anticancer effects in cells and animals, but the results of studies with humans have been less clear. For more information, see the Cruciferous Vegetables and Cancer Prevention fact sheet.

### The IARC monographs: updated procedures for modern and transparent evidence synthesis in cancer hazard identification [^9cf0cf39]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies of Carcinogen Mechanisms

Both the availability and the utility of mechanistic evidence to inform the evaluation of carcinogenicity have increased substantially since the Preamble was last updated. On the other hand, epidemiological studies of cancer and lifetime cancer bioassays in rodents may be available for only a fraction of agents to which humans are currently exposed. Several reports from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have described how toxicity testing, hazard identification, and risk assessment have been or are anticipated to be transformed by mechanistic data. Additionally, the IARC's review of group 1 carcinogens, as well as recent experience of IARC working groups, has shown how mechanistic data can play a role in evaluations of carcinogenicity. In particular, human carcinogens often exhibit one or more key characteristics that are related to how they cause cancer, and different carcinogenic agents exhibit different spectra of these key characteristics. The key characteristics described by Smith and colleagues (Box 1), such as "is genotoxic", "is immunosuppressive", or "modulates receptor-mediated effects", are based on empirical observations of the chemical and biological properties associated with the human carcinogens identified by the IARC Monographs program up to and including volume 100. Key characteristics are distinct from the "hallmarks of cancer", which relate to the properties of cancer cells. Key characteristics are also distinct from hypothesized mechanistic pathways, which describe a sequence of biological events postulated to occur during carcinogenesis. As such, the evaluation approach based on key characteristics adopted in the revised Preamble "avoids a narrow focus on specific pathways and hypotheses and provides for a broad, holistic consideration of the mechanistic evidence".

### The burden of cancer at work: estimation as the first step to prevention [^84d4e282]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Work-related cancers are largely preventable. The overall aim of this project is to estimate the current burden of cancer in Great Britain attributable to occupational factors, and identify carcinogenic agents, industries and occupations for targeting risk prevention.

Methods

Attributable fractions and numbers were estimated for mortality and incidence for bladder, lung, non-melanoma skin, and sinonasal cancers, leukaemia and mesothelioma for agents and occupations classified as International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Group 1 and 2A carcinogens with "strong" or "suggestive" evidence for carcinogenicity at the specific cancer site in humans. Risk estimates were obtained from published literature and national data sources used for estimating proportions exposed.

Results

In 2004, 78,237 men and 71,666 women died from cancer in Great Britain. Of these, 7317 (4.9%) deaths (men: 6259 (8%); women: 1058 (1.5%)) were estimated to be attributable to work-related carcinogens for the six cancers assessed. Incidence estimates were 13,338 (4.0%) registrations (men: 11,284 (6.7%); women 2054 (1.2%)). Asbestos contributed over half the occupational attributable deaths, followed by silica, diesel engine exhaust, radon, work as a painter, mineral oils in metal workers and in the printing industry, environmental tobacco smoke (non-smokers), work as a welder and dioxins. Occupational exposure to solar radiation, mineral oils and coal tars/pitches contributed 2557, 1867 and 550 skin cancer registrations, respectively. Industries/occupations with large numbers of deaths and/or registrations include construction, metal working, personal and household services, mining (not metals), land transport and services allied to transport, roofing, road repair/construction, printing, farming, the Armed Forces, some other service industry sectors and manufacture of transport equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, non-ferrous metals and metal products, and chemicals.

Conclusions

Estimates for all but leukaemia are greater than those currently used in UK health and safety strategy planning and contrast with small numbers (200–240 annually) from occupational accidents. Sources of uncertainty in the estimates arise principally from approximate data and methodological issues. On balance, the estimates are likely to be a conservative estimate of the true risk. Long latency means that past high exposures will continue to give substantial numbers in the near future. Although levels of many exposures have reduced, recent measurements of others, such as wood dust and respirable quartz, show continuing high levels.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^a6fcbc0f]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases and cancers are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Reducing dietary saturated fat and replacing it with polyunsaturated fat is still the main dietary strategy to prevent cardiovascular diseases, although major flaws have been reported in the analyses supporting this approach. Recent studies introducing the concept of myocardial preconditioning have opened new avenues to understand the complex interplay between the various lipids and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The optimal dietary fat profile includes a low intake of both saturated and omega-6 fatty acids and a moderate intake of omega-3 fatty acids. This profile is quite similar to the Mediterranean diet. On the other hand, recent studies have found a positive association between omega-6 and breast cancer risk. In contrast, omega-3 fatty acids do have anticancer properties. It has been shown that certain (Mediterranean) polyphenols significantly increase the endogenous synthesis of omega-3 whereas high intake of omega-6 decreases it. Finally, epidemiological studies suggest that a high omega-3 to omega-6 ratio may be the optimal strategy to decrease breast cancer risk. Thus, the present high intake of omega-6 in many countries is definitely not the optimal strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease and cancers. A moderate intake of plant and marine omega-3 in the context of the traditional Mediterranean diet (low in saturated and omega-6 fatty acids but high in plant monounsaturated fat) appears to be the best approach to reduce the risk of both cardiovascular diseases and cancers, in particular breast cancer.

Obesity and cancer: oxidation and oxidative stress — one shared pathway is increased oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species, with oxidation potentially healthful or harmful; environmental contributors predominate in cancer causation, with as much as 90% of cancers attributed to environmental causes that often involve oxidative stress and tissue damage promoting initiation and progression; mechanistically, oxidative stress reflects an imbalance in redox status with increased release of tissue-damaging free radicals, and reactive oxygen species are unstable free radicals that damage DNA, RNA, and proteins and contribute to cell death; illustrative examples of oxidation include rust formation in iron, rancidity of therapeutic fish oils mitigated by vitamin E, and browning of cut apples due to oxidation of polyphenols.

### Marine polyunsaturated fatty acids and cancer therapy [^327a18d3]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Marine PUFAs

Marine PUFAs are divided into two classes: omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6); the n-3 and n-6 indicate the position of the first double bond with regard to the terminal methyl end of the molecule. The n-3 and n-6 PUFAs are stored in membrane phospholipids, and are responsible for numerous cellular functions including cell membrane structure, fluidity, signalling, and cell-to-cell interaction. They also regulate other bodily functions including blood pressure, blood clotting, and nervous system function and development. The n-3 and n-6 fatty acids are considered to be essential nutrients and are required in the diet. Although the synthesis of longer, more saturated n-3 fatty acids within human tissues is possible when provided with the precursor linolenic acid, the rate of synthesis to longer more unsaturated fatty acids in humans is limited. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) are long-chain n-3 fatty acids found in all fish species, with oily fish from cold climates containing the highest levels of EPA and DHA, although levels differ depending on a number of factors such as environment and fat content.

Arachidonic acid (AA) is a major intermediate derived from n-6 fatty acids that competes for the same metabolic pathway as EPA, as they are both catalysed by the same enzymes, and therefore when high levels of EPA are consumed in the diet, AA levels are reduced and in part substituted by EPA. The reverse also occurs when high levels of AA or low levels of EPA are consumed in the diet. In addition to playing important roles in cellular and bodily functions, n-3 and n-6 are precursors to eicosanoids that have a vital function in regulating inflammatory processes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are stored in cellular membranes, and are released via hydrolysis and esterification by phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) before metabolism into eicosanoids. Eicosanoids can be divided into four categories: prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, which differ in action depending on if they are a derivative of AA or EPA. Eicosanoids from AA are responsible for inducing pro-inflammatory, pro-arrhythmic, and vasoconstrictive responses, whereas eicosanoids from EPA have the contrasting effects of anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmia, and vasodilative responses.

### Oxidative rearrangement of (+)-sesamin by CYP92B14 co-generates twin dietary lignans in sesame [^b51e6fc7]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sesame (Sesamum indicum) has been cultivated since antiquity and charred sesame was found in a stratum dated at between 3050 and 3500 B.C. at an Indus Valley Civilization site. Sesame seed oil is a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, as well as lignans, which are phenylpropanoid-derived plant specialized metabolites chemically defined as monolignol dimers. (+)-Sesamin, (+)-sesamolin and (+)-sesaminol glucosides are the major lignans in sesame seed, and have attracted attention for their health-promoting activities. For example, (+)-sesamin is a phytoestrogen, a precursor of the mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol, and exhibits protective activity against breast and prostate cancers. The long-term consumption of (+)-sesaminol is believed to inhibit pathogenic extracellular β-amyloid aggregation associated with Alzheimer disease. Moreover, sesamol, a sesame lignan-related metabolite, has been related to photoprotective effect in UV-B irradiated lymphocytes, and repression of melanin biosynthesis by reducing cAMP-dependent tyrosinase activity. Lignans are often observed in the seeds of oil crops, such as olive, safflower, and flaxseed, as well as sesame, and have been implicated to be potent defense phytochemicals against microbes and other plant species. However, in sharp contrast to the wealth of knowledge on the biological activities of lignans in mammals, the physio-ecological roles of lignans in plants remain largely elusive.

### Dietary fats, blood pressure and artery health [^120a599a]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the evidence is unclear whether omega-6 vegetable oils high in linoleic acid increase blood pressure. However, there is some evidence that if linoleic acid is coming from industrial seed oils, there may be an increase in blood pressure as well as cardiovascular disease/mortality. The marine omega-3s EPA and DHA, extra virgin olive oil and possibly the parent omega-3 ALA may reduce the risk hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The antihypertensive effect of DHA may outweigh that of EPA which may due to a greater ability to improve endothelial function and arterial vasodilation.

### CAREX Canada: an enhanced model for assessing occupational carcinogen exposure [^cfb7e495]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

General results: prevalence and level of exposure, and data quality in Canada

Overall, CAREX Canada produced occupational prevalence estimates for 44 known and suspected carcinogens, and semiquantitative estimates of exposure levels for 18 of these agents. Table 1 outlines the results, categorised by IARC classifications. The data quality variable for each agent is also noted.

Table 1
Workplace exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, Canada, 2006

Overall, the most prevalent exposure in Canada was shift work (1.9 million exposed), followed by solar UVR exposure to outdoor workers (n = 1.5 million), diesel engine exhaust (n = 781 000) and benzene (n = 374 000). In terms of data quality, 24 (55%) of the 44 agents had low quality data (not enough information to assign exposure levels, or data too outdated to use) and 8 (18%) had moderate data quality (200–1000 workplace samples in the CWED or good quality qualitative data on exposure levels). Only 12 of the agents reviewed (27%) were classified as having high quality data (quantitative exposure level estimates possible, with > 1000 samples available in the CWED). More men than women were exposed to carcinogens; the mean percentage of men exposed by carcinogen was 79%, ranging from 27% for antineoplastic agents to 97% for polychlorinated biphenyls (see onlineS1 for more details).

Results are shown in table 2 for the 18 agents where exposure level estimates were calculated. For most agents, the greatest proportion of exposure tends to be located in the low exposure category. However, agents such as solar radiation, wood dust and artificial UV radiation display large proportions of workers in the high category of exposure.

Table 2
Exposure to known and suspected carcinogens by exposure level, Canada, 2006

Exposure prevalence by two-digit NAICS 2002 industry codes is shown in table 3. The total number of workers employed in each industry is also presented, as well as the top three exposure agents (ordered by prevalence). The number of exposures column indicates occurrences of exposure as opposed to individuals exposed. Although one person may very well be exposed to more than one agent, the exposures-per-worker metric gives an indication of the overall prevalence of exposure to known and suspected carcinogens. The mining and oil and gas extraction industry (NAICS 21) along with the construction industry (NAICS 23) are two notable instances where the exposures-per-worker exceed 1.0.

### Identifying occupational carcinogens: an update from the IARC monographs [^5eab1ab7]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Definitions

In the absence of a consensus definition of an occupational carcinogen, we developed the following criteria:
The agent is a defined substance, a mixture, or a type or source of radiation.
The agent is classified in IARC Group 1 with 'sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' in humans (to ensure that observed exposure-disease associations are causal).
'Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' in humans is obtained entirely or in part from epidemiologic studies of exposed workers (to ensure that the carcinogen has documented occupational exposure); the occurrence of exposure in workers is documented in the pertinent monograph.

Evaluations based on an occupational title, industry or production process without specification of causal agents were also recorded, but were considered separately since they are qualitatively different from the other classes of agents and afford limited opportunities for prevention. Furthermore, such evaluations are time sensitive given that processes, materials and exposures change over time. Infectious agents and pharmaceutical preparations, including botanicals, hormones and antineoplastic agents, were effectively excluded because the pertinent monographs did not provide information indicating occupational exposure. These exclusions also facilitate comparison with previous reviews by Doll and Petoand Siemiatycki et al.

Review and data extraction

Two of us (NG and DL) independently reviewed data for all of the 120 agents classified in Group 1 through October 2017 in volumes 1–120 of the IARC Monographs to identify entries that met the criteria defined above. These determinations were reviewed by a third person (KS) and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. For each included agent, we extracted data on the cancer sites for which the human evidence was classified as sufficient, where the classification was established on the basis of epidemiologic studies of workers, and where the occurrence of exposure in workers was documented in the monograph.

We also summarised agents across six broad classes adapted from Cogliano et al: chemicals; chemical mixtures; metals and metal compounds; airborne particles; airborne complex mixtures, and radiation and radionuclides. We grouped arsenic with the metals, although it is now considered to be a metalloid, to avoid creating of class containing a single agent.

Information on settings where occupational exposure is likely to occur, as described in the pertinent monograph, was extracted. Primary routes of exposure were also recorded for agents in categories other than radiation and radionuclides. If the monograph did not provide this information, we consulted other sources, most often the NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards.

Overall Evaluation

A major revision in the overall evaluation process was to allow for mechanistic data to be explicitly considered simultaneously along with evidence from studies of cancer in humans and in experimental animals. Previously, integration of mechanistic evidence usually occurred after the evaluation of human and experimental animal cancer evidence. In the revised Preamble, all three bodies of evidence are considered together and integrated according to the procedure in Table 2.

Table 2.
Integration of streams of evidence in reaching overall classifications

Another revision simplified the evaluation categories to encompass one of four groups (group 1, 2A, 2B, or 3; Box 2), rather than five (group 1, 2A, 2B, 3, or 4), as previously grouped. The IARC Monographs program selects agents for review only if there is evidence of human exposure and some evidence suggesting carcinogenicity. Therefore, the previous group 3 (not classifiable) and group 4 have been combined, and working groups are encouraged to add the statement that an agent is "probably not carcinogenic to humans" when warranted. For instance, this statement may be appropriate when multiple well-conducted and highly precise epidemiological studies did not find a positive association between the agent and cancer in humans. However, a definitive determination of an absence of any carcinogenic hazard to humans based on epidemiological studies requires assurances that all susceptible populations, exposure circumstances, cancer outcomes, and relevant variables be captured adequately in the body of available studies, which in practice is nearly impossible to attain. An evaluation as group 3 is not a determination of noncarcinogenicity or overall safety. It often means that the agent has unknown carcinogenic potential and there are prominent gaps in research.

### Best practices for the design, laboratory analysis, and reporting of trials involving fatty acids [^634f5ff1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Control/placebo oil

In all RCTs, examination of fatty acid profiles in the circulation is essential for assessment of both the degree of integrity of the experimental procedures and the compliance level of individual participants. It is important in such an evaluation to ensure that the oils chosen as treatments have an adequate span of fatty acid content in comparison with the control oil.

Ideally, the fatty acids of the control oil should mimic the common diet of the country where the trial is conducted unless the investigators are purposely manipulating the diet without use of a control, as would be the case with dietary fat replacement. Another point to consider in the rationale for choosing the appropriate control oil should be whether the participants have a special health condition, such as pregnancy, cardiovascular risk, or cancer. For instance, high intakes of n–6 linoleic acid directly suppress n–3 fatty acids at multiple levels. Using placebo oils with PUFAs very different to the population background diet, richer in n–6 or n–3 PUFAs, may shift metabolism, depending on dose and duration. The background diet of the study population should be considered when inferring effects to other populations, and in many cases may restrict application of the findings of the intervention to that specific population. A background diet containing the fatty acid of research interest can also affect the sample size required to achieve meaningful results. The commercial availability of fatty acid supplements can also cause compliance issues in treatment and control groups.

Critical to deciding the fatty acid composition of a control oil is the question of fat substitution. When replacing one type of fat in the control for another type in the intervention, the nontrivial issue of whether there is any effect on health risk biomarkers because of the addition of the test or the removal of the control oil must be considered. For instance, a PUFA-rich fat intervention test would be expected to lower cholesterol relative to a saturated fat control beyond that attributable PUFA relative to a control PUFA or monounsaturated oil. A possible solution is to use a low-fat control, thus enabling the biological impact of the test fat in the intervention to be assessed without being confounded by the action of removing the control fat. However, in that instance, either the effects of the reduced energy level or the change owing to other macronutrients may confound the assessment of the direct effect of the test fat on the biomarker of interest. Therefore, this issue of substitution of certain bioactive fatty acids for others has to be carefully examined when designing a clinical study and interpreting its results.

### Diets for health: goals and guidelines [^ff3aedc5]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Diet is the single most significant risk factor for disability and premature death. Patients and physicians often have difficulty staying abreast of diet trends, many of which focus primarily on weight loss rather than nutrition and health. Recommending an eating style can help patients make positive change. Dietary patterns that support health include the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Healthy Eating Plate. These approaches have benefits that include prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. These dietary patterns are supported by strong evidence that promotes a primary focus on unprocessed foods, fruits and vegetables, plant-based fats and proteins, legumes, whole grains, and nuts. Added sugars should be limited to less than 5% to 10% of daily caloric intake. Vegetables (not including potatoes) and fruits should make up one-half of each meal. Carbohydrate sources should primarily include beans/legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. An emphasis on monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, avocados, and nuts, and omega-3 fatty acids, such as flax, cold-water fish, and nuts, helps prevent cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline. A focus on foods rather than macronutrients can assist patients in understanding a healthy diet. Addressing barriers to following a healthy diet and utilizing the entire health care team can assist patients in following these guidelines.

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^e6ed41ee]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Moving from controversy to consensus

Two related issues have caused the most controversy about the relative roles of saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats and the evidence for making public health recommendations.

Since the 1960s, the evidence has suggested that replacing saturated fats in the diet with polyunsaturated fats reduces the risk of chronic disease and premature death. In practice this means replacing red and processed meat and high fat dairy with fish, nuts, and seeds, and replacing animal fats such as butter and lard with vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower, soy, rapeseed, or olive oils. The PREDIMED study, a large primary prevention randomised controlled trial on people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, reported that increased intake of extra virgin olive oil or nuts with a Mediterranean diet significantly reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease compared with a low fat dietary advice group. However, while the intake of unsaturated fats increased in both the olive oil and nut arms and may therefore have contributed to the clinical outcomes, there was no nutrient substitution for saturated fats and their intake was not reduced compared with the low fat dietary advice group. How this evidence should be interpreted and applied remains controversial.

Since 2000, clinical trials lasting up to two years have suggested that low carbohydrate diets in which total and saturated fat replaces the carbohydrate content of the diet have beneficial effects on overweight as well as on lipid risk factors such as HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (but not LDL cholesterol) and on risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Here, we ourselves disagree on the significance and interpretation of these trials because long term trial evidence is not available, definitions of low carbohydrate vary substantially across studies, and few clinical trial data exist on the incidence of clinical endpoints (see related article in this series on diet and management and prevention of type 2 diabetes).

These controversies arise largely because existing research methods cannot resolve them. In the current scientific model, hypotheses are treated with scepticism until they survive rigorous and repeated tests. In medicine, randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard in the hierarchy of evidence because randomisation minimises the number of confounding variables. Ideally, each dietary hypothesis would be evaluated by replicated randomised trials, as would be done for the introduction of any new drug. However, this is often not feasible for evaluating the role of diet and other behaviours in the prevention of non-communicable diseases.

### The IARC monographs: updated procedures for modern and transparent evidence synthesis in cancer hazard identification [^d508280a]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

The option of merging groups 2A and 2B was also considered to address the concern expressed by some stakeholders that these groups did not appear to be well distinguished. However, because group 2A and group 2B are based on distinctly different levels of strength of evidence, combining the groups would reduce the utility of the past and future evaluations. Recognizing the concern raised, the revised Preamble was enhanced with respect to the clarity and transparency for distinguishing between groups 2A and 2B, particularly with respect to how they differ in their indication of strength of evidence.

Whereas these modifications will clarify the bases of future evaluations, past evaluations will remain in effect. For example, group 2A evaluations that are based solely on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans according to the 2006 Preamble will not change. Agents may be reevaluated under the most recent Preamble when important additional scientific evidence becomes available.

Overall, the revised Preamble will enable the IARC to leverage recent scientific and procedural advancements in carcinogenesis and systematic review methodology. The advisory group recommended increased emphasis on mechanistic evidence and continued critical evaluation of epidemiological studies, including their exposure assessment methods, as well as the strengthening of the systematic review methodology. These developments, in turn, were taken forward in their recommendations to clarify and strengthen the process for integrating the three streams of evidence — human cancer studies, studies of cancer in experimental animals, and mechanistic studies and data — to reach an overall evaluation of carcinogenic hazard.

Looking to the future, implementing the updates in the revised Preamble will allow the IARC to transparently and consistently apply important advancements in carcinogen hazard identification pioneered in the Monograph s program, with the ultimate aim of more effectively serving the public health goal of cancer prevention.
