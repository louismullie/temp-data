## Question

African Americans Blood pressure treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about blood pressure treatment in African Americans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and pathophysiology that justify tailored strategies. Then, I should verify guideline-backed pharmacologic choices and when to use monotherapy versus combination therapy. Next, I will examine the evidence base, including ALLHAT, AASK, and contemporary trials, and reconcile any apparent contradictions. After that, I need to consider special populations such as CKD, diabetes, and older adults. Finally, I should integrate lifestyle, adherence, and system-level strategies to close control gaps, and close with a practical, stepwise algorithm that aligns with high-quality guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why race-informed strategies are emphasized. African Americans have higher prevalence, earlier onset, and greater severity of hypertension, with disproportionate rates of resistant hypertension and hypertensive complications including stroke, heart failure, and CKD progression, which collectively drive higher cardiovascular mortality and end-stage renal disease burden in this population [^f1209026] [^02dc024c] [^1df386cb].

> I need to check the pathophysiologic rationale that underpins drug selection. Low-renin, salt-sensitive physiology is more common in African Americans, which diminishes the antihypertensive efficacy of renin–angiotensin system blockade as monotherapy and strengthens the case for thiazide-type diuretics and calcium channel blockers as foundational agents, particularly when used in combination to overcome monotherapy limitations [^f4ab54ac] [^8d129a6f] [^f8718f3c].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on first-line pharmacotherapy. JNC 8 gives a moderate-strength recommendation that initial therapy in Black patients, including those with diabetes, should be a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker, reflecting ALLHAT data showing inferior BP control and higher stroke risk with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in Black participants [^f080eea5] [^6aaf7f16]. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly recommends against ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in African Americans, again citing ALLHAT and related evidence, and supports combination strategies when needed [^b52b5735] [^a62a7af0]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance here: this does not mean RAS blockers are contraindicated; rather, they should not be used alone as initial therapy in this population without a diuretic or CCB partner [^b52b5735].

> I will now examine the pivotal evidence. In ALLHAT, among 35% African American participants, chlorthalidone achieved better BP control than lisinopril and was associated with lower risks of stroke, heart failure, and combined cardiovascular disease; stroke risk was 51% higher with lisinopril versus amlodipine in Black patients, whereas no such excess was seen with the thiazide or CCB arms [^a3a6a6de] [^6aaf7f16]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: yes, the relative risk of stroke with ACE inhibitor monotherapy versus CCB was 1.51 in Black participants, which materially influenced guideline recommendations [^a3a6a6de].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or diabetic nephropathy. I should confirm the role of RAS blockade in those settings. The AASK trial demonstrated that an ACE inhibitor–based regimen slowed CKD progression in African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis more effectively than a CCB-based regimen, supporting the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in CKD, typically in combination with a thiazide or CCB for BP control, and this renal benefit is reflected in VA/DoD CKD guidance even as the monotherapy caveat remains [^765b332d] [^9d7cca5a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the renal indication is distinct from monotherapy efficacy for BP lowering, which is why combination therapy is standard in CKD [^9d7cca5a].

> Next, I should review contemporary combination therapy data. The CREOLE trial in sub-Saharan African patients showed that amlodipine-based combinations, either with hydrochlorothiazide or perindopril, outperformed perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide for BP control, reinforcing the concept that a CCB backbone improves early BP reduction in patients of African ancestry, while acknowledging that African American and native African populations are not identical and that local context matters [^431a547c] [^426400f6]. Let me consider the practical implication: this supports starting with or quickly moving to combination therapy when BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal or when monotherapy fails to achieve control [^436e72a2].

> I should double-check the monotherapy versus combination balance. Meta-analyses and contemporary reviews indicate that while thiazides and CCBs are the most effective monotherapy classes in African Americans, most patients ultimately require combination therapy to reach targets, and early combination can reduce therapeutic inertia and hasten control, which is particularly relevant given higher rates of resistant hypertension in this population [^f6bfe6c6] [^c3dc19fe] [^3f95558f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that ACE inhibitors have no role; that would be incorrect, as ACE inhibitors remain essential for CKD and are effective when combined with diuretics or CCBs, even if they underperform as monotherapy for BP lowering in low-renin phenotypes [^765b332d] [^e577ef9d].

> Let me think about special populations and targets. For older African Americans, I initially thought JNC 8 endorsed a systolic target of less than 150 mm Hg, but wait, I should verify that nuance. JNC 8 recommended less than 150/90 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or older in general, while some expert commentaries argued for maintaining less than 140/90 mm Hg in high-risk groups such as African Americans; in practice, many clinicians individualize toward less than 130/80 mm Hg when tolerated, especially with CKD, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease, aligning with broader risk-based strategies and SPRINT-era thinking, though SPRINT's direct applicability to older African Americans requires cautious interpretation [^a4680c5c] [^a114cb82]. For patients with sickle cell disease, ASH recommends a BP goal of 130/80 mm Hg or lower based on indirect evidence, which is more stringent than older thresholds and reflects the high burden of cardiopulmonary and renal complications in that population [^639b7c83].

> Next, I should review lifestyle and adherence strategies because medication choice alone will not close control gaps. Sodium restriction, weight loss, increased potassium intake, and physical activity yield larger average BP reductions in African Americans, and culturally tailored, multicomponent interventions that include home BP monitoring, nurse-led follow-up, and adherence support have demonstrated meaningful improvements in control, albeit with variable durability across settings [^16531810] [^973ee573] [^765d5bb6]. Hold on, I should verify that these interventions are feasible in routine care; yes, when embedded with team-based follow-up and feedback, they can reduce disparities, though sustained implementation remains challenging [^973ee573] [^765d5bb6].

> I need to ensure I address system-level levers to mitigate therapeutic inertia. Standardized protocols, fixed-dose combinations, registries, and rapid titration visits every 2 to 4 weeks can accelerate control and reduce racial disparities, as shown in large integrated systems and supported by VA/DoD guidance emphasizing structured follow-up and combination strategies when appropriate [^e6eff927] [^436e72a2]. Let me reconsider the role of race-agnostic algorithms: Kaiser Permanente's experience demonstrates that high control rates with minimal racial disparity are achievable using guideline-concordant, race-agnostic care pathways that prioritize early combination therapy and close follow-up, which supports moving beyond simplistic race-based monotherapy rules while still honoring the evidence that ACE inhibitor monotherapy is less effective in African Americans [^cd5bc321] [^b52b5735].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, confirm the diagnosis with accurate measurement and assess for secondary causes and target organ damage. Second, initiate lifestyle therapy universally and intensify sodium restriction given higher salt sensitivity prevalence. Third, for initial pharmacotherapy, prefer a thiazide-type diuretic or a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, and avoid ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy. Fourth, if BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal or if monotherapy fails to reach goal within about 4 to 6 weeks, add a second agent from a different class, typically a RAS blocker if CKD is present or a complementary class otherwise. Fifth, escalate to three or more agents as needed, consider spironolactone for resistant hypertension, and refer to hypertension specialists for refractory cases. Throughout, reassess adherence, adverse effects, and social determinants at each visit and adjust the plan accordingly [^f080eea5] [^436e72a2] [^45cf253f].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and reconcile any lingering contradictions. The weight of evidence supports avoiding ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in African Americans for uncomplicated hypertension due to attenuated BP response and worse cardiovascular outcomes in ALLHAT, while recognizing that RAS blockade remains indispensable for CKD and is effective when combined with diuretics or CCBs. Early combination therapy, aggressive lifestyle modification, and system-level protocols to overcome inertia are the most reliable pathways to close control disparities and improve outcomes in this high-risk population [^a3a6a6de] [^765b332d] [^c3dc19fe] [^e6eff927].

For African Americans with hypertension, **thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are first-line** [^f080eea5] because they achieve greater blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction than ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers as monotherapy [^a3a6a6de] [^d92cdaf6]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not recommended as initial monotherapy [^b52b5735] but should be added for CKD, diabetes, or heart failure [^a4680c5c] [^9d7cca5a]. Combination therapy is often needed [^c3dc19fe], and **early use of fixed-dose combinations** (CCB or thiazide plus ACEi/ARB) improves control and reduces disparities [^e6eff927] [^f6bfe6c6]. Lifestyle measures — especially sodium restriction, weight loss, and DASH — are essential and yield larger BP reductions in African Americans [^16531810] [^e10d2156]. Targets are generally < 130/80 mm Hg if tolerated, with < 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years per JNC 8 [^a4680c5c] [^45cf253f].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

African Americans more often have **salt-sensitive, low-renin hypertension** [^f4ab54ac], with greater vascular resistance and a higher risk of resistant hypertension [^8d129a6f]. This phenotype reduces the efficacy of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers as monotherapy [^4eca6d1b] [^d92cdaf6] and supports the use of thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers [^f080eea5].

---

## Recommended first-line pharmacological therapy

Current guidelines recommend **thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers as first-line** therapy for African Americans, including those with diabetes [^f080eea5] [^6aaf7f16].

| **Medication class** | **Rationale** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide diuretics | - Effective in salt-sensitive hypertension <br/> - Reduce cardiovascular events | - ALLHAT [^a3a6a6de] <br/> - JNC 8 [^f080eea5] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Effective in low-renin hypertension <br/> - Reduce stroke risk | - ALLHAT [^a3a6a6de] <br/> - JNC 8 [^f080eea5] |

---

## Limitations of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers

ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are **less effective as monotherapy** in African Americans [^4eca6d1b] [^d92cdaf6]. ACE inhibitors achieve smaller BP reductions and are associated with higher stroke and cardiovascular event rates in this population [^a3a6a6de] [^6aaf7f16]. Beta-blockers are also less effective for BP lowering and are not recommended as first-line unless there is a compelling indication (e.g. heart failure, ischemic heart disease) [^d92cdaf6] [^99afca8f].

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is often required to achieve BP targets [^c3dc19fe]. Early use of fixed-dose combinations (CCB or thiazide plus ACEi/ARB) improves control and reduces disparities [^e6eff927] [^f6bfe6c6]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are appropriate when indicated for CKD, diabetes, or heart failure [^a4680c5c] [^9d7cca5a].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes are essential and yield **greater BP reductions in African Americans** [^c3dc19fe]:

- **Sodium restriction**: Particularly effective due to salt sensitivity [^e10d2156] [^16531810].
- **Weight loss**: Modest weight loss significantly lowers BP [^fafc2485].
- **DASH diet**: Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy [^notfound].
- **Physical activity**: Regular aerobic exercise improves control [^notfound].

---

## Blood pressure targets

Targets are **generally < 130/80 mm Hg** if tolerated, with < 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years per JNC 8 [^a4680c5c] [^45cf253f]. Individualize targets based on comorbidities and tolerance [^a4680c5c].

---

## Barriers to effective treatment

Persistent disparities reflect **multifactorial barriers**:

- **Therapeutic inertia**: Less frequent intensification in African Americans [^notfound].
- **Adherence**: Higher rates of nonadherence due to side effects, costs, and social determinants [^ee434f53] [^cc011617].
- **Access**: Fewer healthcare resources and insurance coverage [^notfound].

---

## Strategies to improve outcomes

Effective strategies include:

- **Standardized protocols**: Reduce inertia and disparities [^e6eff927] [^1f76051b].
- **Team-based care**: Pharmacists, nurses, and community health workers improve control [^notfound].
- **Culturally tailored interventions**: Address adherence and social determinants [^cd5bc321] [^9ae07cc1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers [^f080eea5].
- **Avoid**: ACE inhibitor or beta-blocker monotherapy [^b52b5735] [^d92cdaf6].
- **Combination**: Early use of fixed-dose combinations when needed [^e6eff927] [^f6bfe6c6].
- **Lifestyle**: Sodium restriction, weight loss, DASH, physical activity [^16531810] [^e10d2156].
- **Targets**: < 130/80 mm Hg if tolerated; < 150/90 mm Hg for ≥ 60 years [^a4680c5c] [^45cf253f].

---

Thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are **first-line** for African Americans, with ACE inhibitors or ARBs reserved for specific indications; combination therapy and lifestyle change are often necessary to achieve targets and reduce disparities [^f080eea5] [^c3dc19fe].

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^18b99f42]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Management of high blood pressure in blacks: an update of the international society on hypertension in blacks consensus statement [^3a9729a6]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the "Management of High Blood Pressure in African American" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently < 135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤ 10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is > 15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥ 115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.

### Recognition and management of hypertension in older persons: focus on African Americans [^a114cb82]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hypertension is the most commonly diagnosed condition in persons aged 60 and older and is the single most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke), kidney disease, and dementia. More than half of individuals with hypertension in the United States are aged 60 and older. Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans, with all age groups, including elderly adults, having a higher burden of hypertension-related complications than other U.S.

Populations

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of blood pressure (BP) reduction on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with most of the evidence in individuals aged 60 and older. Several guidelines have recently been published on the specific management of hypertension in individuals aged 60 and older, including in high-risk groups such as African Americans. Most recommend careful evaluation, thiazide diuretics and calcium-channel blockers for initial drug therapy in most African Americans, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Among the areas of controversy is the recommended target BP in African Americans aged 60 and older. A recent U.S. guideline recommended raising the systolic BP target from less than 140 mmHg to less than 150 mmHg in this population. This article will review the evidence and current guideline recommendations for hypertension treatment in older African Americans, including the rationale for continuing to recommend a SBP target of less than 140 mmHg in this population.

### Update on hypertension in African-Americans [^f1209026]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in the U.S. is particularly prevalent and devastating among black individuals, who disproportionately suffer the consequences of this condition to a greater extent compared with persons in other racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, African Americans are often underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials, limiting the ability to reliably apply the results from many outcome studies in this specific population. In this review, we summarize and analyze the currently available evidence, specifically related to the risk factors, manifestations, complications and management of HTN in this often difficult-to-treat population. The aim of the review is to improve understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and identify the optimal approach to deliver the best care for African American patients.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^f2e79b06]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Decades of research have characterized the associations between elevated blood pressure and a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including cerebral vascular disease, heart failure (HF), and coronary heart disease (CHD). 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Among blood pressure–related deaths, published estimates suggest that approximately one third of excess CHD and all‐cause mortality can be attributed to elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) at levels designated as nonhypertensive, 6, 7 indicating that benefits achieved from decreases in blood pressure are not limited to populations with hypertension. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Experimental and observational studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle‐based blood pressure interventions, such as increased physical activity and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, for CVD prevention. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 This body of evidence supports the development of population‐wide interventions to reduce blood pressure alongside interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal for CVD reduction. 18

Several authors have estimated the theoretical effects of shifting the distribution of blood pressure, either by lowering the mean population blood pressure or by decreasing the proportion of the population classified as hypertensive. 8, 11, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Framingham Heart Study investigators reported that a 2‐mm Hg population‐wide diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduction was associated with an estimated 17% decrease in the prevalence of hypertension, and a 6% reduction in the risk of CHD. 19 Other published studies examined CHD and stroke events, but were conducted in predominantly white or European populations and considered blood pressure treatment guidelines no longer in use. 8, 19, 20, 23 The degree to which modest population‐wide blood pressure shifts may affect the incidence of HF also remains unknown, as do the effects of blood pressure shifts in African American populations, 19 who shoulder higher burdens of elevated blood pressure as well as CVD than do white populations. 1 Further, the majority of published studies estimated cardiovascular benefits from interventions that completely eliminated hypertension or uncontrolled hypertension from the population, despite the implausibility of such goals. 24, 25, 26 Therefore, in a biracial, population‐based setting, we assessed the impact of 2 types of pragmatic, hypothetical interventions on reducing the incidence of CHD, stroke, and HF after full implementation: a population‐wide intervention that reduced SBP by 1 or 2 mm Hg and targeted interventions that achieved a 10% reduction in the proportion of the population with unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal.

### Counseling African Americans to control hypertension: cluster-randomized clinical trial main effects [^dc3b3ec5]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Data are limited on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions targeted at blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive blacks who receive care in low-resource primary care practices.

Methods and Results

Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention condition (IC) or usual care (UC). Patients at the IC sites received patient education, home BP monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, whereas physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients' home BP readings and chart audits. Patients and physicians at the UC sites received printed patient education material and hypertension treatment guidelines, respectively. The primary outcome was BP control, and secondary outcomes were mean changes in systolic and diastolic BPs at 12 months, assessed with an automated BP device. A total of 1059 patients (mean age, 56 years; 28% men, 59% obese, and 36% with diabetes mellitus) were enrolled. The BP control rate was similar in both groups (IC = 49.3% versus UC = 44.5%; odds ratio, 1.21 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.63]; P = 0.21). In prespecified subgroup analyses, the intervention was associated with greater BP control in patients without diabetes mellitus (IC = 54.0% versus UC = 44.7%; odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1.02–2.06]); and small-sized community health centers (IC = 51.1% versus UC = 39.6%; odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1.04–2.45]).

Conclusions

A practice-based, multicomponent intervention was no better than UC in improving BP control among hypertensive blacks. Future research on the implementation of behavioral modification strategies for hypertension control in low-resource settings should focus on the development of more efficient and tailored interventions in this high-risk population.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^269f349a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Predicted benefits from blood pressure reductions estimated in a biracial, population‐based cohort showed that a modest population‐wide 1–mm Hg decrement in SBP could prevent substantial numbers of cardiovascular events. Interventions targeted to the population with blood pressure above goal that achieved a 10% proportional reduction in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure also achieved meaningful cardiovascular event reductions, but were of smaller magnitude. Of the 3 CVD outcomes investigated, hypothetical interventions that decreased SBP or blood pressure above goal had the greatest estimated impact on reducing HF incidence. With both intervention types, the estimated benefits of lowering blood pressure on CVD events were greater for African Americans compared to whites.

Decades of research have demonstrated that the medical management of blood pressure among hypertensive populations is effective in reducing the risk of CVD and addresses the medical responsibility to lower the risk of clinical events among those at highest risk. 7, 40, 41, 42 Accordingly, clinical and public health efforts to improve hypertension awareness, treatment, and control have translated into cardioprotective benefits, as shown between 1998 and 2008 when the mean SBP for US adults with hypertension declined by ≈10 mm Hg. 40 However, declines in SBP were largely limited to hypertensive populations, as the average SBP for the entire US population changed little over the same time span. 40

### Counseling African Americans to control hypertension (CAATCH) trial: a multi-level intervention to improve blood pressure control in hypertensive blacks [^df65e20f]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Despite strong evidence of effective interventions targeted at blood pressure (BP) control, there is little evidence on the translation of these approaches to routine clinical practice in care of hypertensive blacks. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel, multicomponent, evidence-based intervention compared with usual care in improving BP control among hypertensive blacks who receive care in community health centers. The primary outcomes are BP control rate at 12 months and maintenance of intervention 1 year after the trial. The secondary outcomes are within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) is a group randomized clinical trial with 2 conditions: intervention condition and usual care. Thirty community health centers were randomly assigned equally to the intervention condition group (n = 15) or the usual care group (n = 15). The intervention comprises 3 components targeted at patients (interactive computerized hypertension education, home BP monitoring, and monthly behavioral counseling on lifestyle modification) and 2 components targeted at physicians (monthly case rounds based on Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines, chart audit and provision of feedback on clinical performance and patients' home BP readings). All outcomes are assessed at quarterly study visits for 1 year. Chart review is conducted at 24 months to evaluate maintenance of intervention effects and sustainability of the intervention. Poor BP control is one of the major reasons for the mortality gap between blacks and whites. Findings from this study, if successful, will provide salient information needed for translation and dissemination of evidence-based interventions targeted at BP control into clinical practice for this high-risk population.

### Prevention and management of CVD in LMICs: why do ethnicity, culture, and context matter? [^6276728a]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventions for CVD: why drugs and models of care may need region-specific fine tuning

Similar to epidemiologic data on CVD, the evidence for its therapeutic interventions has largely been derived from high-income settings. However, just as CVD phenotypes may vary by race and ethnicity, so does the effectiveness of therapies for CVD and associated risk factors.

Clinicians have long recognized that antihypertensives have disparate blood pressure lowering effects by race/ethnicity, yet few observational studies or clinical trials have been designed to directly compare effectiveness across these strata. In fact, application of therapies without a trial has led to inappropriate treatment guidelines. For example, the South Asian ethnicity is characterized by high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, high propensity to diabetes, and low physical activity. Based on prior Western guidelines, the Indian Society of Hypertension advocated beta-blockers (which have all the side effects mentioned above) as the first line treatment. Furthermore, nuanced effects of combination antihypertensive therapy are often not apparent without race- or ethnicity-specific data; secondary subgroup analyses have demonstrated preliminary evidence for variable blood pressure-lowering results upon addition of a second antihypertensive agent, depending not only on the pharmacologic regimen but also on race/ethnicity. The recently completed CREOLE study represents one of the only examples of a study whose primary aim was to determine race-specific treatment strategies for high blood pressure. This study found that combination regimens, including calcium channel blockers, were more effective than a regimen based on renin-angiotensin system blockade and thiazide diuretics in sub-Saharan Africa. None of these studies have been launched to compare initial blood pressure treatment strategies in other races or ethnicities. Clearly, the differential effects of pharmacologic agents on blood pressure by race can influence the downstream risk for CVD events, perhaps most famously shown by the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which African Americans in the renin-angiotensin blockers arm experienced higher risk for strokes and other CVD events.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^f4bd5faa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The large cardioprotective benefits associated with the medical management of blood pressure led earlier studies to evaluate the hypothetical impact of 100% elimination of hypertension on the incidence of CVD through metrics like the population‐attributable fraction. 24, 26 For reference, our results suggested that if 100% of aware and treated blood pressure above goal was controlled among African American and whites aged 45 to 64 years of age, ≈20 154 CHD events could be prevented annually in the United States, consistent with recently published estimates using the JNC 8 guidelines. 24 Despite considerable clinical and public health efforts to improve hypertension management, no historical precedent is available for achieving 100% control; instead, nationally representative estimates suggested that ≈43.5% of adults with treatment‐eligible hypertension are not treated to goal. 43 As an alternative, we estimated event reductions achieved by modest, but plausible decreases in the proportion of the population classified as having unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal. As expected, full implementation of interventions that achieved 10% changes in unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal were estimated to prevent considerably fewer CVD events than fully implemented interventions assuming 100% elimination of blood pressure above goal. This discrepancy reflects the proportion of the population for whom we assume a successful intervention. For example, in a population of 100 000 (prevalence of blood pressure above goal 20%; composed of 40% unaware, 14% aware but untreated, and 46% aware treated but uncontrolled), a successful intervention that reduced uncontrolled blood pressure above goal by 10% would target ≈920 people compared to the substantially larger population of 20 000 people targeted by an intervention assuming 100% elimination of blood pressure above goal.

### Women, hypertension, and the systolic blood pressure intervention trial [^df3ab839]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension accounts for approximately 1 in 5 deaths in American women and is the major contributor to many comorbid conditions. Although blood pressure lowering reduces cardiovascular disease outcomes, considerable uncertainty remains on best management in women. Specifically, female blood pressure treatment goals have not been established, particularly among older and African American and Hispanic women, for whom hypertension prevalence, related adverse outcomes, and poor control rates are high. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) planned to clarify optimal blood pressure management in both sexes. Although confirming that a lower blood pressure goal is generally better, because female enrollment and event rates were low and follow-up shortened, outcomes differences in women were not statistically significant. Thus optimal blood pressure goals for women have not been established with the highest evidence. This review addresses SPRINT's significance and key remaining knowledge gaps in optimal blood pressure management to improve women's health.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^e10d2156]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — ancestry differences and physical activity research needs note that persons of African ancestry are disproportionately represented in CKD populations, and prior systematic reviews suggest that reductions in sodium intake may result in larger reductions in BP in persons of African and Asian ancestry compared to Caucasians, while it is uncertain whether such racial differences occur in CKD and should be evaluated in future studies. There is a paucity of data on factors that could identify which CKD patients gain the greatest or least BP benefit from physical activity interventions or are at greater risk for harm, and identification of these factors and algorithms to tailor physical activity intensity and supervision to individual CKD patients is needed.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^3394adf6]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the leading global risk factor for death, accounting for 13% of mortality. Recent epidemiological trends show that the burden of disease in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has overtaken many European and North American states. In large urban areas, 30–50% of adults are classed as hypertensive; prevalence in rural areas is 15–25%. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, which accounts for up to 11% of adult deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. Management of both the acute and chronic consequences of hypertension remains poorly optimised across much of the continent, with delays in the presentation, limited access to diagnostic imaging services and rudimentary follow-up care.

Only 25% of countries have a national framework for hypertension, and just 7% of those with hypertension in Africa achieve control. The Pan-African Society for Cardiovascular Disease guidelines provide a roadmap towards the WHO non-communicable disease target of 25% reduction in high blood pressure by 2025. Though pragmatic, these are predominantly based upon European and American guidelines, with little reference to research conducted on the continent. It is well established that black people living in the Northern Hemisphere respond differently to antihypertensive agents compared to white populations due to a variety of phenotypic differences including lower circulating renin and higher concentrations of skeletal muscle creatine kinase. Studies in African-Americans are not necessarily generalisable to SSA populations, due to both genetic diversity and contrasting environmental settings. Emerging evidence suggests that hypertension in SSA is more severe, more resistant to treatment and more likely to lead to premature morbidity and mortality. Additionally, many African states are resource-limited and focus on public health strategies on maximising distribution of a restricted formulary, to minimise costs and improve consistency of services. Delivery of care is common by lower-skilled healthcare workers, especially in rural localities, and access to medical care may require high out-of-pocket expenditure.

There have been no systematic reviews to comprehensively synthesise the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of hypertension in SSA. African populations are also underrepresented in global trials and meta-analysis. Two previous reviews do make some specific reference to the continent; however, comparisons are limited to monotherapy only. In light of this, we aimed to review the evidence for all common pharmacological treatments, for persons living in SSA, with regard to both the reduction in blood pressure and prevention of associated cardiovascular disease.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^99e74497]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Our results highlight the potential of population‐wide SBP reduction approaches to complement interventions targeted to clinically defined populations with blood pressure above goal. Interventions targeting the US white populations with uncontrolled blood pressure would need to achieve approximately a 30% proportional reduction in uncontrolled blood pressure in order to achieve event reduction comparable to those estimated for population‐wide interventions that achieve a 1‐mm Hg shift in SBP. African American populations, among whom blood pressure elevation occurs at earlier ages and show elevated rates of CVD in the United States, 1, 40 likely would reap the greatest benefits of population‐wide and targeted above goal blood pressure interventions, particularly for uncontrolled blood pressure, suggesting that both types of interventions have potential for reducing these persistent health disparities.

The strengths of this study include the use of a large, biracial cohort with high retention and quality assurance protocols over an average of 20 years of follow‐up. There also are several limitations that deserve consideration. First, the ARIC cohort may not be fully generalizable to the US population, particularly for African Americans participants, who were primarily recruited from Jackson, Mississippi and Forsyth County, North Carolina; other US minority groups were not represented in this study. The ARIC study was also restricted to participants aged 45 to 64 years at study baseline. Additionally, several studies suggest that the national incidence of CVD events has changed since the 1980s, with the incidence of CHD and stroke declining and the incidence of HF increasing, 1, 50, 51 which may over‐ or underestimate the number of events reduced by population‐wide and targeted blood pressure interventions. Secondly, we assumed the same incidence rate reduction when calculating the number of events that could be prevented from interventions that targeted unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal. We also estimated separate intervention effects, for unaware, untreated, and uncontrolled blood pressure above goal, although in practice, these interventions would likely be promoted in combination and associated with target‐specific IRDs. Third, if future guidelines, following the results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), reduce the thresholds for treatment or goal for blood pressure control, interventions that reduce untreated or uncontrolled blood pressure could result in substantially larger reductions in events. 52 Despite these limitations, few studies have evaluated pragmatic blood pressure interventions and even fewer have included African Americans, who shoulder historic blood pressure and CVD disparities, positioning this study to contribute increased understanding of the population management of elevated blood pressure.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^d27f3537]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The burden of hypertension is rising rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), posing significant health challenges and economic costs that hinder national development. Despite being well-studied in clinical medicine, the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in SSA remain inadequate. This is due to barriers across the care continuum, including individual-, provider-, and system-level obstacles within the health system. A critical issue is the lack of contextualized mechanistic research to understand the mechanisms, phenotypes, and treatment responses in native SSA populations. Current treatment approaches are often based on data from diaspora Africans, particularly African Americans. Consequently, most guidelines do not recommend angiotensin system drugs as first-line agents for Black patients, a stance that should be reconsidered given some evidence of their effectiveness in native SSA populations. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy that includes both preventative and clinical measures at the population and individual levels. Preventative approaches should encompass health and nutrition education, improving food supply quality, and implementing comprehensive transportation and environmental policies. In addition, strategies should be developed to increase the detection of undiagnosed cases through enhanced screening and treatment access to those not receiving care, and revisit current treatment approaches to ensure that they are more tailored to the specific populations and settings. In conclusion, innovative strategies are needed to identify and overcome barriers to hypertension diagnosis and management. A coordinated, multisectoral approach that includes a contextualized mechanistic research agenda, as well as task shifting and task sharing, will help prevent and reduce hypertension in SSA.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^290af62e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

blood pressure reduction policies are largely restricted to hypertensive populations and associated benefits are often estimated based on unrealistic interventions.

Methods and Results

We used multivariable linear regression to estimate incidence rate differences contrasting the impact of 2 pragmatic hypothetical interventions to reduce coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure incidence: (1) a population‐wide intervention that reduced systolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg and (2) targeted interventions that reduced the prevalence of unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal (per Eighth Joint National Committee treatment thresholds) by 10%. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (n = 15 744; 45 to 64 years at baseline, 1987–1989), incident coronary heart disease and stroke were adjudicated by physician panels. Incidentwas defined as the first hospitalization with discharge diagnosis code of "428". A 10% proportional reduction in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal resulted in ≈4.61, 3.55, and 11.01 fewerevents per 100 000 person‐years in African Americans, and 3.77, 1.63, and 4.44 fewerevents per 100 000 person‐years, respectively, in whites. In contrast, a 1 mm Hg population‐wide systolic blood pressure reduction was associated with 20.3 and 13.3 fewerevents per 100 000 person‐years in African Americans and whites, respectively. Estimated event reductions for coronary heart disease and stroke were smaller than for, but followed a similar pattern for both population‐wide and targeted interventions.

Conclusions

Modest population‐wide shifts in systolic blood pressure could have a substantial impact on cardiovascular disease incidence and should be developed in parallel with interventions targeting populations with blood pressure above goal.

Background

US blood pressure reduction policies are largely restricted to hypertensive populations and associated benefits are often estimated based on unrealistic interventions.

Methods and Results

We used multivariable linear regression to estimate incidence rate differences contrasting the impact of 2 pragmatic hypothetical interventions to reduce coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure (HF) incidence: (1) a population-wide intervention that reduced systolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg and (2) targeted interventions that reduced the prevalence of unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal (per Eighth Joint National Committee treatment thresholds) by 10%. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (n = 15 744; 45 to 64 years at baseline, 1987–1989), incident coronary heart disease and stroke were adjudicated by physician panels. Incident HF was defined as the first hospitalization with discharge diagnosis code of "428". A 10% proportional reduction in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal resulted in ≈4.61, 3.55, and 11.01 fewer HF events per 100,000 person-years in African Americans, and 3.77, 1.63, and 4.44 fewer HF events per 100 000 person-years, respectively, in whites. In contrast, a 1 mm Hg population-wide systolic blood pressure reduction was associated with 20.3 and 13.3 fewer HF events per 100 000 person-years in African Americans and whites, respectively. Estimated event reductions for coronary heart disease and stroke were smaller than for HF, but followed a similar pattern for both population-wide and targeted interventions.

Conclusions

Modest population-wide shifts in systolic blood pressure could have a substantial impact on cardiovascular disease incidence and should be developed in parallel with interventions targeting populations with blood pressure above goal.

### Targeting multivariable risks: an opportunity for population high blood pressure control [^b56e28c7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Elevated blood pressure has been recognized since the early 20th century as an indicator of adverse cardiovascular risk and mortality, with increased rates of disease with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Results from early hypertension treatment studies from the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents determined that treating and lowering blood pressure levels among patients with high blood pressure was associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and stroke risks. These successful blood pressure reductions and adverse risk outcomes were demonstrated in the population as a whole, leading to strategies for hypertension control. These strategies for population and clinical programs focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and control of hypertension are associated with the consistent lowering of systolic blood pressure distributions from 1960 to 2010 in the United States. Further, the shifting in blood pressure distributions to the left was associated with the significant reduction in stroke mortality and stroke risks in the population. Hypertension treatment and control was attributed as the greatest factor for population risk reduction and most effective in accelerated blood pressure reduction. While the lowering of blood pressure levels has been recognized as one of the major public health successes of the past 50 years, optimal treatment and control has yet to be obtained. Lloyd-Jones and colleagues, in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association, provide a valuable assessment of cardiovascular events and the level of blood pressure with implications for improved hypertension control and risk reduction. Specifically, the investigator team has advocated for a multiple risk factor assessment and profile for the treatment of elevated blood pressure to maximize cardiovascular disease risks.

This report is timely and contributes to the evidence gap essential in the development of strategies, clinical guidelines, and interventions for elevated blood pressure. In particular, the consideration and assessment of multiple risk factors has become a valuable clinical component in the management of high blood pressure. Specifically, the risk of cardiovascular disease increase with the number of risk factors and comorbid conditions. Likewise, treatment effects of from antihypertensive agents vary by the levels of risks and comorbid conditions. These differences in risks and benefits are associated with therapy regimens that are specific to multiple factors and comorbid conditions. Complicating the recommendations of high blood pressure treatment based on risks is the variation in level of risks by population demographics including race, sex, age, and geography. The significant differences in risk profiles for blood pressure levels by race has implications for target blood pressure levels, blood pressure treatment initiation levels, types of therapy, and treatment intensity.

### Implications of ethnicity for the treatment of hypertensive kidney disease, with an emphasis on African Americans [^1df386cb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

The recognition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an important public health issue has fostered an increasing number of strategies to increase CKD awareness and to reduce both the prevalence and the complications of CKD. Despite these advances, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular events remain the major complications of CKD. Although the ESRD epidemic is attributed in greater part to the increasing rate of diabetes, hypertension remains the second most common reported cause of ESRD and is present in approximately 90% of cases of diabetes-related ESRD. The disproportionately high prevalence of hypertension in ethnic minorities, as well as the difficulty of achieving adequate blood-pressure control in these populations, contributes substantially to the high rate of CKD progression and complications in these groups. Although the role of hypertension as a primary cause of CKD is debated, hypertension is commonly recognized as the most important CKD progression factor. Important differences have been reported in the degree and likelihood of blood-pressure response to antihypertensive medications between ethnic groups, but ethnicity seems to be less important as a determinant of clinical outcomes. In this Review we examine key ethnic variations in hypertensive CKD in terms of pathophysiology, response to antihypertensive therapy, clinical outcomes, and evidence-based recommendations for blood-pressure control, with an emphasis on African Americans.

### Blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy and risk for renal injury in African-Americans [^765b332d]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

African-Americans are more likely than Caucasians to develop hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. Elevations in blood pressure levels clearly potentiate pre-existing renal disease and also contribute to kidney injury independently of other primary renal diseases in this cohort. Until recently, data relevant to a full examination of the issue of blood pressure levels and end-stage renal disease in African-Americans have largely been from post-hoc analyses of clinical trials or from small, prospective, short-term studies.

Recent Findings

The most recent United States Renal Data Systems data show hypertension as the primary cause of end-stage renal disease in African-Americans until 1997, diabetes now being the most prevalent etiology. Data from post-hoc analyses of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study demonstrated that African-Americans with a mean arterial pressure above 98 mmHg had a higher risk of end-stage renal disease than Caucasians. The African-American Study of Kidney Disease tested the hypothesis that a blood pressure well below the usual recommended level will further reduce renal disease progression in African-Americans. The study concluded that a blood pressure lower than that needed to reduce cardiovascular events, as defined by the Sixth Joint National Committee Report on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, i.e. 135–140/80–85 mmHg, will not further slow renal disease progression in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen of blood pressure lowering anchored on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antihypertensive agents that are touted as ineffective in African-Americans, was more effective than one based on either beta-blockers or dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers in slowing the progression of renal injury.

Summary

Systolic blood pressure reduction in the range 130–139 mmHg is appropriate to reduce risk of nephropathy progression and cardiovascular risk in African-Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Moreover, a regimen that is initiated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should be the antihypertensive treatment of choice in African-Americans with kidney disease.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^426400f6]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Wider context

Akin to African-Americans, calcium channel blockers appear to be the most efficacious single agents in African patients. Vascular smooth muscle contractility in those of African descent is purportedly governed by higher concentrations of creatine kinase and lower nitric oxide, pertaining to dual targets for CCBs, which both decrease CK and increase nitrous oxide. However, this has not been verified in SSA participants. Our finding of CCBs' superiority is thus important in supporting consensus from both Pan-African guidance and global public health initiatives.

Similarly, early initiation of combination therapy is a key pillar of the most recent hypertension guidelines. Advantages of combination therapy include tighter, earlier blood pressure control and reduction in dose-dependent side effects, plus augmentation of class effects. Addition of CCBs or diuretics can override the ineffectiveness of ACEi/ARBs in a low-renin/salt sensitivity phenotype, typical of those with African heritage. Our results, predominantly based on the data from CREOLE, support using a CCB backbone combined with ACEi or thiazide diuretic. Policymakers may be keen to adopt a 'magic bullet' solution with a single top choice option for both mono and combination therapy aiding drug procurement and distribution as well as task-shifting in constrained health services. Whilst this is understandable, it would not take account of the heterogeneity in population risk factors and the potential benefits of drug classes outside of their direct effect on blood pressure. For example, none of the studies in our review included participants with co-existing cardiovascular or renal disease, patients in whom treatment with ACEi may be more appropriate than other blood pressure-lowering therapies.

### Racial differences in two self-management hypertension interventions [^765d5bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Only one half of Americans have their blood pressure controlled, and there are significant racial differences in blood pressure control. The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of 2 patient-directed interventions designed to improve blood pressure control within white and non-white subgroups (African Americans, 49%).

Methods

Post hoc analysis of a 2 by 2 randomized trial with 2-year follow-up in 2 university-affiliated primary care clinics was performed. Within white and non-white patients (n = 634), 4 groups were examined: 1) usual care; 2) home blood pressure monitoring (3 times per week); 3) tailored behavioral self-management intervention administered via telephone by a nurse every other month; and 4) a combination of the 2 interventions.

Results

The overall race by time by treatment group effect suggested differential intervention effects on blood pressure over time for whites and non-whites (systolic blood pressure, P = 0. 08; diastolic blood pressure, P = 0.01). Estimated trajectories indicated that among the 308 whites, there was no significant effect on blood pressure at 12 or 24 months for any intervention compared with the control group. At 12 months, the non-whites (n = 328) in all 3 intervention groups had systolic blood pressure decreases of 5.3 to 5.7 mm Hg compared with usual care (P < .05). At 24 months, in the combined intervention, non-whites had sustained lower systolic blood pressure compared with usual care (7.5 mm Hg; P < .02). A similar pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusion

Combined home blood pressure monitoring and a tailored behavioral phone intervention seem to be particularly effective for improving blood pressure in non-white patients.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^066d22b4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We then contrasted the hypothetical population‐wide SBP reduction with interventions targeted to populations with blood pressure above goal that achieved a 10% proportional reduction in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure. For example, before intervention, 26.4% of African Americans and 11.9% of whites 45 to 64 years of age were classified as having blood pressure above goal (NHANES 2009–2012; Table 5); we therefore evaluated a targeted intervention that achieved a 10% proportional decrease in unaware blood pressure above goal (ie, 20% to 18% among African Americans and 40% to 36% among whites, respectively) resulting in post‐intervention proportions of blood pressure above goal of 25.84% for African Americans and 11.41% for whites (Table 5). Similar to results from the population‐wide SBP interventions, 10% proportional reductions in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal produced the largest reduction in events for HF, the magnitude of which varied by race (Table 6, Figure 3). Specifically, a 10% proportional reduction in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal at study baseline resulted in ≈4.61 (95% CI: 2.50–7.36), 3.55 (95% CI: 1.79–5.73), and 11.01 (95% CI: 6.17–17.52) fewer HF events per 100 000 PY, respectively, in African Americans and 3.77 (95% CI: 1.88–6.51), 1.63 (95% CI: 0.65–3.04), and 4.44 (95% CI: 2.49–6.81) fewer HF events per 100 000 PY, respectively, in whites (Table 6, Figure 3). If 10% proportional reductions in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal were achieved nationwide in African Americans and white populations aged 45 to 64, ≈2200, 1017, and 3164 fewer incident HF events, respectively, could be prevented annually; ≈1390, 650, and 2016 incident CHD and 962, 497, and 1505 stroke events would be prevented annually given 10% proportional reductions in unaware, untreated, or uncontrolled blood pressure above goal, respectively (Table 7).

### A 41-year-old African American man with poorly controlled hypertension: review of patient and physician factors related to hypertension treatment adherence [^710c5d4b]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Mr R is an African American man with a long history of poorly controlled hypertension and difficulties with adherence to recommended treatments. Despite serious complications such as hypertensive emergency requiring hospitalization and awareness of the seriousness of his illness, Mr R says at times he has ignored his high blood pressure and his physicians' recommendations. African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and its complications. Although most pharmacological and dietary therapies for hypertension are similarly efficacious for African Americans and whites, disparities in hypertension treatment persist. Like many patients, Mr R faces several barriers to effective blood pressure control: societal, health system, individual, and interactions with health professionals. Moreover, evidence indicates that patients' cognitive, affective, and attitudinal factors and the patient-physician relationship play critical roles in improving outcomes and reducing racial disparities in hypertension control.

### Impact of antihypertensive drug classes on cardiovascular outcomes: insights from the STEP study [^f916370b]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a significant global health concern, particularly in China and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and mortality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs effectively reduces major cardiovascular events and mortality; this benefit is primarily attributed to the extent of blood pressure reduction rather than the specific properties of individual drug classes. However, different classes of antihypertensive drugs have been reported to exert distinct effects on specific cardiovascular outcomes.

Despite extensive research, evidence on comparative effectiveness of different antihypertensive drug classes remains inconsistent, and clinical guidelines vary significantly. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Treatment Guidelines recommended thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as first-line agents. The 2023 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines provide a comparable broad recommendation, but also include beta-blockers as first-line option. The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline recommends ACEIs or ARBs as first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, or for adults younger than 55 years who are not of Black African or African Caribbean family origin; for all other patient groups, CCBs are recommended. These inconsistencies highlight the need for further research to identify which antihypertensive drug class provides the most favourable cardiovascular outcomes and should be prioritised as the optimal first-line antihypertensive therapy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether prolonged exposure to specific antihypertensive drug classes is associated with a reduced risk of composite cardiac outcome in individuals with well-controlled blood pressure, using data from the STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) trial.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^8d129a6f]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients of African ancestry tend to suffer from more severe hypertension, characterized by enhanced vascular contractility and salt retaining capacity, therapy resistance, and higher morbidity and mortality of the condition and its complications. Because of the need for individual treatment options, as well as the increasing objections to the use of ancestry as a surrogate marker for therapeutic responses, we systematically gathered evidence on biomarkers that may predict the response of individual persons of African ancestry to different types of antihypertensive drugs. However, pharmacogenomics yield heterogeneous, insufficient evidence, and the low renin levels found with greater frequency in patients of African ancestry do not, or do not adequately, predict responses to antihypertensive drugs. Finally, there are no convincing clinical data yet of the emerging paradigm that low NO bioavailability and associated high cellular ATP buffer capacity predict the response to specific antihypertensive drugs. Currently, self-identified ethno-geographic ancestry remains the best available predictor of blood pressure lowering responses to antihypertensive drugs.

### Hypertension in blacks: insights from Africa [^0701d975]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Although the consequences of hypertension are universal, blacks (African-Americans or indigenous Africans) have been the subject of a differential approach to causation, outcome, and treatment. Blacks have a greater propensity to salt sensitivity and suppressed plasma renin suggesting a predisposition to sodium retention. Target organ damage is more frequent and blood pressure is more difficult to control. We explore potential underlying causes, both genetic and environmental, particularly in the South African population, and propose a more physiological approach to the treatment of resistant hypertension in blacks.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^f4ab54ac]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Salt-sensitive and low-renin hypertension

Lastly, though not addressed in most guidelines, patients with salt-sensitive hypertension and/or low-renin hypertension have characteristics that lend themselves well to treatment with a diuretic. In most cases, low levels of renin are an indication that the RAS is suppressed because of volume overload and sodium retention. In such patients, as well as in salt-sensitive patients, treatment with diuretics, which reduce volume and increase sodium excretion, would be expected to be efficacious, whereas treatment with RAS inhibitors would be expected to suppress the RAS further. In fact, in the few clinical trials that have looked at patients with low-plasma renin activity and/or salt sensitivity, effective blood pressure lowering strategies include HCTZ, chlorthalidone, indapamide, or spironolactone.

As salt-sensitive hypertension is especially common in black patients, older adults, and in patients with more severe blood pressure or with comorbidities, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease and as low-renin hypertension is particularly common in African Americans, the elderly, and patients with resistant hypertension, it is not surprising that diuretics have been shown to be particularly effective in these patient populations.

### Hypertension treatment in blacks: discussion of the U.S. clinical practice guidelines [^d31e6e65]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Blacks are especially susceptible to hypertension (HTN) and its associated organ damage leading to adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, HTN is particularly significant in contributing to the black-white racial differences in health outcomes in the US. As such, in order to address these health disparities, practical clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on how to treat HTN, specifically in blacks, are needed. This review article is a timely addition to the literature because the most recent U.S. CPG more explicitly emphasizes race into the algorithmic management of HTN. However, recent clinical research cautions that use of race as a proxy to determine therapeutic response to pharmaceutical agents may be erroneous. This review will address the implications of the use of race in the hypertension CPGs. We will review the rationale behind the introduction of race into the U.S. CPG and the level of evidence that was available to justify this introduction. Finally, we will conclude with practical considerations in the treatment of HTN in blacks.

The primary end point was a comparison of the average reduction in 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. Secondary end points included a comparison of average 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure, office SBP or DBP reduction, responder rates, safety, and tolerability. Conclusion The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the 3 dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are equivalent in African Americans with stages 1 and 2 hypertension. IN THE US adult population, hypertension is a common condition, affecting 43 million people. 1, 2 The age-adjusted prevalence is particularly high in African Americans. Awareness and treatment rates have improved during the last 2 decades, but only 27% to 29% of all hypertensive patients have attained systolic blood pressure levels below 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP levels below 90 mm Hg.

Long-acting calcium channel blockers are among the drugs recommended by the Joint National Committee for the Treatment of Hypertension. 2 A recent Veterans Affairs study showed that these drugs are effective when prescribed as monotherapy for white and African American patients with hypertension. 3 Among hypertensive African Americans, monotherapy with CCBs appears to be superior to that with β-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in achieving BP reduction. 4–7. The design of the study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase 4 clinical trial comparison of 3 dihydropyridine CCBs. African American men and women with average DBP from 95 to 110 mm Hg and SBP from 140 to 179 mm Hg were eligible for randomization. Eligibility was determined after receiving no antihypertensives for at least 3 weeks, during which time compliance to placebo was at least 80% by pill counts.

The results indicate that any differences in the 8-week efficacy of 3 broadly used CCBs in African Americans are relatively small at the prescribed doses. Each produced an overall reduction of 19 to 22 mm Hg in office visit SBP and 12 to 14 mm Hg in office visit DBP. Any overall differences in hemodynamic responses were small, and the 3 drugs were equally effective in reducing BP.

### Treatment strategies to control blood pressure in people with hypertension in tanzania and Lesotho: a randomized clinical trial [^3c202c6f]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affected 1.3 billion people worldwide in 2023. In Africa, the prevalence of hypertension is 25% to 30%, and 7% to 15% of individuals with hypertension have controlled blood pressure. Treatment recommendations for African people are extrapolated from studies including African American or Afro-Caribbean individuals with different genetic background, lifestyle, environmental factors, and drug availability.,

Until recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended to start treatment with a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker (CCB) alone. After data from high-income settings demonstrated superiority of combination regimens, the WHO updated the recommendation to start an antihypertensive dual combination therapy in 2021. In Africa, Comparison of Three Combination Therapies in Lowering Blood Pressure in Black Africans (CREOLE) was the first large-scale clinical trial to compare combination antihypertensives in people with uncontrolled hypertension not receiving treatment or taking monotherapy. Amlodipine-containing combination therapies with either hydrochlorothiazide or perindopril were superior to perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. In Africa, combination therapies have not been compared with stepped-care approaches (ie, starting monotherapy and sequentially adding other drugs) in large trials. It remains unclear whether starting a low-dose triple combination is superior in terms of clinical efficacy and tolerability compared with a stepped-care approach.

We conducted the Identifying Strategies to Control Arterial Hypertension in Sub-Saharan Africa (coArtHA) randomized clinical trialto compare 3 treatment strategies among persons with untreated hypertension in Lesotho and Tanzania. We hypothesized that a 2-pill strategy starting a CCB and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) at lower doses would be noninferior compared with high-dosed CCB monotherapy as an initial strategy, with stepped escalation to add hydrochlorothiazide if needed, and that a low-dose 3-pill strategy containing low-dose CCB, ARB, and hydrochlorothiazide would be superior for blood pressure control, reduce adverse effects, and prevent hypertension-mediated organ damage compared with starting CCB monotherapy.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^a1e292ab]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects 47% of adults in the United States (US). Despite decades of Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines and public health campaigns, hypertension remains a leading cause of stroke, heart, and kidney disease. Across the hypertension control cascade, stark inequities exist: hypertension disproportionately impacts people of color, individuals of low socioeconomic status, and uninsured populations, contributing to higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities. Hypertension therefore provides a useful case study for assessing the way guidelines utilize race in treatment algorithms. To better understand how hypertension guidelines have conceptualized and applied race, we conducted a systematic scoping review of adult US hypertension guidelines.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^431a547c]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Role of Race in Antihypertensive Therapy

Although hypertension is one of the most extensively studied diseases in clinical medicine, much of our current understanding of its etiological drivers, resultant phenotypes, and treatment approaches in native Black Africans is derived from studies in diaspora Africans, particularly African Americans. Extrapolating these findings to native Africans may not be justified. This is due to differences in cardiovascular risk profiles, socioeconomic status, and responses to antihypertensive treatment between African Americans and other Black populations, especially native Africans. Critically, studies on drug responses in hypertension are lacking in SSA. We are aware of only 2 multicountry studies conducted exclusively on sub-Saharan African populations. These are the NOAAH trial(Newer versus Older Antihypertensive Agents in African Hypertensive Patients) and the CREOLE clinical trials (Comparison of Three Combination Therapies in Lowering Blood Pressure in Black Africans). The NOAAH trial found a combination of amlodipine/valsartan to be more effective at controlling systolic blood pressure compared with bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide in native Africans. In the CREOLE study, amlodipine plus either hydrochlorothiazide or perindopril was found to be more effective than perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide at lowering blood pressure at 6 months.

### Limitations of analyses based on achieved blood pressure: lessons from the African American study of kidney disease and hypertension trial [^5bcb4ae6]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) guidelines that set target BP levels often rely on analyses of achieved BP from hypertension treatment trials. The objective of this article was to compare the results of analyses of achieved BP to intention-to-treat analyses on renal disease progression. Participants (n = 1094) in the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Trial were randomly assigned to either usual BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of 102 to 107 mm Hg or lower BP goal defined by a mean arterial pressure goal of ≤ 92 mm Hg. Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Primary outcomes were rate of decline in measured glomerular filtration rate and a composite of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate by > 50% or > 25 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), requirement for dialysis, transplantation, or death. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no evidence of a BP effect on either the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate or the clinical composite outcome. In contrast, the achieved BP analyses showed that each 10-mm Hg increment in mean follow-up achieved mean arterial pressure was associated with a 0.35 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.62 mL/min per 1.73 m(2); P = 0.01) faster mean glomerular filtration rate decline and a 17% (95% CI: 5% to 32%; P = 0.006) increased risk of the clinical composite outcome. Analyses based on achieved BP lead to markedly different inferences than traditional intention-to-treat analyses, attributed in part to confounding of achieved BP with comorbidities, disease severity, and adherence. Clinicians and policy makers should exercise caution when making treatment recommendations based on analyses relating outcomes to achieved BP.

### Clinical outcomes by race and ethnicity in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT): a randomized clinical trial [^58a8a74b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Racial and ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain a major public health challenge in the United States. Hypertension is one of the most important, modifiable CVD risk factors leading to coronary heart disease, stroke, end-stage renal disease, and overall mortality. Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic adults (compared to non-Hispanic Whites [NHWs]) have higher rates of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (50%, 54%, and 46%, respectively), and NHBs are at greater risk of hypertension-related CVD morbidity and mortality.CVD age-adjusted death rates are 33% higher among NHBs when compared to the overall US population. Hypertension-related age-adjusted mortality rates of adults aged 25 years and older are 127.2 vs. 135.9 per 100,000 populations for Hispanics vs. NHWs, respectively, though considerable heterogeneity in CVD risk is seen in Hispanics based on country of origin. These disparities cost the US health care system an estimated $49 billion per year. Therefore, BP control interventions to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups are important at both the individual and population levels.

Over the past 2 decades, studies have demonstrated that lowering BP with antihypertensive medications reduces the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality, including in NHB and Hispanic populations. Until recently, there was insufficient data to determine optimal BP targets for the treatment of hypertension in these populations. Lowering systolic BP (SBP) with antihypertensive medications significantly reduced CVD morbidity and mortality in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP), Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur) Trial, and the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET). However, SBP treatment goals in the more intensive treatment arms of these trials were between 150 and 160 mm Hg and only SHEP included African American (AA) participants (14%). Two small trials (with limited statistical power) that compared a SBP target of < 140 mm Hg to < 160 mm Hg found no significant difference in CVD outcomes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes BP trial (ACCORD), which included a racially diverse population (24% NHBs and 7% Hispanics) of 4,733 high-risk hypertensives with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated to a SBP target < 120 mm Hg (compared to SBP < 140 mm Hg), identified no difference in the primary CVD composite outcome but a significant reduction in stroke risk in the < 120 mm Hg group.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^9fede7b1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our scoping review of hypertension guidelines demonstrates race as a frequently cited factor in determining how medical professional societies and practitioners understand, study, and intervene on hypertension in the US. Guidelines from the 30-year period between 1991 and 2022 were reviewed with the majority (62%) containing language on race and racialized categories. The combined categories of Black and African American made up 45% of race category mentions. While Black and African Americans suffer the highest rates of hypertension, other groups also known to experience high rates were seldom mentioned (Hispanic 8%; Asians 4%; Pacific Islander 1%; Native/Indigenous 3%). White, the most prevalent category after Black and African American, made up 16% of mentions and was used in multiple guidelines as the standard of comparison for hypertension rates and treatment, implicitly defining white as the norm. Racism was not explicitly named within the guideline literature, neither as a determinant of high blood pressure nor as an intervention target within the hypertension care cascade.

### Analysis of therapeutic inertia and race and ethnicity in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1f76051b]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the prevalence of therapeutic inertia for the treatment of hypertension similar across racial and ethnic participant groups?

Findings

In this secondary cross-sectional analysis of 8556 participants in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, among participants with blood pressure above their randomized treatment goal, therapeutic inertia occurred at similar frequencies among non-Hispanic White and Hispanic participants but was lower among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White participants.

Meaning

These findings suggest that implementing highly standardized blood pressure measurement and treatment protocols in clinical practice, such as those imposed in clinical trial settings, may reduce racial and ethnic disparities in blood pressure control.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^a4680c5c]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Recommendations for the management of special populations: racial and ethnic populations [^de30c2b8]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

One of the current challenges in the treatment of hypertension is the variation in the incidence and morbidity among ethnic populations. For example, in the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which 35% of the patients were African American, the diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and was also associated with a relative risk reduction in stroke compared with lisinopril. However, the increased stroke risk associated with lisinopril was experienced among African American but not non-African American patients. ALLHAT did not permit combination therapy with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics; therefore, the benefits of such regimens in this patient population could not be assessed. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, in contrast to the overall study population, African American patients with left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) than African Americans treated with losartan, with or without diuretics. On the other hand, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, African American patients treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril had a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite end point (glomerular filtration rate reduction, end-stage renal disease, or death) than African Americans treated with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Although the use of diuretics in African American patients may be a logical first-line choice for BP reduction, most patients will require combination therapy. African American patients with systolic BP ≥ 15 mm Hg above target level or a diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg above target should be considered for first-line combination therapy. Although certain combinations have been shown to be effective in non-African American patients, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different.

### Using benefit-based tailored treatment to improve the use of antihypertensive medications [^e92454e0]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines for prescribing antihypertensive medications focus on reaching specific blood pressure targets. We sought to determine whether antihypertensive medications could be used more effectively by a treatment strategy based on tailored estimates of cardiovascular disease events prevented.

Methods and Results

We developed a nationally representative sample of American adults aged 30 to 85 years with no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or severe congestive heart failure using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. We then created a simulation model to estimate the effects of 5 years of treatment with treat-to-target (treatment to specific blood pressure goals) and benefit-based tailored treatment (treatment based on estimated cardiovascular disease event reduction) approaches to antihypertensive medication management. All effect size estimates were derived directly from meta-analyses of randomized trials. We found that 55% of the overall population of 176 million Americans would be treated identically under the 2 treatment approaches. Benefit-based tailored treatment would prevent 900000 more cardiovascular disease events and save 2.8 million more quality-adjusted life-years, despite using 6% fewer medications over 5 years. In the 45% of the population treated differently by the strategies, benefit-based tailored treatment would save 159 quality-adjusted life-years per 1000 treated versus 74 quality-adjusted life-years per 1000 treated by the treat-to-target approach. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

We found that benefit-based tailored treatment was both more effective and required less antihypertensive medication than current guidelines based on treating to specific blood pressure goals.

### WITHDRAWN: effect of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure in blacks [^d92cdaf6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Black people have a greater prevalence of elevated blood pressure leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure black adults with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

Medline, Embase, LILACS, African Index Medicus, the Cochrane Library November 2003; Pubmed September 2003 to March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data unblinded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Authors were contacted twice to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials considering 53 interventions with 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 20,006 black patients from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States of America, aged 18 to > 80 years. In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57]. In addition, all comparisons for heart failure favoured diuretic (1.47 [1.24 to 1.74] vs calcium blocker; 1.32 [1.11 to 1.58] vs ACE Inhibitor; and 2.18 [1.73 to 2.74] vs alpha blocker. The results also showed a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics. No significant differences were detected between placebo and beta adrenergic blockers in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [95% CI], -3.52 [-7.50 to 0.46] mm Hg). In addition, ACE inhibitors did not significantly differ from placebo in achievement of goal diastolic blood pressure (risk difference [95% CI], 5% [-10% to 21%]). Calcium blockers, diuretics, centrally acting agents, alpha adrenergic blockers and angiotensin II antagonists were all more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in the pooled analyses. Only calcium blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including baseline diastolic blood pressure > 109 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

When first-line drugs from different classes are compared in the treatment of black people, there is no evidence of differential effects on most mortality and morbidity outcomes. Those morbidity differences that were found favoured diuretics. Drugs differ in their ability to reduce blood pressure in black people. Calcium blockers were the only drug class that reduced blood pressure in all subgroups of black people including those with severe hypertension. Beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, alpha blockers and ACE Inhibitors were least good at reducing blood pressure in black adults.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^4eca6d1b]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.

Methods

We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5–5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2–3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.

### A review of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in black patients with hypertension [^c12280d7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines and recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in black hypertensive patients.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating race-specific outcomes in hypertension were gathered using a MEDLINE search with keywords black, African American, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin system, and hypertension. Studies published from 2000 through April 2018 were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Six guidelines, 8 monotherapy publications, and 5 combination therapy publications included race-specific results and were included in the review. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Numerous monotherapy trials indicate that black patients may have a reduced blood pressure (BP) response with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with white patients. Conversely, additional studies propose that race may not be the primary predictor of BP response. Reduced efficacy is not observed in trials involving combination therapy. Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in black patients; however, data are conflicting. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article clarifies vague guideline statements and informs clinicians on the appropriate use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension treatment in black patients through an in-depth look into the evidence.

Conclusions

Potentially reduced efficacy and limited outcomes data indicate that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not routinely be initiated as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. Use in combination with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic is efficacious in black patients, and there are no data showing that this increases or decreases cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes.

### A rational approach to the treatment of hypertension in special… [^fafc2485]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

TREATMENT WITH LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS The pathophysiologic characteristics of hypertension in blacks provide a rationale for a strong focus on lifestyle modifications for improvement of blood pressure. A reduction in body weight by an average of as little as 3. 18 kg significantly reduces blood pressure. 6 In normokalemic hypertensive patients, use of oral potassium supplements may also significantly reduce blood pressure. 7 This occurs, in part, because of a natriuretic effect of potassium. 11 Increasing the dosage of the ACE inhibitor provides a slightly greater average lowering of blood pressure, but the decrease is still less than desirable. 12 Ensuring a low dietary salt intake can improve the blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors in black patients.
13.

The problem of a reduced blood pressure-lowering effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors is moot if diuretics are used as initial or second-line drug therapy in black patients with hypertension. The combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors or beta blockers produces equivalent lowering of blood pressure in whites and blacks, perhaps as a result of diuretic-induced stimulation of renin release. This is true even for combination-type drugs that contain as little as 6. 25 to
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. 14 Most hypertensive black patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to control systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg, the current goals recommended by JNC VI for patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, 15 only 46 percent of black hypertensive patients with stage 1 or stage 2 disease achieved a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg with monotherapy.

In the absence of contraindications, special efforts should be made to ensure that black patients with hypertension who have had a myocardial infarction are receiving a beta blocker and that hypertensive black patients with systolic heart failure or diabetic nephropathy are receiving an ACE inhibitor. In these cases, the protective effect of the drugs is due to more than just reduction of blood pressure. In black hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, evidence now shows that non–dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists can slow the chronic progression of renal disease.

### Racial differences in blood pressure control: potential explanatory factors [^ee434f53]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Poor blood pressure control remains a common problem that contributes to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly among African Americans. We explored antihypertensive medication adherence and other factors that may explain racial differences in blood pressure control.

Methods

Baseline data were obtained from the Veteran's Study to Improve The Control of Hypertension, a randomized controlled trial designed to improve blood pressure control. Clinical, demographic, and psychosocial factors relating to blood pressure control were examined.

Results

A total of 569 patients who were African American (41%) or white (59%) were enrolled in the study. African Americans were more likely to have inadequate baseline blood pressure control than whites (63% vs 50%; odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–2.41). Among 20 factors related to blood pressure control, African Americans also had a higher odds ratio of being nonadherent to their medication, being more functionally illiterate, and having a family member with hypertension compared with whites. Compared with whites, African Americans also were more likely to perceive high blood pressure as serious and to experience the side effect of increased urination compared with whites. Adjusting for these differences reduced the odds ratio of African Americans having adequate blood pressure control to 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.09–2.29).

Conclusions

In this sample of hypertensive patients who have good access to health care and medication benefits, African Americans continued to have lower levels of blood pressure control despite considering more than 20 factors related to blood pressure control. Interventions designed to improve medication adherence need to take race into account. Patients' self-reports of failure to take medications provide an opportunity for clinicians to explore reasons for medication nonadherence, thereby improving adherence and potentially blood pressure control.

### Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry respond better to calcium blockers and diuretics than to ACE inhibitors and β-adrenergic blockers? A systematic review [^f8718f3c]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Why do hypertensive patients of African ancestry generally respond better to diuretics and calcium blockers and less well to ACE and β-adrenergic blockade? Many clinicians use the self-defined ancestry of a patient as a clinical guide to select antihypertensive drugs, but considerable overlap in response is known to occur between ancestry groups. Therefore, many health care workers and patients object to using ancestry as a proxy for drug response, and it is advocated that reduction of blood pressure and related mortality should be achieved through individual treatment options. However, to reach this end, ethno-cultural and biological differences in drug response behind the surrogate measures of 'ancestry' or 'ethnicity' need to be identified.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on environmental, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors that may contribute to the differential clinical response to different types of drugs observed in patients of African ancestry. In this paper, we also addressed genetic variation thought to affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms, of which phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism and receptor function have been most extensively studied.

### Initial combination therapy for hypertension in patients of African ancestry: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f6bfe6c6]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that consider the effect of initial dual antihypertensive combination treatment on blood pressure (BP), morbidity, or mortality in hypertensive African ancestry adults, using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. Main outcomes were difference in means (continuous data) and risk ratio (dichotomous data). We retrieved 1728 reports yielding 13 RCTs of 4weeks to 3years duration (median 8weeks) in 3843 patients. Systolic BP was significantly higher on β-adrenergic blocker vs. other combinations, 3.80 [0.82;6.78] mmHg, but comparable for other combinations. Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia occurred with calcium channel blocker (CCB)+diuretics > diuretics+angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-II-type-1-receptor antagonist (ARB) > CCB+ACEI/ARB. An RCT including high-risk patients reported combined morbidity/mortality for hydrochlorothiazide (mg) 25+benazepril 40 vs. amlodipine 10+benazepril 40 of respectively 8.9% vs. 6.6% (n = 1414, risk ratio 1.35 [0.94;1.94]; all patients, N = 11 506, 1.23 [1.11;1.37]). We conclude that limited evidence supports CCB+ACEI rather than HCT+ACEI as first-line initial combination therapy in African ancestry patients with hypertension.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^cd5bc321]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

### Comparative effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme / angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics on cardiovascular events likelihood in hypertensive African-American and non-hispanic caucasians: a retrospective study across HCA healthcare [^56b8db85]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guideline recommends calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics as first‐line agents for non‐Hispanic (NH) Black adults with hypertension who do not have heart failure or renal disease. The guideline also emphasizes the use of antihypertensive medications from two or more different classes. Conversely, the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks (ISHIB) advises combination therapy with a CCB and a renin‐angiotensin blocking agent (preferably an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) as the primary treatment for NH Black patients with hypertension. Numerous trials have assessed the efficacy of different antihypertensive regimens, yielding conflicting results, particularly in racial and ethnic‐specific studies. The Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs, and alpha‐receptor blockers were not superior to thiazide diuretics in lowering blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics were also more effective in preventing strokes among NH Black individuals compared to other medications. However, the African American Study of Kidney Disease indicated that ACE inhibitors were more effective than beta‐blockers and CCBs in slowing the progression of renal disease in NH Black Americans with nondiabetic renal disease, contradicting ALLHAT's findings that ACE inhibitors were not superior to other antihypertensive classes for preventing kidney disease.

Understanding the optimal first‐line antihypertensive medications for preventing cardiovascular events and mortality is crucial for clinical decision‐making. Previous studies have explored the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in reducing cardiovascular events. Identifying the most effective treatments for controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular events and mortality with minimal side effects is essential for guiding clinicians and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease. To provide an updated perspective on the comparative efficacy of antihypertensive medications, we aimed to investigate the association between prior antihypertensive medication use and the likelihood of cardiovascular events and to assess whether this relationship is influenced by the patient's race. The findings from this study will be relevant for contemporary clinical management of hypertension, especially considering the new ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^b97c4929]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^15c17984]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

2025 High blood pressure guideline — evidence gaps and future directions — highlights persistent control and awareness gaps in U.S. adults with hypertension, noting that most are not controlled to < 130/80 mm Hg and that more than 50% are unaware they have hypertension. The report identifies needs for population management leveraging the electronic health record (EHR) and community-engaged strategies to identify undiagnosed or uncontrolled hypertension, and for research on screening and implementation strategies to control blood pressure (BP) and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Observational data show increased CVD risk among younger adults with stage 1 hypertension and association with target organ damage, with clarification needed on where current evidence can guide treatment decisions in younger adults. There is a lack of evidence to support BP targets for diastolic hypertension, which is more common in younger adults. Accurate BP measurement remains a major challenge, prompting trials comparing attended versus unattended AOBP and studies of alternative methods, including accurate wearable and cuffless devices, home BP monitoring (HBPM), and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), as well as comparisons of home and ambulatory measures to mitigate disparities from limited ABPM availability. Research priorities include addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) and race/ethnicity, clarifying treatment thresholds and targets for subpopulations, and adding data monitoring to evaluate effects across differences in sex/gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, and access to care. Additional needs include studies on white-coat hypertension, limited evidence of BP lowering from sleep apnea treatment despite its contribution to hypertension, and broader testing of stress management techniques. In pregnancy, planning for women with or at risk for high BP emphasizes that safety and effectiveness of antihypertensive therapies should be considered, with counseling on contraception options and recommendations for prophylactic aspirin therapy among those at greatest risk for acute onset or worsening of prior hypertension.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension-United States, 2003–2010 [^56e1b856]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Racial/ethnic disparities exist in blood pressure, awareness, treatment, and control, with Mexican-Americans having a lower awareness and treatment of hypertension, as well as less health-care coverage, compared with blacks and whites. Multiple national efforts target improvements in high blood pressure prevention, treatment, and control. The Million Hearts initiative, co-led by CDC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is focusing efforts on preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017, partially achieved by increasing blood pressure control for 10 million persons in the United States. Million Hearts is working to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors through parallel efforts aimed at clinical settings and communities with a focus on the "ABCS" (i.e. appropriate aspirin use for those at risk, blood pressure control, cholesterol management, and smoking cessation). The initiative aims to improve prescription and patient adherence to appropriate medications for the ABCS, promote a heart-healthy lifestyle, and refine access to effective care, while bringing clinicians' attention to cardiovascular disease prevention, including appropriate drug regimens. Million Hearts also provides communities and clinical settings with resources and materials that are tailored for different racial/ethnic populations.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^a3a6a6de]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

African American hypertension — ALLHAT and LIFE trial findings identify differential effects by drug class. Among ALLHAT participants, 35% were African American, and subgroup analyses found that the ACEI (lisinopril) was less effective in lowering blood pressure than the thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone) or the long-acting dihydropyridine (LA DHP) CCB (amlodipine); African American participants randomized to the ACEI versus the thiazide-type diuretic were at a 40% greater risk of stroke, 30% greater risk of heart failure, 19% greater risk of CVD, and 15% greater risk of combined CHD, with no difference in major CVD outcomes between the thiazide-type diuretic and the LA DHP CCB other than a higher incidence of heart failure with the CCB, and amlodipine showed greater adherence and fewer medications to reach blood pressure goals than lisinopril, while the LIFE study reported better cardiovascular outcomes with the beta-blocker (atenolol) than with the ARB (losartan) in African Americans.

### Evolving the role of black race in hypertension therapeutics [^c3dc19fe]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Black race has been used to guide antihypertensive drug selection for Black patients based on predominant between race (same drug) and intra-race (different drugs) blood pressure (BP) response patterns. Accordingly, thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists have been recommended over renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and beta blockers for Black patients. Current antihypertensive drug prescribing reflects historical guidance as calcium antagonists and thiazide diuretics are prescribed more and RAS blockers less in Black than White patients. Hypertension control rates in Blacks, lag those for Whites despite their greater use of combination drug therapy and lesser use of monotherapy. This is also true across drug regimens containing any of the 4 recommended classes for initial therapy as well as for evidence-based combination drug therapy (calcium antagonist or thiazide diuretic+RAS blocker) regimens for which there is no known racial disparity in BP response. Current recommendations acknowledge the need for combination drug therapy in most, especially in Black patients. One exemplary comprehensive hypertension control program achieved > 80% control rates in Black and White patients with minimal racial disparity while utilizing a race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm. Black patients manifest robust, if not outsized, BP responses to diet/lifestyle modifications. Importantly, race neither appears to be a necessary nor sufficient consideration for the selection of effective drug therapy. Accordingly, we urge the initiation of adequately intense race-agnostic drug therapy coupled with greater emphasis on diet/lifestyle modifications for Black patients as the cornerstone of a race-informed approach to hypertension therapeutics.

### Valsartan alone or with a diuretic or ACE inhibitor as treatment for African American hypertensives: relation to salt intake [^0443054b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the important influence of ethnicity and dietary salt on the antihypertensive efficacy of drugs that block the renin angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are a new therapeutic entity that have not been widely studied in African American hypertensives, either alone, or in combination with other therapies such as diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We performed a pilot, prospective, open label, randomized design clinical trial to evaluate the effects of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan (160 mg once a day) on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive African Americans (n = 88) on a low salt (100 mEq Na+/day) for 2 weeks and the same diet supplemented by 100 mEq Na+ for 4 weeks. After this evaluation, while continuing the Na+ supplementation, patients were randomized to valsartan 320 mg/day (n = 28), or the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg/day (n = 30), or benazepril 20 mg/day to the valsartan 160 mg/day for an additional 6 weeks. Valsartan (160 mg/day) lowered blood pressure significantly in African American patients on both low salt (-6.4/-4.8 mm Hg: P < .001) and a high salt diet (-4.9/-3.8 mm Hg: P = 0.01). The high salt diet attenuated the antihypertensive effect slightly (1.6/1.3 mm Hg, P = not significant). When comparing the efficacy of the three randomized therapeutic regimens while on the Na+ supplement, the valsartan 160 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg was the most effective therapy with an incremental reduction in blood pressure of -10.5/-6.9 mm Hg (P < .01), compared to valsartan 160 mg/day alone. Doubling the dose of valsartan to 320 mg incrementally lowered blood pressure by -3.8/-3.3 mm Hg (P = not significant). The least effective approach was adding benazepril 20 mg/day to valsartan 160 mg/day with no incremental reduction in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reduction of only 1.7 mm Hg (P = not significant). We conclude that in our open label pilot study, the antihypertensive activity of valsartan is not significantly attenuated by supplemented salt diet in hypertensive African Americans. Moreover, adding a low dose of HCTZ appears to be the most effective strategy in enhancing the antihypertensive activity of this angiotensin II receptor blocker in contrast to either doubling the dose or adding an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^16531810]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Twenty-two guidelines (59%) mentioned race at least once in reference to pharmacology. Guidelines emphasized the need for different first-line medications based on whether a patient belonged to a "Black" or "African American" racial group. A 1991 guideline asserted that "black patients tend to respond better to diuretics and calcium antagonists than to beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy". Whelton et al. recommended "[f]or black adults with hypertension (without HF or CKD), initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or CCB". The two most recent hypertension guidelines included in this review recommended different pharmacologic medications based on race.

Fourteen guidelines (38%) referenced interventions designed to address existing differences in hypertension outcomes between racial groups due to lifestyle or behavioral factors. Ten guidelines discussed interventions to decrease sodium intake –, and increase potassium intake. Multiple guidelines described a unique relationship between salt and high blood pressure in African Americans. From the time this association was mentioned in 1991 ("limiting salt intake is recommended for all hypertensive patients, particularly those who are considered salt-sensitive, such as black and older adults"), the reference did not substantially change. A 2006 guideline stated: "The potential benefits of these dietary approaches are amplified because survey data indicate that blacks consume high levels of sodium while their potassium intake is less than that of nonblacks". The AHA's 2014 guideline asserted: "A reduction of salt intake is recommended in patients who are 'salt sensitive', which may be a fairly common finding in black communities". The 2018 guideline on resistant hypertension noted: "Other subgroups of individuals (e.g. those with CKD350 and obesity, blacks) are often more sensitive and can derive particularly robust benefits from sodium restriction". Other guidelines highlighted the need for interventions to increase physical activity, decrease obesity rates, and encourage smoking cessation. For example, Egan et al. wrote, "special attention to smoking cessation is especially important for African Americans with diabetes as they have more lower-extremity amputations than Caucasians with diabetes".

### A randomized controlled crossover trial evaluating differential responses to antihypertensive drugs (used as mono-or dual therapy) on the basis of ethnicity: the comparIsoN oF optimal hypertension regiMens; part of the ancestry informative markers in HYpertension program-AIM-HY INFORM trial [^5c75356c]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Although data relating to Asians in the North American literature are limited — and where it is available, "Asian" frequently equates to "Far Eastern" (Chinese, Japanese, etc), — results from several large US studies provide some evidence of ethnic variation in response to antihypertensive drugs. In broad terms, greater falls in BP are achieved with thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics in black subjects with hypertension when compared to their white peers; conversely, ACEi are less effective in this cohort. In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, patients on chlorthalidone achieved better BP control than those receiving lisinopril or amlodipine. Those using lisinopril had a greater risk for stroke (risk ratio [RR]: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17–1.68), combined cardiovascular disease (RR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09–1.30), and heart failure (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.10–1.54) compared with those receiving chlorthalidone, treatment differences which were far more pronounced in African Americans when compared with whites. Furthermore, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial researchers reported a higher risk of stroke in African American hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril as opposed to amlodipine (RR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.22–1.86), an association which was not observed in non–African Americans (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89–1.28). Subsequent meta-analyses reiterate these findings, demonstrating no evident benefit from ACEi in achieving diastolic blood pressure (DBP) goals for African American hypertensive patients. Conversely, ACEi may offer substantial benefits for African Americans with hypertensive renal disease; in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, ramipril slowed renal disease progression in African Americans irrespective of whether proteinuria was present, more so than amlodipine or metoprolol. However, demographic differences with the United Kingdom (eg, a large South Asian population, population "admixture", first/second-generation immigrants as opposed to a population resident for 2–3 centuries), along with variations in vascular risk, diet, and weight, restrict the utility of US data.

### An effective approach to high blood pressure control: a science advisory from the American Heart Association, the American college of cardiology, and the centers for disease control and prevention [^f32fc50e]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

The Value of Hypertension Treatment Algorithms As Part of a Multifactorial Approach to Improve Blood Pressure Control

As described previously, despite the strong evidence and consensus regarding the treatment and control of high blood pressure, as well as the availability of many different therapeutic options, achieving success in hypertension control at both the individual patient-level and even more importantly, the population-level, has remained a major challenge nationally.

Although there is no single explanation for the poor hypertension control seen in many patient subgroups, the fragmentation of health care for many patients and the lack of consistent implementation of system-level solutions in clinical practice and healthcare delivery systems appear to be important contributors. Efforts focused primarily on educating patients and providers about hypertension and the benefits of its treatment have not been sufficient in bringing hypertension under control. Similarly, interventions targeting only physicians have not led to consistent and meaningful improvements on a large scale. However, there are examples of substantial success that could be emulated and scaled with a high likelihood of important benefit.

To reduce the prevalence of hypertension in the United States, system-level approaches will be needed. Successful examples from other medical areas where a system-level approach has been taken include reducing medical errors and improving patient safety in the hospital setting; improving the inpatient treatment and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; reducing health disparities in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions; early detection and intervention in sepsis to lower case fatality; and reducing hospital-acquired infections. In the case of hypertension, system-level methods can address multiple factors in a coordinated manner:

Identifying all patients eligible for management
Monitoring at the practice/population level
Increasing patient and provider awareness
Providing an effective diagnosis and treatment guideline
Systematic follow-up of patients for initiation and intensification of therapy
Clarifying roles of healthcare providers to implement a team approach
Reducing barriers for patients to receive and adhere to medications as well as to implementing lifestyle modifications
Leveraging the electronic medical record systems being established throughout the US to support each of these steps

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^3f95558f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Another important consideration is race in antihypertensive medication selection. African American patients have higher risk of treatment resistant hypertension and are more likely to require more agents for adequate control. To this end, current guidelines promote the use of dual drug antihypertensive drug therapy. Recommended treatment is a combination drug therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker combined with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic.

Our recommendations are consistent with the 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) clinical policy which, based on expert opinion and panel consensus, states that in order to gradually lower BP and/or facilitate chronic BP management, "emergency physicians may choose to initiate hypertension treatment for markedly elevated BP" (defined as SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg based on expert opinion). The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines similarly note that prompt management of very high BP is important to limit the risk of target-organ damage. Additionally, clinicians should consider factors such as poor primary care follow-up, geriatric patients, or patients at greater risk for adverse outcomes from elevated hypertension such as African American patients in making ED prescribing decisions. Prescribing antihypertensive medication in the ED setting is effective and can be done safely. Additional resources include mobile health follow-up and engagement, home BP monitor, and community health workers.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^02dc024c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Results

At study baseline, a maximum of 15 744 (27% African American) ARIC cohort members were available for analysis (Table 1). African Americans were more likely to be female and on average to have higher estimated SBP and diastolic blood pressure than white participants. African American individuals were over twice as likely to have blood pressure above goal and to report the use of antihypertensive medications. Although African Americans were slightly younger at baseline, they contributed on average 1.2 years less person time through 2011 than did whites.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of the ARIC Study Cohort (N = 15 744) by Race, 1987–1989

Over a mean 20 years of follow‐up, 1803 incident CHD events, 1147 incident stroke events, and 2537 incident HF events were identified (Tables 1 and 2). Age‐adjusted incidence rates for CHD, stroke, and HF were higher among African Americans than whites. The discrepancy by race was especially apparent for HF, where estimated incidence rates were 1193/100 000 PY among African Americans but 786/100 000 PY among whites.

Table 2
Incident CHD, Stroke, and HF Events and Incidence Rates in the Cohort (N = 15 744), by Race, 1987–2011 (ARIC Study)

A population‐wide hypothetical intervention that achieved an overall 1 mm Hg decrement in SBP at study baseline after full implementation yielded a greater estimated number of preventable events per 100 000 PY for HF (Figure 2 A, Table 3), than for CHD and stroke. Notably, the estimated benefits from modest population‐wide decrements in SBP were consistently greater for African Americans than for whites; the greatest difference by race was observed for incident HF, for which a 1 mm Hg population‐wide decrement in SBP prevented 7.0 additional events per 100 000 PY in African Americans when compared to whites. If applied nationwide, a hypothetical 1 mm Hg shift in SBP among African American and white US populations aged 45 to 64 years was estimated to prevent ≈9338 incident HF events, 6210 incident CHD events, and 3761 incident stroke events annually (Table 4). As expected, the hypothetical intervention achieving the larger SBP reduction of 2 mm Hg was associated with larger reductions in the incidence of CHD, stroke, and HF for both racial groups (Figure 2 B, Tables 3 and 4).

2014 Hypertension Guideline (JNC 8) — methodology and scope compared with JNC 7: The panel defined critical questions with a methodology team and focused analyses on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, including an initial systematic review and subsequent panel review according to a standardized protocol. Definitions of hypertension and prehypertension were not addressed but thresholds for pharmacological treatment were defined; lifestyle modifications were recommended by endorsing the Lifestyle Work Group. Drug therapy recommended selection among 4 specific medication classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB], calcium channel blocker [CCB], or diuretics) and doses based on RCT evidence, with specific medication selections for racial, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetic subgroups. The evidence review addressed a limited number of high-priority questions, and the report was reviewed by experts, including those affiliated with professional and public organizations and federal agencies, with no official sponsorship inferred.

### Nurse-led disease management for hypertension control in a diverse urban community: a randomized trial [^973ee573]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Treated but uncontrolled hypertension is highly prevalent in African American and Hispanic communities.

Objective

To test the effectiveness on blood pressure of home blood pressure monitors alone or in combination with follow-up by a nurse manager.

Design

Randomized controlled effectiveness trial.

Patients

Four hundred and sixteen African American or Hispanic patients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension. Patients with blood pressure ≥ 150/95, or ≥ 140/85 for patients with diabetes or renal disease, at enrollment were recruited from one community clinic and four hospital outpatient clinics in East and Central Harlem, New York City.

Intervention

Patients were randomized to receive usual care or a home blood pressure monitor plus one in-person counseling session and 9 months of telephone follow-up with a registered nurse. During the trial, the home monitor alone arm was added.

Main Measures

Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 9 and 18 months.

Key Results

Changes from baseline to 9 months in systolic blood pressure relative to usual care was -7.0 mm Hg (Confidence Interval [CI], -13.4 to -0.6) in the nurse management plus home blood pressure monitor arm, and +1.1 mm Hg (95% CI, -5.5 to 7.8) in the home blood pressure monitor only arm. No statistically significant differences in systolic blood pressure were observed among treatment arms at 18 months. No statistically significant improvements in diastolic blood pressure were found across treatment arms at 9 or 18 months. Changes in prescribing practices did not explain the decrease in blood pressure in the nurse management arm.

Conclusions

A nurse management intervention combining an in-person visit, periodic phone calls, and home blood pressure monitoring over 9 months was associated with a statistically significant reduction in systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure compared to usual care in a high risk population. Home blood pressure monitoring alone was no more effective than usual care.

### Racial / ethnic disparities in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension-United States, 2003–2010 [^3f4ac598]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

The results presented in this report indicate that during 2003–2010, racial/ethnic disparities existed among U.S. adults with hypertension and within hypertension stages for age, awareness, treatment, and health-care coverage. Mexican-Americans and blacks with hypertension were significantly younger than whites. This might reflect earlier onset of hypertension among these racial/ethnic groups. Awareness and treatment was highest among blacks. This association is consistent with previous studies and might be a result of efforts to reduce the persistent high prevalence of hypertension among blacks. Although no significant difference was observed in hypertension treatment by race/ethnicity among those with stage 2 hypertension, treatment was low overall (50%–58%) in this high-risk group, for whom clinical guidelines recommend a two-drug combination. Data on the number or type of medication used by participants, including two-drug combinations, were not examined in this report. A greater proportion of blood pressure control among those treated for hypertension has been observed among Mexican-Americans (74%) and whites (75%) compared with blacks (62%). To improve treatment and achieve the Healthy People 2020 goal of blood pressure control in 61.2% of persons with hypertension across all race/ethnic groups, targeted implementation of demonstrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies is necessary.

Recommendation 7 — initial drug selection for the general black population — states that "in the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB", graded as "Moderate Recommendation – Grade B" for the general black population and "Weak Recommendation – Grade C" for black patients with diabetes. The text further states that "both thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension in black patients", and "the panel recommended a CCB over an ACEI as first-line therapy in black patients because there was a 51% higher rate (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22–1.86) of stroke… with the use of an ACEI as initial therapy compared with use of a CCB"; it also notes "there were no differences in other outcomes" between a CCB and a diuretic and that "There were no outcome studies… that compared diuretics or CCBs vs β-blockers, ARBs, or other renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in black patients".

### Ethnic and racial disparities in hypertension management among women [^c0de3184]. Seminars in Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease for all ethnic and racial groups. Compared with other lifestyle and metabolic risk factors, hypertension is the leading cause of death in women. Women with preeclampsia are three times more likely to develop chronic hypertension and have an elevated risk of future cardiovascular disease. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in blood pressure control. This is followed by a summary of contemporary clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, through lifestyle behavioral modification, and treatment of hypertension with pharmacotherapy.

### The potential impact of optimal blood pressure treatment intensity to reduce disparities in dementia between black and white individuals [^09184189]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Black adults have higher dementia risk than White adults. Whether tighter population-level blood pressure (BP) control reduces this disparity is unknown.

Objective

Estimate the impact of optimal BP treatment intensity on racial disparities in dementia.

Methods

A microsimulation study of US adults ≥ 18 across a life-time policy-planning horizon. BP treatment strategies were the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) protocol, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8) recommendations, and usual care (non-intervention control). Outcomes were all-cause dementia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), stroke, myocardial infarction, non-ASCVD death, global cognitive performance, and optimal brain health (being free of dementia, cognitive impairment, or stroke). Population-level and individual-level effects stratified by race were estimated.

Results

Optimal population-level implementation of a SPRINT-based BP treatment strategy, compared to usual care, would increase average annual dementia incidence in White, but not Black, adults (1% versus 0%), due to hypertensive individuals' greater survival, and reduce annual ASCVD events more in Black than White adults (13% versus 5%). Under a SPRINT-based strategy, individuals with hypertension gained more years lived without dementia, ASCVD, myocardial infarction, or stroke and more years lived in optimal brain health. A SPRINT-based strategy did not attenuate individual-level race disparities in outcomes, except stroke. Due to longer life expectancy, a SPRINT-based strategy did not substantially reduce lifetime dementia risk in either group. The JNC-8-based strategy had similar but smaller effects as the SPRINT-based strategy.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that tighter population-level BP control would not reduce population-level disparities in dementia between US Black and White adults.

### Reducing the blood pressure-related burden of cardiovascular disease: impact of achievable improvements in blood pressure prevention and control [^e70d56b0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Population

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study is a prospective, population‐based investigation of the etiology and natural history of CVD and its risk factors. 27 From 1987 to 1989, ARIC investigators sampled 15 792 predominately white and African American participants between the ages of 45 and 64 from 4 geographic regions in the United States: Washington County, Maryland; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi. The latter 2 communities contributed the majority of African Americans to the cohort. Physical examinations and standardized questionnaires were administered by trained study personnel at baseline and during 4 follow‐up examinations. Cohort follow‐up for identification and classification of health outcomes is ongoing. The ARIC study obtained institutional review board approval from all participating institutions, and informed consent was obtained at each study visit.

The following sequential exclusions were applied: participants who reported races other than African American or white (n = 48); participants missing information to classify prevalent CHD, stroke, or HF or with prevalent CHD, stroke, or HF from each respective analysis (CHD [n = 1106], stroke [n = 315], or HF [n = 1035]). Prevalent CHD was defined at baseline by self‐reported history of a physician‐diagnosed myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction identified by electrocardiography, or prior coronary revascularization. Prevalent stroke was defined as a self‐reported history of physician‐diagnosed stroke. 28 Prevalent HF was defined by current use of medication prescribed for HF or manifest HF defined by the Gothenburg criteria stage 3. 29 After these exclusions, a total of 14 638, 15 429, and 14 709 participants were available for the evaluation of incident CHD, stroke, and HF, respectively. Follow‐up time was calculated from study enrollment to the first CHD, stroke, or HF event, loss to follow‐up, death, or December 31, 2011.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^74989d21]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that adult black hypertensive patients do generally have a lesser mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy when compared to whites. This meta-analysis provides evidence for current guidelines that recommend that drugs other than ACEI should be preferred for uncomplicated, mild-moderate hypertension in blacks, guidelines that have particular import in sub-Saharan Africa. These results, though, must be taken in the context of other research that provides strong evidence for the benefits of ACEIs in some subgroups of hypertensive black adults, particularly those with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and those requiring multi-drug therapy for their hypertension. For hypertensive black adults in whom ACEI monotherapy is indicated, higher doses may be necessary to obtain the desired reduction in blood pressure.

### Analysis of therapeutic inertia and race and ethnicity in the systolic blood pressure intervention trial: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^e6eff927]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Prior research suggests that a standardized approach to BP management can increase BP control. For example, the American Medical Association's Measure Accurately, Act Rapidly, and Partner with Patients BP Improvement Program reduced racial and ethnic disparities in BP control through addressing therapeutic inertia. Additionally, Kaiser Permanente Northern California has shown that a standardized approach to hypertension treatment can achieve parity in BP control between Black and White patients, with BP control exceeding 80% in both patient populations. Kaiser Permanente uses several strategies to reduce therapeutic inertia, including maintaining a system-wide hypertension registry, prioritizing evidence-based practice guidelines and fixed-dose combination therapy, and using medical assistants for follow-up measurements. While the SPRINT protocol for BP management represents one approach to standardizing BP care, other standardized approaches, such as the Measure Accurately, Act Rapidly, and Partner with Patients program and the Kaiser Permanente algorithm, demonstrate multiple effective strategies to minimize therapeutic inertia. In addition to implementing care protocols to reduce therapeutic inertia, health systems should encourage the use of fixed-dose combination medication (especially early in disease management), follow-up every 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or titration of drug therapy until BP goal is achieved, team-based care, and personalized feedback to clinicians. Greater implementation of patient-centered strategies are needed in community care of adults with hypertension. Ongoing studies focused on team-based hypertension care, mobile health platforms, and home BP monitoring will provide more evidence on interventions that increase patient engagement and reduce therapeutic inertia.

### A summary of the effects of antihypertensive medications on measured blood pressure [^593a2d58]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic analysis of family data on blood pressure (BP) is often compromised by the effects of antihypertensive medications. A review of numerous clinical trials that investigated the effects of BP-lowering medications is summarized here.

Methods

Published clinical trials, including 137 clinical trials with monodrug therapies and 28 clinical trials of combination drug therapies with a total of 11,739 participants, were reviewed from PubMed. Six major classes/groups of antihypertensive medications were categorized by ethnicity, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha1-blockers, cardioselective beta-blockers (beta1-blockers), calcium channel blockers, thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics, and loop diuretics.

Results

Using sitting or supine BP, for ethnic groups combined, monodrug therapy with ACE inhibitors showed a weighted average effect of lowering the systolic and diastolic BP by 12.5/9.5 mm Hg; alpha1-blockers by 15.5/11.7 mm Hg; beta1-blockers by 14.8/12.2 mm Hg; calcium channel blockers by 15.3/10.5 mm Hg; thiazide diuretics by 15.3/9.8 mm Hg; and loop diuretics by 15.8/8.2 mm Hg. However, ACE inhibitors, alpha1-blockers, and beta1-blockers were less effective in African Americans than in non-African Americans, whereas calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, and loop diuretics were more effective in African Americans than in non-African Americans. For two-drug combination therapy with ethnic groups combined, the BP-lowering effect of the second medication, when compared to its effect as monodrug therapy, was 84% and 65% for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively.

Conclusions

The BP-lowering effects reported here may be used to impute the pretreatment BP levels, which can improve the information content and hence the power of epidemiologic analysis in studies where use of antihypertensive medications is a confounding factor in the BP measurements.

### Blood pressure control among black and white adults following a quality improvement program… [^cc011617]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Blood pressure control increased an absolute 4. 6% among Black patients and
2. 1% among White patients from before to after the QI program implementation. We included patients who were identified as having hypertension by the KPSC population care management hypertension registry between December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2019. Blood pressure control increased an absolute
4. 6% among Black patients and 2. 1% among White patients from before implementation of the QI program to after. Blood pressure control increased an absolute 4. 1% among Black female patients and

1. 8% among White female patients from before implementation of the QI program to after. In the current study, a similar proportion of Black and White patients with hypertension were treated with antihypertensive medication. A higher proportion of Black than White patients were treated with 3 or more antihypertensive medications; however, the prevalence of uncontrolled BP was higher in Black than in White patients throughout the study period, with the lowest BP control among Black individuals aged 18 to 49 years. In an NHANES analysis from 2011–2018, Lu and colleagues17 found that Black adults had a similar treatment rate, received more intensive antihypertensive therapy if treated, and had lower BP control compared with White adults. Lower medication adherence, environmental issues, and lifestyle factors may be contributors to more intensive treatment yet lower BP control among Black patients. 18–20.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^8640bd5a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Professional society guidelines are evidence-based recommendations intended to promote standardized care and improve health outcomes. Amid increased recognition of the role racism plays in shaping inequitable healthcare delivery, many researchers and practitioners have critiqued existing guidelines, particularly those that include race-based recommendations. Critiques highlight how racism influences the evidence that guidelines are based on and its interpretation. However, few have used a systematic methodology to examine race-based recommendations. This review examines hypertension guidelines, a condition affecting nearly half of all adults in the United States (US), to understand how guidelines reference and develop recommendations related to race.

Methods

A systematic scoping review of all professional guidelines on the management of essential hypertension published between 1977 and 2022 to examine the use and meaning of race categories.

Results

Of the 37 guidelines that met the inclusion criteria, we identified a total of 990 mentions of race categories. Black and African/African American were the predominant race categories referred to in guidelines (n = 409). Guideline authors used race in five key domains: describing the prevalence or etiology of hypertension; characterizing prior hypertension studies; describing hypertension interventions; social risk and social determinants of health; the complexity of race. Guideline authors largely used race categories as biological rather than social constructions. None of the guidelines discussed racism and the role it plays in perpetuating hypertension inequities.

Discussion

Hypertension guidelines largely refer to race as a distinct and natural category rather than confront the longstanding history of racism within and beyond the medical system. Normalizing race as a biological rather than social construct fails to address racism as a key determinant driving inequities in cardiovascular health. These changes are necessary to produce meaningful structural solutions that advance equity in hypertension education, research, and care delivery.

### The effects of genes implicated in cardiovascular disease on blood pressure response to treatment among treatment-naive hypertensive African Americans in the genHAT study [^9153892d]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

African Americans have the highest prevalence of hypertension in the United States. Blood pressure (BP) control is important to reduce cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality in this ethnic group. Genetic variants have been found to be associated with BP response to treatment. Previous pharmacogenetic studies of BP response to treatment in African Americans suffer limitations of small sample size as well as a limited number of candidate genes, and often focused on one antihypertensive treatment. Using 1131 African-American treatment-naive participants from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment Study, we examined whether variants in 35 candidate genes might modulate BP response to four different antihypertensive medications, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and an a-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin) as compared with a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) after 6 months of follow-up. Several suggestive gene by treatment interactions were identified. For example, among participants with two minor alleles of renin rs6681776, diastolic BP response was much improved on doxazosin compared with chlorthalidone (on average -9.49mmHg vs -1.70mmHg) (P = 0.007). Although several suggestive loci were identified, none of the findings passed significance criteria after correction for multiple testing. Given the impact of hypertension and its sequelae in this population, this research highlights the potential for genetic factors to contribute to BP response to treatment. Continued concerted research efforts focused on genetics are needed to improve treatment response in this high-risk group.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^45cf253f]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension guideline management algorithm (2014) — Adults aged ≥ 18 years with hypertension are managed by setting blood pressure goals and selecting therapy by age, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, the blood pressure goal is SBP < 150 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; in the general population aged < 60 years, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; in all ages with diabetes present without CKD, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg; and in all ages with CKD present with or without diabetes, the goal is SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg. Initial pharmacologic therapy by race is as follows: Nonblack — Initiate thiazide-type diuretic or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or calcium channel blocker (CCB), alone or in combination; Black — Initiate thiazide-type diuretic or CCB, alone or in combination; CKD, all races — Initiate ACEI or ARB, alone or in combination with other drug class. Therapy adjustment uses one of three titration strategies: A. Maximize first medication before adding second or B. Add second medication before reaching maximum dose of first medication or C. Start with 2 medication classes separately or as fixed-dose combination. If not at goal blood pressure, reinforce medication and lifestyle adherence and for strategies A and B add and titrate thiazide-type diuretic or ACEI or ARB or CCB (use medication class not previously selected and avoid combined use of ACEI and ARB), while for strategy C titrate doses of initial medications to maximum; if still uncontrolled, reinforce adherence and add additional medication classes (eg, β-blocker, aldosterone antagonist, or others) and/or refer to a physician with expertise in hypertension management. Note that ACEIs and ARBs should not be used in combination.

Figure 1
Flow diagram. Data were retrieved from PUBMED, EMBASE, LILACS, the African Index Medicus, and the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency databases. *Studies were excluded using a hierarchical approach. First, we excluded reports that did not fulfill the main inclusion criteria (n = 2,644): an original report considering drug therapy with different available drug types in non-pregnant adults of African ancestry with uncomplicated hypertension, defined as the absence of clinical heart failure, stroke or end stage renal disease as reported by the authors. Studies conducted exclusively in diabetics were also excluded in this step. Of the remaining studies fulfilling these main inclusion criteria (n = 1,119), most studies were excluded in the next step (n = 982), because these were not original reports providing an explanation for the difference in response to antihypertensive drugs between ancestry groups. As a quality and consistency check, each paper retrieved from the search yield (n = 3,763) was categorized, per database, thus the excluded paper categories harbor duplicate reports, occurring in more than one database. † Eligible reports thus fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and were original reports considering potential causes for the differential response of patients of African ancestry to antihypertensive drugs used as single drug or single drug-based treatment. Included studies from the electronic searches (n = 55), and hand search (n = 17) are described in detail in the Results section.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^1768af10]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our analysis of prescription patterns showed that since 2018, 63.5% of Black participants were prescribed a 2017 ACC/AHA guideline-recommended first-line HTN treatment, compared with 75.8% of White participants and 81.8% of Hispanic participants. Given prior studies of efficacy and the relative SBP effects of different classes of HTN medications in this study, it is possible that greater adherence to 2017 AHA/ACC Guideline-recommended first-line treatments could result in fewer total medications prescribed, especially in the Black population.

CCBs and diuretics were among the most effective medications in Black participants in our dataset after adjusting for starting SBP, which corroborates previous studies and the 2017 AHA/ACC Guideline recommendations for diuretics and CCBs as first-line prescriptions in the Black population. In the Hispanic population, the medications with the greatest predicted effectiveness included diuretics, the central alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine, the ACEI lisinopril, and the beta-blocker atenolol. Notably, these top medications were different from both Black and White populations. However, overlapping confidence intervals caution the interpretation of these results.

Currently, 2017 AHA/ACC Guidelines do not recommend different first-line treatments in Hispanic patients. Our results suggest that it may be worthwhile to create a separate set of recommendations for HTN management in the Hispanic population, though further study would be needed. Since many patients started on one agent will later require additional agents to reach the blood pressure target, optimizing medication effectiveness in a manner which considers self-reported race and ethnicity may minimize the number of medications prescribed.

A previous study reported that personalizing HTN medication decisions between four commonly used HTN drugs (lisinopril, losartan, HCTZ, and amlodipine) can lead to a 4 mmHg greater reduction in SBP, compared with a nonpersonalized approach. Research has demonstrated that a 10 mmHg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 20%, coronary heart disease by 17%, stroke by 27%, HF by 28%, and all-cause mortality by 13%, while a 5 mmHg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 10%, suggesting that personalized approaches that maximize SBP lowering will be beneficial to public health. Reductions of mean SBP across both African American and White populations as small as 1 mmHg are associated with reductions in HF events, indicating that even modest SBP population-wide shifts can reduce CVD burden.

### Race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication in Medicare beneficiaries… [^99afca8f]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure published a recommendation that non-Black adults initiate antihypertensive medication with a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker, whereas Black adults initiate treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker. β-Blockers were not recommended as first-line therapy. For non-Black adults, the JNC8 panel member report recommended thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. Black adults were recommended thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs. 1 The panel did not recommend β-blockers as first-line therapy in the absence of either coronary heart disease or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The race/ethnicity-specific treatment recommendations in the JNC8 panel member report were based on randomized trial data showing that Black adults have smaller blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk decreases than White adults when treated with an ACEI. 3, 4 Prespecified subgroup analyses of the Antihypertensive. Overall, 66% of Black beneficiaries initiated antihypertensive medication monotherapy, whereas 78% of White and other race/ethnicity beneficiaries initiated monotherapy. The proportion of Black beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy who did so with an ACEI or ARB was 25. 2% in 2011 and
23. 7% in 2018. Among both Black beneficiaries and White beneficiaries, the proportion initiating monotherapy with an ACEI decreased, and the proportion initiating with an ARB increased.

The proportion of White beneficiaries initiating combination therapy who did so with an ARB or CCB increased, whereas the proportion initiating treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic decreased. The most common dual antihypertensive combination therapy filled by beneficiaries in each race/ethnicity group in 2018 was a thiazide-type diuretic with either an ACEI or an ARB.

### 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure treatment guideline recommendations and cardiovascular risk [^d7e5c0cb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline provides updated recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification.

Objectives

Determine the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among adults recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation or intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.

Methods

The authors analyzed data for black and white REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study participants (age ≥ 45 years). Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured twice at baseline (2003 to 2007) and averaged. Participants not taking (n = 14,039) and taking (n = 15,179) antihypertensive medication were categorized according to their recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Overall, 4,094 CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure) occurred by December 31, 2014.

Results

Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, 34.4% were recommended pharmacological antihypertensive treatment initiation. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended antihypertensive medication initiation with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg was 22.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.3 to 25.0). Among participants with SBP/DBP 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, the CVD event rate was 20.5 (95% CI: 18.5 to 22.6) and 3.4 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.4) for those recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, 62.8% were recommended treatment intensification. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended treatment intensification was 33.6 (95% CI: 31.5 to 35.6) and 22.4 (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.9) for those with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, respectively.

Conclusions

Implementing the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would direct antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification to adults with high CVD risk.

### Effect of lifestyle coaching or enhanced pharmacotherapy on blood pressure control among black adults with persistent uncontrolled hypertension: a cluster randomized clinical trial [^9ae07cc1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Black adults have a heavier burden of cardiovascular disease (the leading cause of death) and stroke (the leading cause of long-term disability) in the US compared with White adults. The prevalence of hypertension, the most modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke, is substantially higher in Black adults, who are less likely to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control and experience a greater impact on stroke risk compared with White adults. Eliminating disparity in BP control could avert thousands of deaths due to cardiovascular diseaseand reduce the population burden of dementia.

Rates of hypertension control have improved significantly among members within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care delivery system since the establishment of its Preventing Heart Attacks and Stroke Everyday program in 2004. However, a prior cohort studyexamining BP control at 6 months after ischemic stroke from KPNC found that Black patients still had poorer BP control compared with patients of other races and ethnicities despite equal use of health care resources, antihypertensive prescriptions, and medication adherence. Greater difficulty in controlling BP and adverse lifestyle practices (eg, higher salt intake, less physical activity, more smoking) may explain this disparity, at least in part. To improve the disparity of BP control between Black and White patients, a population-based approach is necessary for aggressive targeting of high-risk Black adults with uncontrolled BP. To address the important challenge of treating hypertension in Black adults as emphasized by the International Society on Hypertension in Blacks, our primary aim was to determine whether a lifestyle coaching intervention (LC group) or an enhanced pharmacotherapy monitoring protocol (EP group) would be more effective than usual care (UC group) in controlling BP in Black adults who had persistent uncontrolled hypertension.

Introduction

Hypertension remains a leading modifiable cause of racial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although blood pressure (BP) control rates improved from 1999 to 2010, they recently declined, especially among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adults with hypertension taking antihypertensive medication. Despite similar treatment rates and increased availability of safe, effective, and affordable antihypertensive medications, BP control rates among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults remain significantly lower than for non-Hispanic White adults among US adults who report taking antihypertensive medication (53.2%, 58.2%, vs 68.2%, respectively). Additionally, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults have a greater prevalence of comorbid diseases associated with pharmacologic treatment resistance, such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Overall, 51.1% of non-Hispanic White individuals with hypertension in the US have a controlled BP (ie, systolic/diastolic BP of < 140/90 mm Hg), compared with only 42.7% of Black and 42.4% of Hispanic individuals.

The root causes of disparities in BP control are multifactorial and can be attributed to patient-related, clinician-related, and health care system–related barriers. Therapeutic inertia, the phenomenon of clinicians not initiating or up-titrating clinically indicated therapy in the setting of unmet treatment goals, is a clinician-related barrier to controlled BP. The prevalence of therapeutic inertia in hypertension in clinical practice remains high. However, data on racial and ethnic differences in therapeutic inertia in hypertension are limited, and the available data are conflicting. Some studies suggest that therapeutic inertia may be higher, while others show similar or lower prevalence, in Black vs White adults with hypertension. By studying racial and ethnic differences in hypertension-related therapeutic inertia in a clinical trial in which BP care was standardized and protocolized, targeted interventions could be developed and prioritized to improve BP management in all racial and ethnic groups, potentially leading to reduced disparities in BP control and hypertension-related CVD.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^e577ef9d]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

These findings must also be taken in the context of other clinical trials that have demonstrated the benefit of ACEI therapy among blacks with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus despite lesser reduction in blood pressure. Also, use of ACEIs as part of a combination for treatment of hypertension has proven to be effective among black adults. In fact, according to one meta-analysis, combination therapy including ACEIs may actually result in a greater blood pressure reduction in black adults than white adults. Since black adults are disproportionately affected by heart and kidney disease and many will require at least 2 hypertensive agents for blood pressure control, the use of a combination therapy including an ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker may be particularly beneficial in this population.

This meta-analysis has several important limitations. First, all of the studies included in this meta-analysis except one were done in the USA and therefore may not be applicable to black adults living in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Although this is a limitation, we also believe that this meta-analysis is important in providing context for the much-anticipated results of the first large, randomized, controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs among hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, this meta-analysis was performed on pooled study results and not individual level data. The consistency of the difference in mean blood pressure reduction, however, does point to a real difference in reduction by race. Finally, as with any meta-analysis, this study is limited by the variables that were studied and reported in the component trials. Since hypertension is multifactorial, some important confounders such as nutrition, salt intake and handling, nephron number or hormone levels may have been missed.

Pharmacological treatment — For hypertension: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.
