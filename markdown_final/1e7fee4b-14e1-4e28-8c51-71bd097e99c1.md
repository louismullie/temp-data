## Question

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true microscopic hematuria and excluding pseudohematuria. Then, I should verify benign transient causes and ensure they are addressed before proceeding. Next, I will risk-stratify for malignancy and outline the evaluation by risk tier. After that, I need to check special populations and follow-up after negative evaluations. Finally, I will integrate cost-effectiveness and implementation gaps to synthesize a practical, high-value algorithm with explicit decision points and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis, because I need to ensure we are not overcalling hematuria from a dipstick alone. Microscopic hematuria is defined as at least 3 red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination of a properly collected specimen, and a positive dipstick must be confirmed with microscopy before initiating any workup; otherwise, we risk pseudohematuria and unnecessary procedures, which are common in practice [^117VZNTA] [^114yLxJ6]. Wait, let me verify the collection details: midstream clean-catch is preferred, and if contamination is suspected, a catheterized specimen may be needed to avoid vaginal or foreskin contamination, especially in women and uncircumcised men [^117VZNTA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check for transient or benign causes before labeling someone as having persistent microscopic hematuria. I need to check for recent vigorous exercise, menstruation, viral illness, trauma, or recent urologic instrumentation, and I should treat and then repeat urinalysis after an appropriate interval to confirm persistence; if a urinary tract infection is present, I should treat it and repeat urinalysis in about 6 weeks to ensure resolution before moving to malignancy workup [^117Eoaeg] [^117VZNTA]. But wait, what if the hematuria resolves after addressing a benign cause? In that case, no further urologic evaluation is needed at that time, though I should document resolution and counsel on recurrence triggers [^117Eoaeg].

> Next, I should review risk stratification because the intensity of evaluation hinges on baseline malignancy risk. I need to ensure I capture age, sex, smoking history, degree of hematuria, and any prior urologic malignancy or pelvic radiation; the updated AUA/SUFU guideline categorizes patients as low/negligible, intermediate, or high risk, which guides whether to defer or proceed with cystoscopy and imaging [^1173yDcv] [^112njtLh]. Let me consider the low-risk group carefully: never-smokers younger than 50 years with low RBC counts have extremely low malignancy rates, supporting deferral of immediate invasive testing in many cases [^112njtLh] [^112njtLh].

> For low/negligible-risk patients, I should confirm that immediate cystoscopy or imaging is not recommended; instead, I will repeat urinalysis within 6 months and only escalate if hematuria persists or worsens, at which point I should reclassify to intermediate or high risk and proceed accordingly [^112njtLh] [^111QMmz7]. Wait, let me verify the rationale: validation studies show malignancy rates near 0% in low-risk cohorts, and prolonged follow-up without immediate workup did not miss cancers, which supports this conservative approach when patients understand and accept the small residual risk [^112njtLh].

> For intermediate-risk patients, I should confirm that cystoscopy and renal ultrasound are the recommended first-line tests, reserving CT urography for those who prefer maximal sensitivity or have specific risk features; this balances cancer detection with cost and radiation harms [^112MZhiB] [^116ni3LB]. Hold on, I should verify the imaging trade-offs: CT urography has higher sensitivity for upper tract urothelial carcinoma but carries radiation and contrast risks; ultrasound detects most renal cell carcinomas and many upper tract lesions while avoiding radiation, and cost-effectiveness analyses favor ultrasound plus cystoscopy over CT-based strategies in this risk tier [^113XDjiQ] [^115xEjjP].

> For high-risk patients, I need to ensure we do not under-evaluate; cystoscopy and upper tract imaging with CT urography are indicated given the higher pretest probability of malignancy, and I should not substitute ultrasound for CTU in this group unless contraindications exist [^112njtLh] [^117DFb2D]. Let me reconsider alternatives if contrast is contraindicated: in patients with eGFR 30–59 or contrast allergy, MRI urography or noncontrast CT with delayed imaging can be considered, but I should acknowledge lower sensitivity for urothelial carcinoma compared with CTU [^1116eVP2] [^113XDjiQ].

> I will now examine the role of urine cytology and urine-based tumor markers, because I need to ensure we do not overuse low-yield tests. Routine cytology or markers are not recommended in the initial evaluation of low/negligible- or high-risk patients; cytology may be considered only in high-risk patients with equivocal cystoscopy or persistent hematuria with irritative symptoms, recognizing its low sensitivity for low-grade disease and potential to drive unnecessary workups [^111aLfmk] [^111t95gy] [^114N69ay]. Wait, let me verify the yield data: contemporary series show minimal added value of cytology in microscopic hematuria, with many cancers missed by cytology and detected only by direct visualization or imaging, reinforcing the primacy of cystoscopy and appropriate upper tract imaging [^116YcPGC] [^117QiiXn].

> Special populations require tailored thinking, so I should confirm adjustments for women, patients on anticoagulation, and those with suspected glomerular disease. In low-risk women, especially never-smokers under 50 with low RBC counts, the malignancy risk is extremely low and deferring workup is reasonable; conversely, women over 60 or smokers have higher risk and warrant standard evaluation, and I should also consider gynecologic sources of bleeding before urologic workup [^114EWx1u] [^112qLVFD]. For patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, I should not attribute hematuria to anticoagulation alone; evaluation should proceed as for non-anticoagulated patients, since malignancy risk is unchanged [^114MSbvc]. If I see dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, proteinuria, or elevated creatinine, I should involve nephrology for possible glomerular disease while still completing risk-based urologic evaluation when indicated [^114MSbvc].

> After a negative evaluation, I need to ensure appropriate follow-up and avoid over-surveillance. Shared decision-making about repeating urinalysis is advised; if repeat urinalysis is negative after a negative evaluation, further urologic follow-up can be discontinued, whereas persistent or recurrent microscopic hematuria warrants reconsideration of additional testing, and new gross hematuria or evolving symptoms should prompt re-evaluation [^111bup6H] [^116tVVqC]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence on long-term risk: large cohorts suggest that after a complete negative evaluation, the subsequent cancer incidence is very low, supporting discharge from routine urologic surveillance in most patients [^116AUHHs].

> I should double-check implementation gaps because underuse and misuse coexist. Many patients with high-risk features do not receive timely cystoscopy or imaging, while others with unconfirmed dipstick hematuria undergo unnecessary procedures; decision support and education can mitigate both errors, but alerts alone may not overcome workflow barriers without aligned incentives and clear pathways [^1168oDQh] [^116JNmwu] [^114tF77h]. Let me verify cost and harm trade-offs: uniform CT urography increases costs and radiation-induced cancers with only marginal gains in detection compared with risk-stratified approaches, reinforcing the value of ultrasound-first strategies in appropriate tiers [^113RAdLf] [^115xEjjP].

> Putting this together, my algorithm is as follows: confirm true microscopic hematuria with microscopy and exclude transient causes; if hematuria resolves, stop; if it persists, risk-stratify; for low/negligible risk, repeat urinalysis in 6 months and escalate only if persistent; for intermediate risk, perform cystoscopy and renal ultrasound, with CT urography reserved for select cases; for high risk, perform cystoscopy and CT urography; avoid routine cytology or markers except in narrowly defined high-risk scenarios; and after a negative evaluation, use shared decision-making for repeat testing, discontinuing follow-up if subsequent urinalysis is negative and re-evaluating if gross hematuria or new symptoms occur [^112njtLh] [^112MZhiB] [^117DFb2D] [^111bup6H].

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf on microscopy** [^114yLxJ6] in the absence of symptoms or infection [^111xfM7J]. The **prevalence is 2–31%** in adults, higher in older adults and men [^117VZNTA]. Initial evaluation includes history, physical exam, serum creatinine, and repeat urinalysis to confirm persistence [^114MSbvc] [^112njtLh]. Risk-based workup is recommended: low-risk patients should have repeat urinalysis at 6 months [^112njtLh]; intermediate-risk patients should have cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB]; high-risk patients should have cystoscopy and CT urography [^117DFb2D]. Urine cytology is not routine [^111aLfmk] and anticoagulation does not exclude malignancy [^114MSbvc]. Most cases are benign, but persistent hematuria warrants follow-up [^111bup6H] to exclude malignancy or renal disease [^111xfM7J].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

AMH is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** [^114yLxJ6] on microscopy in a properly collected specimen without symptoms or infection [^111xfM7J]. Confirm with **repeat urinalysis** [^114yLxJ6] to ensure persistence and exclude transient causes [^114MSbvc].

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

Prevalence varies with age, sex, and comorbidities: **2–31% in adults** [^111M5miS], higher in older adults and men. Risk factors include **age, male sex, smoking, occupational exposures, and anticoagulation** [^111xfM7J] [^113VR3kr].

---

## Etiology

AMH has diverse causes, including:

- **Benign**: UTI, stones, BPH, exercise, menstruation [^111xfM7J].
- **Malignant**: Bladder, renal, or prostate cancer [^111xfM7J] [^111V1Czx].
- **Glomerular**: IgA nephropathy, Alport syndrome, thin basement membrane disease [^112Y6La1].
- **Systemic**: Hypertension, diabetes, sickle cell trait [^notfound].

---

## Initial evaluation

Initial evaluation should include:

- **History**: Smoking, occupational exposures, anticoagulation, family history [^114MSbvc].
- **Physical exam**: Blood pressure, abdominal, and pelvic exam [^116SrBWt].
- **Laboratory tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis with microscopy [^114MSbvc] [^1143meSj].
- **Repeat urinalysis**: Confirm persistence and exclude transient causes [^112njtLh].

---

## Risk stratification and diagnostic workup

The AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend **risk-based evaluation**:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended evaluation** |
|-|-|
| Low/negligible | Repeat urinalysis at 6 months; no immediate cystoscopy or imaging [^112njtLh] |
| Intermediate | Cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB] |
| High | Cystoscopy and CT urography [^notfound] |

---

Urine cytology is **not recommended routinely** [^111aLfmk] but may be considered in high-risk patients with equivocal cystoscopy or persistent hematuria [^114N69ay]. Anticoagulation **does not exclude malignancy**; evaluate as in non-anticoagulated patients [^113VR3kr] [^114MSbvc].

---

## Follow-up and management

After a negative evaluation, **shared decision-making** is advised regarding repeat urinalysis [^111bup6H]; persistent or recurrent hematuria warrants further evaluation [^116tVVqC]. Management targets the **underlying cause**, with urology or nephrology referral as indicated [^114MSbvc].

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

AMH is a marker of underlying disease; **malignancy risk is ~3%** overall [^112UeQtC] and higher with risk factors. Persistent hematuria increases the risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, particularly with glomerular causes [^112Y6La1].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Controversies include the **optimal imaging modality** (ultrasound vs CT urography) [^113XDjiQ] and the **utility of urine-based tumor markers** [^111t95gy]. Ongoing research aims to refine risk stratification and reduce unnecessary testing [^116imRnK].

---

AMH is common and often benign, but it requires a structured, risk-based evaluation to exclude malignancy or renal disease. The **AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines** provide a practical, evidence-based approach balancing detection with avoidance of overtesting [^114qPfNG].

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^115sJyBv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^112zzZRS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

### Cost-effectiveness of common diagnostic approaches for evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^115xEjjP]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is highly prevalent and may signal occult genitourinary (GU) malignant abnormality. Common diagnostic approaches differ in their costs and effectiveness in detecting cancer. Given the low prevalence of GU malignant abnormality among patients with AMH, it is important to quantify the cost implications of detecting cancer for each approach.

Objective

To estimate the effectiveness, costs, and incremental cost per cancer detected (ICCD) for 4 common diagnostic approaches evaluating AMH.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A decision-analytic model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using inputs from the medical literature. PubMed searches were performed to identify relevant literature for all key model inputs, each of which was derived from the clinical study with the most robust data and greatest applicability. Analysis included adult patients with AMH on routine urinalysis with subgroups of high-risk patients (males, smokers, age ≥ 50 years) seen in the primary care or urologic referral setting.

Interventions

Four diagnostic approaches were evaluated relative to the reference case of no evaluation: (1) computed tomography (CT) alone; (2) cystoscopy alone; (3) CT and cystoscopy combined; and (4) renal ultrasound and cystoscopy combined.

Main Outcomes and Measures

At termination of the diagnostic period, cancers detected, costs (payer perspective), and ICCD per 10 000 patients evaluated for AMH.

Results

Of the 4 diagnostic approaches analyzed, CT alone was dominated by all other strategies, detecting 221 cancers at a cost of $9 300 000. Ultrasound and cystoscopy detected 245 cancers and was most cost-effective with an ICCD of $53 810. Replacing ultrasound with CT detected just 1 additional cancer at an ICCD of $6 480 484. Ultrasound and cystoscopy remained the most cost-effective approach in subgroup analysis. The model was not sensitive to any inputs within the proposed ranges. Using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ultrasound and cystoscopy was the dominant strategy in 100% of simulations.

Conclusions and Relevance

The combination of renal ultrasound and cystoscopy is the most cost-effective among 4 diagnostic approaches for the initial evaluation of AMH. The use of ultrasound in lieu of CT as the first-line diagnostic strategy will optimize cancer detection and reduce costs associated with evaluation of AMH. Given our findings, we need to critically evaluate the appropriateness of our current clinical practices, and potentially alter our guidelines to reflect the most effective screening strategies for patients with AMH.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^114r1D75]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^111xfM7J]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women requires separate guidelines [^1121WUDr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The guidelines recently updated by the American Urological Association for the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) are based on data derived predominantly from men. They cannot be reliably applied to females as the epidemiology of AMH is gender dependent. The research on women in this area has been limited. It is incumbent on the experts in the field of female pelvic medicine to advance the science and develop management algorithms for AMH in women.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^111W429b]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112njtLh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^1116eVP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Committee opinion no. 703 summary: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^114EWx1u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has been variably defined over the years. In addition, the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, whether the patient is a man or a woman influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Thus, data support changing current hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### What is new in evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women? best articles from the past year [^113fHfEg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

This month we focus on current research in asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Dr. Kenton discusses four recent publications, which are concluded with a "bottom line" that is a take-home message. A complete reference for each can be found on on this page along with direct links to abstracts.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^116YcPGC]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111bup6H]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114oNGrM]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — initially low/negligible-risk with hematuria on repeat urinalysis: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis. In such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)

### Could nonenhanced computer tomography suffice as the imaging study of choice for the screening of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria? [^115rkqFL]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the noncontrast and contrast-enhanced phases of computed tomographic urography for detection of upper urinary tract findings in adults undergoing initial evaluation of newly diagnosed asymptomatic microscopic hematuria to determine if less-intensive noncontrast imaging has the potential to become a suitable imaging alternative in the work-up of this common condition.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective review from 2010–2015 for adults who underwent computed tomographic urography for initial evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Three nonblinded physicians independently categorized the upper urinary tract findings described in the computed tomography reports into one of three groups: normal, benign, or suspicious for malignancy. The noncontrast images of a randomized portion of the studies categorized as normal and all studies categorized as suspicious and benign were submitted to two blinded radiologists who independently classified each study into one of the aforementioned categories.

Results

The noncontrast images for 475 subjects were blindly reviewed. When compared to the computed tomographic urography reports, the negative predictive values of noncontrast images were 97.25% and 94.92% for radiologist 1 and radiologist 2, respectively, with an associated specificity of 88.6% and 97.95%. Of the 5 true upper tract malignancies, both blinded radiologists correctly identified 4 of the 5.

Conclusion

Contrast imaging added little diagnostic value when compared with noncontrast imaging for most subjects undergoing initial evaluation for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Less-intensive imaging with nonenhanced computed tomography could reduce the nontrivial risks associated with multiphasic contrast imaging but further work is necessary to identify risk-stratifying criteria.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^115RxCWB]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

The American Urological Association guideline for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommends yearly evaluation for urinary tract cancer in case of persistent hematuria after a negative urologic workup. We identified few additional cases of invasive bladder cancer more than 1 year after hematuria diagnosis among patients who underwent a cystoscopy within 3 months before or after their hematuria diagnosis. Because the American Urological Association recommends cystoscopy for all patients older than 35 years with hematuria, follow-up for more than 1 year may not be needed. This recommendation accords with suggestions by Mishriki et althat patients with monosymptomatic hematuria who have undergone a thorough initial investigation with normal results do not need further follow-up.

Inclusion of nonurologic cancers in this study adds to the existing literature. The 12-fold increased risk of any cancer during the first 3 months after the initial hematuria diagnosis likely indicates that hematuria can be the presenting symptom of an occult cancer or that an occult cancer can be an incidental finding during diagnostic workup for hematuria. For rectal and gynecologic cancers, the initial increased risk of cancer was succeeded by a compensatory decreased risk, which was sustained during more than 5 years of follow-up.

### Utilization and yield of CT urography: are the American Urological Association guidelines for imaging of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria being followed? [^112f3D2k]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this study were to determine whether patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria undergoing CT urography (CTU) meet the American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation and to determine the yield of CTU for upper tract malignancy.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was conducted of consecutive CTU examinations performed for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adult patients. Patients with clinical evidence suggestive of a benign cause of hematuria (stone, urinary tract infection, trauma) or prior urologic malignancy were excluded. The study group included 419 patients (173 men, 246 women). CT reports were reviewed to identify causes of hematuria in all cases. Evaluate for appropriateness was conducted with 200 randomly allocated patients. Urinalysis results were reviewed, and appropriate use of CTU was defined as more than 3 RBCs per high-power field in the absence of urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy results after CTU were noted.

Results

In total, 58 of 200 patients (29.0%; 95% CI, 23.2–35.6%) did not meet American Urological Association criteria for radiologic evaluation. Fifteen (7.5%) received dipstick analysis only. Thirty-eight (19.0%) had urinalysis results showing 0–2 RBCs per high-power field. Five patients (2.5%) were found to have urinary tract infections. No upper tract urothelial neoplasms were identified (0/419; 95% CI, 0.0–0.9%). One solid renal mass was identified without pathologic confirmation. One possible bladder mass was seen at CTU but not visualized at subsequent cystoscopy.

Conclusion

In 29.0% of examinations, CTU is performed for patients who do not meet the criteria for radiologic evaluation. The yield of CTU for upper urinary tract malignancy is low.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^112PYwCc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^113VR3kr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116tVVqC]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — follow-up after negative evaluation: In patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114MSbvc]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria initial evaluation — in patients with microhematuria, clinicians should perform a history, physical examination including blood pressure measurement, and serum creatinine to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy, medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microhematuria; clinicians should perform the same evaluation of patients with microhematuria who are taking antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (regardless of the type or level of therapy) as patients not on these agents; in patients with findings suggestive of a gynecologic or non-malignant urologic etiology, clinicians should evaluate the patients with appropriate physical examination techniques and tests to identify such an etiology; in patients diagnosed with gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary sources of microhematuria, clinicians should repeat urinalysis following resolution of the gynecologic or non-malignant genitourinary cause, and if microhematuria persists or the etiology cannot be identified, clinicians should perform risk-based urologic evaluation; in patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria; and clinicians should refer patients with microhematuria for nephrological evaluation if medical renal disease is suspected. However, risk-based urologic evaluation should still be performed.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^114K5iTu]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116SrBWt]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to elicit a history and perform a physical examination, including BP measurement, and obtain serum creatinine in patients with microscopic hematuria to assess risk factors for genitourinary malignancy (such as detailed smoking history), medical renal disease, gynecologic, and non-malignant genitourinary causes of microscopic hematuria.

### Referral patterns for the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women in a single health care system: room for improvement [^117QMGrk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify patterns of care for women referred for asymptomatic microhematuria in a single, hospital-based health care system and estimate the cost of unindicated evaluation.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 100 women with a diagnosis of asymptomatic microhematuria referred to a tertiary female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery practice. Our analysis focused on referral patterns by obstetrician-gynecologists and primary care physicians. Data analyzed included whether asymptomatic microhematuria was documented using urine microscopy (vs urine dipstick) and whether the urine microscopy correctly identified asymptomatic microhematuria with three red blood cells (RBCs).

Results

Forty-six patients were referred who met the American Urological Association's guidelines for asymptomatic microhematuria with a workup estimated at $8,298 per patient. Fifty-four were referred to a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery specialist despite clearly not meeting the American Urological Association's definition of asymptomatic microhematuria. Of these, 33 patients were referred based on dipstick-positive results only, 11 were referred based on microscopic urinalysis demonstrating fewer than three RBCs per high-power field (HPF), and the remaining 10 patients were referred with urine microscopy demonstrating at least 3 RBC/HPF but in the setting of a clearly benign cause, such as infection or menstruation. The total estimated cost of the unnecessary asymptomatic microhematuria workup in patients who did not meet American Urological Association criteria for referral was $1,213 per patient.

Conclusion

Fewer than half of the referrals for asymptomatic microhematuria were appropriate, leading to wasted and entirely preventable health care expenditures. This study highlights the need for education of health care providers making these referrals.

### In search of a consensus: evaluation of the patient with hematuria in an era of cost containment [^114pn2BE]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria by renal ultrasound to detect upper tract malignancy: a 20-year experience in a community hospital [^115khe78]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the sensitivity of ultrasound imaging in detecting upper urinary tract malignancy in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) in an outpatient community setting.

Materials and Methods

A list of all patients who received renal ultrasound for hematuria in our health care system between January 1, 1997 and July 1, 2015 was obtained, and electronic health records were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were excluded for age (< 18 years), < 3 years follow-up, prior upper tract malignancy, recent urinary tract catheterization, inpatient status, pregnancy, insufficient data, or gross hematuria. The initial ultrasound was considered positive if suspicious findings led to a subsequent diagnosis of an upper tract malignancy. False negatives were determined by electronic medical record follow-up for at least 3 years.

Results

Of the 2138 patients with AMH who met inclusion criteria, ultrasound imaging detected suspicious findings in 9 of 9 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 3 of 3 patients with upper tract urothelial cancer, indicating a sensitivity of 100% and 100%, respectively. Four additional malignancies were diagnosed more than 3 years after the initial evaluation for an incidence rate of 1.6 cases of upper tract malignancy per 10,000 person-years.

Conclusion

The prevalence of upper urinary tract malignancy was low in patients with AMH. Ultrasonography is an appropriate modality for upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with AMH. Practice guidelines should be updated to reflect the high sensitivity of ultrasound and low risk of upper tract malignancy in patients with AMH.

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^116XDB6a]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is a common finding in patients presenting to both primary care doctors as well as urologists. Sources of microscopic hematuria include infection, stones, inflammatory disorders as well as cancer of the genitourinary tract, particularly urothelial cancer. A primary focus in the urologic workup of hematuria is to rule out cancer. This is done using radiographic studies as well as procedures such as cystoscopy and bladder biopsy. As the authors state in their article titled "The utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria", cytologic analysis of voided urine, though attractive due to its noninvasive nature, has been found to have the neither the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, nor the ease of administration necessary to replace more invasive diagnostics in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Urinalysis: case presentations for the primary care physician [^112tVSnf]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Urinalysis is useful in diagnosing systemic and genitourinary conditions. In patients with suspected microscopic hematuria, urine dipstick testing may suggest the presence of blood, but results should be confirmed with a microscopic examination. In the absence of obvious causes, the evaluation of microscopic hematuria should include renal function testing, urinary tract imaging, and cystoscopy. In a patient with a ureteral stent, urinalysis alone cannot establish the diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder can identify a stent and is preferred over computed tomography. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen obtained from a person without symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended in nonpregnant adults, including those with prolonged urinary catheter use.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^1127MwzE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study indicates that the prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is low (7%). A key question is what is the proportion of subjects in whom a positive cytology prompted a biopsy that was positive for cancer, in whom a biopsy would not otherwise have been performed? None of our patients had a positive cytology and a negative cytsoscopic/radiologic evaluation. This is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated an extremely low yield of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria. To our knowledge, these are the first contemporary report bringing the utility of urinary cytology in patients with microscopic hematuria into question.

As for the application of serial urinary cytologies, previous studies demonstrated a marginally improved by serial examinations, which was confirmed in our study. Because of this low prevalence and the low sensitivity, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with microscopic hematuria is minimal, especially since all high risk patients proceeded to cystourethroscopy and upper urinary tract radiologic evaluation.

Current AUA guidelines recommend that patients presenting with microscopic hematuria should undergo upper tract evaluation along with cystoscopy. When the CT scan is not feasible, MRI or renal ultrasound with bilateral retrograde pyelograms can be substituted (2). This evaluation is adequate in assessing the kidneys, collecting system, ureters, bladder, and urethra as the cause of the hematuria. Unfortunately, except in select patients our current diagnostic modalities will not allow us to diagnose urothelial carcinomas without visualization of a lesion followed by biopsy, which is the gold standard. With this said, the acquisition of urinary cytology even as an adjunct to the above studies rarely changes the evaluation or management and may lead to an exhaustive, unfruitful, and costly evaluation. In the face of abnormal cytology and normal cystoscopy confirmed by biopsy and normal imaging of the upper tract, the question arises whether to pursue the abnormal cytology as a possible upper tract tumor. Evaluation may include retrograde pyelogram, ureteroscopy, and selective cytology. The yield of these maneuvers is reported to be extremely low and of little benefit, except in highly select patients, especially in the face of normal radiologic studies and normal cystoscopic evaluation. However, if an abnormality is noted on radiologic or cystoscopic examination, urinary cytology may prove to be useful as a confirmation of a malignancy prior to formal biopsy.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112tL1bY]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to initial imaging and cystoscopy, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain cystoscopy in intermediate-risk patients with persistent microscopic hematuria on repeat urinalysis who initially did not undergo cystoscopy based on urinary marker results.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in inpatient nonsurgical adults [^112KMMGu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the proportion of nonsurgical inpatients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) who qualified for urologic investigation according to consensus guidelines.

Methods

The study population included all patients acutely admitted to the internal medicine departments of Israeli regional hospitals between 2014 and 2017.

Results

Of 29,086 consecutive admissions, 10,116 (34.8%) underwent dipstick urinalysis and 8,389 (28.8%) underwent reflex microscopic urinalysis. After the exclusion of patients with a urethral catheter or a positive urine culture, 2,206 had 3 or more RBCs per high-power field, and as many as 2,052 (7.1% of the entire cohort and 24.4% of all patients undergoing microscopic urinalysis) met the criteria for a urologic workup.

Conclusions

We conclude that according to the consensus guidelines, an unreasonably high proportion of hospitalized nonsurgical patients would be referred for a urologic workup of uncertain clinical utility because of an incidental AMH finding.

### Use of a risk stratification tool to guide evaluation of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^116T6agT]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine if use of the hematuria risk index can reduce testing and cost, while maintaining equivalent lesion detection in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective cohort study of 1049 patients at single institution. Hematuria risk index score was calculated based on clinical factors including age, sex, smoking history, and degree of hematuria for each patient along with evaluation studies performed and total number of tumors discovered. Cost benefit analysis was performed based on published Medicare averages.

Results

Tumor detection rate in overall, low-risk, and moderate-risk groups were 1.2%, 0%, and 2.96% at a total cost of $408,376. When low-risk group is not screened cost decreases to $166,252 with no lesions missed. The cost to discover one lesion/cancer in the overall group was $34,031.3, the cost to find one high-grade clinically significant lesion/cancer was $136,125.3 for the overall group. When the low-risk group was removed, the cost to find a high-grade clinically significant lesion/cancer decreased to $55,417.3 without missing any significant lesions. Ultrasound may be utilized instead of computed tomography with minimal loss of lesion detection in select moderate risk patients.

Conclusion

None of the low-risk hematuria risk patients were diagnosed with any lesions, as such these patients may not need an evaluation. Furthermore, by utilizing a risk-stratified approach to the assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria health care costs can be significantly decreased with limited negative consequences in terms of lesion detection.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^111ZAZ8y]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Intravenous urography in evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^114DNsA7]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In 2001, the American Urologic Association Best Practice Policy Panel recommended CT or intravenous urography (IVU) over ultrasonography as the initial imaging modality in patients with asymptomatic microhematuria. We here present results of a study initiated many years ago and completed prior to 2001 that provides information pertinent to the use of IVU as the initial imaging modality for such patients.

Patients and Methods

This study compared the results of IVU and ultrasonography in patients 40+ years of age who were referred to a single urology department for evaluation of microscopic hematuria between 1994 and 2000. There were 290 patients who agreed to participate by undergoing ultrasonography in addition to IVU; 247 completed both tests. There were 81 men and 166 women with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 40–86 years). Thirty patients (12%) were smokers.

Results

A renal lesion or mass suggestive of tumor was found in 8 patients (3.2%); 3 patients had this finding on the IVU examination and 5 on ultrasonography. None of the patients had such a lesion/mass on both examinations. Two patients with suspect lesions were ultimately found to have renal-cell carcinoma. Both of the patients with renal cancer had a suspect lesion on the ultrasound examination but not on the contemporaneous IVU.

Conclusion

Intravenous urography may miss lesions/masses that lead to a diagnosis of upper-tract neoplasia.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^115HdPpN]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to repeat urinalysis, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to re-classify low/negligible-risk patients as intermediate- or high-risk based on hematuria on repeat urinalysis, and obtain risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata.

### Assessing the costs of extraurinary findings of computed tomography urogram in the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^117Lk9ip]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the costs associated with incidental extraurinary findings on computed tomography urogram (CTU) in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed to identify all CTUs performed for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria at our institution from 2012 to 2014. All genitourinary (GU) and incidental extraurinary findings were documented. Further clinical follow-up to May 2015 was reviewed to determine if any referrals, tests, imaging, and/or procedures were ordered based on the initial CTU. Cost estimates were determined using the Medicare physician reimbursement rate.

Results

Two hundred two patients were evaluated with CTU for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. GU malignancy was documented in 2 patients (0.99%), both renal masses suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Sixty patients were found to have kidney stones, of which 26 had stones ≥ 5mm. Incidental extraurinary findings were found in 150 (74.3%) patients, requiring further imaging costs of $17,242 or $85.35 per patient screened. Twelve patients required a total of 20 procedures for a cost of $54,655. The total cost related to extraurinary findings was $140,290 or $694.50 per initial patient screened.

Conclusion

The incidental extraurinary findings detected on CTU can lead to expensive and invasive testing and treatment. Whereas costs associated with further workup were high, the overall outcomes in both GU and non-GU cancer diagnosis were low. Future analysis should focus on limiting the cost and invasiveness of our evaluation for this condition.

### Incidence of significant findings of microhematuria workup in women-what guidelines work best? [^112qLVFD]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To apply the American Urogynecological Society (AUGS)/American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations of foregoing workup in patients under 50 years of age with less than 25 red cells per high-powered field, to a cohort of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) patients, and assess diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value compared to the American Urologic Association (AUA) guidelines.

Methods

Retrospective review of female patients who underwent AMH evaluation from 2012 to 2015. The number of patients who would have avoided workup following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations was determined. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive value and accuracy of the AUGS/ACOG recommendations compared to AUA guidelines were determined.

Results

Six hundred twenty women underwent AMH workup with 265 women undergoing full workup as per the AUA guidelines. Applying the AUGS/ACOG recommendations to this cohort would not have resulted in missed malignant diagnoses. Two tumors were found, both in patients who had undergone complete workup, and for whom AUGS/ACOG recommends workup. Following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations would have avoided workup in 126/620 of all women and 44/265 women who underwent the full AUA workup. In looking at findings of malignancy, the AUGS/ACOG workup had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 100% as compared to the AUA guidelines.

Conclusion

AUA guidelines may over screen female low risk AMH patients. Extensive workup in a low risk group of female patients does not result in increased cancer diagnoses. Perhaps a more nuanced approach could result in fewer workups without compromising cancer detection.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116AUHHs]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation — In situations where ongoing follow up after a negative hematuria evaluation is desired following shared decision-making, the Panel recommends obtaining a repeat urinalysis (UA) with microscopy, and patients who have a negative repeat UA after a negative microhematuria (MH) evaluation do not need further MH follow up. Even among patients with persistent or recurrent MH, the incidence of malignancy is low, and these cancers are diagnosed years after the initial evaluation; in a retrospective cohort with complete MH evaluation, repeat cystoscopy in 161 of the 637 patients revealed two new bladder cancers (1.2%), while repeat imaging detected a new suspicious renal mass in 4 of 317 patients (1.3%), and both cancers were detected more than 36 months following the initial evaluation; in another retrospective evaluation of 250 patients with a negative MH evaluation, 87 low-risk patients (32.2%) had persistent MH and underwent repeat cystoscopy and imaging three years following initial evaluation, with the only malignancy identified being a single case of prostate cancer. Based on these data, the Panel recommends shared decision-making regarding the utility of a repeat UA among patients with a negative MH and the optimal timing of obtaining it, if desired, and if a complete MH evaluation reveals a benign etiology not requiring intervention and a subsequent UA shows a persistent, stable degree of MH, the Panel recommends shared decision-making regarding whether to proceed with further repeat evaluation.

Microhematuria — management after repeat urinalysis in initially low/negligible-risk patients: Low/negligible-risk patients with microhematuria on repeat urinalysis should be reclassified as intermediate- or high-risk based on repeat urinalysis; in such patients, clinicians should perform risk-based evaluation in accordance with recommendations for these respective risk strata (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Low/negligible-risk patients should undergo a repeat UA to evaluate for the resolution versus persistence of MH, and if the repeat UA shows no evidence of MH, then no further evaluation of the bladder or upper tract is needed at this time. A study of over 11,000 patients found that persistent MH on repeat urine testing had a significantly higher rate of malignancy on subsequent evaluation (0.35% versus 0.07%), and patients with persistent MH are classified as either intermediate- or high-risk for malignancy depending upon the degree of MH at the repeat UA and other risk factors.

Initial evaluation — urinalysis and renal function assessment indicate that patients with a positive dipstick test (1+ or greater) should undergo confirmation by quantitative measurement (protein-to-creatinine ratio or albumin-to-creatinine ratio). The serum creatinine level should be utilized to calculate an eGFR by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease or CKD-EPI equations, and microscopic hematuria, defined as greater than 3 RBC/ hpf, should also be further assessed to rule out a co- existing urinary tract neoplasm.

Bladder cancer — clinical presentation and initial evaluation indicate that the most common presenting symptom is microscopic or gross hematuria, with urinary frequency due to irritation or reduced bladder capacity also possible, and less commonly a urinary tract infection; patients presenting with these symptoms should be evaluated with office cystoscopy to determine if a lesion is present, and enhanced cystoscopy may be used if available; if a lesion is documented, the patient should be scheduled for a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease within the bladder, and urine cytology may also be obtained around the time of cystoscopy; because smoking is a major risk factor for bladder cancer, screening for smoking and initiation of treatment for smoking cessation, if appropriate, is recommended during the initial evaluation; TURBT with a bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) is performed to resect visible tumor and to sample muscle within the area of the tumor to assess invasion.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^117Xw92T]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have reported the limitations of urinary cytology in the evaluation of patients with hematuria. Paez and colleagues reported that no tumor could be diagnosed with cytology alone and that a negative cytology could not exclude a malignancy. Because of its limitations, Nabi et al. recommended the judicial use of cytology in the proper clinical context. Similar to the report by Deshpande et al. over 25% of patients with atypical urinary cytology were found to have biopsy proven cancer. Because of this, atypia may require biopsy to rule out malignancy, closer follow-up, or other urinary based assays to improve sensitivity (e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridization, FISH).

Our study has several limitations. First, this is a small, retrospective study from a single institution. Not only could biases have been introduced in patient selection and evaluation, this group may not represent patients with microscopic hematuria seen by urologists outside of a tertiary care setting or those seen by primary care physicians. Secondly, a paucity of outside medical records were available to review in order to determine how the patients initially were found to have microscopic hematuria (i.e. were they diagnosed based on history, urine dipstick, microscopic analysis). Thirdly, other urine based assays (e.g. NMP-22, BTA, etc) also have reduced sensitivity in this cohort. Lastly, there was no standardized follow-up protocol in place to monitor patients with a negative hematuria evaluation in order to determine possible long-term developments.

The interpretation of urinary cytology can be extremely challenging and should be used only as an adjunct to evaluation of upper tract and bladder. Due to the complex nature of evaluating cytologic specimens, it is of utmost importance to have an experienced cytopathologist interpreting these results. Current urine based assays (e.g. NMP-22, BTA) are not at the point of being able to exonerate the bladder of harboring bladder cancer, thus patients suspected of a bladder cancer should be evaluated with upper tract imaging and cystoscopy. The addition of urinary cytology in patients with gross hematuria may be justifiable, however, its addition to the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria has an extremely low yield in detecting cancer and may lead to unnecessary, invasive procedures with known side effects not to mention high costs.

Microhematuria — diagnostic evaluation context: Most experts agree that patients with gross hematuria (GH) should be evaluated with cystoscopy, upper tract imaging and urinary cytology, but variability exists across guidelines regarding microhematuria. The 2012 AUA Guideline recommended computed tomography (CT) urography and cystoscopy in all patients over 35 years of age with microhematuria and was crafted without regard to an individual patients' risk of malignancy, and its principal goal was to minimize the likelihood of missing a malignancy diagnosis.

### Comparison of microscopic hematuria guidelines as applied in 1018 patients with microscopic hematuria [^112UeQtC]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the 2012 American Urological Association (AUA) and 2020 AUA/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine & Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) microscopic hematuria (MH) guidelines as applied in 1,018 patients with MH, to confirm of risk groups and to investigate the natural history of patients with MH.

Materials and Methods

Patients who had undergone a complete urological evaluation for MH according to the 2012 AUA MH guidelines were identified retrospectively. All the patients were then classified into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk for urinary tract malignancy according to the updated 2020 AUA/SUFU MH guidelines, for a second evaluation. The results of the first and second evaluations using the previous 2012 AUA and updated 2020 AUA/SUFU MH guidelines, respectively, were then compared.

Results

A total of 1018 patients with MH were identified. The urinary tract malignancy rate was 3.3% (34 of the 1,018 patients). According to the 2020 AUA/SUFU MH guidelines, there were 218 patients (21.4%) in the low-risk group, 447 patients (43.9%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 353 patients (34.6%) in the high-risk group. All the 34 patients with malignancy were from the intermediate- or high-risk group who require further urological evaluation. There was no patient with newly developed urinary tract malignancy at the median follow-up time of 28 months (12–58).

Conclusion

The use of the updated 2020 AUA/SUFU MH guidelines may reduce the number of diagnostic procedures without compromising the diagnosis of life-threatening malignant lesions.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^111M5miS]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

How would the identification of factors associated with MH help counselling the patient? The yield of finding malignancy in patients with MH is very low. AUA meta-analysis found that the incidence of malignancy upon workup of asymptomatic MH was 3.3% when based on one positive urine sample. According to current guidelines, MH prompts a workup of the lower and upper tracts with cystoscopy and abdominal imaging representing a significant cost to health care systems. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether the identification of factors associated with increased risk of MH may help stratifying patients who can obviate investigations with invasive procedures.

Some limitations exist in our study. All past medical history was self-reported by patients and may thus induce a bias. The population presenting to this health fair may not be representative of the general population as patients with specific concerns or who do not have regular medical follow-up may have been overrepresented. However, the prevalence of smoking and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease was similar to rates in the general Canadian population. Furthermore, this was a single institution experience and this may limit generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is that the dipstick microhematuria was not confirmed with microscopy in this study. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria but should still be confirmed with microscopy before ordering costly and invasive testing. Lastly and importantly, follow-up data was not available for our patient population to identify if these patients ultimately underwent full workup and their findings.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116imRnK]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria (MH) guideline updates emphasize that UBTM/cytology is limited to use in appropriate populations per current Guideline recommendations as a tool to reduce the use of cystoscopy during MH evaluation, and similarly, optimizing follow-up in patients with negative marker testing will be valuable; the necessity of such repeated evaluation should be evaluated as well as the optimal timing and should be a key endpoint for designing prospective marker-based trials. The revised Guideline includes recent data demonstrating the low risk of diagnosis of a subsequent malignancy among patients with MH who have a negative evaluation, even among those with persistent (stable) MH, and while these patients may be discharged from urologic follow-up, dissemination and implementation beyond urologists may be needed to prevent repeated referrals. Many patients with MH will have persistent findings of microscopic blood, likely due to benign causes that may or may not be recognized, and additional prospective research is needed to determine when and how patients with persistent or recurrent MH should be re-evaluated and when it is potentially safe to stop repeat evaluations. Further studies are also needed to guide management and follow up of patients who have a presumed false-positive UBTM test, particularly if done inappropriately in low/negligible- or high-risk groups, and additional non-invasive means of evaluating for the presence of bladder cancer. Overall, the revision represents an effort to improve the detection of clinically significant disease while reducing the indiscriminate allocation of healthcare resources and subjecting patients to tests with risk and attendant discomfort/anxiety, and the impact of this Guideline on frequency, intensity, yield of evaluation will need to be studied to determine the impact of the updated recommendations on public health and to inform the next Guideline update.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^114xqk7q]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority of bladder lesions are considered cancer until proven otherwise. However, we report that a visual diagnosis of malignancy had 83.9% PPV following white light cystoscopy. In the setting of surveillance cystoscopy 99% of low grade bladder cancers were distinguishable from high grade cancers by urologists. Cystoscopy is operator dependent and when it is performed by a more experienced cystoscopist, specificity would be higher. Thus, it is essential that suspicious bladder lesions be biopsied due to the high likelihood of malignancy. Bladder biopsy could be performed by flexible cystoscopy at the initial diagnosis, which could reduce the need for general anesthesia.

There are several limitations to this study. While we did not identify any UTUC that presented as microscopic hematuria, it is plausible that these patients might have initially presented with microscopic hematuria if screening for microscopic hematuria had been performed, although this is not recommended by any consensus. While sonographers normally visualize the renal tract with the bladder distended to adequately visualize the bladder, this was not performed in all cases. Similarly bladder assessment was limited on some CTU scans when contrast medium did not opacify the bladder or the artefact was due to metalwork in the pelvis. To account for such suboptimal scans we excluded these scans to determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging to identify bladder cancer. Additionally, we could not determine the sensitivity of cystoscopy since we were unable to determine whether tumors were missed because patients with normal cystoscopy findings were discharged home and did not undergo a repeat test.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112pWPvw]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Institutional review board approval was obtained to query medical records for pertinent clinical information in 239 consecutive patients evaluated between January 2003 and August 2005 for microscopic hematuria at a urology outpatient clinic in a tertiary-care inner-city hospital. Microscopic hematuria was characterized as microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)]. Initial evaluations included medical history; physical examination, urinalysis, and voided urinary cytology. Urine cultures were obtained in patients if there was high suspicion of a urinary tract infection as the cause of the hematuria. Clinic and hospital records were reviewed for several key factors including tobacco usage, voiding symptoms (American Urologic Association, AUA, symptom score), urinalysis, urinary cytology, cystoscopic/radiologic evaluation, and pathologic outcomes. Median follow-up was 40 months (range 1–66 months).

Based on AUA guideline criteria on the use of urinary cytology, voided urinary cytologies were collected over a seven day period prior to radiologic and cystoscopic evaluation. Of the 239 patients, 182 patients had one cytology available for review whereas 125 and 96 patients had two and three cytologies, respectively, available for evaluation. Thus a total of 403 urinary cytologies were reviewed by our cytopathologists. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, final cytologic testing results were classified by the cytopathologists into 1 of 4 categories: normal, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant.

Cystoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary tract and bladder biopsy

Hematuria evaluation included cystourethroscopy performed by an attending urologist with a 30- and 70-degree endoscope in a 17-F sheath in women in the outpatient setting, an 18-F flexible cystoscopy in men in the outpatient setting, or with a 30-and 70-degree endoscope with a 21-F sheath in the operating room. Any abnormal bladder lesions were biopsied and frank tumors were resected. Pathologic specimens were sent for evaluation in 10% formalin. In patients with atypia, suspicious, or carcinoma on cytology and no obviously bladder tumor, random bladder and prostatic biopsies were obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

Key Points

Question

What is the long-term risk of cancer after a hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria?

Findings

In this cohort study of 134 173 Danish adults with a hospital-based hematuria diagnosis, a 2-fold increase in risk of bladder and kidney cancers was found 1 to 5 years after the first hematuria diagnosis but was confined to patients who did not undergo cystoscopy within 3 months of their initial hematuria diagnosis. After 1 year, patients had similar risks of both gynecologic and colorectal cancers as the background population, and the risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated.

Meaning

These findings may indicate that hospital-based hematuria diagnosis is a marker of greater cancer risk and may inform follow-up recommendations for hematuria.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^115R76Um]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Radiologic evaluation of the upper urinary tract

The majority of patients (175, 74%) had their upper tracts evaluated by computed tomography urography scan of the abdomen and pelvis consisting of non-contrasted and contrasted images. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) was used to evaluate the upper tracts of 6 (3%) patients. In patients with an intravenous contrast allergy or another contraindication for CT scan or IVP, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 15, 6%) or renal ultrasound and retrograde pyelogram (n = 69, 29%) was used to evaluate the upper urinary tracts.

Outcome Assessment

Biopsy specimens were graded histologically according to established grading systems. The 2002 Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system was used for clinical staging.

Statistical Analysis

Differences in distribution of demographic and clinical variables were evaluated using the Chi-square test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. P-values were obtained from the Fisher's exact test for testing the null hypothesis that there is no association between a "risk" factor (e.g. tobacco, voiding symptoms, cystoscopic or radiologic abnormality associated with bladder cancer) and abnormal urinary cytology vs. the one-sided alternative hypothesis that there is positive association between a "risk" factor and abnormal urinary cytology. P < 0.05 is significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^113WWGA4]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The non-invasive Cxbladder urine test system has demonstrated clinical utility in ruling out urothelial carcinoma (UC) in patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH), suggesting that the number of invasive diagnostic tests, including cystoscopy, used in this patient population may be reduced by Cxbladder testing prior to conducting a full urological work-up. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the enhanced clinical utility of communicating objective information on diagnostic decisions made by individual physicians on individual patients with AMH.

Methods

Three hundred ninety-six physician-patient decisions were generated from twelve participant physicians evaluating real world case notes from the same 33 patients presenting with AMH. Each physician reviewed and recommended diagnostic tests and procedures based on each patient's referral data and then re-evaluated their clinical recommendation following disclosure of the non-invasive Cxbladder urine test result. Changes assessed were the total number of requested diagnostic procedures and the number of invasive procedures, including cystoscopy, following addition of information from Cxbladder in the Triage and Triage and Detect modalities.

Results

Physicians made significant changes to their diagnostic behavior for patients with AMH when presented with Cxbladder test results, including a reduction in the number of total and invasive procedures including cystoscopy for individuals identified as having a low probability of UC. The intensity of investigation was targeted and increased, including use of total procedures and cystoscopy, for patients identified by Cxbladder tests as having a high probability of UC: urologists increased the level of investigation for both total procedures and invasive procedures. The outcome resulted in patients with a high risk of UC receiving appropriate guideline-recommended invasive diagnostic tests. Patients who tested negative were offered fewer and significantly less invasive procedures. This change in physician behavior results in an increased clinical and patient utility, lower risk of missed UC and invasive test-related harm incidents.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated the potential for increased clinical resolution and significantly enhanced patient management, when physicians consider Cxbladder test results in their clinical evaluation. The change in physician behavior led to more appropriate diagnostic procedure selection and resource allocation to the benefit of both patients and healthcare systems.

### Diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XDjiQ]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microhematuria is a highly prevalent condition with a low associated risk of urothelial and upper tract malignancy. The AUA Guidelines recently changed recommendations for imaging favoring renal ultrasound for low- and intermediate-risk patients with microhematuria. We summarize the diagnostic test characteristics of computed tomography urography, renal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance urography in comparison with surgical pathology for the diagnosis of upper urinary tract cancer in microhematuria and gross hematuria patients.

Materials and Methods

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines from evidence collected for the 2020 AUA Microhematuria Guidelines report, including studies assessing imaging following diagnosis of hematuria published from January 2010 through December 2019.

Results

The search identified 20 studies which reported the prevalence of malignant and benign diagnoses in relation to imaging modality, of which 6 were included in the quantitative analysis. For the detection of renal cell carcinoma and upper urinary tract carcinoma in patients with microhematuria and gross hematuria, computed tomography urography had a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI, 84%-98%) and a specificity of 99% (95%CI, 97%-100%) with a certainty of evidence rating of very low and low, respectively when 4 studies were pooled. In comparison, ultrasound demonstrated a sensitivity ranging from 14%-96% (low certainty of evidence) and a specificity of 99%-100% in 2 studies (moderate certainty of evidence), while magnetic resonance urography demonstrated a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 86% in 1 study with a low certainty of evidence.

Conclusions

In a limited data set for each individual imaging modality, computed tomography urography appears the most sensitive imaging modality for the diagnostic evaluation of microhematuria. Future studies will be needed to evaluate the clinical and health system financial impacts of the change in guideline recommendations from computed tomography urography to renal ultrasound in evaluating low- and intermediate-risk patients with microhematuria.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1166bBG5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — interventions, comparators, and outcomes note that interventions include urinary cytology and urine-based tumor markers (UBTMs), patient engagement tools and decision aids, and follow-up schedules in patients with initial negative hematuria evaluation. Comparators are defined as any of the included interventions of interest when used as the control and compared to another intervention, and it was anticipated that most identified studies would be single arm. Critical outcomes include hematuria detection concordance (urinalysis [UA] versus dipstick), diagnostic yield incorporating prevalence of malignant and/or benign diagnoses, diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and false positive rate), risk stratification for urologic malignancy with system performance characteristics (predictive ability, prognostic ability, number needed to screen), and rate of adverse events and number needed to harm; important outcomes include disease specific survival rates, diagnostic grade/stage of malignancy, prevalence of risk factors in hematuria patients, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.

### Evaluating hematuria: impact of guideline adherence on urologic cancer diagnosis [^111CefoR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to assess physician adherence to 2001 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for evaluating patients with asymptomatic hematuria and its impact on the diagnosis of urologic cancer.

Methods

In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study of patients with asymptomatic hematuria evaluated in a large academic health center in 2004 (allowing for long-term follow-up), we randomly selected 100 of 1771 patients with asymptomatic hematuria (52 men; mean age 54 years; 58 microscopic, 39 macroscopic, three unknown-type hematuria; median follow-up 89 months, interquartile range 33–97 months). Multivariate logistic regression assessed effects of age, sex, hematuria type, and physician specialty on guideline adherence, the primary outcome. Secondary outcome measures were variability in evaluation among physician specialists, and the proportion of patients developing urologic cancer.

Results

Only 36 of 100 patients had a guideline-adherent evaluation, of which 5 were diagnosed with urologic cancer (median 1 month, range 0–11). No urologic cancers were diagnosed in 64 patients with nonadherent evaluations. Only evaluation by a urologist significantly predicted guideline adherence (P < .0001). Patients with gross hematuria more often underwent intravenous or computed tomography urography (P = 0.009); urologist evaluation more often led to intravenous or computed tomography urography (P < .0001), cystoscopy (P < .0001), cytology (P = 0.009), and guideline-adherent evaluation (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Although most physicians did not adhere to 2001 AUA guidelines when evaluating patients with asymptomatic hematuria, no urologic cancers were diagnosed in patients without guideline-adherent evaluation, barring the possibility of occult cancers. Evaluation by a urologist was the only predictor of a guideline-adherent evaluation. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal evaluation of patients with asymptomatic hematuria.

Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline (2020, Amended 2025) — purpose and methodology are outlined as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of microhematuria (MH). OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating hematuria using criteria determined by the expert panel; the initial draft evidence report included evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, and a second search included studies published up to December 2019. Five systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies met the study selection criteria and were chosen to form the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular modality was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low); and evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed, with additional information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence exists. In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA update literature review (ULR) process, which identified 82 studies for full-text review that were published between December 2019 and June 7, 2024; of those 82 studies, 23 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, and the subsequent amendment is based on data released since the initial 2020 publication of this Guideline.

### CT evaluation of the upper urinary tract in adults younger than 50 years with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria: is IV contrast enhancement needed? [^1123rBrn]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to compare CT urography (CTU) with unenhanced CT in the evaluation of upper urinary tracts in adults younger than 50 years with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

Materials and Methods

In this study, 1516 CTU examinations were reviewed in adults younger than 50 years. Inclusion criteria were no significant prior urologic disease and asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with at least one urinalysis with greater than or equal to 3 RBCs/high-power field and less than or equal to 50 RBCs/high-power field. Upper urinary tract findings on CTU were classified as malignancy-related or non-malignancy-related hematuria and incidental non-hematuria-related findings. A blinded radiologist reviewed the unenhanced images, recording upper urinary tract findings and recommendations for further contrast-enhanced imaging. The modified Wald equation at a 95% CI, the "Rule of Threes" equation, and binomial distribution were used for malignancy-related findings.

Results

Four hundred forty-five examinations in 442 patients met inclusion criteria. CTU reports showed zero malignancy-related hematuria findings, 64 non-malignancy-related hematuria findings (62 renal calculi and two others), and 138 incidental non-hematuria-related findings. Unenhanced CT interpretation had a sensitivity of 100% (64/64) and a specificity of 89.2% (337/378). The theoretic risk of an upper urinary tract malignancy is 0–1.1%.

Conclusion

CTU added no additional diagnostic benefit versus unenhanced CT in evaluating the upper urinary tracts of adults younger than 50 years with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. Using only unenhanced CT can reduce radiation and minimize contrast agent-associated risk, with a less than 1.0% risk of missing upper urinary tract hematuria-related malignancy.

### Dipstick pseudohematuria: unnecessary consultation and evaluation [^111bxiHJ]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

While many primary care providers advocate routine screening urinalyses, a heme positive dipstick test often leads to a false-positive diagnosis of hematuria, or pseudohematuria. Thus, American Urological Association guidelines recommend urological evaluation for asymptomatic patients only for at least 3 red blood cells per high power field in 2 of 3 microscopic urinalyses. We determined the percentage of patients referred for asymptomatic hematuria undergoing unnecessary consultation and studies.

Materials and Methods

Patients were retrospectively identified if seen for initial consultation associated with CPT 599.7X, hematuria. Among these patients those referred for evaluation of asymptomatic nonmacroscopic hematuria were identified, and referral patterns, ancillary tests, procedures and findings were examined.

Results

Of 320 new patient visits with diagnosis code 599.7X, 91 were referred for asymptomatic, nonmacroscopic hematuria. Of these patients only 37 (41%) had microscopic urinalyses before referral and only 22 (24%) had microscopic urinalyses showing 3 or more red blood cells per high power field. Of the 69 patients referred without confirmed microhematuria approximately 25% had true microhematuria and 15 with no true hematuria had undergone imaging before referral. The Medicare reimbursement value for the evaluation of these 69 patients was $44,901. Of these patients 35 underwent cystoscopy and only 1 (with true microhematuria) had a malignancy.

Conclusions

Positive dipstick heme tests should always be confirmed by microscopic urinalysis before urological referral or evaluation. Education of referring physicians regarding the American Urological Association guidelines could possibly help limit costly and potentially harmful, unnecessary evaluation of patients without true microhematuria.

### Hematuria and risk for end-stage kidney disease [^112Y6La1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hematuria is a common clinical finding requiring medical attention and poses several clinical challenges. The main challenge is to predict the future risk for chronic kidney disease and therefore to design a long-term follow-up evaluation and treatment plan. This review focuses on the risk for subsequent end-stage kidney disease among young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria.

Recent Findings

It has been recently recognized that young persons with persistent isolated microscopic hematuria have an increased risk for end-stage kidney disease, mainly secondary to primary glomerular diseases. These predominantly include IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease, and Alport syndrome. Among these causes, the association with progression to chronic kidney disease is best established for IgA nephropathy and Alport syndrome. Thin basement membrane disease had been considered 'benign' by most authors, although recent findings suggest otherwise. In addition, novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic interventions for these conditions have recently been studied.

Summary

Persistent isolated microscopic hematuria confers a risk for future chronic kidney disease, which is dependent on disease context, underlying genetics, environment interactions, and treatment. 'Benign (familial) hematuria' is a misnomer, which we recommend abandoning as it prompts loss to follow-up. Instead, we favor annual/biennial follow-up assessment that should include measurement of blood pressure, urinalysis, and kidney function tests.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^113n7Gwo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

is a cardinal clinical symptom with an associated risk of urinary tract cancer. The risk of malignancy in patients who present with macroscopic hematuria is 20.4% and in comparison the risk of malignancy is 5.2% in patients who present with microscopic hematuria. Bladder cancer is the most common cancer detected in microscopic hematuria cases, accounting for 4.8% of those investigated, while renal cancer and UTUC are less common with an incidence of 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.

Recommendations on who should be investigated for microscopic hematuria differ across guideline bodies. While there is a resounding consensus that cystoscopy remains the investigation of choice to visualize the bladder, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal upper tract imaging. RBUS and CTU are the most commonly used imaging modalities. The AUA recommends performing CTU for macroscopic and microscopic hematuria while the United Kingdom NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the ACP (American College of Physicians®) do not specify a recommended imaging modality. Similarly the role of upper tract imaging in patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer also differs among guidelines.

CTU has the highest diagnostic performance for identifying upper tract disease. A meta-analysis suggested that CTU achieves 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC. However, the diagnostic performance of CTU should be balanced against the risk due to intravenous contrast medium. Intravenous contrast administration is associated with a 3% risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients at high risk, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m². Prophylaxis hydration was shown to be ineffective. In addition, exposure to ionizing radiation is carcinogenic and there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction, although it is rare.

The DETECT I study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study prospectively recruiting patients referred from primary care physicians to urology departments for investigation following the presentation of hematuria. We report the incidence of upper tract disease and bladder cancer in patients with macroscopic and microscopic hematuria as well as the diagnostic ability of CTU and RBUS to identify upper tract cancer to determine whether CTU can be safely replaced by RBUS in patients who present with microscopic hematuria.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^116N3VGk]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Results

Of the 239 patients presenting for evaluation of microscopic hematuria, 182 patients obtained urinary cytology in the initial evaluation. Table 1 depicts the demographic and clinical characteristics of all 239 patients presenting for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

Table 1
Demographics and clinical features of 239 patients presenting for microscopic hematuria evaluation

* difference between patients with cytology available compared to patients without cytology, p < 0.05

A total of 403 cytologic specimens were reviewed. Eighteen samples were unsatisfactory for interpretation due to scant number of cells or severe degradation. Thus 385 specimens were reported. Two hundred and seventy four urinary cytology samples were classified as negative (72%) and 104 (27%) as atypia. The remaining 7 urinary cytologies from 5 patients were categorized as suspicious or malignant, which accounted for 1% of all of the urinary cytology evaluated. Cytology #1 detected 4 cancers and cytology #2 detected an additional cancer case (confirmed 2 cytologies from #1) whereas cytology #3 did not detect any additional cancers.

Of the 182 patients with available cytologic data, 38 (21%) demonstrated an abnormality on cystoscopic examination worrisome for malignancy, 9 (5%) an abnormality on radiologic evaluation worrisome for malignancy, or 10 (5%) an abnormality on both worrisome for malignancy. Table 2 illustrates both cytologic and cystoscopic findings of the 182 patients. None of the non-suspicious bladder tumors proved to be cancer and 17 (45%) of the suspicious bladder tumors were found to be malignancy (Table 3). Biopsy proven bladder cancer was evident in 2% of patients with normal cytology, 15% of patients with atypia, and 100% of patients with suspicious or malignant cytology (Table 4). None of the patients with biopsy proven bladder cancer was found to have carcinoma in situ. Combining the above two groups (atypia and suspicious/malignant cytology), we determined the unadjusted odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs for patient characteristics that are associated with atypical or suspicious/malignant cytology (Table 5).

### Comparison of the harms, advantages, and costs associated with alternative guidelines for the evaluation of hematuria [^113RAdLf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Existing recommendations for the diagnostic testing of hematuria range from uniform evaluation of varying intensity to patient-level risk stratification. Concerns have been raised about not only the costs and advantages of computed tomography (CT) scans but also the potential harms of CT radiation exposure.

Objective

To compare the advantages, harms, and costs associated with 5 guidelines for hematuria evaluation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A microsimulation model was developed to assess each of the following guidelines (listed in order of increasing intensity) for initial evaluation of hematuria: Dutch, Canadian Urological Association (CUA), Kaiser Permanente (KP), Hematuria Risk Index (HRI), and American Urological Association (AUA). Participants comprised a hypothetical cohort of patients (n = 100 000) with hematuria aged 35 years or older. This study was conducted from August 2017 through November 2018.

Exposures

Under the Dutch and CUA guidelines, patients received cystoscopy and ultrasonography if they were 50 years or older (Dutch) or 40 years or older (CUA). Under the KP and HRI guidelines, patients received different combinations of cystoscopy, ultrasonography, and CT urography or no evaluation on the basis of risk factors. Under the AUA guidelines, all patients 35 years or older received cystoscopy and CT urography.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Urinary tract cancer detection rates, radiation-induced secondary cancers (from CT radiation exposure), procedural complications, false-positive rates per 100 000 patients, and incremental cost per additional urinary tract cancer detected.

Results

The simulated cohort included 100 000 patients with hematuria, aged 35 years or older. A total of 3514 patients had urinary tract cancers (estimated prevalence, 3.5%; 95% CI, 3.0%-4.0%). The AUA guidelines missed detection for the fewest number of cancers (82 [2.3%]) compared with the detection rate of the HRI (116 [3.3%]) and KP (130 [3.7%]) guidelines. However, the simulation model projected 108 (95% CI, 34–201) radiation-induced cancers under the KP guidelines, 136 (95% CI, 62–229) under the HRI guidelines, and 575 (95% CI, 184–1069) under the AUA guidelines per 100 000 patients. The CUA and Dutch guidelines missed detection for a larger number of cancers (172 [4.9%] and 251 [7.1%]) but had 0 radiation-induced secondary cancers. The AUA guidelines cost approximately double the other 4 guidelines ($939/person vs $443/person for Dutch guidelines), with an incremental cost of $1 034 374 per urinary tract cancer detected compared with that of the HRI guidelines.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this simulation study, uniform CT imaging for patients with hematuria was associated with increased costs and harms of secondary cancers, procedural complications, and false positives, with only a marginal increase in cancer detection. Risk stratification may optimize the balance of advantages, harms, and costs of CT.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^117QiiXn]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We determine the utility of serial urinary cytologies in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria who were evaluated with upper and lower urinary tract studies to rule out a malignancy.

Methods

Two hundred and thirty-seven patients with the diagnosis of microscopic hematuria were evaluated at an inner-city tertiary care hospital. Of these 239 patients, 182 patients had 405 cytologies obtained as part of their evaluation for hematuria. In addition, all patients had their lower urinary tract and upper tract thoroughly evaluated.

Results

Two hundred and seventy four cytology samples were read as normal, 104 (26%) as atypia, 7 (2%) as suspicious/malignant, and 20 (5%) as unsatisfactory. Seventeen patients (9.3%) had biopsy confirmed bladder cancer. Of these 17 patients, 2 had normal cytology, 11 had atypia, and 5 had suspicious/malignant. No patient had a positive cytology and a negative biopsy. Overall the number of hematuric patients harboring bladder cancer was small (7%). Cytology #1 detected 4 cases of cancer, cytology #2 detected an additional case and cytology #3 did not detect any additional cancers.

Conclusion

Because of this low prevalence of bladder cancer in patients presenting with microscopic hematuria and the low sensitivity of detecting bladder cancers, the utility of urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of patients with hematuria may be minimal. The exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of hematuria is unknown.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114yLxJ6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — dipstick versus microscopy: Clinicians should not define microhematuria by positive dipstick testing alone, and a positive urine dipstick test (trace blood or greater) should prompt formal microscopic evaluation of the urine; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level: Grade C. The Panel emphasizes that a positive dipstick merits microscopic examination of the urinary sediment but does not warrant full evaluation unless microscopic evaluation confirms ≥ 3 RBC/HPF, and if suspicion persists, repeat microscopic testing may be reasonable after assessing patient risk and preference. Supporting data note that in a series of 237 female patients with a positive dipstick, 20.3% had a normal urinalysis, and amongst 54 patients referred for microhematuria evaluations based solely on a positive dipstick, only 14 (26%) had a positive urinalysis result.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116ni3LB]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — intermediate-risk evaluation: Clinicians should recommend cystoscopy and renal ultrasound in patients with microhematuria categorized as intermediate risk for malignancy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) In appropriately counseled intermediate-risk patients who want to avoid cystoscopy and accept the risk of forgoing direct visual inspection of the bladder urothelium, clinicians may offer urine cytology or validated urine-based tumor markers to facilitate the decision regarding utility of cystoscopy. Renal and bladder ultrasound should still be performed in these cases. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) For patients with intermediate-risk microhematuria who do not undergo cystoscopy based on urinary marker results, clinicians should obtain a repeat urinalysis within 12 months. Such patients with persistent microhematuria should undergo cystoscopy. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^1175PFMw]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

RBUS was shown to detect renal cancer with high sensitivity, although 14 cases had false-positive results. In these false-positive cases a second scan would be done, typically renal protocol CT, which would better characterize the renal mass. Thus, the approach to cystoscopy with RBUS instead of CTU to investigate the upper tract of patients who present with microscopic hematuria should be the preferred upper tract imaging of choice.

We acknowledge that RBUS has poor sensitivity for identifying renal calculi. Therefore, we propose that patients who present with symptoms suggestive of renal colic such as flank pain would benefit from RBUS with noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters and bladder or CTU. We acknowledge that replacing CTU with RBUS in patients with microscopic hematuria would potentially miss asymptomatic renal calculi when no hydronephrosis presents with microscopic hematuria. We believe that such patients would be uncommon and identifying them would be at the expense of subjecting a high number to CTU which would yield negative results.

In an ideal world all patients should be investigated with the best diagnostic test available. However, the risk of adverse events, the low disease incidence in the specific patient cohort and the high cost of diagnostic testing suggest that this may not be warranted. Cases of microscopic hematuria have a 0% disease specific incidence of UTUC and are below the 3% threshold for diagnostic investigation used by the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the 1% suggested by the AUA. Additionally, while the risk of an adverse reaction to iodinated contrast medium is low, it can be life threatening. The ionizing radiation from CTU is 4 mSv, which is 200 times that of a standard chest x-ray. Also, cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation was shown to account for 0.6% to 0.9% of diagnosed cancers.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^111Y8aYW]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that CTU can safely be replaced by RBUS to image the upper tracts in conjunction with cystoscopy as part of investigations following a presentation of microscopic hematuria. The risk of UTUC in patients with microscopic hematuria is extremely low and RBUS can identify renal parenchymal cancer with high sensitivity. When renal calculi is suspected, noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters and bladder with RBUS or CTU is necessary. Cystoscopy remains the diagnostic test of choice to detect bladder cancer.

### Risk of radiation from computerized tomography urography in the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^115pjShR]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The AUA (American Urological Association) guidelines for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria recommend that patients undergo computerized tomography urography, which is associated with high doses of ionizing radiation. To our knowledge the associated risk of secondary malignancy and mortality remains unknown. We modeled the risk of malignancy and associated mortality due to ionizing radiation from computerized tomography urography relative to the additional diagnostic benefit offered over renal ultrasound.

Materials and Methods

We performed a PubMed® based literature search to identify model inputs. We obtained estimates of age and gender specific radiation induced secondary malignancy and mortality rates from the BEIR (Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation) VII Phase 2 report with dose extrapolation using the linear no threshold model.

Results

Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria had a 0.053% and 0.48% prevalence of upper tract urothelial carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, respectively. Ultrasound had 77% sensitivity for upper tract urothelial carcinoma and 82% sensitivity for renal cell carcinoma. The effective radiation dose of computerized tomography urography was 31.7 mSv. Based on these inputs a population of 100,000 patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria would include 53.1 and 478 patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, respectively. On ultrasound alone 98.2 cases of upper urinary tract malignancy would be missed. An additional 149 cases of secondary malignancy would be caused by computerized tomography urography associated radiation with 101 fatalities. A total of 1,018.3 computerized tomography urography studies would need to be performed to detect an additional case of upper tract malignancy.

Conclusions

Based on current risk models computerized tomography urography for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria may be associated with a small but significant risk of secondary malignancy relative to the additional diagnostic benefit offered.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^1146XeYi]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Definition and screening

There was no disagreement on the definition of CKD by laboratory tests, but all guidelines fail to precise which structural abnormalities qualify for CKD. NICE and ACP guidelines as well as the USPSTF recommended explicitly against screening of asymptomatic individuals without known risk factors. Screening was recommended for high risk groups in most guidelines, but KHA-CARI used broad definitions for at risk populations like smoking, obesity, socioeconomic disadvantage or age. This can lead to screening situations where health benefits and therapeutic consequences of CKD diagnosis are lacking.

Diagnostic tests in newly diagnosed CKD

Main purpose of the initial diagnostic work-up is to establish CKD and rule out emergencies or specifically treatable kidney disorders, e.g. glomerulonephritis. Most guidelines agree on assessing kidney function by eGFR creatinine and proteinuria. Primarily KHA-CARI and HAS, recommend extensive additional diagnostic work-up, mainly to identify possible complications or comorbidities reflecting the epidemiology in specialized nephrology services but not in primary care. As the risk of developing complications like electrolyte disturbances, anemia or CKD-MBD is largely dependent on kidney function, a more differentiated approach according to CKD stage, could lower health service utilization and cost while maintaining quality of care. HAS explicitly stated that testing was aimed to obtain baseline values in some instances. It is debatable whether this set point information has therapeutic consequence.

Assessment of hematuria was inconsistently addressed. While NICE recommended against using urine microscopy, KHA-CARI recommended it. Most primary care providers do not have the skills and equipment to perform urine microscopy. However NICE and KDIGO did not specify when dipstick testing for hematuria is warranted, while most guideline did not address checking for hematuria at all.

### Confirmatory microscopic urinalysis after positive dipstick microhematuria: adherence patterns and quality improvement [^116JNmwu]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate adherence to the 2025 AUA/SUFU microhematuria (MH) guideline, which requires confirmatory microscopic urinalysis (MUA ≥ 3 RBC/HPF) after a positive dipstick.

Materials and Methods

TriNetX Research Network data (109 U.S. health systems) were queried for adults aged 18–90 years with an initial positive dipstick from July 2020 to February 2025. Patients with gross hematuria, urinary tract infections, and kidney and/or ureteral calculi, cystitis, proteinuria, dysuria, and pregnancy diagnoses were excluded. Patients were stratified into three cohorts: no MUA, negative MUA, and positive MUA. We recorded the use of CT urography, MRI urography, renal ultrasound, or cystoscopy within 6 months of positive dipstick.

Results

Among 37,300 eligible patients, 25,904 (69%) received MUA and 11,396 (31%) did not. MUA was positive in 9,913 cases (38%) and negative in 15,991 (62%). Downstream testing followed 7.5% of dipstick-only cases, 16.1% of negative-MUA cases, and 16.3% of positive-MUA cases. In total, 855 procedures were performed without any MUA and 2,575 after a negative MUA, resulting in potentially avoidable charges. Conversely, 84% of patients with confirmed MH underwent no further evaluation.

Conclusion

31% of positive urine dipstick results were not followed by a confirmatory MUA, and 84% of patients with a positive MUA underwent no additional evaluation. These shortfalls point to gaps in the implementation of guideline-based care for MH. Future work should test targeted decision-support tools and simplified referral pathways to improve adherence and patient outcomes.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1168oDQh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — practice patterns and evaluation gaps — show low referral and procedure use, with a 2008 primary care study reporting less than 50% referred for urologic evaluation, contemporary evaluation rates under 10%, and among patients with risk factors only 23% receiving any imaging and 13% undergoing cystoscopy; underuse of cystoscopy is concerning given that most cancers in patients with hematuria are bladder cancers, optimally detected with cystoscopy.

### Efficacy of a clinical decision support tool to promote guideline-concordant evaluations in patients with high-risk microscopic hematuria: a cluster randomized quality improvement project [^114tF77h]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to determine whether implementation of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool integrated into the electronic health record of a multisite academic medical center increased the proportion of patients with AUA "high-risk" microscopic hematuria (MH) who receive guideline-concordant evaluations.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a 2-arm cluster randomized quality improvement project in which 202 ambulatory sites from a large health system were randomized to either have their physicians receive at time of test results an automated CDS alert for patients with high-risk MH with associated recommendations for imaging and cystoscopy (intervention) or usual care (control). Primary outcome was met if a patient underwent both imaging and cystoscopy within 180 days from MH result. Secondary outcomes assessed individual completion of imaging, cystoscopy, or placement of imaging orders.

Results

There were 917 patients randomized to intervention (n = 476) or control (n = 441) arms between October and December 2021. The percentage of eligible patients for whom the alert correctly triggered in the intervention arm was 83%. Primary outcome was achieved in 0.6% vs 0.9% (relative risk 0.69; 95% CI 0.15, 3.10) of patients in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Patients in the intervention and control groups had similar rates of completed imaging (17.7% vs 14.7%) and cystoscopy (1.5% vs 0.9%). Those in the intervention arm had a higher likelihood of CT urogram order (5.5% vs 1.1%, P = 0.003) and a nonsignificant increase in urology evaluation (11.1% vs 7.5%, P = 0.09).

Conclusions

Implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDS tool to promote evaluation of patients with high-risk MH did not lead to improvements in patient completion of a full guideline-concordant evaluation. The development of an algorithm to trigger a CDS alert was demonstrated to be feasible and effective. Further multilevel assessment of barriers to evaluation is necessary to continue to improve the approach to evaluating high-risk patients with MH.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^117WgheX]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Further, cost-effectiveness analysis recommended performing RBUS instead of CTU to evaluate patients with microscopic hematuria. A comparison of 4 diagnostic approaches, including CT alone, cystoscopy alone, CT with cystoscopy and RBUS with cystoscopy, suggested that the combination of RBUS with cystoscopy represents the most cost-effective combination at $53,810 per each cancer detected. Replacing RBUS with CTU would cost $6,480,484 per each cancer identified. It was estimated that using RBUS instead of CTU would result in a cost savings of $390 million, which is much needed in an era of escalating health care cost.

The role of cystoscopy to visualize the bladder remains the gold standard. Even after excluding suboptimal scans a patient with a normal CTU or RBUS still requires cystoscopy due to the high risk of false-negative findings. This is similar to the diagnostic ability of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancer, which have a reported sensitivity of 57% to 82% and a specificity of 74% to 88%. While larger tumors would be easily identifiable, smaller tumors might be missed. It is likely that optimized CTU with the bladder well distended and contrast material which fully opacifies the bladder lumen would improve diagnostic accuracy. However, such scans may be difficult to achieve in clinical practice.

### Imaging for microscopic haematuria [^113z5XRs]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

For evaluation of the upper urinary tract, intravenous urography has for many years been the method of choice. In recent years, different imaging protocols have been suggested. In this article different strategies for the evaluation of microscopic haematuria, with a focus on the advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities, will be discussed.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in… [^117VZNTA]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

1 Despite this, microscopic hematuria is often found incidentally during routine health screenings, with a prevalence of about 2% to 31%. 2–6 Because primary care physicians commonly are the first to recognize asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of hematuria is necessary. In 2012, the American Urological Association published an updated guideline on the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults. 6 Based on the guideline, this article describes the current approaches to diagnosis, follow-up, and referral for patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. At least 10 to 20 microscopic fields should be examined under 400× magnification. 16 According to the AUA, the presence of three or more red blood cells on a single, properly collected, noncontaminated urinalysis without evidence of infection is considered clinically significant microscopic hematuria.

6 If the specimen shows large amounts of squamous epithelial cells or if the patient is unable to provide an uncontaminated specimen secondary to anatomic constraints, catheterization should be used to obtain a specimen.
6. HEMATURIA WITH URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS If a patient has microscopic hematuria in the presence of pyuria or bacteriuria, a urine culture should be obtained to rule out urinary tract infection. Culture-directed antibiotics should be administered, and a microscopic urinalysis should be repeated in six weeks to assess for resolution of the hematuria. 6, 17 If the hematuria has resolved after the infection has cleared, no further workup is needed. If hematuria persists, diagnostic evaluation should commence.
6.

BENIGN CAUSES OF HEMATURIA Many causes of microscopic hematuria do not require a full diagnostic workup, including vigorous exercise, infection or viral illness, menstruation, exposure to trauma, or recent urologic procedures. If a potential benign cause is identified, the insult should be removed or treated appropriately, and the urine retested after at least 48 hours. Persistent hematuria warrants a full workup.
6. Initial Evaluation All patients with confirmed asymptomatic microscopic hematuria should provide a patient history and have a physical examination that includes blood pressure measurement and a laboratory assessment.

Blood in the urine can originate from any site along the urinary tract and, whether gross or microscopic, may be a sign of serious underlying disease, including malignancy. The literature agrees that gross hematuria warrants a thorough diagnostic evaluation. 1 By contrast, microscopic hematuria is an incidental finding, and whether physicians should test for hematuria in asymptomatic patients remains at issue. No major organization currently recommends screening for microscopic hematuria in asymptomatic adults, even though bladder cancer is the most commonly detected malignancy in such patients.
2. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease should undergo an appropriate evaluation. In patients at low risk for disease, some components of the evaluation may be deferred.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has many causes, ranging from minor incidental findings that do not require treatment to highly significant lesions that are immediately life-threatening. Therefore, hematuria has been classified into four categories: life-threatening; significant, requiring treatment; significant, requiring observation; and insignificant. Patients with microscopic hematuria, a negative initial urologic evaluation and no evidence of glomerular bleeding are considered to have isolated hematuria. Although many such patients may have structural glomerular abnormalities, they appear to have low risk for progressive renal disease. Thus, the role of renal biopsy in this setting has not been defined. Nevertheless, because follow-up data are limited, these patients should be followed for the development of hypertension, renal insufficiency or proteinuria.

In patients with a negative initial evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, consideration should be given to repeating urinalysis, voided urine cytology and blood pressure determination at six, 12, 24 and 36 months. Although cytology may not be a sensitive marker for detecting low-grade transitional cell carcinoma, it detects most high-grade tumors and carcinomas in situ, particularly if the test is repeated. Such high-grade lesions are the most likely to benefit from early detection. If none of these occurs within three years, the patient does not require further urologic monitoring. Further evaluation for renal parenchymal disease or referral to a nephrologist should be considered if hematuria persists and hypertension, proteinuria or evidence of glomerular bleeding develops.

### The clinical significance of asymptomatic gross and microscopic hematuria in children… [^113GJxNY]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In hopes of understanding these issues, we began a long-term prospective study using a defined protocol to evaluate children referred to our clinic for asymptomatic hematuria. This report summarizes our findings. Methods. Results Microscopic hematuria Three hundred forty-two patients were evaluated for microscopic hematuria. In 274 patients, no cause for the hematuria was uncovered. The most frequent cause detected was hypercalciuria in the absence of stone disease. Interestingly, 20% of these patients had a family history of stone disease. Gross hematuria Two hundred twenty-eight patients were evaluated for asymptomatic gross hematuria. In 86 patients, no cause for the hematuria was uncovered. The most frequent cause detected was hypercalciuria in the absence of stone disease. Twenty-four percent had a family history of stone disease.

We found clinically insignificant abnormalities in the upper urinary tracts of 5 of 342 children and grade 3 reflux in 1 of 79 patients. The absence of clinically important radiological abnormalities in children with microscopic hematuria is supported by the findings of Feld et al. 11 In their study, renal ultrasonography examinations of 283 children showed only 18 clinically insignificant abnormalities. Of 90 voiding cystograms, 9 showed low-grade reflux. Thus, in children with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, radiological studies fail to reveal abnormalities requiring clinical intervention. Rarely, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria can be the first sign of occult renal disease. However, it seems likely that in patients with microscopic hematuria due to occult glomerular disorders, progression to clinically significant disease will be accompanied by the development of hypertension and/or proteinuria.

Thus, long-term follow-up of children with microscopic hematuria is mandatory. We recommend a blood pressure measurement and urinalysis at the time of the annual physical examination. The development of hypertension and/or proteinuria or the onset of gross hematuria mandates a thorough reevaluation and consideration of kidney biopsy. In summary, our results suggest that asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in children is rarely associated with clinically significant disease of the urinary tract and may not warrant diagnostic evaluation. However, long-term follow-up is mandatory. As asymptomatic gross hematuria is more commonly associated with urinary tract disease, a thorough evaluation for causation is justified.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults… [^116iNGrr]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria is defined as the excretion of more than three red blood cells per high-power field in a centrifuged urine specimen. 1 Because the degree of hematuria bears no relation to the seriousness of the underlying cause, hematuria should be considered a symptom of serious disease until proved otherwise. FINDINGS ON MICROSCOPY Dysmorphic erythrocytes are characterized by an irregular outer cell membrane and suggest hematuria of glomerular origin. Red blood cell casts are also associated with a glomerular cause of hematuria. Acanthocytes, which are ring-formed erythrocytes with one or more membrane protrusions of variable size and shape, may represent an early form of dysmorphic erythrocytes and are a marker for hematuria of glomerular origin. Erythrocytes of uniform character are classified as isomorphic and suggest hematuria of lower urinary tract origin. Microscopic clots of clumped erythrocytes in urine are also suggestive of lower urinary tract bleeding.

The presence of both dysmorphic and isomorphic erythrocytes in urine represents a mixed morphologic pattern of nonspecific origin. Final Comment Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is commonly nephric in origin, whereas gross hematuria is often uroepithelial in origin. Gross, painless hematuria is often the first manifestation of a urothelial tumor. However, the degree of hematuria bears no relation to the seriousness of the underlying disease. Consequently, the microscopic finding of blood in the urine should be considered a serious symptom until significant pathology has been excluded. Phase contrast microscopy is currently the best initial method of documenting microscopic hematuria. The evaluation often includes intravenous pyelography, cystourethroscopy and urinary cytology. Unfortunately, consensus is lacking regarding the management of persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria of unknown etiology.

Recommended surveillance schedules for patients with a previous negative evaluation for unexplained microscopic hematuria include urinalysis and voided urinary cytology annually until the hematuria resolves, or for up to three years if microscopic hematuria persists. Any significant increase in the degree of microscopic hematuria, an episode of gross hematuria or the new onset of irritative voiding symptoms in the absence of infection warrants a complete reevaluation.
